"As Canadians sour on China, an ambassador changes his tone | CBC News","Dominic Barton, Canada's ambassador to China, made his first appearance at the China committee this week since before the pandemic hit Canada. He was noticeably less forgiving of Beijing and less bullish on business opportunities than last time — perhaps reflecting a turn against China in public opinion.",2020-12-10T09:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/china-kovrig-spavor-dominic-barton-1.5835036,"Today marks two years since the two Michaels were detained by China.It's also been ten long pandemic months since Canada's ambassador to Beijing, Dominic Barton, made his previous appearance before the Commons subcommittee on Canada-China relations. Tuesday's second round of that hearing showed how much the mood around China has changed during 2020. Barton appeared conscious of the need to make some repairs to the impression he left in February, when his testimony drew unusually direct criticism from former diplomats with experience working in China.Back then, Barton suggested that it was incumbent upon Canadians to recognize that ""China values unity and the needs of society at large, rather than freedom of individual choice ... we just have to understand that.""Former diplomat and China expert Charles Burton told the subcommittee that Barton's words parroted Communist Party propaganda asserting that Chinese culture is inherently averse to liberty and democracy — when in fact the aversion comes from Xi Jinping's Politburo.Watch: Trudeau says government will examine all options to bring Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig.:Politics NewsIn his Tuesday appearance, however, Barton opened with remarks on ""our efforts to promote rights and freedoms in China.""""We are concerned by the decline of civil and political rights in China,"" he told MPs.Barton began his appearance with a lengthy description of a recent visit to the Tibet Autonomous Region, which he toured in a party of foreign diplomats. It was one of two closely-supervised Tibetan tours put on for mostly western diplomats this year, a sign that the Communist Party — bravado notwithstanding — still cares about what western countries say regarding its human rights record.It may also have been an attempt to switch foreign attention to Tibet from the even more problematic neighbouring region of Xinjiang, where China's heavy-handed persecution of the Muslim Uighur people is opening new fronts for confrontation with the West.Barton said that he had consulted with pro-Tibet groups and academics in Canada before accepting the trip, which he said he undertook partly to show Tibetans the world was still concerned about their plight.In addition to discussing what he'd seen on the tour — which took in a school, a monastery and greenhouses — Barton also talked about the motives of the Communist Party in allowing the trip. He said he understood that ""what I saw was not the complete picture on any issue"" and described one effort to escape his minders — when he left his hotel at 5 a.m. for an unaccompanied stroll through the streets of Lhasa.Barton once famously described himself as ""a bull on China"" and his entire pre-diplomatic career was built on viewing China primarily as a business opportunity.During his last committee appearance, Barton told members he ""would love to talk more about promoting trade and investment. I probably should shut up and move on, but I'm very excited by the opportunity we have on many fronts.""This time, he took his own advice and left out the economic boosterism — suggesting that the ambassador had not only learned to read the room but perhaps understood how the ground had shifted under him.""Countries all around the world are evolving their approach to China,"" he told the subcommittee Tuesday night. That's certainly true in Europe, where both public attitudes and government approaches to China have become considerably tougher over the course of 2020. Shachi Kurl of the Angus Reid Institute said Barton's changed tone also reflects new realities at home.""This isn't just about Canada and Ambassador Barton aligning with the Western consensus,"" she told CBC's Power and Politics. ""It really is about aligning with the Canadian consensus, because for several years we have seen a deterioration, and then a deterioration, and then a further deterioration in Canadian views of the Beijing regime.""Opinion polls do show a crashing decline in China's standing in Canadian public opinion, reaching what Kurl calls ""an all-time low"" as 2020 draws to a close.""You now find among the Canadian population a bloody-mindedness that says, 'You know what? This is not OK,'"" she said. ""This is about more than the human rights situation, this is about more than events in Hong Kong. What has really viscerally affected Canadians is the kidnapping of the two Michaels.""Obviously, the detention of Kovrig and Spavor was always intended by Beijing to be a pressure tactic — not a play for hearts and minds. But it hasn't worked as a pressure tactic and has instead backfired disastrously upon China's public image.Would the CCP judge the strategy wise in hindsight, or consider it a failure? Either way, the need to save face makes it hard for the Communist Party — famously averse to backing down on anything — to alter its course now.During his committee appearance, Barton praised the two Canadians for their resilience, which he said was an inspiration to him.Barton was eager to mend fences when asked about another Canadian detainee: Huseyin Celil, a Uighur rights activist from Burlington, Ont. who was snatched on behalf of Chinese authorities while visiting Uzbekistan 14 years ago, whisked across the border and given a life sentence.When asked about the case in February, Barton said he had not been able to visit Celil because Celil was not a Canadian citizen. Once again, he was echoing a view espoused by the government of China, which has refused to recognize the fact that Celil has been a Canadian citizen since 2001. Foreign Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne was forced to correct the record in the House of Commons a few days after Barton's misstatement.Two former ambassadors to China condemned Barton's mischaracterization of Celil. ""China doesn't get to determine who is or becomes a Canadian citizen,"" said David Mulroney, who represented Canada in Beijing from 2009 to 2012.This time, Barton described the steps he had taken to reach out to the Celil family in the wake of that embarrassing incident.There is still no sign of progress in Celil's case, however. His detention differs from that of Kovrig and Spavor in that Celil was not seized as a bargaining chip to pressure Canada, and his case predates the Huawei dispute.Instead, Celil's detention intersects with another issue that has raised tensions between China and Canada — one that also came up in one of the tenser moments in this week's meeting between Barton and MPs.Conservative MP Garnett Genuis pressed Barton to make a clear statement on China's suppression of its Uighur minority, who are concentrated in the far western Xinjiang region.He read out the recent words of the Trudeau government's newish ambassador to the UN, Bob Rae, who told CBC News ""there's no question that there's aspects of what the Chinese are doing that fits into the definition of genocide in the genocide convention."" Did Barton agree with that statement? The ambassador refused to be pinned down, saying that while the situation was ""very, very concerning,"" more reports from the area were needed.Rights activists are particularly suspicious of Barton on this file because the company he headed, McKinsey, earned a reputation for indifference to Uighur suffering while eagerly promoting the Chinese government's economic plans for their homeland.The company defended itself but faced harsh criticism — even from the traditional business press.""I think we need to see the reports,"" Barton said. ""I haven't talked to Ambassador Rae about the particular evidence he has on that side.""""We need to have independent people on the ground who can go wherever they want"" in Xinjiang in order to determine what's happening, he added. Genuis was skeptical. ""We'd love to get access,"" he said. ""I think there's realities in terms of whether that's ever going to be given.""""Is Mr. Rae's statement consistent with the government's policy, or is yours?"" Genuis asked.Barton minimized the gap between the two, arguing that Rae was also seeking more investigation. A noticeable difference remained, however, in how the two men described the situation."

Hong Kong media tycoon Jimmy Lai charged under national security law: reports | CBC News,"Hong Kong democracy activist and media tycoon Jimmy Lai has been charged under the city's national security law on suspicion of colluding with foreign forces and endangering national security, local media reported on Friday, citing unnamed sources.",2020-12-11T07:50:40.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/lai-charged-hongkong-1.5837177,"Hong Kong democracy activist and media tycoon Jimmy Lai, 73, has been charged under the city's national security law on suspicion of colluding with foreign forces, his Apple Daily newspaper reported on Friday, citing a police source.Lai, an ardent critic of Beijing, would be the highest profile person charged under the sweeping new law imposed on the Chinese-ruled city in June.He was due to appear in court on Saturday, according to Apple Daily, a popular tabloid known for its feisty and critical coverage of China and Hong Kong.The security law, which punishes what Beijing broadly defines as secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces with up to life in jail, has been condemned by the West and human rights groups as a tool to crush dissent in the semi-autonomous, Chinese-ruled city.Authorities in Hong Kong and Beijing say it is vital to plug gaping holes in national security defences exposed by months of sometimes violent anti-government and anti-China protests that rocked the global financial hub over the last year.""The goal is to hold Jimmy Lai, and shut Jimmy Lai up,"" Mark Simon, an associate of Lai, told Reuters.Hong Kong police did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The publishing tycoon is one of the financial hub's most prominent democracy activists, while his Next Media group is considered one of the key remaining bastions of media freedoms in Hong Kong.Tensions between China and the United States have escalated in recent weeks as Washington accuses Beijing of using the security law to trample wide-ranging freedoms guaranteed when the former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997.Authorities have intensified a crackdown on opposition forces in the city, dismissing lawmakers from the legislature, conducting widespread arrests and jailing high-profile democracy activists such as Joshua Wong.Lai was denied bail earlier this month following his arrest on a separate charge of fraud related to the lease of a building that houses his Apple Daily, an anti-government tabloid.He was arrested in August when about 200 police officers swooped on his offices. Hong Kong police later said they had arrested nine men and one woman for suspected offences including ""collusion with a foreign country/external elements to endanger national security, conspiracy to defraud"" and others.The tycoon had been a frequent visitor to Washington, where he has met officials, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, to rally support for Hong Kong democracy, prompting Beijing to label him a ""traitor."""
"China's Sinopharm vaccine 86% effective, say United Arab Emirates officials | CBC News","The United Arab Emirates said Wednesday a Chinese coronavirus vaccine tested in the federation of sheikdoms is 86 per cent effective, in a statement that provided few details but marked the first public release of information on the efficacy of the shot.",2020-12-09T11:57:30.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/vaccine-sinopharm-uae-1.5833823,"The United Arab Emirates said Wednesday a Chinese coronavirus vaccine tested in the federation of sheikdoms is 86 per cent effective, in a statement that provided few details but marked the first public release of information on the efficacy of the shot.The announcement brought yet another shot into the worldwide race for a vaccine to end the pandemic, a scientific effort that has seen China and Russia compete with Western firms for an effective inoculation. While questions remain about the Sinopharm shot, already at least one country outside China plans to roll it out in a mass-vaccination campaign.The U.A.E., home to Dubai and Abu Dhabi, conducted a trial beginning in September of the vaccine by Chinese state-owned pharmaceutical giant Sinopharm involving 31,000 volunteers from 125 nations. Volunteers between 18 and 60 years old received two doses of the vaccine over 28 days.The U.A.E.'s Health and Prevention Ministry announced the results via a statement on the state-run WAM news agency, saying it has ""reviewed Sinopharm CNBG's interim analysis of the Phase III trials.""""The analysis shows no serious safety concerns,"" the statement said, without detailing whether any participant suffered side effects.It wasn't immediately clear if the announced results included only those taking part in the testing in the UAE or if they also include results from China and elsewhere. The statement described the vaccine as receiving ""official registration"" without elaborating on what that meant.Emirati officials and Sinopharm did not respond to questions from The Associated Press.However, calls Wednesday to SEHA, the Abu Dhabi health authority, included an option for individuals to schedule an appointment to receive a ""COVID-19 vaccine."" The centre was swamped with calls following the announcement on the vaccine's efficacy.The Sinopharm vaccine has been approved for emergency use in a few countries and the company is still conducting late-stage clinical trials in 10 countries. Morocco is gearing up for an ambitious COVID-19 vaccination program, aiming to vaccinate 80 per cent of its adults in an operation starting this month that's relying initially on the Sinopharm vaccine.Sinopharm's shot relies on a tested technology, using a killed virus to deliver the vaccine, similar to how polio immunizations are made. Leading Western competitors, like the shot made by Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech, use newer, less-proven technology to target the coronavirus's spike protein using RNA. The United Kingdom already has begun vaccinating people with the Pfizer shot.WATCH | Inside the scramble to mass produce a COVID-19 vaccine:The NationalTop officials in the UAE, including Dubai's ruler, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, have publicly received the shots as part of the vaccine testing.Already, Pfizer reports its shot as being 95 per cent effective, while another RNA candidate from Moderna appears to be 94.5 per cent effective. Results suggest a third vaccine from Oxford University and AstraZeneca is safe and about 70 per cent effective, but questions remain about how well it may help protect those over 55.In transport, Pfizer says its vaccine must be stored in a freezer at –80 C to –60 C or in a thermal container at –90 C to –60 C. The Moderna vaccine must remain at a temperature of –20 C.The Sinopharm vaccine is believed to be able to travel at a temperature of 2 C to 8 C, a major draw for areas of the world where nearly three billion people live without stable electricity and refrigeration. In November, the Communist Party secretary for Sinopharm said almost one million people in China had received its vaccine.Since the pandemic began, the UAE has detected over 178,000 cases of the virus, with 160,000 recoveries and nearly 600 deaths. Its aggressive testing policy has seen over 17 million tests conducted in a country home to just over nine million people."

"China angered by U.S. arms sales to Taiwan, threatens sanctions | CBC News","China threatened on Thursday to retaliate against the latest U.S. arms sale to Taiwan, as the island welcomed the weapons package but said it was not looking to get into an arms race with Beijing.",2020-10-22T12:27:25.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/china-response-us-arms-taiwan-1.5772252,"China threatened on Thursday to retaliate against the latest U.S. arms sale to Chinese-claimed Taiwan, as the island welcomed the weapons package but said it was not looking to get into an arms race with Beijing.The Trump administration has ramped up support for Taiwan through arms sales and visits by senior U.S officials, adding to tensions between Beijing and Washington, already heightened by disagreements over the South China Sea, Hong Kong, human rights and trade.Beijing has applied increasing pressure on democratically ruled Taiwan to accept China's sovereignty, including by flying fighter jets across the sensitive mid-line of the Taiwan Strait, which normally serves as an unofficial buffer.Beijing considers Taiwan a wayward province it has vowed to reunite with the mainland, by force if necessary. Washington considers it an important democratic outpost and is required by law to provide it with the means to defend itself.Responding to the U.S. approval of a potential $1.8 billion US arms sale to Taiwan, China's Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said during a daily news briefing that such sales should stop.The sales ""seriously interfere with China's internal affairs, seriously damage China's sovereignty and security interests, send a seriously wrong signal to Taiwan independence forces and severely damage China-U.S. relations and peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait,"" he said.""China will make a legitimate and necessary response according to how the situation develops,"" Zhao added.He did not give details, but China has sanctioned U.S. companies in the past for selling weapons to Taiwan, though it is unclear what form they have taken.In Taipei, Taiwan Defence Minister Yen De-fa thanked the United States and said the weapons were to help Taiwan improve their defensive capabilities to deal with the ""enemy threat and new situation.""""This includes a credible combat capability and asymmetric warfare capabilities to strengthen our determination to defend ourselves,"" he added.""This shows the importance attached by the United States to security in the Indo-Pacific and Taiwan Strait. We will continue to consolidate our security partnership with the United States.""Yen said they were not looking for confrontation.""We will not engage in an arms race with the Chinese Communists. We will put forward requirements and build fully in accordance with the strategic concept of heavy deterrence, defending our position and defensive needs.""Taiwan's armed forces are dwarfed by China's, which are expanding their capability with new weapons like aircraft carriers and stealth fighters.Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen has made defence modernization a priority in the face of a rising Chinese threat, particularly ""asymmetric warfare"" capabilities, which refers to making any Chinese attack difficult and costly, for example with smart mines and portable missiles.Like most countries, Washington has no formal diplomatic ties with Taipei, though it is its strongest global backer. The U.S. has been pushing Taiwan to modernize its military so it can become a ""porcupine"" — that is, hard for China to attack.Among other weapons systems, Wednesday's formal notifications to Congress by the State Department were for 11 truck-based rocket launchers made by Lockheed Martin called a High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS), for an estimated cost of $436.1 million.The notifications also covered 135 AGM-84H Standoff Land Attack Missile Expanded Response (SLAM-ER) Missiles and related equipment made by Boeing for an estimated $1.008 billion, and six MS-110 Recce external sensor pods made by Collins Aerospace for jets, at an estimated cost of $367.2 million.Further congressional notifications are expected to follow, including drones made by General Atomics and land-based Harpoon anti-ship missiles made by Boeing to serve as coastal defence cruise missiles.The U.S. administration has stepped up pressure on Beijing in the run-up to the Nov. 3 U.S. presidential election, in which President Donald Trump has made a tough approach to China a key foreign policy theme.Last week, the U.S. national security adviser, Robert O'Brien, said that while China probably was not ready to invade Taiwan for now, the island needed to ""fortify itself"" against a future attack or any bid to isolate it through non-military means, such as an embargo.Taiwan has been testing new surface-to-surface missiles, which its media says have the ability to strike deep inside China, potentially giving the island the ability to attack far-off Chinese air bases and command centres."

The cubs were sent to China in January and their parents were to remain in Calgary until 2023."

"China, top global emitter, aims to go carbon-neutral by 2060 | CBC News",Chinese President Xi Jinping says his country will aim to stop adding to the global warming problem by 2060.,2020-09-23T13:01:48.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/china-carbon-neutral-1.5735172,"Chinese President Xi Jinping says his country will aim to stop adding to the global warming problem by 2060.Xi's announcement during a speech Tuesday to the UN General Assembly is a significant step for the world's biggest emitter of greenhouse gases.Calling for a ""green revolution,"" Xi said the coronavirus pandemic had shown the need to preserve the environment.""Humankind can no longer afford to ignore the repeated warnings of nature,"" he said.Citing the Paris Agreement that he and former U.S. President Barack Obama helped forge in 2015, Xi said his country would raise its emissions reduction targets with ""vigorous policies and measures.""""We aim to have CO2 emissions peak before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2060,"" he said.The term ""carbon neutrality"" means releasing no additional CO2 into the atmosphere, though technically it allows countries to keep emitting if they ensure that an equal amount is captured again in some form.The announcement was cheered by climate campaigners. Greenpeace executive director Jennifer Morgan called it ""an important signal"" that showed climate change is ""top of agenda for China.""""A big shift for curbing emissions and a significant step forward in international cooperation"" U.N. climate chief Patricia Espinosa said.The goal will be a challenge for China, which relies heavily for its electricity on coal, one of the most carbon-intensive fossil fuels.China released the equivalent of 10 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide, or CO2, into the atmosphere in 2018, according to the Global Carbon Project that tracks emissions worldwide. That was almost twice as much as the United States and three times as much as the European Union.Several other major emitters have set earlier deadlines, with the EU aiming to be carbon neutral by 2050. Frans Timmermans, who leads the EU executive's efforts on climate change, welcomed Xi's announcement.""We need decisive action from every country to keep temperatures under control, tackle climate change and keep our planet inhabitable,"" he said.The United States has so far not set such a goal. President Donald Trump, who once described climate change as a hoax invented by China, has started the process of pulling the U.S. out of the Paris accord.If China fulfills Xi's goal, it could prevent 0.2 to 0.4 C further warming for the world, according to ""very rough estimates"" by MIT management professor John Sterman, who models and tracks emission reductions and pledges with Climate Interactive.But much depends on how they do their emissions reduction and how soon they cut them, he said, adding he has to do a more thorough analysis.""That's a lot,"" Sterman said. ""China's by far the world's big emitter. They're emitting more than the EU and US together.""""It puts a lot more pressure on the United States,"" Sterman said.Perhaps even more important than the carbon neutrality pledge is the effort to peak carbon dioxide emissions before 2030 instead of by 2030, Sterman said. Carbon dioxide's more than 100-year lifetime in the air makes earlier emission cuts more effective than promises in the future, he said.""Emissions that don't happen between now and 2030 are going to reduce warming a lot more than the same emission reductions after 2060,"" Sterman said.However, pledges are not the same as actions. What's needed is signs of action, such as eliminating plans to build new coal-fired power plants, cutting subsidies for coal power and getting off coal entirely, Sterman said. Coal is the biggest carbon dioxide emitter of power sources.Twenty-nine nations before China have pledged to achieve climate neutrality in different years, according to the Carbon Neutrality Coalition. They include Canada.With China, the 30 countries that have some kind of carbon neutrality pledges, account for about 43 per cent of the world's carbon dioxide emissions from the burning of fossil fuels. The largest polluting countries not on the list are the United States, India, Russia, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, South Africa, Turkey, Brazil and Australia."
4 new barges headed for Tuktoyaktuk from China | CBC News,"The COVID-19 pandemic may be delaying deliveries across Canada, but it’s not stopping four new barges from travelling from China to Tuktoyaktuk, N.W.T., this summer.",2020-07-28T17:58:03.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/barges-new-china-tuktoyaktuk-1.5659538,"The COVID-19 pandemic may be delaying deliveries across Canada, but it's not stopping four new barges from travelling from China to Tuktoyaktuk, N.W.T., this summer.Marine Transportation Services (MTS) is expecting the new fleet this August, arriving on a heavy-lift ship from Shanghai.Steve Hagerman, the director of MTS, the N.W.T. government-owned barge company, said the cross-continental delivery would've been noteworthy, even if the country wasn't already in the midst of a pandemic.""That's going to be a one-of-[a-kind] for sure. I don't believe that this will be repeated again,"" said Hagerman.Barges bring critical fuel and other dry goods to Arctic coastal and Mackenzie River communities every summer in both the N.W.T. and Nunavut.Hagermen said these four barges from China Merchants Jinling Shipyard are part of a new series that are made specifically to handle large volumes of fuel products. With the increased capacity, it will allow MTS to decrease the number of deliveries into some communities.An Infrastructure spokesperson said the total budget to design, build and deliver the four barges is $20.7 million; the federal government paid for 75 per cent, and the territorial government covered the other 25 per cent.Hagerman said, so far, organizing the delivery has been going better than he anticipated — despite the shipyard in China shutting down ""for well over a month"" since the height of the pandemic in March.Another concern has been that, like the N.W.T., China has been seeing high water levels, and the country is dealing with severe flooding.""We were really concerned, of course, that we wouldn't be able to get the barges at all this year,"" he said. ""I don't know how they did it, but they fast-tracked and put us right back on schedule.""With the ships coming in during the COVID-19 pandemic, there will be restrictions in place, said an Infrastructure spokesperson in an email Tuesday. Interactions between crew and residents are already restricted for regular community cargo deliveries, with designated drop-off zones. ""For the delivery of the barges from China, the barges will be unloaded by another vessel between 30 and 60 kilometres offshore, depending on weather. There will be no physical interactions or contact between vessels or vessel crews,"" the email said.The crew from China will not leave their vessel, with communication between crews only by radio. The email said MTS staff who are physically involved with attaching the new barges have gone through 14 days of self-isolation, as have the Chinese crew members.Nunakput MLA Jackie Jacobson said the new barges are going to be a big deal for his riding and other Arctic coastal communities.""It just reassures, having new barges in place that are able to carry as much fuel as we need for these communities. Instead of doing two trips a year, they are able to do it all in one,"" said Jacobson.""I'm looking forward to making sure that all my coastal communities are being serviced and I think this is a big step for our government working with the coastal communities.""""We haven't seen any big boats since last year, so it will be good to see,"" said Jacobson.Hagerman, with MTS, said the heavy-lift ship is slated to head overseas with the barges on July 28.It should arrive about 14 days later, depending on the weather.Hagerman said the new vessels won't be replacing any current barges, and although these vessels are generally used on the ocean, they can also be used on rivers."

Pompeo calls for 'new alliance of democracies' to oppose China | CBC News,"The Trump administration took a hammer to one of the most significant Republican foreign policy achievements in the past five decades on Thursday, with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo declaring U.S. engagement with China a dismal failure.",2020-07-23T22:29:24.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/pompeo-china-speech-nixon-library-1.5661003,"The Trump administration took a hammer to one of the most significant Republican foreign policy achievements in the past five decades on Thursday, with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo declaring U.S. engagement with China a dismal failure.As the administration sharpens its already harsh criticism of China with distinctly political overtones ahead of November's election, Pompeo travelled to the Richard Nixon Presidential Library in Yorba Linda, Calif., on Thursday to pointedly lament that the former president's good and noble intentions in opening China to the world had come to naught and must be abandoned.Nearly 50 years after Nixon's historic 1972 trip to China, Pompeo used the symbolism of the venue to accuse the Chinese of taking advantage of that opportunity to lie, cheat and steal their way to power and prosperity. Pompeo called for the free world to ""induce"" change in China, making an overt appeal for a new coalition of democratic nations to force the Chinese Communist Party change direction or face isolation. Pompeo said western engagement with China could not continue as it has.""The free world must triumph over this new tyranny,"" he said in speech to an invited audience that included exiled Chinese dissidents. ""The old paradigm of blind engagement with China simply won't get it done. We must not continue it. We must not return to it.""Pompeo's speech was just the latest in series of Trump administration broadsides against China that have become an almost daily occurrence with cabinet-level officials from Pompeo, U.S. Defence Secretary Mark Esper and Attorney General Bill Barr launching harsh criticisms of Beijing. The three men have each delivered public addresses attacking China in recent weeks, as has FBI director Christopher Wray.WATCH | Trump signals bashing China will be part of re-election campaign:CBC NewsTrump, who in the early days of the coronavirus pandemic, was playing up his ""friendship"" and positive relationship with Chinese President Xi Jinping in an apparent effort to preserve trade negotiations with the Chinese, now seems to have signed off on an all-out assault on China. This has come as his polling numbers decline over COVID-19 and he looks to paint his presumed challenger in November's election, former vice-president Joe Biden, as soft on China.In his speech Pompeo called on nations to induce change in the Chinese Communist Party's behaviour ""because Beijing's actions threaten our people and our prosperity.""China has roundly rejected the administration's accusations and taken particular aim at Pompeo, who it has accused of fomenting anti-Chinese sentiment around the world. China maintains that it is only seeking to develop its economy and society for the benefit of its own people and the world.Pompeo heaped scorn on China's position, calling it a clear threat to the world. ""If the free world doesn't change Communist China, Communist China will surely change us. There can be no return to past practices because they're comfortable, or because they're convenient.""""The kind of engagement we have been pursuing has not brought the kind of change in China that President Nixon hoped to induce,"" Pompeo said. ""The truth is that our policies — and those of other free nations — resurrected China's failing economy, only to see Beijing bite the international hands that fed it.""Pompeo suggested the creation of a bloc, what he termed ""a new grouping of like-minded nations — a new alliance of democracies,"" to oppose China, although he was not specific about which countries should join. He did not mention the ""Community of Democracies"" group that was co-founded by the U.S. and Poland during former president Bill Clinton's administration to promote global human rights and rule of law globally, which has been ignored since Trump became president.China, meanwhile, has embarked on its own effort to build alliances with infrastructure and financial assistance packages to developing nations. It has established a bloc of nations that vote with it at various United Nations and other international institutions, some of which the Trump administration has withdrawn from.The State Department has been curtailing visas for Chinese and Communist Party officials involved in Xinjiang, Tibet and Hong Kong, and limiting the number of Chinese students and journalists allowed to come to the United States. In addition, the Commerce and Treasury departments have both announced new sanctions against China. They have warned private U.S. and foreign firms of potential penalties and reputational risk if they start or continue business with Chinese entities implicated by the U.S. in human rights abuses or clamping down on freedoms in Hong Kong.On Wednesday, the administration ordered China to close its consulate in Houston, citing intellectual property theft, inappropriate actions on behalf of Chinese students and researchers and behaviour inconsistent with legitimate diplomats by consular officials based in the Texas city. China has denounced the action as outrageous and has warned it would draw a firm response."

China sentences 4th Canadian to death on drug charges in 2 years | CBC News,China has sentenced a fourth Canadian citizen to death on drug charges in less than two years following a sharp downturn in ties over the arrest of an executive of Chinese tech giant Huawei.,2020-08-07T08:07:28.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/canadian-death-sentence-china-1.5677675,"China has sentenced a fourth Canadian citizen to death on drug charges in less than two years following a sharp downturn in relations over the arrest of an executive of Chinese tech giant Huawei.Ye Jianhui was sentenced Friday by the Foshan Municipal Intermediate Court in the southern province of Guangdong. Ye had been found guilty of manufacturing and transporting drugs, the court said in a brief statement.Another suspect in the case was also given the death penalty and four others sentenced to between seven years and life in prison. Death sentences are automatically referred to China's highest court for review.Ties between Canada and China have soured over Canada's late 2018 arrest of Meng Wanzhou, a company executive and the daughter of Huawei's founder, at Vancouver's airport in at the request of the U.S., which wants her extradited to face fraud charges over the company's dealings with Iran.Her arrest angered Beijing, which calls it a political move aimed at constraining China's rise as a global technology power.Ye's sentencing comes a day after fellow Canadian Xu Weihong was given the death penalty by the Guangzhou Municipal Intermediate Court, also in Guandong province. Convicted Canadian drug smuggler Robert Schellenberg was sentenced to death in a sudden retrial shortly after Meng's arrest, and a Canadian citizen identified as Fan Wei was given the death penalty in April 2019 for his role in a multinational drug smuggling case.In apparent retaliation, China also detained former Canadian diplomat Michael Kovrig and Canadian entrepreneur Michael Spavor weeks after Meng's arrest, accusing them of vague national security crimes.Foreign Affairs Minister François-Philippe Champagne, reacting Thursday to news of Xu's sentence, said Ottawa was profoundly concerned.""We oppose the death penalty at every step of the way,"" Champagne said in an interview on CBC's Power and Politics. ""We have said it time and time and time again to the Chinese government and will continue to do that.""Champagne said Canada is trying to build an international coalition of nations to advocate against the arbitrary detention of foreign nationals and for consular access when they are detained."

Moscow views the Crimea annexation as legitimate, and denies meddling in the vote that gave Donald Trump the U.S. presidency.Russia has also drawn international criticism for speedily approving a COVID-19 vaccine, and some Western experts said it cut corners during testing. Putin has touted the vaccine on national television and said that one of his adult daughters had already been inoculated.On on Tuesday, he offered to provide the vaccine free to all UN staff. However, both Russian and Western experts insist that further studies are needed to determine the vaccine's effectiveness and safety.Putin continued to call for unity and urged countries to reaffirm their commitment to the UN charter and international law, lamenting a ""deficit of humanity and kindness"" between countries amid the pandemic.He repeatedly stressed the Soviet Union's role in helping vanquish the Nazis in World War II — the conflict that gave birth to the United Nations. Despite calls for deep reform of the UN, Putin said the Security Council's five permanent members should keep their veto power, and said their leaders agreed to an in-person meeting once the pandemic allows.""In an interconnected, interdependent world, in the whirlpool of international events, it is necessary to act together and rely on the principles of international law enshrined in the UN charter,"" he said.Earlier, Chinese President Xi Jinping told delegates that Beijing has no intention of fighting ""a Cold War or a hot one with any country,"" as tensions grow between China and the United States.""We will continue to narrow differences and resolve disputes with others through dialogue and negotiation. We will not seek to develop only ourselves or engage in zero-sum game,"" Xi said in a pre-recorded video statement.Long-simmering tensions between the U.S. and China hit their boiling point over the pandemic, spotlighting Beijing's bid for greater multilateral influence in a challenge to Washington's traditional leadership.The coronavirus emerged in China late last year and Washington has accused Beijing of a lack of transparency that it says worsened the outbreak. China denies the U.S. assertions.In what appeared to be a rebuke to U.S. President Donald Trump, though both leaders' speeches were pre-recorded, Xi called for a global response to the virus and giving the World Health Organization a leading role.Xi's speech followed Trump telling the UN that it ""must hold China accountable"" for its actions related to the coronavirus pandemic.""The Chinese government, and the World Health Organization, which is virtually controlled by China, falsely declared that there was no evidence of human-to-human transmission,"" Trump, who offered no evidence for his claim, said, also in a prerecorded message.WATCH / Trump launches full attack on China at UN meetingWorldOn Tuesday, the U.S. death toll from the coronavirus topped 200,000, a figure unimaginable eight months ago. Trump has been blamed for worsening the pandemic by ignoring the virus and obfuscating the nation's federal response to curb its spread.  The U.S. president promised to distribute a vaccine. ""We will end the pandemic,"" he said, and enter a new era of prosperity, co-operation and peace.Trump, a frequent critic of the UN, also said in the excerpts that if the organization is to be effective, it must focus on ""the real problems of the world"" like ""terrorism, the oppression of women, forced labour, drug trafficking, human and sex trafficking, religious persecution, and the ethnic cleansing of religious minorities.""Meanwhile, Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro defended his administration's record protecting the Amazon rainforest, telling global leaders that his country has been wrongly portrayed as an environmental villain.Speaking first, as is tradition for the Brazilian leader, Bolsonaro said that the South American nation has succeeded in boosting agricultural exports to feed a growing global population, which has made it a target.""We are victims of one of the most brutal disinformation campaigns about the Amazon and the Pantanal wetlands,"" Bolsonaro said. ""The Brazilian Amazon is well-known to be very rich. That explains why international institutions support such campaigns based on ulterior interests, joined by self-serving and unpatriotic Brazilian associations, with the objective of harming the government and Brazil itself.""Deforestation in Brazil's Amazon region may have reached a 14-year high in the 12 months through July, according to preliminary data published last month by the country's space agency. Final data will be released in coming months.Fires also spiraled out of control in Brazil's Pantanal, the world's largest tropical wetlands, with the number of blazes surpassing 16,000 so far in 2020 — considerably more than any full year on record since 1998.Bolsonaro came to office in 2019 promising to open more of the Amazon to development, such as farming and mining. International concern, particularly after last year's fires, has led investors to try to distance themselves from increasing deforestation and to pressure Bolsonaro's government to take more action against it.Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said in his address that any COVID-19 vaccine should be universally available, regardless of where it is produced.""No matter what country they are produced in, vaccines that are made ready to be administered should be presented to the common use of humanity,"" he said in a video address.Erdogan also proposed a regional conference with all Mediterranean coastal states, including the breakaway Turkish Cypriots, to address tensions over maritime boundaries and hydrocarbon exploration in the region.He said Turkey's primary preference was to solve disagreements ""justly and in an appropriate way"" through talks, but added that ""futile"" attempts to exclude Turkey from plans in the eastern Mediterranean could not succeed.NATO members Turkey and Greece are at odds over rights to potential energy resources in the eastern Mediterranean and the extent of their continental shelves.Tensions heated up last month when Turkey sent a seismic survey vessel to waters claimed by Greece and Cyprus, but they cooled a bit last week when Ankara recalled the ship in a move welcomed by Greece and the EU.""I would like to reiterate our call to establish dialogue and co-operation with coastal states in the Mediterranean,"" Erdogan said. ""So we are proposing the holding a regional conference where the rights and interests of all coastal states are taken into consideration, and where Turkish Cypriots are present, too."""

With the global market for medical supplies overwhelmed by chaos and acts of piracy, Canada needed to take some of the risk out of securing everything from badly needed medical masks to gowns to gloves. Federal bureaucrats and political staff handling procurement of medical supplies were frustrated by deliveries showing up late. Unreliable and profiteering brokers were driving prices through the roof. Rival countries were buying shipments out from under each other.Yesterday, we received our third shipment of supplies needed to help our front-line healthcare workers protect themselves and continue caring for Canadians. The shipment contained millions of N95 respirators.There are even stories circulating of unnamed countries sending government planes to China — ferrying suitcases stuffed with cash — to buy supplies right on the tarmac or at the factory door.""It is really a Wild West when it comes to buying medical supplies right now,"" Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland told reporters on April 6.That intense global competition comes as health professionals in Canada warn of extreme shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE) that they say is putting the lives of front-line workers at risk. Some staff have even walked off the job because of a lack of protective gear.What Canada hopes will be a partial solution got its start in the embassy in Beijing.Dominic Barton, Canada's ambassador to China, may be new to the world of diplomacy, but the former managing director of the management consulting firm McKinsey brings a deep understanding of the Chinese economy to his role. Prior to his ambassadorship, Barton also sat on the advisory board of the state-run China Development Bank. His experience is being put to use in the global bidding wars for medical supplies. ""We're lucky we have Barton,"" said a federal official working directly on the procurement efforts. ""He's a business person first. He has good links into China, gets China, gets Chinese business.""Barton redeployed much of the staff at Canada's embassy, consulates and trade offices all over China. The diplomatic staff flipped their role from selling Canada to the Chinese, to buying Chinese medical supplies for Canada.""We have engaged our embassy on the ground in efforts to ensure that our orders are delivered on schedule and those parties are also identifying new opportunities for us,"" Public Services and Procurement Minister Anita Anand said on April 7.  But Canada's diplomats lacked an intimate knowledge of China's medical manufacturing sector and supply chains. So Canada hired a multi-national management consulting firm to help officials navigate what had suddenly become the world's most competitive industry. Federal officials would not initially confirm the name of the consulting firm because of the sensitive nature of these operations, but a source with direct knowledge of the arrangement said it was not Barton's old firm McKinsey. The unnamed consulting firm is helping Canada identify which factories are more reliable in terms of delivering quality goods that will meet Canadian standards. Stories have been surfacing around the world of sub-par masks and other defective supplies arriving from China only to be sent back or thrown out.Public Services and Procurement Minister Anita confirmed April 16 that Deloitte Canada will provide assistance on transportation, receiving, storage services and customs clearances.Members of the Chinese diaspora in Canada are also using their business connections to help federal and provincial governments secure reliable supplies. Canada's plan helps. But it isn't foolproof. The Toronto Star reported that Canada recently received a shipment of badly needed testing swabs only to find they were contaminated with what is believed to be mould. ""Cutting deals and securing quality supplies quickly is probably the biggest challenge in this entire thing,"" said the official working on procurement. There is also the challenge of ensuring that what Canada orders actually arrives. Barton may know business and the consultants may know the supply chains, but none of that guarantees medical supplies actually make it to Canada. ""Ordering of course does not guarantee a delivery,"" Anand said recently. ""In order to make sure that goods find their way back to Canada, we are taking very serious steps on the ground.""Those steps include hiring France-based Bolloré Logistics — a global transportation and logistics firm that has operated in Shanghai since 1994 — to help with on-the-ground support, including the transportation and receiving of goods, to ensure the Canadian orders are delivered in as timely a fashion as possible and are not diverted to a higher bidder. Bolloré Logistics helps get the supplies from the factory to a secure warehouse in Shanghai near the airport where they can be stored while the company works on customs clearance. This is where the near shut-down of international travel that is crippling global airlines actually helps Canada. There is a sudden glut of planes and pilots available to fly and maintain a critical air bridge for medical supplies. The first two flights organized as part of this effort arrived in Toronto on April 1 and April 6, delivering a resupply of personal protective equipment. The April 6 flight arrived with about eight million surgical masks ordered by the federal government, and other orders made directly by the governments of Nova Scotia and Quebec. The federal government has secured an arrangement with Air Canada and Cargojet to run more supply flights from China once Bolloré Logistics has enough supplies in the warehouse ready to go. The Cargojet flight that landed in Hamilton was the most recent delivery. Air Canada is due to send planes to Shanghai this week to deliver additional shipments. Touchdown in Hamilton from Shanghai today <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/CJT1392?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#CJT1392</a> 75,000 pounds of Personal Protection Equipment for Canadian front line workers &amp; <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/GovtOfCanada?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#GovtOfCanada</a> Proud of our entire <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/Cargojet?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#Cargojet</a> team for all their hard work &amp; sacrifice. 🇨🇦✈️ <a href=""https://t.co/nakmWoxJNk"">pic.twitter.com/nakmWoxJNk</a>The plan is for the number of flights to grow as the supply chain in China is able to deliver more supplies. Airlines are working to be ready to meet the demand.On April 7, Air Canada's Vice President of Flight Operations Murray Strom issued an internal call for pilots to volunteer for special flight assignments to support this effort.""The government of Canada has requested Air Canada provide emergency airlift capabilities to operate cargo-only flights"" from Shanghai to Canada, Strom wrote to his pilots in a memo obtained by CBC News. Strom specifically asked pilots trained to fly Boeing 777s and 787s to step up — suggesting there could be as many as four daily flights travelling to Shanghai via Japan. ""This operation will require a lot of pilots over the next seven to 10 days to assist both Canada and our airline to make this happen,"" Strom wrote. ""These are truly unique times we are going through, but we all need to be willing to do our part to assist our fellow Canadians who are going through some very tough times.""On Saturday Air Canada publicly announced that it was boosting its cargo capacity by stripping the seats out of three of its enormous Boeing 777 aircraft to double their cargo capacity.""Bringing critical medical and other vital supplies rapidly to Canada and helping distribute them across the country is imperative to combating the COVID-19 crisis,"" Tim Strauss, vice-president of cargo at Air Canada, said in a statement. We’re transforming three of our <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/B777s?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#B777s</a> to transport goods in the cabin, thereby doubling their cargo capacity to help fly critical medical and vital supplies to and across Canada.

But it's backstopping a still-fragile supply chain in a time of great stress. To further reduce risk, Canada is buying from as many Chinese factories as possible so it doesn't become reliant on a single operator. The idea is to reduce the exposure from having a manufacturing line bought out by a rival country or being left vulnerable due to a sudden drop in quality from a specific supplier. ""These supply chains are complex,"" Anand said on April 7. ""But we are taking every effort to make sure that we get those goods back to Canada and in the hands of front-line health-care workers.""The global procurements are part of what Public Services and Procurement Canada calls an ""aggressive approach"" to getting PPE for front-line workers, including bulk-buying for the provinces and scaling up domestic manufacturing capacity. Provinces and territories are also taking steps to build their own inventory of supplies.""We are exploring all options for securing the necessary equipment and supplies to fight COVID-19, through both domestic and international supply chains, to ensure that front-line health-care workers across the country are equipped and protected in the fight against COVID-19,"" spokesperson Michèle LaRose said in an email."

Heavy snowfall in provinces to the north had cut off parts of the busy railway line that starts in the city and ends in Beijing.President Hu Jintao called an emergency meeting with the top echelon of party leaders, which urged local authorities to regard disaster relief as the ""most pressing task"" and make ""all-out efforts"" to ensure normal production and life in areas hit by the storm, Xinhua said."

P.E.I. urged to allow COVID-19 tests to meet new China travel requirements | CBC News,Some members of P.E.I.'s Chinese community are asking the Island's Department of Health to expand options for COVID-19 testing to allow those wishing to travel to China to meet new requirements drafted by the Chinese government.,2020-09-03T10:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-covid-19-testing-for-travellers-1.5709749,"Some members of P.E.I.'s Chinese community are asking the Island's Department of Health to expand options for COVID-19 testing, after the Chinese government imposed new requirements for travel. Starting on Sept. 9, anyone boarding a flight from Canada to China needs to provide proof of a negative COVID-19 test within the past 72 hours. Right now on P.E.I., testing is available only to those who have coronavirus symptoms or a close contact with symptoms. ""Right now, there is no policy here in the province to have people tested for travel reasons,"" said Ally Guo, a member of the Island Chinese community who also volunteers within the community. ""If you have no symptoms and no problem, they cannot test for you.""Guo has recently started a social media group advocating for a testing option on P.E.I. for travel purposes — and she said at least 40 families have already joined.  The group has reached out to the Association for Newcomers to Canada, the Island's Department of Health, MP Sean Casey, and Chief Public Health Officer Dr. Heather Morrison.""We are trying to communicate with Health, and try to get them involved to have that exception for those people required to submit that kind of report [so that] they can present their ticket information or something, to have that test done,"" said Guo.One of the people trying to get back to China is Lihua Ji, who came to P.E.I. from Beijing in December for the birth of her grandson.The plan was to stay for a couple months and return to China in March, but the pandemic made that impossible.Since then, Lihua Ji has had four flights home cancelled. She's got a ticket booked for Sept. 15, but isn't sure how she'll be allowed to board the flight unless she's able to get tested for COVID-19 within three days of the trip. Speaking through Guo, the new grandmother told CBC that she worries for her husband, who is in poor health and lives alone in China. She also said she brought only enough medication for a few months, and has been using less of it to stretch out what she's got. That supply is quickly running out. Guo said those wishing to travel internationally and require a negative COVID-19 test for travel are willing to pay the costs of being tested.They can't get them done privately, even if that were an available option, because the Chinese government specifies that for travel from Canada, the tests need to be administered by institutions designated or recognized by the Chinese embassy or consulates in Canada.In P.E.I., the only acceptable tests would be administered by the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Charlottetown or the Prince County Hospital in Summerside. Officials with the Chief Public Health Office say they are working on the possibility of a testing option for travel purposes, but don't have any additional details at this time. They say more countries are requesting this as a prerequisite for entry for travel so they do plan to address this.No timelines have been provided, however."

The United States is responsible for all this,"" Wang said. ""We once again urge the United States to immediately retract its wrong decision and create necessary conditions for bringing the bilateral relationship back on track.""The White House urged China on Friday not to engage in ""tit-for-tat retaliation.""""Our action to direct the closure of PRC [People's Republic of China] Consulate General in Houston was taken to protect American intellectual property and Americans' private information,"" National Security Council spokesperson John Ullyot said.""We urge the CCP [Chinese Communist Party] to cease these malign actions rather than engage in tit-for-tat retaliation,"" Ullyot saidWang said some consulate personnel ""interfered in China's internal affairs and harmed China's security interests,"" but gave no details. He said Beijing complained ""many times"" to Washington about that.Also Friday, the U.S. State Department sent out a notice warning Americans in China of a ""heightened risk of arbitrary detention.""""U.S. citizens may be subjected to prolonged interrogations and extended detention for reasons related to 'state security,""' the notice said.Americans may be detained or deported for ""sending private electronic messages critical"" of the Chinese government, it said. The notice gave no indication of what prompted the warning.On Tuesday, the Trump administration ordered the Houston consulate closed within 72 hours. It alleged Chinese agents tried to steal data from facilities including the Texas A&M medical system.The ministry on Thursday rejected the allegations as ""malicious slander"" and warned the Houston consulate's closure was ""breaking down the bridge of friendship"" between the two countries.The United States has an embassy in Beijing and consulates in five other mainland cities — Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu, Shenyang and Wuhan. It also has a consulate in Hong Kong, a Chinese territory.The Chengdu consulate was in the news in 2012 when Wang Lijun, the police chief of the major city of Chongqing, visited and told American officials his concerns about the death of a British business associate of the wife of Chongqing's Communist Party secretary, Bo Xilai.That prompted the British Embassy to ask for a new investigation, which led to the arrest and conviction of Bo's wife. Bo was later dismissed and sentenced to prison.The consulate was surrounded by police while Wang was inside. He later emerged and was arrested and sentenced to 15 years on charges of corruption and defection. The U.S. government has refused to confirm whether Wang asked for asylum.Also Thursday, the U.S. Justice Department said it believes the Chinese Consulate in San Francisco is harbouring a Chinese researcher, Tang Juan, who is accused of lying about her background in the Communist Party's military wing on a visa application.The department announced criminal charges of visa fraud against Tang and three other Chinese researchers.U.S. authorities this week announced criminal charges against two Chinese computer hackers who are accused of targeting companies that are working on vaccines for the coronavirus.WATCH | Pompeo takes aim at China in Nixon Library speech:NewsThe Justice Department said Tang lied on a visa application last October as she made plans to work at the University of California, Davis, and again during an FBI interview months later.U.S. officials including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have stepped up accusations of technology theft.

U.S.-China trade war boosts sales of Canadian live lobster exports to China | CBC News,"Exporters and shippers of live Canadian lobster are reporting a huge growth in the number of air cargo shipments to China, driven by the trade war between the United States and China.",2018-09-26T09:00:48.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/u-s-trade-war-drives-soaring-canadian-live-lobster-exports-to-china-1.4838547,"Exporters and shippers of live Canadian lobster are reporting a huge growth in the number of air cargo shipments to China, driven by the trade war between the United States and China.The two countries have been dumping major tariffs on each other's goods for weeks. Both the U.S. and China have tacked tariffs on about 5,000 goods coming from each other's countries. Neither side seems prepared to back down either. Earlier this month, China announced a tariff hike on $60 billion worth of U.S. products.All that fighting is proving to be a boon for the Nova Scotia lobster industry, which provides the lion's share of the Canadian supply of live lobster. The steep tariffs on U.S. goods means Canadian lobster is a whole lot cheaper to buy in China than crustaceans from our American neighbours.  ""Our market share is getting more and more for this July, August and September, much more than last year and the last couple of years,"" said Yang Xue, general manager of Chinese-owned First Catch Fisheries, which now operates three charter flights a week carrying live lobster from Halifax to China.First Catch is part of a macro-economic event.The first month China imposed a retaliatory 25 per cent tariff on lobster from the U.S., Canadian shipments nearly doubled compared to the year before.Shipments to China went from 627,000 kilos in July, 2017 to over 1.25 million kilos in July 2018, according to Canadian government statistics. The value rose from $12 million to nearly $21 million.Most of that is flown out of Halifax Stanfield International Airport on jumbo jets carrying about 80,000 kilograms of live lobster per trip.""It's pretty massive,"" said Abbey MacDonald, operations manager at Flying Fresh Air Freight, a freight forwarding business. ""We never would have imagined this amount of freight moving.""This week, eight charter flights will carry live lobster – most of it from Nova Scotia – to Asia.Six are direct flights to China. Two will go to Seoul.The lift effort is extraordinary for late September – a time when the region has only one lobster fishery underway in the Northumberland Strait between New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island.""Normally we have a lull in our workload at some point in the summer. This summer that lull never came,"" MacDonald said.Shippers say Halifax is struggling to keep up with demand, with live lobster charters now being flown out of Moncton, N.B. The logistics hub in Halifax is also dispatching trucks to airports in Toronto and Montreal. Passenger aircraft also carry live lobster.It's still not enough, hence the chartered jumbo jets.""I couldn't even imagine what we could do if we had the capacity out of here,"" said MacDonald. She credits Gateway Facilities, the company that does most of the ground handling for the freighters, with doing an exceptional job. ""But there's only so much space and so much runway for them to handle.""Industry sources say live lobster inventories have been well drawn down by now.There have been fears Maine lobster, which is effectively shut out of China, is being imported into Canada and then shipped out as Canadian lobster to avoid the Chinese tariffs.It's a concern expressed last week by Geoff Irvine, of the Lobster Council of Canada at a fishermen's forum in Yarmouth, N.S.""Some of our live shippers are worried it could erode the Canadian market. It would undercut our market advantage [in China] and the prices we have, and we don't want that,"" Irvine told CBC News.Yang Xue said Canadian hard shell lobster is clearly better than its soft shell counterparts from Maine.The company added a charter to China after the tariff was imposed.The key effect of the tariff, he sees. is to keep Maine lobster out of China and drive down price.""The price is not being impacted by the U.S. lobster as last year and the year before. So what I see is Canadian lobster getting a better price and the only market.""Read more articles at CBC Nova Scotia"

How a photographer secretly documented the darkest moments of China's Cultural Revolution | CBC Radio,Li Zhensheng — a photographer who lived a double life during China's Cultural Revolution — has died at the age of 79.,2020-06-25T00:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/radio/asithappens/as-it-happens-thursday-edition-1.5626893/how-a-photographer-secretly-documented-the-darkest-moments-of-china-s-cultural-revolution-1.5625420,"Read Story TranscriptLi Zhensheng — a photographer who lived a double life during China's Cultural Revolution — has died at the age of 79.Li worked for a state-run newspaper as a photographer. He was ordered to not take ""negative"" images, but he secretly snapped thousands of illegal pictures that displayed the harsh truth of the decade.In May 1966, Chairman Mao Zedong announced the start of the Cultural Revolution, which effectively purged the Communist Party ranks and consolidated power for Mao. It resulted in economic stagnation, hunger, persecution, and bloodshed that left at least half a million people dead. Li's job with the newspaper Heilongjiang Daily allowed him to document a period of massive upheaval in China. He hid thousands of negatives under the floorboards in his apartment. Years later, he published some of them in his book Red-Color News Soldier. The images have also been displayed in exhibits around the world.  The New York Times has called his pictures, ""perhaps the most complete and nuanced pictorial account of the decade of turmoil ignited by Mao Zedong.""Robert Pledge is the director of the photographic agency Contact Press Images and editor of Red-Color News Soldier. Here is part of his conversation with As It Happens host Carol Off. I just want to say just for people who don't know the Cultural Revolution or don't remember, this was an extraordinary period of time ... from 1966 to 1976. It's believed that maybe a million and a half people were killed during that time. Tens of millions were persecuted for ""revisionism."" And he was able to get some very candid photos. How did he do that? How is he able to get access to these moments?Because he was a newspaper photographer, and therefore allowed to carry a camera, which most people were not allowed to do during that very turbulent period. It was a very violent period of time where parents were denounced by children. People were publicly humiliated. Hundreds of thousands, possibly millions of people were killed [or] committed suicide. He worked for a newspaper. And therefore, he was part of the propaganda machine, if you will. And that gave him some protection. Unlike most of his colleagues, he realized that this event would be very profound and long lasting. And he sensed that this was an event that was so huge that he had to record it and go beyond being part of the propaganda purpose.Did he set out to do that? At the beginning did ... he know that he was going to be exposing the dark side of the Cultural Revolution when he set out?No, of course not.I think in May 1966 … Chairman Mao declared that China would undergo Cultural Revolution and that would happen every seven years in China. Li Zhensheng was ... a young photographer [who] thought that was terrific for his career. The only problem is that very quickly he realized that this Cultural Revolution had everything but ... culture. Temples and churches were being destroyed, statues were being broken down. People were being mistreated. There was nothing cultural about it. That's when he realized that he had to record what he was seeing, what he was experiencing for history. So there's something very interesting and unique in his situation because he was, on the one hand, the propaganda photographer, and on the other hand, the undercover photographer who was recording the reality — the things that were really happening — and taking great risks doing that.Just for an example, can you give us some of the most striking images. There's so many of them, but what are the ones that really do expose that dark side?In the early stages of the movement, '66, '67, there were these massive rallies of young Red Guards. Teenagers ... would publicly humiliate members of the establishment — political establishment, if you will — the governor, the general secretary of the party, the professors, the teachers, even the parents. And they would bring them out in the stadium … to publicly humiliate them. [They] had them stand on a chair with their hands tied behind their backs [to] be shouted at and whipped and mistreated in public. I mean, it was devastating. So many people committed suicide as a result. They weren't necessarily killed right there on the spot. For instance, the governor of Heilongjiang Province, Li Fanwu, was brought up and stood on a chair. And young kids 12, 13, 14 years of age would shave his hair off — tear his hair off to humiliate him because they accuse him of wanting to look like Chairman Mao with his hairstyle. And that they noted [the governor's] ambition, political ambition.And Li Zhensheng photographed these moments. He photographed them and he realized that they would never be published.How did he conceal the photos?He would then process the film [and] he would edit the film. [He would] choose the pictures and all the images on his negatives that he knew were politically incorrect, if you will, all those negatives that were negative, he would cut them out and then he would bundle them. And he ended up burying them under the floorboard of his very small apartment.We know that Li Zhensheng's photos have been seen around the world, that they are famous images. But he had only limited access ... to mainland China. How important was it that people in China should see his work of the Cultural Revolution? His main objective in life since he retired was to have his images be seen by the younger generation of Chinese who were never told much by their parents or grandparents who felt embarrassed or ashamed [or] traumatized by the events.You had to remember that some families were torn between those who supported the Cultural Revolution and those who now opposed it. The participants and the victims are alive today. So it is not something that people would speak about comfortably.And they never told their children, or few told their children or their grandchildren what happened to them during that kind of time. And Li wanted that to be known. That was his goal in life, to get the pictures published.Written by Lito Howse. Interview produced by Katie Geleff. Edited for length and clarity. "
Canadian lobster exporters feel pinch of new COVID-19 testing in China | CBC News,A recent outbreak in Beijing is disrupting Canadian live lobster exports because Chinese authorities began testing for COVID-19 in imported food. However Canadian groups say the tests are unfounded since there is no scientific evidence that COVID-19 has been transmitted in food.,2020-06-19T09:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/nova-scotia-lobster-covid-19-testing-china-1.5618215,"A recent coronavirus outbreak traced to a market in Beijing is disrupting Canadian live lobster exports to China.New testing measures imposed in at least three cities — Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou— have led to cancelled lobster shipments from Nova Scotia this week and delays for shipments that do arrive.""We've hit a significant snag,"" said Geoff Irvine, executive director of the Lobster Council of Canada.""The latest news is that they will continue to do these random inspections, which has effectively caused many of the large shipments to stop.""Chinese authorities began testing for COVID-19 in imported food after an outbreak was traced to a cutting board used for salmon in the Xinfadi market in the Chinese capital. China is a crucial market for Canadian lobster fishermen. Before the pandemic struck, China was edging closer to overtaking the United States as the top importer, with sales of live lobster to China reaching $457 million last year.Random seafood shipments, including live lobster from Canada, are being held until test results come back.""The tests can take up to 36 hours, which means that the product sits out of water for 36 hours, so there can be mortality issues that someone has to pay for,"" Irvine said.The inspections have interrupted a rebound in live lobster sales to China after the market collapsed earlier in the year due to the pandemic.Figures from Statistics Canada, first reported by seafood publication Undercurrent News, reveal the scale of the collapse.In January, Canada sent 4,323 tonnes of live lobster worth $79.3 million in China. The majority of it was from Nova Scotia.In February, sales fell to 46 tonnes — worth just $940,000.""We've known since the start of the pandemic that there were going to be bumps in the road with regards to export markets. We've seen those challenges from day one,"" said Federal Fisheries and Oceans Minister Bernadette Jordan.The hope is this setback is a blip.""There's been no official closure of the borders or border ban on seafood products. It's just this testing regime that makes doing the business very, very risky,"" said Irvine.""The effect of these inspections are that the live shippers just simply don't want to ship there to take the risk.""I do know some shippers who are changing their terms of sale. If Chinese buyers want to pay for the product in advance and take the risk … of the inspections, they can still do that.""Other industry associations are also speaking out, including the Fisheries Council of Canada and the National Fisheries Institute in Washington.All say there is no scientific evidence that COVID-19 has been transmitted in food or food packaging, citing multiple public health agencies from the World Health Organization to the Canadian Food Inspection Agency.""The bigger problem is that it's completely unfounded,"" said Irvine.Earlier this week, Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada told provincial officials and industry stakeholders the Chinese government has not notified Canada of what it is doing.""There are no clear details on the type of products that will be targeted or the delay that may be caused for clearing customs as a result of testing,"" said a June 16 note. ""However, there are indications that meat, poultry, aquatic products and fruit and vegetables may be subject to testing.""The Government of Canada remains in close contact with the Canadian Mission in Beijing and will continue to seek further clarifications from official sources.""On Thursday night, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency said Chinese authorities have asked Canada and other countries for ""assurances"" food is free of COVID-19.""The General Administration of Customs China (GACC) has written to trading partners, including Canada, to officially request that government authorities provide assurances that food processing establishments eligible to export to China follow measures to prevent any COVID-19 contamination of food products during food production,"" spokesperson Christine Carnaffan said in an email response to CBC News.""The Government of Canada continues to engage with Chinese counterparts to reassure China of the strong measures in place in Canada to ensure the safety of the food and food products exported from Canada.""The statement reiterated the Canadian Food Inspection Agency's position: ""There is currently no scientific evidence that food or food packaging is a likely source or route of transmission of COVID-19. In addition, there have been no confirmed cases of food or food packaging being associated with the transmission of the virus."""

Government files reveal new information about shipment of deadly viruses from Canada to China | CBC News,One of the scientists escorted from the National Microbiology Lab last year amid an RCMP investigation was responsible for a shipment of Ebola and Henipah viruses to the Wuhan National Biosafety Laboratory four months earlier. Coronavirus was not part of the shipment.,2020-06-14T08:00:57.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/canadian-scientist-sent-deadly-viruses-to-wuhan-lab-months-before-rcmp-asked-to-investigate-1.5609582,"Newly-released access-to-information documents reveal details about a shipment of deadly pathogens last year from Canada's National Microbiology Lab to China — confirming for the first time who sent them, what exactly was shipped, and where it went.CBC News had already reported about the shipment of Ebola and Henipah viruses but there's now confirmation one of the scientists escorted from the lab in Winnipeg amid an RCMP investigation last July was responsible for exporting the pathogens to the Wuhan Institute of Virology four months earlier.Dr. Xiangguo Qiu, her husband Keding Cheng and her students from China were removed from Canada's only level-4 lab over what's described as a possible ""policy breach."" The Public Health Agency of Canada had asked the RCMP to get involved several months earlier. The virus shipments are not related to the outbreak of COVID-19 or research into the pandemic, Canadian officials said. PHAC said the shipment and Qiu's eviction from the lab are not connected.""The administrative investigation is not related to the shipment of virus samples to China,"" Eric Morrissette, chief of media relations for Health Canada and the Public Health Agency of Canada wrote in an email.""In response to a request from the Wuhan Institute of Virology for viral samples of Ebola and Henipah viruses, the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) sent samples for the purpose of scientific research in 2019.""However, experts are concerned.""It is suspicious. It is alarming. It is potentially life-threatening,"" said Amir Attaran, a law professor and epidemiologist at the University of Ottawa.WATCH | Deadly viruses were sent from Canada to China, documents show:CBC News Manitoba""We have a researcher who was removed by the RCMP from the highest security laboratory that Canada has for reasons that government is unwilling to disclose. The intelligence remains secret. But what we know is that before she was removed, she sent one of the deadliest viruses on Earth, and multiple varieties of it to maximize the genetic diversity and maximize what experimenters in China could do with it, to a laboratory in China that does dangerous gain of function experiments. And that has links to the Chinese military.""Gain of function experiments are when a natural pathogen is taken into the lab, made to mutate, and then assessed to see if it has become more deadly or infectious.In Canada, gain of function experiments to create more dangerous pathogens in humans are not prohibited, but are not done because they're considered too dangerous, Attaran said.""The Wuhan lab does them and we have now supplied them with Ebola and Nipah viruses. It does not take a genius to understand that this is an unwise decision,"" he said.""I am extremely unhappy to see that the Canadian government shared that genetic material.""Attaran pointed to an Ebola study first published in December 2018, three months after Qiu began the process of exporting the viruses to China. The study involved researchers from the NML and University of Manitoba.The lead author, Hualei Wang, is involved with the Academy of Military Medical Sciences, a Chinese military medical research institute in Beijing. All of this has led to conspiracy theories linking the novel coronavirus responsible for COVID-19, Canada's microbiology lab, and the lab in Wuhan. Online claims that Chinese scientists stole coronavirus from Winnipeg lab have 'no factual basis'The RCMP and PHAC have consistently denied any connections between the pandemic and the virus shipments. There is no evidence linking this shipment to the spread of the coronavirus. Ebola is a filovirus and Henipa is a paramyxovirus; no coronavirus samples were sent.The ATIP documents identify for the first time exactly what was shipped to China.The list includes two vials each of 15 strains of virus:  PHAC said the National Microbiology Lab routinely shares samples with other public health labs.The transfers follow strict protocols, including requirements under the Human Pathogens and Toxins Act (HPTA), the Transportation of Dangerous Goods Act, the Canadian Biosafety Standard, and standard operating procedures of the NML.CBC News has not been provided with some of the paperwork involved with the transfer, as information was redacted under sections of the Access to Information Act dealing with international affairs, national security and other issues.The ATIP documents provide details about the months leading up to the shipment — including confusion over how to package the deadly viruses — the lack of decontamination of the package before it was sent, and concerns expressed by the NML's director-general Matthew Gilmour in Winnipeg, and his superiors in Ottawa. They wanted to know where the package was going, what was in it, and whether it had the proper paperwork.In one email, Gilmour said Material Transfer Agreements would be required, ""not generic 'guarantees' on the storage and usage.""He also asked David Safronetz, chief of special pathogens: ""Good to know that you trust this group. How did we get connected with them?""Safronetz replied: ""They are requesting material from us due to collaboration with Dr. Qiu.""Meanwhile, it appears the NML's shipper initially planned to send the viruses in inappropriate packaging and only changed it when the clients in China flagged the problem.""The only reason the correct packaging was used is because the Chinese wrote to them and said, 'Aren't you making a mistake here?' If that had not happened, the scientists would have placed on an Air Canada flight, several of them actually, a deadly virus incorrectly packaged. That nearly happened,"" Attaran said.The package was routed from Winnipeg to Toronto and then to Beijing on a commercial Air Canada flight on Mar. 31, 2019. The next day, the recipients replied that the package had arrived safely. ""We would like to express our sincere gratitude to you all for your continuous support, especially Dr. Qiu and Anders! Thanks a lot!! Looking forward to our further cooperation in the future,"" said the heavily redacted email, which does not provide the name of the sender.Nearly one year after the expulsion of Qiu, Cheng, and her students from the NML, there are still no updates on the case from the RCMP or PHAC.At the time, Public Health Agency spokesperson Morrissette said the department was taking steps to resolve this case as quickly as possible. On Thursday, he said the investigation has not yet concluded.""Administrative investigations are impartial, thorough and in-depth. They are also procedurally fair and respect the rights of individuals,"" he said.Gordon Houlden, director of the China Institute at the University of Alberta, said he welcomes scientific collaboration and exchanges with China, ""but there has to be a framework of rules in place"" and Canada's intellectual property must be protected.Houlden, a former diplomat, has many unanswered questions about this particular shipment.A vacuum of information is always a problem, especially in a situation of heightened tension with China over the arrest of a Huawei executive in Canada, the seemingly retaliatory arrest of two Canadian men in China and questions over the origins of the coronavirus, he said. ""There's also a danger if you don't provide information that people will jump always to the worst conclusion,"" Houlden said. Current NML head Matthew Gilmour was not made available for an interview. He is leaving as of July to work for the U.K.-based Quadram Institute Bioscience. His medical adviser, Dr. Guillaume Poliquin, will take over until a permanent replacement can be found.Qiu could also not be reached for a comment."

China to lift coronavirus lockdown in most of Hubei province | CBC News,"Chinese authorities say they will end a two-month lockdown of most of coronavirus-hit Hubei province at midnight, as domestic cases of what has become a global pandemic subside.",2020-03-24T15:27:48.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/china-lift-hubei-lockdown-1.5507908,"Chinese authorities said Tuesday they will end a two-month lockdown of most of coronavirus-hit Hubei province at midnight, as domestic cases of what has become a pandemic subside.People with a clean bill of health will be allowed to leave, the provincial government said, easing restrictions on movement that were unprecedented in scale. The city of Wuhan — the capital of Hubei and where the virus was first detected in December — is to remain locked down until April 8.China barred people from leaving or entering Wuhan beginning on Jan. 23 in a surprise middle-of-the-night announcement and expanded that to most of the province in succeeding days. Trains and flights were cancelled and checkpoints set up on roads into the central province.The drastic steps came as the coronavirus began spreading to the rest of China and overseas during the Lunar New Year holiday, when millions of Chinese travel.WATCH | Wuhan springs to life as COVID-19 recedes:WorldThe virus raged for weeks in Wuhan and surrounding cities. Hospitals overflowed and temporary ones were hastily set up to try to isolate the growing number of infected patients. More than 2,500 people have died in Wuhan out of 3,270 countrywide.The outbreak has since been brought under control, and Hubei has seen almost no new infections for more than a week.The move to end the lockdown showed the authorities' apparent faith in the success of the drastic measures as they try to kick-start the world's second-largest economy and put money in the pockets of workers, many of whom have gone weeks without pay. It remained unclear, however, which cities and provinces, including Beijing, would allow people from Hubei to enter their jurisdictions. About 120,000 migrant workers — including many who had made the traditional trip home to Hubei for Lunar New Year — have already been allowed to leave in recent days on special buses and trains, according to Chinese media reports. The reports said manufacturing centres, such as Guangdong and Zhejiang province, are open to people from Hubei.Outside of Hubei, the government says work has restarted on about 90 per cent of major public construction projects across the country. While many migrant workers remain trapped by travel restrictions and quarantines, factories are operating again, though not at full capacity.In the Beijing area, the city zoo and parts of the Great Wall reopened this week, though they required advance reservations to limit the number of visitors. Some restaurants were reopening for business, some on the condition that customers do not sit facing each other.At the Xibei restaurant inside a mall in eastern Beijing's Shuangjing neighbourhood, a line formed around 11 a.m. Tuesday for the lunch opening, although managers said they expected to serve only around 140 customers, down from the usual daily number of 900 before the virus outbreak.Half of the establishment's 20 tables had ""closed"" signs on them to help keep a distance between customers, while food delivery workers rushed in and out with orders of grilled beef and lamb, noodles, pancakes and other northern Chinese dishes.Wu Lin, who works in cosmetics, was dining out for the first time since restrictions were imposed because of the outbreak.""Since [the restaurant] can open at the moment, I believe their prevention and control is fairly good,"" Wu said. ""For example, they check the temperature of every customer and staffer. It gives us a sense of safety.""Officials have turned their attention to the threat of the virus entering from abroad, with almost all new cases being recorded among people arriving from overseas. China's National Health Commission on Tuesday reported 78 new coronavirus cases, among which 74 were imported.Starting Wednesday, Beijing will require everyone coming from overseas to be tested for the coronavirus on top of being quarantined for 14 days. In a notice published online, city authorities said those who have entered the city within the last 14 days will also undergo the mandatory testing.""Currently, the imported risk from the epidemic's rapid spread overseas continues to rise,"" the Beijing notice said.The heightened measures — which apply regardless of one's final destination — follow a previous order that all overseas arrivals quarantine themselves at designated hotels at their own expense unless they live alone."

The death toll in Iran climbed to six, the highest outside China, and a dozen towns in northern Italy effectively went into lockdown as authorities tested hundreds of people who came into contact with an estimated 79 confirmed cases there.

The agency said 70 of them are linked to a branch of the Shincheonji church in Daegu, which has become the biggest cluster of viral infections in the country, which now has a total of 556 cases.Daegu Mayor Kwon Yong-jin told reporters that 247 residents had tested positive for the virus since the city confirmed its first case on Feb. 18. That first patient is a Shincheonji church member in Daegu who has no recent record of overseas travel. Officials said she attended church services and visited other places before being diagnosed with the disease, but they still believe it's unlikely that the woman set off the chain of infections.Kwon said there are concerns that the number of those infected in Daegu could see yet another massive increase because authorities were launching intensive examinations of church members with virus-related symptoms. More than 9,000 worshipers were being tested.Downtown Daegu was mostly deserted with shelves at some supermarkets and stores empty. Many restaurants, bars, real-estate offices and tour agencies have shut down as traffic nosedived and people stayed home, ordering food and supplies online.On Sunday, mainland China reported 648 new infections for a total of 76,936. The daily death toll fell slightly to 97. In all, 2,442 people have died in the country from COVID-19.The number of new Chinese cases has seesawed daily but remained under 1,000 for the past four days. Several changes to how the infections are counted, however, have made it difficult to draw conclusions from the figures.The central Chinese city of Wuhan and other parts of Hubei province, where the outbreak first emerged in December, remain under lockdown. More than 80 per cent of the country's cases are in Hubei, where the death toll has also been higher than in the rest of the nation.China's Politburo, made up of senior officials of the ruling Communist Party, cautioned Friday that while the epidemic has been ""preliminarily contained,"" the country has yet to see a turning point.Officials signaled that regular activities should gradually resume after the virus prompted an extension of last month's Lunar New Year holiday. Many workplaces have opted to have their employees work remotely, and schools are conducting online classes.In Beijing, most residential communities have implemented ""closed management,"" limiting the number of people per household who can go in and out using exit-entry cards and requiring those just returning to the Chinese capital to isolate themselves at home for 14 days.A cluster of infections was reported out of Beijing's Fuxing Hospital. The facility, which has 34 confirmed cases, has been closed off to protect the surrounding community, said a statement from Xicheng district authorities.More than 500 cases also have been found in prisons across the country.The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said a male patient hospitalized at Cheongdo city, near Daegu, died on Sunday, the country's fourth fatality. He was believed to be 57 years old but no other details on him were made available.On Saturday night, Prime Minister Chung Sye-kyun said in a nationally televised address that the virus outbreak had entered ""a more grave stage"" and repeated the government is making all-out efforts to contain the further spread of the disease. Chung also said his government will sternly deal with any acts that hamper national quarantine efforts.Globally, more than 78,000 people have been infected in 29 countries.Israel, which has reported one case, turned back a South Korean airliner with most of its passengers after it landed at the country's Ben Gurion airport Saturday evening. Twelve Israelis on board were evacuated and quarantined while the plane was taxied away from the allotted terminal, Israeli media reported.Yonhap news agency cited Seoul's Foreign Ministry as registering a strong protest with the Israeli government. The Foreign Ministry told the Israeli government that no excessive, unreasonable measures should be taken against South Korean nationals, according to the report.Seoul's Foreign Ministry couldn't immediately be reached for comment. According to Yonhap, the plane was returning to South Korea on Sunday afternoon.South Korea earlier informed Israel that nine members of a group who toured Israel and the West Bank for a week this month tested positive for the virus. The tourists were diagnosed upon returning home. Israeli and Palestinian health authorities asked people who were in close contact with the tourists to quarantine themselves.A team of global experts with the World Health Organization is on the way to China's Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said Saturday. It has been visiting other parts of China this week.Tedros also told a meeting of African health ministers that the WHO is concerned about cases with ""no clear epidemiological link, such as travel history to China or contact with a confirmed case."" He is especially concerned about the growing number of cases in Iran, where 28 people have been infected."

"No concentration camps in China just 'vocational training centres,' says envoy | CBC News","Detention camps housing hundreds of thousands, perhaps over one million ethnic Uighurs, in western China are nothing more than vocational training centres, the country’s ambassador to Canada insisted on Wednesday.",2020-03-04T20:28:03.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/china-concentration-camp-uighurs-1.5485658,"Detention camps housing perhaps as many as one million ethnic Uighurs in western China are nothing more than ""vocational training centres,"" the country's ambassador to Canada insisted on Wednesday.Cong Peiwu, speaking at a security and defence conference in Ottawa, was put on the hot seat several times during a panel discussion about the competition between great powers in the Middle East.He discussed how China could use soft power influence in the troubled region while being asked whether it is detaining a substantial number of Muslim Uighurs against their will in high-tech concentration camps. Cong took issue with the characterization.""There's nothing like concentration camps in China,"" he said.Last fall, a leak of internal Chinese government documents to the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) painted a stark picture of camps, which have been built across Xinjiang region in the past three years. The leaked documents, dubbed ""The China Cables"" by the ICJI, contain a nine-page 2017 memo, sent from the then deputy-secretary of province's Communist Party to the officials in charge of the camps.The memo spells out how the camps should be run as high-security prisons, complete with strict discipline and punishments.The publication of the records by media outlets around the world, including CBC News, caused a sensation and led to condemnation from several governments, including Global Affairs Canada, which said it was concerned about ""credible reports of the mass detention, repression and surveillance"" in Xinjiang.Chinese officials, including Cong, have responded by attempting to discredit the reports.""Some of the western media can be misleading you. So, be careful. There's a lot of fake news,"" he said  As for the concentration camps, as you call it ... actually it was used to be vocational training centres.""PoliticsHe stuck to Beijing's often-repeated position that the camps were necessary to quell the unrest from a few years ago.""So, that's why the government had to take preventative measures when it comes to counter-terrorism,"" he said.Cong also faced questions about the detention of two Canadians, Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig, who have been held for over year, an action widely seen as retaliation for the arrest of Chinese telecommunication executive Meng Wanzhou by federal authorities.She is wanted in the U.S. in connection with the alleged violation of Iranian sanctions by her company, Huawei.Cong insisted Spavor and Kovrig are being treated fairly according to Chinese law, although he would not say when the country will present evidence to back up the claims of security officials that the two men are spies and a threat to national security. He faced several questions about the case during the panel discussion and afterward when speaking with journalists. The ambassador did suggest the frosty relationship between Canada and China has thawed a bit because of the Liberal government's measured response to the outbreak of the novel coronavirus. ""I would like to commend and appreciate what the Canadian side has done so far in the fight against the outbreak,"" Cong said. ""I think, first, it has adopted a cool-headed approach and an evidence-based manner.""Expressions of ""support, solidarity and sympathy"" by Canada have been also appreciated, he added.Politics"

Further details would be given on Friday, he added.WATCH | Chinese proposal takes aim at Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement:The NationalThe Hong Kong dollar weakened on the news.Xinhua said a preparatory meeting for a Chinese parliament session adopted an agenda that included an item to review a bill ""on establishing and improving the legal system and enforcement mechanisms for the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region to safeguard national security.""Earlier Thursday, the South China Morning Post, citing unnamed sources, said the laws would ban secession, foreign interference, terrorism and all seditious activities aimed at toppling the central government and any external interference in Hong Kong.Online posts had already emerged urging people to gather to protest on Thursday night and dozens were seen shouting pro-democracy slogans in a shopping mall as riot police stood nearby.Opposition democrats said the move would gravely wound Hong Kong's reputation as a financial centre and its high degree of autonomy.""If this move takes place, 'one country, two systems' will be officially erased,"" said democratic lawmaker Dennis Kwok.""This is the end of Hong Kong,"" added Kwok, flanked by other opposition democrats.Hong Kong people took to the streets last year to protest a now-withdrawn bill that would have allowed extraditions of criminal suspects to mainland China. The movement broadened to include demands for broader democracy amid perceptions that Beijing was tightening its grip over the city.""If Beijing passes the law … how [far] will civil society resist repressive laws? How much impact will it unleash on to Hong Kong as an international financial centre?"" said Ming Sing, political scientist at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.The legislation could be a turning point for Hong Kong, potentially triggering a revision of its special status in Washington and likely to spark more unrest.""If it happens, we'll address that issue very strongly,"" U.S. President Donald Trump said from Washington before departing for a visit to a Michigan factory.U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on May 6 he was delaying a report assessing whether Hong Kong was sufficiently autonomous to warrant Washington's special economic treatment that has helped it remain a world financial centre.The delay was to account for any actions at the National People's Congress, he said.Tension between the two superpowers has heightened in recent weeks, as they exchanged accusations on the handling of the coronavirus pandemic, souring an already worsening relationship over trade.Pompeo said on Wednesday that pro-democracy lawmakers had been ""manhandled"" this week while trying to stop what he characterized as procedural irregularity by pro-Beijing legislators, and added: ""Leading Hong Kong activists like Martin Lee and Jimmy Lai were hauled into court. Actions like these make it more difficult to assess that Hong Kong remains highly autonomous from mainland China.""A previous attempt by Hong Kong to introduce national security legislation, known as Article 23, in 2003 was met with mass peaceful protests and shelved.Hong Kong has a constitutional obligation to enact Article 23 ""on its own,"" but similar laws can be introduced by Beijing separately into an annex of the Basic Law, the city's mini-constitution.That legal mechanism could bypass the city's legislature as the laws could be imposed by promulgation by Hong Kong's pro-Beijing government.""Some people are destroying Hong Kong's peace and stability. Beijing saw all that has happened,"" pro-establishment lawmaker Christopher Cheung, who is not part of discussions in Beijing, told Reuters.""Legislation is necessary and the sooner the better.""National security legislation has been strongly opposed by pro-democracy protesters who argue it could erode the city's freedoms and high degree of autonomy, guaranteed under the ""one country, two systems"" formula put in place when it returned to Chinese rule.Protesters denounce what they see as the creeping meddling in Hong Kong by China's Communist Party rulers. Beijing denies the charge."
China posts lowest full-year growth in 25 years,"China's economic growth edged down to 6.8 per cent in the final quarter of 2015 as trade and consumer spending weakened, dragging full-year growth to its lowest in 25 years.",2016-01-19T00:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/china-economic-growth-2015-1.3409708,"China's economic growth edged down to 6.8 per cent in the final quarter of 2015 as trade and consumer spending weakened, dragging full-year growth to its lowest in 25 years.Growth has fallen steadily over the past five years as the ruling Communist Party tries to steer away from a worn-out model based on investment and trade toward self-sustaining growth driven by domestic consumption and services. But the unexpectedly sharp decline over the past two years prompted fears of a politically dangerous spike in job losses.Full-year growth declined to 6.9 per cent, government data showed Tuesday. That was the lowest since sanctions imposed on Beijing following its crackdown on the Tiananmen Square pro-democracy movement caused growth to plummet to 3.8 per cent in 1990.The October-December growth figure was the lowest quarterly expansion since the aftermath of the global financial crisis, when growth slumped to 6.1 per cent in the first quarter of 2009. Growth in the July-September quarter of 2009 was 6.9 per cent.Growth in investment in factories, housing and other fixed assets, a key economic driver, weakened to 12 per cent in 2015, down 2.9 percentage points from the previous year. Retail sales growth cooled to 10.6 per cent from 2014's 12 per cent.""The international situation remains complex,"" said Wang Bao'an, commissioner of the National Bureau of Statistics, as a news conference. ""Restructuring and upgrading is in an uphill stage. Comprehensively deepening reform is a daunting task.""""Official data do not point to a hard landing in the fourth quarter of 2015, but they provide little reason to stop worrying about China's drag on the global economy, either,"" said economist Bill Adams of PNC Financial Services Group in a report.Growth was in line with private sector forecasts and the ruling Communist Party's official target of about seven per cent for the year.As a result, Asian stock markets mostly eked out modest gains Tuesday. The Shanghai Composite was up 1.6 per cent at 2,961.58 and Hong Kong's Hang Seng gained 0.8 per cent to 19,386.75. Japan's Nikkei 225 overcame early losses to rise 0.2 per cent to 16,989.31. South Korea's Kospi advanced 0.2 per cent to 1,881.77.Beijing responded to ebbing growth by cutting interest rates six times since November, 2014, and launched measures to help exporters and other industries. But economists note China still relies on state-led construction spending and other investment.December exports shrank 1.4 per cent from a year earlier, well below the ruling party's target of six per cent growth in total trade. For the full year, exports were down 7.6 per cent, a blow to industries that employ millions of Chinese workers.Forecasters see indications retail sales and other activity accelerated toward the end of 2015, suggesting Beijing's efforts to put a floor under the downturn are gaining traction.""The growth picture remains two-sided. The real estate construction slump and weak exports continued to weigh on activity,"" said Louis Kuijs of Oxford Economics in a report.""Meanwhile, though, consumption continued to expand robustly, supported by solid wage growth,"" said Kuijs. ""The robust growth in the consumption and services nexus is key for policymakers. They need it to avoid labour market stress.""Spending on online commerce grew by 33.3 per cent over 2014. Wang said the share of total economic activity accounted for by consumption rose to 56.4 per cent, up 15 percentage points from 2014.Forecasters expect economic growth to decline further this year, with the International Monetary Fund targeting a 6.3 per cent expansion."

""We will not tackle this problem of global warming and climate change unless we get everyone on board, everyone with an oar in the water and everyone rowing together.""Baird is leading the Canadian delegation at the two-week United Nations climate change conference in Bali, where participants will be discussing the framework for a new agreement to replace the Kyoto Protocol when it expires in 2012.  The conference, which is drawing representatives from 190 countries, officially began Monday, although Baird will not be arriving until next week.""It'sessential we work at this conference to bring other countries aboard,"" Baird said.Still, Baird said Canada will not shy away from making a bolder commitment than developing nations, whose new economies could suffer under drastic emissions-reducing measures.""Let me be clear, Canada can afford to do more faster than developing countries, so it doesn't have to be a one-size fits all solution,"" Baird said. ""But everyone's got to be going in the same direction down the right road.""Baird has insisted previously that all emitters must be on board when a new climate change treaty is drafted. Under the Kyoto Protocol, some developing countries did not have targets to meet because of their fragile economies.During Baird's speech to the Economic Club of Toronto, a protester jumped on stage carrying a sign that read ""Liar.""Baird and the Conservative government have been attacked for their failure to meet the emissions targets set out in the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, which was signed by Canada under a Liberal government in 1998.Kyoto, which was ratified by 141 countries,provides specific targets for different nations, with Canada expected to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by six per cent from 1990 levels by 2012.But Baird's environmental plan, made public in April, only calls for Canada to reduce overall emissions by 20 per cent from 2006 levels by 2020. This plan means Canada will miss its Kyoto goals by years."
How a revival of Maoism is impacting China — and the world | CBC Radio,"If you thought Maoism was dead, think again. It’s enjoying a revival under President Xi Jinping.

But in China, it's very much alive. In fact, there's a significant revival of Maoist strategies in China, under President Xi Jinping.""Xi Jinping is on record saying that the Chinese communist party has to keep flying the flag of Mao Zedong thought, without that it will lose legitimacy and face a political crisis no less,"" Lovell tells IDEAS' Mary Lynk.Her book, Maoism: A Global Story, is in depth exploration of the impact of Maoism in China and around the world. It won  the 2019 Cundhill History prize — a prestigious, international award administered by McGill University. Lovell, who is also a professor of modern Chinese history and literature at University of London, argues in light of the growing tensions between the West and China, it's critical to understand the political legacy of Mao Zedong.China, today, downplays the role it played in global affairs under Mao. But Lovell contends Mao and the PRC put an enormous amount of 'time, energy and money' into establishing its influence and image abroad.""For the past 10 or 20 years, as China has started to look like a superpower, its rulers have advanced the theory of China's peaceful rise. So government publicity repeats that China has never interfered in the sovereign affairs of other countries, unlike the West,"" Lovell explains.""China today doesn't want to illuminate its desire for leadership of the world revolution during the Maoist period, which was a time when China under Mao exported not only ideology in the form of hundreds of millions of copies of the Little Red Book, but also hard occurrences of revolution, money, weapons and training for global insurgencies, especially in the developing world.""Around the world, Lowell says the export of Maoism continues to be a potent influence, adding it's one of the most significant and complicated political forces of the modern world.""I also like to argue that there's a pressing need to evaluate the power and allure of Maoism beyond China, because it's had a long after life in revolutions and insurrections that have transformed states across the world in countries like Cambodia, Zimbabwe, Peru, India and Nepal,"" Lovell says.""So these revolutions and insurrections and wars have been based on Mao's theories of class struggle and guerilla warfare. Maoism, then, has been a pivotal influence on global rebellion across the last 80 years.""For decades, Lovell says, the West has wrongly dismissed Maoism as an outdated historical and political phenomenon. ""I think it's partly down to perceptions of Western victory in the Cold War, namely that the sudden collapse of the Soviet Union between 1989 and 1991 signaled the global collapse of communism,"" Lovell says.""Of course, if you take a non-Eurocentric view, if you look at Asia rather than Europe, communism as a state ideology looks far more secure after 1989 in China, Vietnam and North Korea.""Maoism is not easy to define. It does have some central doctrines, such as voluntarism: ""that by sheer audacity of belief the Chinese — and any other people with the necessary strength of will — could transform their country."" But it is also full of contradictory ideas, just like Mao himself.  Here is an excerpt from Julia Lovell's, Maoism: A Global History: In contemplating Mao and his ideas, we are left principally with inconsistency. Mao was an army man, an arch political manipulator and centraliser, the architect of his own personality cult, a fetishiser of party discipline; and a glorifier of mass rebellion who continually saw himself as an outsider. He was a rhetorical feminist, who serially impregnated, abandoned, sexually abused and infected women. The wife of a close associate from the Yan'an days up until Mao's death remembered him thus: 'I really admired him. He was so clever. He was very humorous. I was afraid of him. I avoided him. He didn't say much, he'd ask you your view...You'd ask him what he thought and he wouldn't say.' This conversational assessment, lacking the analytical cogency of a scripted answer, condenses Mao's mutability: his informality; his guardedness; the reverence and fear he inspired; his savvy manipulations....It is perhaps this perplexing, inconsistent mutability, in combination with memory of the political and military success of Mao, that has given the political line which carries his name its potency, persuasiveness and mobility. Somehow, Maoism is the creed of winners and insiders, of losers and outsiders, of leaders and underdogs, of absolute rulers, vast, disciplined bureaucracies, and oppressed masses. Frustrated with its contradictions, its muddying of tidy disciplines, Christophe Bourseiller, an authority on Maoism's journey to Europe, goes so far as to say: 'Maoism doesn't exist. It never has done. That, without doubt, explains its success.' Copyright Julia Lovell 2019Julia Lovell is professor of modern China at Birkbeck College, University of London.

Coronavirus takes bite out of Clearwater's seafood sales to China | CBC News,"With the live lobster market currently halted in China, it comes as no surprise that North America's largest shellfish producer, Clearwater Seafoods, says the coronavirus has slowed the company's food service and restaurant sales.",2020-03-05T10:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/canadian-seafood-sales-china-coronavirus-1.5486097,"With the live lobster market currently halted in China, it comes as no surprise that North America's largest shellfish producer, Clearwater Seafoods, says the coronavirus has slowed the company's food service and restaurant sales.""If anybody in the industry is telling you things are fine, clearly that is not the case. But the sky is not falling either,"" Clearwater Seafoods CEO Ian Smith told analysts this week.The company was briefing the financial market on healthy sales results for the last three months of 2019 before the outbreak hit China.Live lobster sales in China are big business not only for Clearwater.In the first 10 months of 2019, sales from Atlantic Canadian companies were $384 million.Clearwater, based in Bedford, N.S., is warning of potential ""headwinds"" in 2020 because of the coronavirus, or COVID-19.""The real question is what have the impacts already been and what are they likely to be going forward,"" Smith said.On the upside, he said all live lobster that was in China before the Chinese New Year, which is when the outbreak hit, has now been eaten or further processed.Smith said when the markets resume, this represents a multimillion dollar export opportunity.Restaurants in China have adapted by offering takeaway and delivery services, while demand has picked up for frozen products produced by Clearwater.Smith said retail and e-commerce sales in China are up so far this year, but not enough to offset lost food service business.Clearwater has diverted live lobster to other areas while it monitors the impact of the outbreak in China and around the world.The company has seen no disruption or change in order patterns from customers in Europe and North America, except for one exception: lower sales to Asian grocery stores and restaurants in North America, which is a small piece of its business.Clearwater also ships frozen products to China on container vessels, primarily Arctic surf clams caught off Cape Breton and Newfoundland.Atlantic Canadian containerized exports to China are mostly frozen seafood and agriculture products.Each week, between 100 and 200 containers from the Port of Halifax arrive in China, where some cargo has been stalled by the outbreak.Nova Scotia Fisheries and Aquaculture Minister Keith Colwell said it's fortunate the cargo is frozen and not perishable.The ""jam up"" in giant ports like Shanghai left shippers from Atlantic Canada with few options as port workers were either ordered to stay home or unable to go to work, said Yang Xue, a Halifax-based export consultant.He predicts the bottleneck will end as Chinese people return to work and port staff work around the clock to clear backlogs.""They are fully staffed. I think this will be resolved in the next week or two,"" he said.St. John's-based Ocean Choice International ships frozen shrimp, sea cucumber, yellowtail flounder and redfish to China.""We have shipped products to China since the coronavirus outbreak, and while we have experienced some delays associated with customs clearance and logistics once the shipments reach China, we have not experienced any major delays that have caused issues,"" said spokesperson Cara Pike.A spokesperson for frozen french fry maker Cavendish Farms, which is owned by J.D. Irving Ltd., says the company ""has not seen any delays/impacts to our export program due to coronavirus.""Meanwhile at Clearwater, Smith said containers shipped to China in December — it takes 45 to 60 days to get there — are moving from the port to their intended destinations.""We continue to sell our products in China. In March alone, we are forecast to sell hundreds of thousands of pounds of new orders, not just for clams, but also for other species to our Chinese customers,"" he said.MORE TOP STORIES"

Health Canada issues recall of some KN95 masks made in China | CBC News,Health Canada has issued a recall of KN95 respirators manufactured by dozens of Chinese companies because they “pose a health and safety risk to end users.”,2020-05-13T23:38:01.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/health-canada-issues-recall-of-some-kn95-masks-made-in-china-1.5568734,"Health Canada has issued a recall of KN95 respirators manufactured by dozens of Chinese companies because they ""pose a health and safety risk to end users."" In a bulletin issued to Canadian importers and distributors on Monday, Health Canada warned that some KN95 masks recently tested by the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health ""failed to meet 95 per cent filtration specifications."" NIOSH, part of the U.S.-based Centers for Disease Control, is responsible for conducting research and making recommendations to prevent work-related injury and sickness.""Health Canada cannot reasonably conclude that the benefits associated with having the KN95 Filtering Facepiece Respirator available in Canada, as currently labelled, outweigh the risks,"" the May 11 bulletin says. The bulletin, titled Recall of KN95 Respirators, was sent to companies across Canada that are authorized to import or distribute supplies for use in hospitals or other health-care institutions. It notes that some of these companies may have imported and sold masks that have now been recalled.The bulletin does not say how many KN95 masks have been imported to Canada. Read the full bulletin here.For hospital workers in the COVID-19 pandemic, N95 masks have become the health-care standard in personal protective equipment because they are designed to filter out at least 95 per cent of airborne particles. The recalled masks are made to the Chinese standard, KN95, which is also supposed to filter out more than 95 per cent of particulates. But NIOSH tests found that some masks filtered out as little as one per cent. ""Manufacturers of concern are only those that failed to meet 95 per cent filtration specifications,"" says the recall notice. According to Health Canada's website, it started authorizing the use of KN95 masks for medical purposes in light of the pandemic.""To expand the availability of N95 respirators during the pandemic, equivalent alternate standards may also be acceptable …this includes both medical and commercial (non-medical) KN95... respirators,"" the site says.Health Canada indicates the N95 and KN95 standards are similar ""with respect to design, filtration, performance and materials standards.""  However, it says that ""recent testing performed by the CDC resulted in concerns with some KN95 respirators (specifically those with ear loop design) that pose a difficulty in achieving a proper fit, which is essential for use.""Health Canada notes that by contrast the headband design on other KN95 masks offers a proper fit and seal. Ottawa also noted that some KN95 respirators failed to meet the 95 per cent filtration standard.Earlier this month, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) made a decision similar to Health Canada's. It published a list of products produced by dozens of Chinese manufacturers declaring they ""are no longer authorized."" The FDA started allowing the sale of the KN95 masks for medical use in the US since early April under an ""emergency use authorization."" Despite the concern about the quality of many KN95 masks, Ottawa says ""this action does not implicate KN95 respirators purchased by the Government of Canada and tested by the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC).""It says that before it sends masks to front-line workers they are subjected to quality tests including a ""visual inspection to check for defects in design and construction, and testing to confirm that they meet filtering specifications."" Last week, Ottawa revealed that it had suspended shipment of millions of Chinese-made masks because they failed to meet the required specifications. Federal government rejects 8 million N95 masks from single distributorAccording to the federal government's website, as of May 7 it has ordered 135 million N95 respirators. The site says so far 11.5 million have arrived but ""a significant portion of these remain under testing."" So far Ottawa has determined eight million of those masks fall below federal standards for medical use while others are still being tested.  Of the 11.5 million N95 masks received so far, Ottawa says one million have been found to meet federal standards. Ottawa urged any importer that brought in KN95 masks from any of the dozens of China-based manufacturer's listed on the NIOSH website to take immediate action and ""stop sale"" of the products. It added that they should relabel the KN95 respirators as face masks which can be used in health care or non-healthcare settings where 95 per cent filtration isn't necessary. ""The products are not being removed from the market,"" says Health Canada.Ottawa also instructed importers to alert their Canadian customers immediately. It says it will still allow KN95 masks into the country provided independent testing shows the masks meet the standards."

He lives with his girlfriend, who is Chinese. Wuhan is where the virus that has brought the world to its knees was first detected, and the city has been on lockdown every since. That is now easing, with people allowed out of their homes. ""We left our apartment a little bit at the beginning to go grocery shopping, when it wasn't so strict, but then about a week into that they said you can't go out at all. Now we have our groceries brought to us,"" Henshaw said. It's been 62 days since people have been told to stay indoors, and Henshaw said that like here in Canada, people have been getting together using social media, with entire neighbourhoods arranging for large grocery delivery orders that get dropped off at doorsteps. ""Someone from the community will say, 'Hey, I need vegetables, does anyone else need vegetables?' and then 50 people get together, and one person contacts the grocery store and send a city bus filled with food,"" Henshaw said. ""The bags get dropped off and the individuals pick up their bags and go back home."" Henshaw has help from his girlfriend, with whom he lives, so he can order food and navigate other parts of life in China without knowing the language very well. He's been spending his time like many Canadians are now — reading, watching movies and television (he's partial to Schitt's Creek) and working out from home, as well as learning to make Chinese dumplings. He's also been making English-language teaching videos for his students. Hey <a href=""https://twitter.com/danjlevy?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">@danjlevy</a> I wanted to let you know that as a Canadian living in Wuhan China during the <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/Coronavirus?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#Coronavirus</a> my gf and I have loved watching <a href=""https://twitter.com/SchittsCreek?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">@SchittsCreek</a> .

In the beginning it was the most scary, but once people stopped moving and people stayed home and more tests came out, the information made things less scary,"" Henshaw said. ""Honestly, if it wasn't for the World Health Organization, I would not be nearly as informed or feeling nearly as confident."" He urged Londoners to listen to Middlesex-London Health Unit Medical Officer of Health Dr. Chris Mackie. ""I've been following the news and hearing the simple advice, of staying home right now, and washing your hands, staying away from crowds. It's simple things, but it's a change of lifestyle, but it makes a really big difference."" Wuhan is slowly starting to scale back restrictions placed on its residents, as cases numbers of COVID-19 in the city have been dropping. The Chinese government is staggering the return of cities that can return back to normal. ""With fewer cases being reported here in China, and there's a wave of hope,"" he said. "

""Once this is hopefully moved on and been rectified or settles down, then we'll revisit those travel plans.""Chris Busch, assistant vice-president of enrolment management at the University of Windsor, said his institution has put in place a similar freeze on trips to China. According to Busch, recruitment trips, as well as reciprocal exchange programs where UWindsor students study abroad in China have been paused or rescheduled ""until the coronavirus outbreak has been addressed to our satisfaction.""The university's decision to pause trips to China was made earlier this week, and the decision was made at the same time for each group of travellers. Busch said a lot of UWindsor faculty made the decision themselves ""that they did not want to travel and, therefore, we're very supportive of that.""Any costs associated with postponing the trips will be taken on by the university, Busch added. The university has already issued a statement on its website informing students about the coronavirus. Additionally, Busch said, students can seek support through student health counselling and wellness services, as well as through the My Student Support Program (MySSP).""It's available live, it's in simplified Chinese and other languages too,"" Busch said. Though China is one of the largest sources of incoming foreign students, Busch said the number of people who go to China is low. ""I would say the number would be somewhere between 30 and 40 per semester,"" he said. Windsor Regional Hospital has tested a handful of people for coronavirus. There are currently no confirmed coronavirus cases in Windsor-Essex region. The latest figures published by the World Health Organization (WHO) have approximately 31,480 confirmed coronavirus cases across 24 countries. Approximately 31,000 confirmed cases are in China, where 637 people have died to date. One person has died of coronavirus outside of China. According to Health Canada, there are still three confirmed cases in Ontario and two confirmed cases in B.C.

"South China Sea dispute to get Hague court ruling soon, to China's chagrin | CBC News","An international court said it would deliver a hotly anticipated ruling in the Philippines' case against China over the South China Sea on July 12, drawing an immediate rebuke from Beijing, which rejects the tribunal's jurisdiction.",2016-06-30T04:23:33.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/south-china-sea-court-ruling-1.3659328,"An international court said it would deliver a hotly anticipated ruling in the Philippines' case against China over the South China Sea on July 12, drawing an immediate rebuke from Beijing, which rejects the tribunal's jurisdiction.The United States, which is a close ally of the Philippines and is concerned about China's expansive South China Sea claims, reiterated its backing for The Hague-based Permanent Court of Arbitration and urged a peaceful resolution of the dispute.Manila is contesting China's historical claim to about 90 per cent of the South China Sea, one of the world's busiest shipping lanes. Several Southeast Asian states have overlapping claims in the sea and the dispute has sparked concerns of a military confrontation that could disrupt global trade.In a lengthy statement, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Hong Lei said Manila's unilateral approach flouted international law.""I again stress that the arbitration court has no jurisdiction in the case and on the relevant matter, and should not hold hearings or make a ruling,"" he said.He said: ""On the issue of territory and disputes over maritime delineation, China does not accept any dispute resolution from a third party and does not accept any dispute resolution forced on China.""In Manila, presidential communications secretary Herminio Coloma Jr said the Philippines ""expects a just and fair ruling that will promote peace and stability in the region.""U.S. state department spokeswoman Anna Richey-Allen reiterated U.S. backing for the court. ""We support the peaceful resolution of disputes in the South China Sea, including the use of international legal mechanisms such as arbitration,"" she said.China's official Xinhua news agency said the court was a ""law-abusing tribunal"" that had ""widely contested jurisdiction."" It said the case would only worsen the dispute.""Manila fails to see that such an arbitration will only stir up more trouble in the South China Sea, which doesn't serve the interests of the concerned parties in the least,"" it said.China's bases its South China Sea claim on a so-called ""Nine Dash line"" stretching deep into the maritime heart of southeast Asia and covering hundreds of disputed islands and reefs, rich fishing grounds and oil and gas deposits.A ruling against Beijing ""would deprive China of any legal basis for making such a claim,"" Paul Reichler, the Philippines' chief lawyer in the case told Reuters.For China to reject the ruling meant it had ""essentially declared themselves an outlaw state"" that did not respect the rule of law, Reichler said.The Philippines argues that China's claim violates the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea and restricts its rights to exploit resources and fishing areas within its exclusive economic zone. While the territorial dispute over the South China Sea was a key issue, priority would be given to crushing Islamist militants in the Philippines, Manila's new defence minister Delfin Lorenzana told Reuters.Lorenzana's comments about his priorities will add to uncertainty about incoming Philippines president Rodrigo Duterte position on the dispute. Duterte has said he would confront Beijing but also said he would engage through dialogue. U.S. officials are worried China may respond to what is widely expected to be a negative ruling for Beijing by declaring an air defense identification zone in the South China Sea, as it did in the East China Sea in 2013, and by stepping up its building and fortification of artificial islands.U.S. officials say that beyond diplomatic pressure, the U.S. response to such moves could include accelerated ""freedom-of-navigation"" patrols by U.S. warships and overflights by U.S. aircraft as well as increased defense aid to southeast Asian countries.China has accused the United States of ""hyping"" the issue and warned in May that international complaints about its actions in the South China Sea would snap back on its critics. But it has largely avoided specific comments on how it might respond to the arbitration ruling.Tensions have spread ahead of the ruling, with Indonesia's president ordering an expansion of offshore oil exploration and commercial fishing in waters near the Natuna Islands, where Indonesian navy vessels and Chinese fishermen recently clashed."
China sentences Canadian to death for drug operation | CBC News,"A court in southern China has handed down sentences to at least six foreigners involved in a global methamphetamine operation, including a Canadian sentenced to death.",2019-04-30T11:02:41.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/china-sentences-canadian-death-drugs-1.5116336,"A court in southern China has handed down sentences to at least six foreigners involved in a global methamphetamine operation, including a Canadian given the death penalty.The Jiangmen Intermediate People's Court on Tuesday sentenced 11 people, including an American and four Mexicans, who produced more than 63 kilograms of the illegal drug. The Canadian was identified as Fan Wei, but it was unclear whether that's a legal name.A person identified as Wu Ziping was also sentenced to death; the court did not give Wu's nationality.Fan and Wu were the only two to receive the death penalty, according to CNN.The sentence is likely to further strain relations between Canada and China. Canada arrested a Chinese tech executive last December at the request of the U.S., and since then China has detained two Canadians and delayed some Canadian exports in apparent retaliation.Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland condemned the penalty.""We're very concerned by this sentence,"" she said Tuesday morning. ""Canada stands firmly opposed to the use of the death penalty everywhere around the world. We think that this is a cruel and inhumane punishment which should not be used in any country.""We are obviously particularly concerned when it is applied to Canadians.""According to the court, Fan and Wu conspired to manufacture and sell the drugs in 2012, and brought the others — described as ""drug-making technicians"" — on board. Between July and November of that year, the court says, the group set up a ""den"" in Guangdong's Taishan city, where they produced and sold more than 63 kilograms of methamphetamine and 365.9 grams of dimethyl amphetamine.A court employee reached by phone declined to give further details.Global Affairs Canada said Canadian officials have been following the case and providing consular assistance to Fan and his family since he was first detained in 2012. Canadian officials also attended the April 30, 2019 verdict and sentencing.""We call on China to grant clemency for Mr. Fan,"" said spokesperson Guillaume Bérubé.""It is of extreme concern to our government that China has chosen to apply the death penalty, a cruel and inhumane punishment.""GAC is providing no further details, citing privacy issues.In a separate drug-smuggling case, China sentenced Canadian Robert Lloyd Schellenberg to death in a sudden retrial in January — one month after Canadians Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor were detained on vague national security allegations. The moves were widely seen as punishment for Canada's arrest of Meng Wanzhou, chief financial officer of the Chinese telecom company Huawei.Freeland did not say Tuesday whether she believes the latest death sentence is in retaliation for the arrest of Meng.China has also suspended the licence of two major Canadian canola exporters, alleging officials discovered hazardous organisms in canola seed shipments."

""It's forced us to refocus our marketing efforts.""And this is not the first time events in China have impacted attendance. Howden said a diplomatic dispute between Canada and China over the arrest of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou in Vancouver also caused people from China to cancel trips to the festival last year.But Howden wants to build up tourism in the community, which is primarily dependent on the oil and gas industry and is not giving up. He said it's been a rocky road marketing to China and Hong Kong for the last two years but hopefully those efforts will pay off in the long run.""When a community relies solely on one industry, it is subject to ups and downs,"" he said.""The tourism and the beauty we have in the North is also something that can help create a baseline and help create a balance, so when other things go up and down hopefully, it doesn't happen all at the same time,"" added Howden.In the meantime, Howden and the festival team have shifted their marketing focus this year to Europe and the United States. And there has already been proven success attracting guests from south of the border.Howden said last year there were two visitors from Texas who went home and told their friends about the festival.

China shrugs off criticism over Canadian's death sentence | CBC News,"China says it's ""not worried in the slightest"" by mounting international concern over the death sentence handed to Canadian Robert Schellenberg for drug smuggling.",2019-01-16T12:23:31.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/china-international-criticism-death-sentence-canadian-1.4980001,"China said on Wednesday it's ""not worried in the slightest"" by mounting international concern over the death sentence handed to a Canadian for drug smuggling.Monday's sentence for Robert Schellenberg for smuggling 222 kilograms of methamphetamines prompted Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to accuse China of ""arbitrarily"" applying the death penalty.The United Nations said it was opposed to the death penalty apart from exceptional circumstances, and Australia's acting foreign affairs minister, Simon Birmingham, said he was ""deeply concerned"" by the case.Speaking at a daily news briefing in Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said Canada's ""so-called allies could be counted on 10 fingers"" and that they do not represent ""the entire international community.""""I can very clearly state that we are not worried in the slightest,"" Hua said of the mounting outcry, adding that a majority of Chinese supported severe punishment for drug crimes.Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland dismissed the remark saying Canada is getting far more support from its allies than perhaps the Chinese regime is prepared to admit. ""The EU alone, which has issued a statement, is a union of 28 countries and we're very pleased to have the support from the EU which is a great partner and ally,"" Freeland told reporters in Saint-Hyacinthe, Que. ""It is of course on the basis of friendship with Canada, but more than that, it is on the basis of a much broader recognition of the principle that we are speaking out about that we are getting such strong support from our allies,"" she added. CBC NewsFreeland added that she had spoken with U.S. Secretary of State Michael Pompeo on Tuesday and had not only received support from him on that call, but was pleased to see that support was made public in a statement earlier today. The statement said Freeland and Pompeo ""expressed their concerns about the arbitrary detentions and politically motivated sentencing of Canadian nationals.""Freeland attributed her allies support to efforts being made by Trudeau who she said ""has been energetically reaching out to our allies and explaining that the arbitrary detentions of Canadians are not just about Canada, they represent a way of behaving which is a threat to all countries.'Schellenberg's sentence has further strained relations between China and Canada, already aggravated by the December arrest in Vancouver of Meng Wanzhou, chief financial officer of Huawei Technologies, on a U.S. extradition request as part of an investigation into suspected violations of U.S. trade sanctions.Days after Meng's arrest in Vancouver, China detained two Canadians on suspicion of endangering state security.China has not linked any of the three Canadians' cases to Meng's arrest, but has warned of severe consequences if she was not immediately released.The Global Times, a state-run tabloid with a nationalistic bent, said China ""cannot be weak at this time.""""Canada does not have any special cards that can allow Chinese law to bow its head to it,"" the newspaper said in an editorial on Wednesday. It also said Canada's protests would have no effect.CBC NewsFreeland said Tuesday that Ottawa had formally applied for clemency for Schellenberg, as it usually does for citizens condemned to death abroad.When asked if China typically listened to this type of request, Hua said the judiciary was not subject to ""interference from administrative organs.""""You ask whether China is willing to listen to the Canadian side's request, but I don't know if Canada's leaders or politicians have seriously listened to China's solemn position.""We have very clearly outlined the case's facts and its seriousness,"" she added.Schellenberg had appealed a 15-year prison sentence issued in November, but the court in Liaoning province sided with prosecutors who argued at a retrial that the punishment was too light.A lawyer for Schellenberg, Zhang Dongshuo, said his client would appeal."
"Bookings from China down 70%, says B.C. tourism organization | CBC News",Canada's tourism industry is bracing for the impact of the novel coronavirus on the number of foreign visitors this summer travel season.,2020-03-04T20:27:56.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/bookings-from-china-down-70-bc-tourism-coronavirus-covid-19-1.5485493,"Canada's tourism industry is bracing for the impact of the novel coronavirus on the number of foreign visitors this summer travel season.Some people in the industry are already seeing a change in the number of people coming from overseas, particularly from China — the second-largest long-haul market for Canada-bound tourists, and where the virus outbreak began.""Bookings are down from China by about 70 per cent between March and October, so that's obviously quite considerable,'' said Maya Lange, the vice-president of global marketing with Destination B.C., a Crown corporation focused on attracting visitors to the province.Several airlines have restricted the number of flights to the country, and some people have had difficulties getting visas due to temporary closures at some application centres.Several Canadian tourism marketing agencies have pulled all their ad money from China and are using it to double down on efforts to attract people from other markets like the United States and United Kingdom.According to Statistics Canada, there were 571,000 tourist arrivals from China in 2019.""In the past, in any one of our markets, when exceptional circumstances have occurred, we have taken similar actions to ensure our tourism marketing efforts are impactful,'' said Tess Messmer, a spokesperson for Destination Canada, a Crown corporation focused on marketing Canada abroad.The corporation said China remains an important market and it will still work with online travel agencies and travel media there.Tourism Ottawa has also pulled its ad dollars out of China, but said it hopes to maintain a relationship with Chinese tour providers and other contacts.""We know that this will end at some point and we want to continue the relationship, we don't want to abandon the gains that we've made in any markets,'' said spokesperson Jantine Van Kregten.Chinese travellers, while heavily sought after by the Canadian tourism industry, still make up a relatively small portion of Canada's annual visitors, Lange said.She was expected to give a presentation to members of B.C.'s tourism industry Wednesday, with a focus on what to expect if the novel coronavirus continues to spread globally.She said during the SARS outbreak in 2003, tourists from within Canada and the U.S. still vacationed.""So, we do think those markets will continue to travel, obviously if Canada continues as a safe destination,'' she said.There are hopes within the industry, too, that the tourism shortfall will be offset by Canadians travelling within Canada.Michael Ballingall with Big White Ski resort said the resort is seeing cancellations from Italy and Spain.""But the magic is, we're starting to see bookings from Ontario for Ontario spring break,"" he added.The virus has spread from China to more than 70 countries. Canada is still considered a safe place to visit, with a low risk of transmission of the virus.So far, 33 cases of the virus have been confirmed domestically, with 20 in Ontario, 12 in B.C. and one in Quebec. All of them have been linked to people who have recently returned from abroad and their close contacts.Premier John Horgan told travellers at a news conference Wednesday that the province is safe.""British Columbia is relatively free of incidents or cases,"" said Horgan. ""So I think people should be comfortable that they can participate in the community.""Health Minister Patty Hajdu said the federal government is preparing for a large influx of international travellers during the upcoming tourist season, but was not specific about those plans.Federal and provincial health authorities in Ontario and B.C. have so far not issued special instructions about large gatherings like events and festivals, calling it ""business as usual.""""If there's a need to change that, it will be a conversation with the federal government, provincial government, and something we'll look at locally based on the risk of the infection and the benefits of maintaining societal functioning,"" said Dr. Vera Etches, Ottawa's top local public health official.Still, health authorities warn the situation in Canada and abroad has been changing rapidly and everyone needs to be ready to adjust.""For event planners, I would say you need to do a risk assessment on an ongoing basis,'' Dr. Bonnie Henry, B.C.'s provincial health officer."

Interpol president reported missing during trip to China | CBC News,"Meng Hongwei, Interpol's president, boarded a plane and arrived in China, according to a French judicial official. But then, nothing. His wife, who put out a call on Friday, said she hasn't heard from her 64-year-old husband since the end of September, the official said.",2018-10-05T23:38:55.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/interpol-president-missing-1.4853196,"He left his home in Lyon, France, for a visit to his homeland, and then vanished — putting the International Criminal Police Organization, best known as Interpol, at the centre of its own missing persons case.Meng Hongwei, Interpol's president, boarded a plane and arrived in China, according to a French judicial official. But then, nothing. His wife, who put out a call on Friday, said she hasn't heard from her 64-year-old husband since the end of September, the official said.To make matters murkier, Meng is not just the head of Interpol: He's also a vice-minister for public safety in China.Interpol, based in Lyon, would say only that reports that its president is missing is ""a matter for the relevant authorities in both France and China.""France launched its own investigation on Friday morning, according to a judicial official who wasn't authorized to speak publicly and asked for anonymity.Whether China was taking action was unknown. But the South China Morning Post, a Hong Kong newspaper, hinted that Meng may have been the latest target of an ongoing campaign against corruption in China.The newspaper said that upon landing last week Meng was ""taken away"" for questioning by what it said were ""discipline authorities."" The term usually describes investigators in the ruling Communist Party who probe graft and political disloyalty. The Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, the party's secretive internal investigation agency, had no announcements on its website about Meng and could not be reached for comment.Meng is the first from his country to serve as Interpol's president, a post that is largely symbolic but powerful in status and not without political weight. But because Interpol's secretary general is responsible for the day-to-day running of the police agency's operations, Meng's absence may have little operational effect.Far from being a Hollywood-style agency with agents toting weapons across the globe, Interpol is low-profile and discreet about its cases, unless it wants to talk.The organization links up police officials of its 192 member states, who can use Interpol to disseminate their search for a fugitive or a missing person. Only at the behest of a country does the information go public via a ""red notice,"" the closest thing to an international arrest warrant. ""Yellow notices"" are issued for missing persons.But Interpol walks a fine line between its noble mission — facilitating international police co-operation — and the politics and policies of some of its member countries.Meng's appointment as president in 2016 — amid Chinese leader Xi Jinping's sweeping anti-corruption drive — alarmed some human rights organizations, fearful it would embolden China to strike out at dissidents and refugees abroad.Such actions would be contrary to Interpol's mission statement: ""Action is taken within the limits of existing laws in different countries and in the spirit of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights."" It adds that ""intervention or activities of a political, military, religious or racial character"" are prohibited.Meng has a shiny curriculum vitae, having held down various positions within China's security establishment, including as a vice-minister of public security — the national police force — since 2004. In the meantime, he served as head and deputy head of branches of the coast guard, all while holding positions at Interpol. His term in Lyon runs until 2020.His duties in China would have put him in close proximity to former leaders, some who had fallen afoul of Xi's campaign. He likely dealt extensively with former security chief Zhou Yongkang, now serving a life sentence for corruption.Xi has placed a premium on getting officials and businesspeople accused of fraud and corruption to return from abroad, making Meng's position even more sensitive.The anti-corruption drive recently drew headlines after the disappearance three months ago of X-Men star Fan Bingbing, one of the country's best-known actresses.Watch: Movie star Fan Bingbing's disappearance raises questionsThe NationalHer whereabouts remain unknown. But on Thursday, Chinese tax authorities spoke publicly about her disappearance, ordering her and companies she represents to pay taxes and penalties totalling $130 million US. Fan is being fined around $70 million personally for tax evasion. Still out of the public eye, she issued a statement apologizing for her actions.China, in the midst of a week-long holiday, offered no comment on Meng's disappearance.In France, there were only questions.The French are ""obviously aware of the disappearance but know nothing more at this stage,"" said one diplomatic official, unauthorized to comment publicly on the matter and speaking only on condition of anonymity."

The novel coronavirus has spread widely throughout China, even though Chinese New Year celebrations were cancelled and the government has promoted hand-washing, wearing medical masks and seeking immediate medical attention.Earlier this month, the World Health Organization announced a chronic shortage of gowns, masks, gloves and other personal protective equipment in every region, but especially China. The WHO is working to distribute the equipment to those who need it, and health-care workers are the first priority.Although the hospital the masks are going to isn't in Wuhan, the epicentre of the epidemic, it's still in need, Ducas said.""It's at least 500 kilometres away, but that doesn't stop a virus,"" he said.""This is a relatively large hospital. There's lots of people in and out of there. This is a potential hazard to the health-care workers and to the patients. There are Chinese health-care workers that have gotten this infection and have died.""Friesen knows first-hand how important personal protective equipment is. She was a nurse in a Winnipeg intensive care unit when serious respiratory illnesses SARS and H1N1 were on the minds of Manitobans and claiming lives around the world.""I can understand how important it is to get these supplies in the hands of the people that need it, like, right now,"" she said.""I can't even imagine what it would be like to be doing that and not have enough supplies to protect yourself.… That would just be horrendous.""The boxes of masks are at a UPS store in Winnipeg, waiting to be shipped out, as Ducas sorts out the customs rules with his colleagues in China.The masks likely would be thrown away if it wasn't for Not Just Tourists.""These are supplies that would have been thrown in a landfill here and instead, they're now going to be repurposed for something really important,"" Friesen said."

But China has pledged to buy $32 billion worth of American agricultural products over the next two years, including lobster and other seafood products.Rahaman says the Chinese government has the clout to compel its companies to switch back to lobster from the United States.He calls it ""pseudo-capitalism.""""They have private corporations who are heavily indebted to state-owned banks and, through that channel, China can actually direct trade and commerce,"" he said.""I understand there is a lot of skepticism on whether they will actually follow through on the promises they have made.

Coronavirus deaths surpass 400 in China as new hospital for infected opens | CBC News,The number of deaths in China from the rapidly spreading coronavirus surpassed 400 on Monday as the central government sent medical workers to a newly built hospital and further restricted people's movement in sweeping new steps to contain the illness.,2020-02-03T10:59:26.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/china-coronavirus-wuhan-health-1.5449626,"The latest: The number of deaths in China from the rapidly spreading coronavirus surpassed 400 on Monday as the central government sent medical workers to a newly built hospital and further restricted people's movement in sweeping new steps to contain the illness.China's National Health Commission said the number of deaths in the country rose to 425 as of the end of Monday, up by 64 from the previous day. Of the new deaths, all were in central Hubei province, the epicentre of the virus outbreak. In the provincial capital of Wuhan, 48 people died.Across China, there were 3,235 new confirmed infections on Monday, bringing the total number so far to 20,438.Meanwhile, Hong Kong reported its first coronavirus death Tuesday, according to local news broadcaster TVB, the second fatality outside mainland China.The 39-year-old male had previously been reported by local authorities as having an underlying illness. Hong Kong has had 15 confirmed cases including one that was transmitted locally. With Wuhan and some other Chinese cities in virtual lockdown, travel severely restricted, and China facing increasing international isolation, fears of wider economic disruption are growing.Earlier Monday, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported the number of confirmed cases outside China had reached 153. WHO said the number of cases will keep growing because tests are pending on thousands of suspected cases.Reopening of schools was also delayed to keep the virus from spreading further in Hubei, where the 1,000-bed hospital in the provincial capital Wuhan was completed in just 10 days. A second hospital with 1,500 beds will open within days. Restrictions were tightened still further in one city by allowing only one family member to venture out to buy supplies every other day.Separately, a Chinese woman suspected of spreading the virus asymptomatically while in Germany for a business meeting on Jan. 20, was determined, in fact, to be exhibiting symptoms. The German government's public health agency wrote to the New England Journal of Medicine, which first falsely reported the case on Thursday, to correct the mistake. The report had stoked fears that the outbreak could be much harder to control if people could spread the virus before they appeared sick. Medical teams from the People's Liberation Army were arriving in Wuhan to relieve overwhelmed health workers and to work at the new hospital, located in the countryside far from the city centre. Its prefabricated wards, where patients began arriving by late morning, are equipped with state-of-the-art medical equipment and ventilation systems.Leading Chinese epidemiologist Zhong Nanshan said additional hospital space was crucial to stopping the spread of new infections.""The lack of hospital rooms forced sick people to return home, which is extremely dangerous. So having additional [beds] available is a great improvement,"" Zhong told state broadcaster CCTV.Zhong played a major role in overcoming China's 2002-2003 outbreak of SARS, a coronavirus from the same family as the current pathogen.WATCH | What we actually know about the coronavirus:CBC NewsIn a sign of the economic toll of the outbreak, China's Shanghai Composite index plunged 8.7 per cent when it reopened Monday following the Lunar New Year holiday. It steadied later on the central bank's moves to inject cash.""We are fully confident in and capable of minimizing the epidemic's impact on economy,"" Lian Weiliang, deputy chief of the National Development and Reform Commission, said at a news conference in Beijing.Meanwhile, health ministers from the Group of Seven (G7), which includes Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the U.K., the U.S., and the EU, agreed to co-ordinate their response to dealing with coronavirus on Monday, the German health ministry said.The ministers agreed to co-ordinate their approach on travel regulations and precautions, research into the new virus and co-operation with WHO and China.""An appropriate response to the virus can only be co-ordinated internationally and at European level. Because a virus knows neither borders nor nationalities,"" German Health Minister Jens Spahn said in a statement.Canada's public health agency says there have been four confirmed coronavirus cases here — three in Ontario and one in B.C. The overall risk to Canadians from the disease is low, the Public Health Agency of Canada says. The first two confirmed cases were reported in Toronto after a couple returned from a trip to China that officials said included travel to the Wuhan area. One patient was treated in hospital and then released. The other was in self-isolation in their home.The next case was confirmed in B.C., and the most recent case was in London, Ont. Both of these patients had travelled to the Wuhan area in China.In Canada, efforts continued Monday to get Canadians who want to leave out of the affected area.Ottawa is currently working with China to arrange flights out of Wuhan for more than 300 Canadians. It's not yet clear when the flight will happen, but Foreign Affairs Minister François-Philippe Champagne said planning is well underway and a second plane will be available if needed.Canada's Health Minister Patty Hajdu said Monday there's no indication that any of the Canadians who have asked for help getting out of Wuhan have the coronavirus. Hajdu also noted that officials don't expect that anybody with symptoms of the virus would be allowed by Chinese authorities to get on the flight.Even without signs of the virus, Canadians who are on the flight out of Wuhan will be quarantined at a military base for two weeks to prevent the spread of the virus, Global Affairs Canada said over the weekend.Brazil will join Canada and a number of other nations by repatriating their citizens from Wuhan, said Brazilian Health Minister Luiz Henrique Mandetta on Monday, adding the country will declare a national health emergency later in the week. On Monday, the CDC confirmed that there had been a second case of person-to-person transfer of the coronavirus. The first such case in the U.S. had been reported last week. The U.S. said Sunday that Americans who had travelled in China within the last 14 days would be routed to designated airports for enhanced health screenings and most non-Americans who recently were in China would be denied entry.Carrie Lam announced Monday that Hong Kong will shut almost all land and sea border control points to the mainland from midnight to stem the spread of the virus. She said only two border checkpoints — at Shenzhen Bay and the bridge to Macao and Zhuhai — will remain open.Lam denied that the move was due to pressure from medical workers. Some hospital workers went on strike Monday and more threatened to walk out on Tuesday unless the government agrees to talks.Hong Kong has recorded 15 cases of the virus and has cut flights and train and bus connections to the mainland, but a push is growing for it to close the border completely.Strike organizers say about 6,000 medical staff were prepared to participate. Hong Kong was severely impacted by the SARS outbreak, which many believe was intensified by official Chinese secrecy and obfuscation.This, on same day Beijing denounces foreign governments (esp US) who have moved to close borders to travelers from China, calling the moves ‘unnecessary’ and ‘excessive’.

The U.S., Japan, Singapore, Indonesia, New Zealand and Australia have imposed similar restrictions despite criticism from China and WHO's guidance that such measures were unnecessary.WATCH | Hospital workers in Hong Kong press for stronger border controls amid outbreak:WorldOn Monday, China accused the U.S. of spreading fear by pulling its nationals out of Wuhan and restricting travel instead of offering significant aid.Washington has ""unceasingly manufactured and spread panic,"" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told reporters, noting that the WHO had advised against trade and travel curbs.""It is precisely developed countries like the United States with strong epidemic prevention capabilities and facilities that have taken the lead in imposing excessive restrictions contrary to WHO recommendations,"" she added.About 150 cases have been reported in two dozen other countries. The Philippine Health Department said a 44-year-old Chinese man from Wuhan died from the virus and his companion remained hospitalized. Vietnam's confirmed cases increased to eight, including a Vietnamese American man who had a two-hour layover in Wuhan on his way from the U.S. to Ho Chi Minh City.Amid accusations of a slow official response to the outbreak, six officials in the city of Huanggang, next to Wuhan in Hubei province, were fired over ""poor performance"" in handling the outbreak, the official Xinhua News Agency reported. It cited the mayor as saying the city's ""capabilities to treat the patients remained inadequate and there is a severe shortage in medical supplies such as protective suits and medical masks.""The trading and manufacturing centre of Wenzhou, with nearly 10 million people in coastal Zhejiang province, confined people to their homes, allowing only one family member to venture out every other day to buy necessary supplies.

The statement also said the patients are in stable condition and their close contacts have been placed under medical observation.The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission said in a statement that 136 new cases of coronavirus had been discovered in the city on Saturday and Sunday.As of late Sunday, 198 cases in total had been reported in Wuhan, including three deaths. Some 170 people were still being treated in the hospital, while 25 had been cured, it said.The statement gave no further details of the latest death toll.Outside China, two cases have been reported in Thailand and one in Japan, all involving people from Wuhan or who recently visited the city. South Korea on Monday reported its first confirmed case, a 35-year-old  female Chinese national who had travelled from Wuhan.Beijing said on Sunday it will increase efforts to contain the coronavirus outbreak, while health authorities around the world are working to prevent its spread.Chinese President Xi Jinping said on Monday the country would curb the spread of the outbreak, state television reported.""People's lives and health should be given top priority and the spread of the outbreak should be resolutely curbed,"" it quoted Xi as saying.Bundled up in winter clothes as they head home for the Lunar New Year holiday amid a health scare over the mysterious new virus, Chinese travellers on the teeming concourse of Beijing West station were evenly split between the masked and the barefaced.Covering up was clearly the best decision for many of the passengers waiting to board the packed train carriages for the five hour journey to Wuhan, the epicentre of an outbreak that has sent shivers through the world's most populous country.Going back to her hometown, 28-year-old Tan Jie has been ribbed at work about the danger of contracting the new coronavirus, but the blue surgical mask on her face shows she is taking the risk seriously.""My Beijing colleagues joked and said 'when you come back to work, we'll have to quarantine you for two weeks,'"" Tan said, trying to make light of the dampener the scare has put on the most important holiday for Chinese families.Liao Guang and her husband are looking forward to being reunited with their two-year-old child in Yichang, a city in the same province as Wuhan, and rushed to buy masks before travelling, as alarm spread on social media after the number of confirmed cases tripled over the weekend. ""All the trending items were about this pneumonia outbreak, so I thought we should buy a mask and take some kind of a preventative measure,"" said Liao, a 26-year-old, trailing a wheelie bag.""I think during this [holiday], we're not going to go out too much, and probably won't go to places with a lot of people, like the movie theatre.""In response to an outbreak in China caused by a novel (new) <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/coronavirus?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#coronavirus</a>, <a href=""https://twitter.com/CDCgov?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">@CDCgov</a> will begin health screenings of travelers arriving from <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/Wuhan?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#Wuhan</a>, China at SFO. <a href=""https://t.co/UhQlPGuwGD"">https://t.co/UhQlPGuwGD</a> <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/novelcoronavirus?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#novelcoronavirus</a> <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/2019nCoV?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#2019nCoV</a> <a href=""https://t.co/N1opzql4nf"">https://t.co/N1opzql4nf</a>The virus belongs in the same family of coronaviruses as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which killed nearly 800 people globally during a 2002/03 outbreak that also started in China.

Who's the Canadian leading WHO's coronavirus investigation in China? | CBC News,A renowned Canadian doctor and emergencies specialist is leading a team of international experts investigating the coronavirus outbreak on the ground in China.,2020-02-12T09:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/coronavirus-china-who-bruce-aylward-1.5459615,"A renowned Canadian doctor and top emergencies official is leading an international team of experts for the World Health Organization investigating the coronavirus outbreak on the ground in China.The front-line team was formed after WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus secured an agreement with Chinese President Xi Jinping in late January allowing them entry into the country to conduct the investigation.""A lot of people are asking, 'Where is the outbreak going? Is it getting better? Is it getting worse?'"" Ghebreyesus said at a media briefing Monday. ""An advanced team of WHO experts has just arrived in China, led by Dr. Bruce Aylward, to lay the groundwork for the larger international team.""I’ve just been at the airport seeing off members of an advance team for the <a href=""https://twitter.com/WHO?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">@WHO</a>-led <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/2019nCoV?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#2019nCoV</a> international expert mission to <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/China?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#China</a>, led by Dr Bruce Aylward, veteran of past public health emergencies.Tedros said Aylward will be working with between 10 and 15 colleagues, who have yet to be named, and their Chinese counterparts to get the ""right expertise on the team to answer the right questions"" about the outbreak.Limited information has been provided publicly about the team's mission or where specifically it will be operating — and it has taken them two weeks to get into China at a critical time during the outbreak. A native of St. John's, N.L., Aylward joined WHO in 1992 after completing his medical training at Memorial University, the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine and the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health.CBC News was unable to reach Aylward for an interview, but a spokesperson for WHO said they would provide more information about the mission as it becomes available.""Bruce has always been adventuresome. He chose a career that was cutting edge in terms of world health,"" said Dr. Ian Bowmer, the president of the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada and a former Memorial University professor who Aylward credited for his interest in infectious diseases. ""I think he's incredibly well positioned to take the lead for the World Health Organization.""Aylward is highly experienced in infectious disease control, having led WHO's response to the Ebola outbreak in West Africa and mass immunization programs throughout Asia, and has been instrumental in the ongoing efforts to eradicate polio worldwide.In 1998, he headed up WHO's collaboration with the Global Polio Eradication Initiative, a public-private partnership with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.""He was essentially the person who led the initiative related to the eradication of polio for WHO,"" said former Ontario Chief Medical of Health Dr. Arlene King. ""He's very familiar with the landscape in China and some of the sensitivities that he will need to navigate in order to be ... successful there."" With more than 50 million people in quarantine near the epicentre of the outbreak in the central Chinese province of Hubei, Aylward is entering a ""complex and difficult situation"" but he is a ""trusted voice,"" said senior WHO adviser Dr. Chris Maher.""China has really pulled out all the stops in trying to respond to [the outbreak], so it's not an easy situation to be operating in,"" Maher said. ""But I think this is right up Bruce's alley, it's the sort of thing that he enjoys and does well, so he's a good choice to go in.""From 2014 to 2016, Aylward helped develop WHO's Health Emergencies Programme and directed more than 2,000 people in WHO's on-the-ground response to the Ebola outbreak in West Africa.Aylward also led WHO's response to the Zika virus outbreak in Latin America and Caribbean nations in 2016, declaring a global public health emergency and investigating the link between the virus and microcephaly.""He has had to deal with governments at the highest levels in all regions of the world, and all of those experiences have to be very important for him in China,"" said former U.S. ambassador John Lange, the UN Foundation Senior Fellow for Global Health Diplomacy.""It's hard to imagine that there are many people in the world with such varied experiences directly relevant to the kind of work that he's doing."" Aylward's career is not without criticism, however. He faced backlash for WHO's handling of the effort to fight the Ebola epidemic in 2014. An investigation by the Associated Press in 2015 found a string of avoidable errors badly undermined the work of international aid workers, including a lack of resources, expired supplies and a delay in declaring an international emergency.Aylward, who was then WHO's top Ebola official, said it was common for Ebola treatment centres to be caught up in political wrangling. ""Undoubtedly in some cases there was bureaucracy,"" he said at the time, adding it was wrong to lay the blame at WHO's door. ""These were government decisions at the end of the day.""But a quicker and more effective response to the epidemic from WHO would have resulted in far fewer deaths, said Dr. Irwin Redlener, director of the National Center for Disaster Preparedness at Columbia University in New York, at the time. ""I personally would have no confidence that the same team at WHO would be able to handle the next international outbreak,"" Redlener told the Associated Press. ""We've already seen what the old leadership at WHO has been able to do, so I don't know why we would expect them to be able to right themselves."""

He added that there are several potential causes of viral pneumonia, many of which are more common than SARS.Chinese municipal health officials in Wuhan said in a statement on their website on Friday that they had ruled out common respiratory diseases, such as influenza, bird flu and adenovirus infection, as the cause.Eleven of those infected were in critical condition and the rest stable, they said, adding that all had been isolated and doctors were observing 121 people with whom they had been in close contact.Clean-up efforts at a seafood market where some victims were vendors have been completed, the city officials said, adding that no obvious human-to-human transmission had been seen and no medical staff had been infected.On Friday, Singapore's health ministry said it would begin temperature screening on passengers arriving on flights from Wuhan.In 2003, Chinese officials covered up a SARS outbreak for weeks before a growing death toll and rumours forced the government to reveal the epidemic, apologize and vow full candour regarding future outbreaks.The disease, which emerged in southern China late in 2002, spread rapidly to other cities and countries in 2003. More than 8,000 people were infected and 775 died.Wuhan police this week said they had summoned eight people who ""posted and forwarded false information online, causing adverse social impact."""

The Snohomish County resident is in his 30s and was in good condition Tuesday at a hospital in Everett, outside Seattle. He's not considered a threat to medical staff or the public, health officials told reporters on a conference call.""This is certainly not a moment of panic or high anxiety,"" Gov. Jay Inslee said later at a news conference.Officials are now tracing the man's movements and contacts in China and the U.S. He has told health officials he did not visit any of the markets in Wuhan that are implicated in the outbreak and did not know anyone who was sick. ""We are still in the early days of this investigation, both domestically and abroad,"" Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, told the conference call.The man did not have symptoms when he arrived at Seattle-Tacoma airport last Wednesday, but contacted health officials on Sunday when he began to feel ill, officials said. Samples were sent to the CDC overnight Sunday, and the man's diagnosis was confirmed on Monday.""The risk to the public is very low,"" Messonnier said.The CDC later said it will add Atlanta's international airport and Chicago O'Hare to the list of three airports already screening for the illness — New York's Kennedy International, Los Angeles and San Francisco. What's more, officials also will begin forcing all passengers from Wuhan to go to one of those five airports if they wish to enter the U.S.The agency also said it expects more U.S. cases of the coronavirus. More than 1,200 travellers have been screened so far, and none has been referred for testing.The CDC had previously said it has developed a test to diagnose the new coronavirus that it plans to share with domestic and international partners.The virus, which can cause coughing, fever, difficulty breathing and pneumonia, has infected 440 people in 13 Chinese provinces, according to China's National Health Commission Wednesday morning.The death toll from the outbreak has risen to nine.Separately, China's eastern Zhejiang provincial health authority said a total of five cases of the new coronavirus were confirmed as of noon Tuesday local time. Chongqing city also confirmed five cases of infection, the city's health authority said on Tuesday.As the death toll from the mysterious flu-like virus in China climbed and new cases surged, authorities fretted about the added risk from millions of Chinese travelling for the Lunar New Year holiday. The World Health Organization (WHO) warned Tuesday that the new coronavirus was likely to spread.""More cases should be expected in other parts of China and possibly other countries in the coming days,"" said WHO spokesperson Tarik Jasarevic.WATCH:  Hong Kong scientists warn about containing coronavirus promptlyWorldBased on current information, an animal seems to be the most likely primary source of the outbreak. Jasarevic said.""Reports suggest that infection can cause mild to severe disease and be fatal in some. Based on current data, some new cases seem to experience milder diseases which is within the milder end of the spectrum of symptoms caused by respiratory illnesses.""The WHO tweeted that it will hold an emergency committee on Wednesday to determine whether the outbreak constitutes a public health emergency of international concern and what recommendations should be made to manage it.So far in China, the virus has mostly been concentrated in Wuhan city, although isolated cases have also been reported in Shanghai and Beijing. Outside of China, cases have been confirmed in Thailand, South Korea, Japan and now the U.S. Taiwan, the self-ruled island that China claims as its own, also confirmed its first case, a woman who had returned from working in Wuhan, on Tuesday.Taiwan, which has close economic and people-to-people links with China despite political tensions, on Monday set up an epidemic response command centre to co-ordinate the island's response to the virus. More than 1,000 beds were prepared in isolation wards in case the virus spreads further.Countries in Asia and around the globe have begun body temperature checks at airports, railway stations and along highways in hopes of catching people carrying the virus.The measures are part of a widening effort aimed at preventing a repeat of the 2002-2003 outbreak of SARS, another coronavirus that started in China and killed nearly 800 people, paralyzed transport and damaged Asian economies. In Canada, 44 people died, many of them health-care workers.China's often secretive Communist government was blamed for making SARS far worse by initially hiding information and blocking the work of WHO.This time, China's leader Xi Jinping has led calls for tough measures, ordering that ""party committees, governments and relevant departments at all levels should put people's lives and health first.""At the airport in Wuhan, the temperatures of departing passengers were being checked. Virtually anyone in a public role, from traffic policemen to bank tellers, along with many riding public transport have donned protective masks.Dr. Theresa Tam, Canada's chief public health officer, told reporters Monday that there are no reported cases in Canada and the agency is not aware of any cases involving Canadians overseas.""We are certainly preparing for the potential of a first case in Canada,"" says <a href=""https://twitter.com/CPHO_Canada?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">@CPHO_Canada</a> Dr. Tam, as the deadly coronovirus outbreak in China continues to spread. She says it's ""not surprising"" the U.S. has detected a case, given the heightened alerts to local health systems. <a href=""https://t.co/TCIuQApWD3"">pic.twitter.com/TCIuQApWD3</a>There were three travellers from Wuhan who were investigated and ruled out over the last week, Tam said. She would not say where in Canada they were screened.Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) told CBC News on Sunday that ""the overall risk of disease spread to Canada is considered low."" Canada has no direct flights from Wuhan, and the volume of travellers arriving indirectly from Wuhan is low, PHAC said.CBC NewsPHAC said it will be ""implementing additional measures"" in the coming week, including warning signs in English, French and simplified Chinese at airports in Toronto, Vancouver and Montreal. On the kiosks where people fill in questions, they'll be asked if they've been in an area affected by the outbreak within the past 14 days.  A spokesperson for the Vancouver Airport Authority said Tuesday the new measures have not yet been implemented. If an ill passenger is referred for quarantine, their temperature could be taken as part of the assessment.  One case has been detected in Japan, and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has urged officials to step up quarantine checks at airports and other entry points, with many visitors from China expected to arrive during the holidays. The number of Chinese tourists has risen steadily in recent years, with more than nine million visiting last year.Japan will require visitors arriving from Wuhan to fill in health forms, chief cabinet secretary Yoshihide Suga said.WATCH: Coronavirus could spread during Lunar New Year travel rush, WHO warnsCBC NewsJapan confirmed its first patient last week, a man in his 30s who tested positive for the coronavirus after returning from Wuhan.The Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare said it has tracked down 41 people who had contacts with the patient and is monitoring them. It says none has developed pneumonia symptoms.Brendan Murphy, Australia's chief medical officer, said flights from Wuhan are being met by biosecurity staff and by state health officials in New South Wales who are distributing pamphlets in English and Chinese to all passengers describing the symptoms of the disease and asking them to identify themselves if they have any.Australian health officials said a man was placed in isolation in Brisbane after developing a respiratory illness after traveling to Wuhan but has now recovered.Russian airports have stepped up screening of travelers arriving from China too, airport officials said on Tuesday.At least four Russian airports - Sheremetyevo and Vnukovo in Moscow, as well as airports in Yekaterinburg and Irkutsk - have introduced screening measures to try to identify infected passengers, Russian airport officials said.The virus was a threat to Russia, deputy health minister Sergei Kraevoi was cited as saying by the RIA news agency.Russia's consumer health regulator, Rospotrebnadzor, advised Russian tourists who planned to go to China to refrain from visiting Wuhan and to steer clear of zoos and of markets selling animals and seafood.The regulator said it could not rule out the possibility of the infection spreading to Russia, but evaluated the risk of a widespread outbreak in Russia as low, the Interfax news agency reported.It was also cited as saying that a testing system to diagnose the new coronavirus had been developed in Russia and that laboratories would start receiving it by the end of the week.Regional authorities have already been briefed on measures they need to take to reduce the risks of an epidemic. More than 1.5 million Chinese citizens visit Russia each year, according to Rospotrebnadzor."

How China built two hospitals in two weeks to combat the coronavirus | CBC Radio,"In less than two weeks, construction workers in Wuhan, China, built two new hospitals from the ground up. Architecture critic Anne Quito explains how they did it.",2020-02-07T22:11:28.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/radio/day6/oscar-villains-lynn-beyak-coronavirus-hospitals-weinstein-s-lawyer-the-creator-of-comic-sans-and-more-1.5454398/how-china-built-two-hospitals-in-two-weeks-to-combat-the-coronavirus-1.5454409,"Two new hospitals have been purpose-built in Wuhan, China to treat the novel coronavirus in a remarkable feat of well-choreographed engineering.""A ballet of bulldozers and excavators,"" said architecture critic Anne Quito.Huoshenshan Hospital and Leishenshan Hospital only began construction at the end of January. Built from scratch using pre-fabricated rooms, each facility features 1,000 or more beds. Both hospitals were built in less than two weeks. They are intended to alleviate stress on the region's healthcare system. More than 31,000 cases have been confirmed in China, and over 600 have died.Quito, who writes for Quartz, told Day 6 host Brent Bambury how Chinese officials were able to complete the buildings in a matter of days and what the facility will look like.Here is part of that conversation.It's one thing to think about building a warehouse in two weeks, but a hospital is another thing entirely. How long does it usually take to build a hospital?A hospital, by U.S. standards, usually takes five to seven years — and that's a conservative estimate and not quite at this scale.As you know, there are many, many steps to making a building; and much less a highly technical building like a hospital with so much technology. One architect described a hospital as kind of like a machine.WATCH: Timelapse video Huoshenshan Hospital's construction from CGTNNow that the buildings are complete and they're accepting patients, if you or I walked into one of these facilities in Wuhan, what would we notice? How would it compare to a modern hospital? We would notice that the complex would be made from prefab blocks or squares. It's two levels, and the architecture — or the design — would just be for treating one singular disease. So airflow would be very carefully figured out — [the] air ducts, that's the prominent feature because that's what they're trying to solve for. It's an airborne disease, so it's really just like long, long, wide corridors with quarantines and people in suits. So it looks serviceable; it doesn't look ramshackle at all. There [are] TVs, there's air conditioning. There are two patients per room. There's a box where nurses leave food and there's an ultraviolet light that sanitizes food ... so there's no direct contact. As you mentioned, a hospital isn't just a box — isn't just a cabin — but a really technical building.So it really is one program to contain and to treat patients of coronavirus. But would you be concerned if you were there, either as a patient or a visitor, that these systems that have been so hastily put in place might be flawed?I sought out a structural engineer who had worked in China extensively, and I wanted to know if it was really, you know, safe. And he assured me engineering and construction there are top notch. Safety is actually their concern. He said that things shifted in the last five to seven years. There's a lot more thinking about safety, of not just the structure but even of the workers. There are 7,000 workers working on site 24/7, and what's fascinating, too, is to watch people in China and elsewhere cheer these workers. They're sort of lionized as heroes.But you're getting this information mostly from state media in China. They're the ones who livestream the production process. And the official tone around this is very nationalistic. It's celebratory. It's showing that China can deal with this kind of an emergency. Should we be skeptical that these facilities are as up-to-grade as the official line suggests?Of course, there must always be room for skepticism. The New York Times actually describes this approach by the Chinese government as ""curated transparency."" They're showing us the building of two hospitals, but maybe leaving out some other things. There's a recent report, I believe by Al Jazeera, that in fact there's a network of other hospitals being built around Wuhan and it's being quietly built, maybe not to alarm people of how fast the disease is spreading. So they've offered us basically two shows and we're watching.The hospitals are modelled after one that was created in Beijing that was built in just a week during the SARS epidemic. That facility served its purpose. Is it still in use?It's been quietly abandoned, apparently.And is that because it was built for one purpose only and it couldn't be repurposed?Yes. The structural engineer I spoke to believes that it was that. I mean, we have this great capacity to build prefab boxes and they're very useful for building skyscrapers quickly and in this case, for building a medical facility quickly. But in that equation, we haven't really been thinking about sustainability and the afterlife of these materials. So I think there's a lesson and there's an opportunity, if not here, then in future hospitals. Right now, they're made with steel and cement and concrete. There are much more sustainable materials out there that we could be considering.These might be temporary, but you reported on a skyscraper built in Hunan and that was built in 19 days. Do you think that China is uniquely positioned to continue building this kind of speed architecture?They are, for many reasons. Labour is cheap. There are very few labour unions. Construction workers actually went on a massive strike last year, but still the labour conditions remain not quite up to par. Also, materials: a lot of materials [that] were used for construction come from China, and it's rather readily available. So they're uniquely positioned. And they have this sort of mindset; this sort of zeal. And the architect I was speaking to also speaks to China's openness to doing things in a new way. There's really sort of an innovation mindset in China that people are saying helped push the field forward.This Q&A has been edited for length and clarity.

Airlift departs Wuhan to repatriate Canadians from China's coronavirus outbreak zone | CBC News,"A chartered aircraft has departed Wuhan, China to bring home Canadians stuck in the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak, according to Global Affairs Canada.",2020-02-06T14:28:16.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/airlift-wuhan-canada-repatriation-1.5453969,"A chartered aircraft has departed Wuhan, China to bring home Canadians stuck in the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak, Global Affairs Canada has confirmed.After the aircraft departed, a government official confirmed there are 176 passengers on board.There were 211 people on the initial manifest for today's flight, which was delayed by one day due to bad weather in Vietnam, where the aircraft was pre-positioning to go on to Wuhan. Of those, 194 had indicated they intended to be at the airport for the flight, including 34 minors and 13 permanent residents.In an interview on CBC News Network's Power & Politics, Health Minister Patty Hajdu said it's possible that some of those 18 who didn't ultimately board may have been prevented from doing so because they were showing signs of illness.""But it could also be that they changed their mind at the last minute,"" she told host Vassy Kapelos.""It's a big decision for people. There might be situations where there is a family member left behind that's in hospital. There might be situations where someone is studying or working. I think we'll have better clarity as the days evolve.""During a news conference Thursday, Foreign Affairs Minister François-Philippe Champagne said the Canadian flight is expected to arrive in Trenton, Ont. in the early hours Friday morning after a stopover in Vancouver.""That was truly a whole of government effort and while we are not there yet, I would like to recognize the hard work of the incredible public servants who made this complex operation happen to help Canadians in need,"" he said.Champagne said a small number of people did not show up for the flight because they changed their minds at the last minute. Between this flight and spots set aside for Canadians on a subsequent American flight, two-thirds of the Canadians who want to come home will be repatriated.A second chartered flight carrying the remaining Canadians will leave Wuhan on Monday, Champagne said.Before boarding the aircraft, passengers must undergo multiple layers of screening by Chinese and Canadian authorities. Anyone who shows symptoms of illness will not be permitted to board.PoliticsNational defence and public health officials will be on board and will take steps to isolate anyone who becomes ill during the flight.About 50 Canadians who couldn't find seats on the charter flight will be allowed to board an American aircraft in Wuhan that is scheduled to leave soon after the Canadian charter departs, Champagne said. Those passengers will land in Vancouver and a government-chartered plane will take them to the Canadian Forces base in Trenton, Ont.The returning passengers from both flights will be under quarantine for 14 days at the base.Hajdu said returning passengers will be assessed daily by medical professionals.""The national microbiology mobile lab will be on site to test any symptomatic travellers and there will be general help provided to all travellers that includes clothing, food, diapers and games,"" she said.Noting that it has been a ""scary"" and ""very stressful"" time for the evacuees, Hajdu said emotional and mental health support services also will be available.Hajdu said on Power & Politics that the decision to quarantine was made to protect public health, noting that about 70 per cent of the cases of the new coronavirus stemmed from Wuhan.""Out of an abundance of caution, this seems like a prudent course for us to take,"" she said.Michael Bryant, executive director of the Canadian Civil Liberties Association, wrote to Justice Minister David Lametti asking that individuals under quarantine be given access to independent legal counsel, recognizing their right to be free from arbitrary detention and to liberty and due process.""It is unrealistic to expect them to arrange for their own lawyers to attend at a hospital or at Trenton, if that were even possible,"" he said. ""The greater likelihood is that they may be denied legal counsel whilst their liberty is affected by quarantine.""Richard Schabas, Ontario's former chief medical officer, said he is skeptical about the practical effect of a quarantine, which he calls an ""ancient"" disease control strategy.""It's a concept that almost has no place in modern public health because it just doesn't work,"" he told CBC News Network. Short of a vaccine, which could take up to a year to develop for the novel coronavirus, case identification and case isolation are the best ways to interrupt the virus, he said, adding that the outcome will depend largely on the strength of the virus.The federal government is advising all Canadians in China to leave the country by commercial means unless it's essential for them to be there. Several airlines have suspended or limited their flights to China.Global Affairs heightened its travel advisories for China after the outbreak, warning against all travel to Hubei province and against all non-essential travel to other parts of China.GAC's website has been updated and now states that, for safety and security reasons, Canadians should ""consider leaving China"" if their ""presence isn't essential.""Champagne repeated that advice again Thursday. ""It's just common sense,"" he said.There are now more than 28,000 reported cases of the novel coronavirus around the world; most of the cases are in China. As of Friday, the death toll in China reached 636, according to the country's National Health Commission.In Canada, there have been five confirmed cases — three in Ontario and two in British Columbia — and public health officials say the risk to Canadians remains low."

Poland charges Huawei manager with spying for China | CBC News,"Poland's counter-espionage agency has charged a Chinese manager at tech giant Huawei in Poland and one of its own former officers with espionage against Poland on behalf of China, Polish state television reported on Friday.",2019-01-11T12:13:16.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/poland-charges-huawei-manager-spying-china-1.4974364,"Poland's counter-espionage agency has charged a Chinese manager at tech giant Huawei in Poland and one of its own former officers with espionage against Poland on behalf of China, Polish state television reported on Friday.The two men were arrested on Tuesday, according to the Internal Security Agency. Polish security agents also searched the offices of Huawei and Orange, Poland's leading communications provider, where the Pole had recently worked, seizing documents and electronic data. The homes of both men were also searched, according to TVP, the state broadcaster.The development comes as a U.S. dispute with China over a ban on Huawei is spilling over to Europe, the company's biggest foreign market, where some countries are also starting to shun its network systems over data security concerns.Some European governments and telecom companies are following the U.S. lead in questioning whether using Huawei for vital infrastructure for mobile networks could leave them exposed to snooping by the Chinese government.Maciej Wasik, deputy head of Poland's special service, said the operation that resulted in the arrest of the two suspects had been underway for a long time and was planned with care.He said ""both carried out espionage activities against Poland.""Polish state TV, which is close to the government, identified the Chinese man as Weijing W., saying he was a director in Poland at Huawei. Also going by the Polish first name Stanislaw, the Chinese man had previously worked at the Chinese Consulate.State TV identified the Pole as Piotr D., and said he was a high-ranking employee at the Internal Security Agency until 2011, where he served as deputy director in the department of information security.TVP said the men have not pleaded guilty and are refusing to give testimony.If convicted, they could face up to 10 years in prison. Under Polish law, their last names cannot be published ahead of trial.Huawei issued a statement from its Chinese headquarters that said it was aware of the situation and looking into it.""We have no comment for the time being. Huawei complies with all applicable laws and regulations in the countries where it operates, and we require every employee to abide by the laws and regulations in the countries where they are based,"" it continued.Geopolitical tensions over Huawei intensified after its chief financial officer, who is the daughter of founder Ren Zhengfei, was arrested Dec. 1 in Canada in connection with U.S. accusations that the company violated restrictions on sales of American technology to Iran.Huawei has been blocked in the U.S. since 2012, when a House intelligence committee report found it was a security risk and recommended that the government and private companies stop buying its network equipment."

Dozens of infections have been confirmed in: Taiwan, Australia, Cambodia, France, Germany, Japan, Malaysia, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Singapore, South Korea, Thailand, Vietnam, the United States and Canada.In Canada, there are three confirmed cases, two in Ontario and one in British Columbia — all linked to recent travel in China.The World Health Organization's emergency committee is set to reconvene behind closed doors in Geneva on Thursday to decide whether the rapid spread of the virus now constitutes a global emergency.""In the last few days the progress of the virus, especially in some countries, especially human-to-human transmission, worries us,"" WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a news conference on Wednesday, naming Germany, Vietnam and Japan.""Although the numbers outside China are still relatively small, they hold the potential for a much larger outbreak.""In a report published Wednesday, Chinese researchers suggested that person-to-person spread among close contacts occurred as early as mid-December.""Considerable efforts"" will be needed to control the spread if this ratio holds up elsewhere, researchers wrote in the report, published in the New England Journal of Medicine.More than half of the cases in which symptoms began before Jan. 1 were tied to a seafood market, but only eight per cent of cases after that have been, researchers found. They reported the average incubation period was five days.Canada's chief public health officer says it will likely take at least a year before a vaccine is developed.Dr. Theresa Tam says government and public health authorities should plan on having to manage the outbreak for some time to come.The United States flew about 200 Americans out of Wuhan Wednesday. They were being screened on arrival in California. A group of 210 Japanese evacuees from Wuhan landed Thursday at Tokyo's Haneda airport on a second government chartered flight, according to the foreign ministry. Reports said nine of those aboard the flight showed signs of cough and fever. France, New Zealand, Australia and other countries are also pulling out their citizens or making plans to do so.WorldCanada, for its part, is still working on its plans to get Canadians out of the affected area but has secured a plane. Foreign Affairs Minister François-Philippe Champagne said Wednesday that 160 Canadians have requested consular services to date.The effects of the virus are already weighing heavily on China's economy, the world's second-biggest, with companies cutting corporate travel and tourists cancelling trips.Various airlines are cutting flights, including British Airways, Lufthansa, American Airlines and Air Canada."

The ceremony will take place at the White House. High level representatives of China will be present. At a later date I will be going to Beijing where talks will begin on Phase Two!However, no version of the text has been made public, and Chinese officials have yet to publicly commit to key planks, such as increasing imports of U.S. goods to $200 billion US, nearly doubling U.S. exports to China.The United States launched a trade war against Beijing a year and half ago over allegations of unfair trade practices, such as theft of U.S. intellectual property and subsidies that unfairly benefit Chinese state-owned companies.The deal was particularly hard on U.S. agricultural producers, who were cut off or severely reduced in their access to the Chinese market.The United States Trade Representative said the Phase 1 deal includes stronger Chinese legal protections for patents, trademarks, copyrights, including improved criminal and civil procedures to combat online infringement, pirated and counterfeit goods.Issues such as industrial subsidies would be addressed in a later deal, U.S. authorities said."

SARS claimed 44 lives in Canada, with people working in healthcare particularly vulnerable. Fears of a SARS recurrence arose this month after a slate of patients were hospitalized with an unexplained viral pneumonia in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province.As of Sunday, 59 people were diagnosed with the condition and have been isolated while they receive treatment, according to the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission. Seven were in critical condition, while the rest were stable.The commission said in a statement that initial investigations have ruled out SARS, as well as Middle East respiratory syndrome, influenza, bird flu and adenovirus.The commission previously said the condition's most common symptom was fever, with shortness of breath and lung infections appearing in a ""small number"" of cases. There were no clear indications of human-to-human transmission.Several patients were working at the South China Seafood City food market in sprawling Wuhan's suburbs. The commission said the market would be suspended and investigated.Hong Kong's Hospital Authority said Sunday that a total of 15 patients in Hong Kong were being treated for symptoms including fever and respiratory infection after recent visits to Wuhan.Hospitals and doctors have been directed to report cases of fever in anyone who has travelled to Wuhan in the past 14 days, Hong Kong's health chief Sophia Chan said Sunday.The hospital authority said it has activated a ""serious response"" level to curb spread of the infection. Chan warned Hong Kong residents against visiting wet markets and eating wild game in mainland China.The World Health Organization said it was closely monitoring the situation and maintaining contact with Chinese authorities. No travel or trade restrictions are necessary at this time, the WHO said."

Travellers at Pearson to be asked about coronavirus amid pneumonia outbreak in China | CBC News,Travellers to Toronto's Pearson International Airport will soon be asked a question about a new coronavirus that has caused a pneumonia outbreak in China.,2020-01-21T01:01:19.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/coronavirus-pearson-airport-toronto-screening-measures-1.5434040,"Travellers to Toronto's Pearson International Airport will soon be asked a question about a new coronavirus that has caused a pneumonia outbreak in China.Dr. Theresa Tam, Canada's chief public health officer, told reporters on Monday that travellers will be asked a screening question at electronic immigration kiosks if they have travelled to areas affected by the coronavirus in the last 14 days and they will be reminded to report flu-like symptoms to border services agents.There will also be messaging on arrival screens about the coronavirus, Tam said.""The Chinese lunar year is coming so out of an abundance of precaution that's why we are putting out additional information for travellers,"" Tam said. Federal public health officers will also post signs about the coronavirus, known as 2019-nCoV, at Vancouver International Airport and Montréal-Trudeau International Airport.According to the official Chinese Xinhua News Agency on Monday, 224 cases of pneumonia caused by the new coronavirus infection have been reported in China. Of that number, 217 have been confirmed. China has reported four deaths.China has confirmed human-to-human transmission in the outbreak, which began at a seafood market in the city of Wuhan in central China. Cases have since been reported in Japan, Thailand and South Korea.The virus belongs in the same family of coronaviruses as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which killed nearly 800 people globally during a 2002-03 outbreak that started in Guangdong, China. In Canada, 44 people died, many of them health-care workers.Symptoms of 2019-nCoV are mainly fever, with a few reports of people having difficulty breathing, and chest x-rays showing signs of pneumonia in both lungs. According to the World Health Organization, signs of infection can include respiratory complaints, fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, SARS, kidney failure and even death. The only way to confirm 2019-nCoV is with a lab test.Canada has has no direct flights from Wuhan, and the number of travellers arriving indirectly from Wuhan is low. The overall risk of disease spread to Canada is considered low, the Public Health Agency of Canada has said in a statement on the weekend.An expert in Toronto, however, says the spread of the coronavirus needs to be closely watched.Dr. Kamran Khan, an infectious disease physician, and founder and CEO of the digital health company BlueDot, said officials do not yet know fully how the coronavirus is spread and no vaccines are available. He said BlueDot, founded six years ago, is working on better ways to detect and respond to infectious disease threats.Khan said airport screening is ""not the most efficient strategy."" Travellers are far more likely to get sick after they leave the airport, he said. The ""real front-lines"" are emergency departments, but education for travellers is still important, he added.""We're in a world today where people can easily jump on a plane and go halfway around the world in a matter of hours,"" Khan said on Monday. ""And we are also just at the precipice of the Lunar New Year, when we're anticipating there will be a mass migration of people and gatherings and congregations where this disease could potentially propagate,""His organization is tracking the spread of the coronavirus to other countries and monitoring the outbreak of pneumonia in China. He said it is no longer about animal-to-human transmission, but instead human-to-human transmission.""SARS had a mortality rate somewhere around 10 percent,"" he said. ""I think it still remains to be seen: Is this as deadly as SARS, or if this going to be is a milder illness?""Khan said the coronavirus has the hallmarks of SARS, including the fact that it spread from markets to people, it has human-to-human transmission, it has infected health workers and there has possibly been what he called a ""super spreading event."" But officials don't yet know how severe it is, he added.""SARS had an important impact here in Toronto,"" he said. ""That was no small event.""According to Tam, Canada has had no confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV. Three people in Canada who travelled to Wuhan were investigated for the virus, but the results came back negative. The World Health Organization (WHO) will hold an emergency meeting on Wednesday to discuss whether the new coronavirus identified in China constitutes an international health emergency."

"Security fears, political tensions souring China's relations with Central Europe | CBC News","A half-decade ago, China planted an economic flag in Central Europe with its multi-billion-dollar Belt and Road plan to build a vast infrastructure network. Five years on, though, some of those countries are finding the relationship increasingly uncomfortable.",2019-11-30T09:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/china-belt-and-road-central-europe-1.5370854,"This story is part of a CBC News series exploring China's expanding influence around the world and how Canada and other countries are contending with China's power.A half-decade ago, China planted an economic flag in Central Europe with its multi-billion-dollar plan to build a vast infrastructure network of roads, railways, pipelines and ports. Just like elsewhere in the world, China touted its Belt and Road Initiative as a deal that would stretch far into the future and bind countries together under Chinese investment and benevolent guidance. Five years on, though, some of those countries are finding the Chinese embrace increasingly uncomfortable. Case in point: early this year, Polish authorities arrested two people suspected of espionage. One of those was Wang Weijing, a Chinese senior manager in Poland for the telecom manufacturer Huawei Technologies. The other man arrested was a Pole, a friend of Wang's who had access to highly sensitive Polish telecommunications work.""I am wrongfully accused,"" Wang said to Reuters in July. ""Not to mention that finding a spy in Huawei is a perfect excuse to kick Huawei out of Poland.""Wrongfully accused or not, Huawei almost immediately said it had fired him. The Poles have held him in prison for 11 months.""The case is unequivocal,"" said Polish President Andrzej Duda in July.That's not good news for Wang or China.The stakes in Poland are major. Huawei has invested more than $1 billion US in the country and has promised to invest hundreds of millions more if it gets a prized 5G contract from the Polish government next year.  But Poland now finds itself at the centre of a power struggle between China and the United States. The U.S. in May effectively banned the purchase of Huawei equipment by U.S. telecoms, arguing that the equipment made the U.S. vulnerable to Chinese spying. It also urged allies to impose similar bans.Duda has gently referred to ""an impasse"" in Poland's relations with China, which could lead to China losing the big 5G contract. The Chinese have hinted quietly that they could move their investments elsewhere if they do.Meanwhile, next door in the Czech Republic, the stakes are lower but the argument is much louder and more public. It revolves around a sister city agreement between Prague and Beijing that collapsed in recriminations and reprisals in October. The Chinese insisted on including in the sister city accord a clause saying both cities endorsed the One China policy, which implicitly recognizes China's sovereignty over Taiwan, as well as Hong Kong and Tibet. The mayor of Prague, Zdenek Hrib, said politics had no place in a sister city agreement and wanted it removed.""Our conscience is not for sale,"" said Michaela Krausová, a leading member of the governing party of the Prague city council.The Chinese refused despite the fact that sister city agreements between Beijing and other Western cities, notably London, Riga and Cologne, contained no such clause.Hrib is a new mayor from the ranks of a new party, the Pirate Party, which was set up to shake up Czech politics. He took office last year and five months later, visited Taiwan. He also flew the Tibetan flag over Prague city hall. The Chinese were not amused. Matters were not improved when the Czech cybersecurity watchdog warned against using Huawei equipment, saying it posed security threats.Hrib's symbolic actions infuriated the Chinese government. In the spring of 2019 it abruptly cancelled a tour of China by the Prague Philharmonic Orchestra.""Prague's inappropriate behaviour is the fundamental reason that the city's leaders are not welcome by the Chinese people,"" said Geng Shuang, the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman.Other cultural tours were also cancelled. In October, the Prague city council definitively rejected the sister city accord, and the Chinese Embassy talked openly of reprisals.The Czech foreign minister, Tomas Petricek, responded angrily: ""Diplomacy is not conducted with threats."" Hrib went further.""China would do better to concentrate on its previous promises of investment,"" he said. ""They weren't fulfilled. Refusing the Prague Philharmonic tour after the contract was signed shows that China is not a reliable economic partner.""That was a direct slap in the face of the Chinese. It was also aimed at Czech President Milos Zeman. Over four years, he had carved out a very China-friendly policy, much to the annoyance of the European Union. The Pirate insurgency threatens it. ""It's very easy to create unfriendly relations,"" Zeman told the Chinese ambassador in September. ""The mayor of Prague has little experience in such affairs, but I must say the Chinese response was excessive.""Zeman had invited massive Chinese investment and in the beginning got it. According to the Czech National Bank, there were Chinese investments of more than $1.3 billion in 2015-2016.  But these have been reversed. In the last two years, almost $800 million has been withdrawn.One of the reasons is that the head of the big investment company pouring the money in, Ye Jianming, has been detained for corruption by the Chinese. His company has imploded. This is particularly embarrassing to Zeman because he had made Ye an economic adviser, a high-profile if symbolic role.Zeman said in October that one of the investments that did materialize, a major stake in Prague's biggest professional soccer team, has been sold off as part of the Chinese reprisals. To add to the confusion, the team itself doesn't seem to know about this.Chinese reprisals might lead to a large drop in the number of Chinese tourists to Prague. Last year, 650,000 people from China visited the city. Czech sinologist Olga Lomova professed herself unconcerned in an interview with Czech radio in October.""We have too many tourists already. I don't think it would be a loss.""The Chinese have hardly given up on their overtures to central and southern Europe. Instead, they hint they could move their Polish investment to Hungary, run by the hard-right Prime Minister Viktor Orban. The Hungarian government would be delighted. It's already the largest recipient in Central Europe of Chinese investment with more than $5 billion, and in 2017 signed a strategic partnership agreement with China.Within days of the arrest of Wang in Poland, Gergely Gulyas, a senior Hungarian minister attached to the prime minister's office, announced: ""The Hungarian government sees no security risk"" in Huawei technology. In other words, bring it on.And the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, continues to do the rounds, most recently in Italy and Greece, promising enticing new investments and stirring up old quarrels by suggesting the Elgin marbles — priceless sculptures from the Parthenon now in the British Museum —  belong in Athens.And in Brussels, the EU does little but wring its hands.

"Canada is waking up to China's quest for a 'new world order', says Japanese observer | CBC News","One of Japan’s top academics says China is trying to create its own new world order and leading Western democracies, including Canada, have begun to look at their relationship with the rising superpower through that lens.",2020-02-16T09:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/china-totalitarianism-xi-jinping-canada-japan-1.5465067,"One of Japan's top academics says China is trying to create its own new world order — and leading Western democracies, Canada included, have started to look at their relationship with the rising superpower through that lens.For the last several years, Junya Nishino's research has been focused on his country's relationship with South and North Korea. North Korean leader Kim Jong-un's outbursts gave him plenty to work on.But it has been hard for the demure, precise professor of political science to ignore an increasingly assertive Beijing, its provocative actions and the amount of time and political energy being expended by Japan's leaders on the China relationship.While acknowledging China is an ""indispensable"" economic power for his country and Western nations, Nishino said the policy of engagement based solely on trade and business interests has failed.""We have to keep in mind that China is a very different regime,"" he told CBC News in a recent interview. ""China is not a democratic country. China is an authoritarian system. So we always need to pay close attention.""Since the 1990s, Western countries — with Canada in the vanguard — have pursued a policy of helping Beijing build up an affluent middle class through liberalized trade and investment, in the long-term hope that it would lead to a more democratic country.Over the last several years, however, it has become apparent, in a variety of ways, that the Chinese leadership has no interest in moving in that direction.China's President Xi Jinping, with the full support of his party, rewrote the country's constitution in March 2018 and scrapped term limits, essentially allowing him to stay in office for life.The surprise move came as Beijing pressed claims over the South China Sea, built up its military and launched a global infrastructure plan known as the Belt and Road Initiative.The country also drastically enhanced domestic security and enforced ideological purity standards in schools and the media.At the same conference that extended his grip on power, Xi told Chinese lawmakers and political advisers that his country's brand of authoritarian capitalism is a ""new type of political party system"" that would benefit the rest of the world.""From the Japanese perspective, clearly, China is trying to create its own new order, not only in East Asia, but the world,"" said Nishino.A year ago, writing in the Qiushi Journal, the Chinese Communist Party's (CCP) main theoretical magazine, Xi insisted that his country ""must never copy the models or practices of other countries.""Western-style separation of powers — the bedrock of democratic institutions — held no appeal for China, Xi wrote, arguing that the party must remain supreme.""We must never follow the path of Western 'constitutionalism,' 'separation of powers' or 'judicial independence,''' Xi wrote.Those sentiments made Nishino and other China-watchers sit up and take notice.""We and China have very different values and we need to keep this in mind,"" said Nishino, who has been speaking to Canadian officials and audiences over the past week.After an initial flurry of interest among Europeans in the Belt and Road Initiative, he said, there now seems to be a wariness among Western countries — and they'd do well to avoid the plan.During President Barack Obama's second term, the U.S. recognized that China had changed and began to take a harder line. Such an approach is more difficult for Japan to take because of geography.Relations between Tokyo and Beijing run hot and cold, thanks in large part to tension over eight uninhabited islands — little more than hunks of rock — in the East China Sea.Both countries lay claim to the islands, which are known as the Diaoyu islands in China and as the Senkaku islands in Japan.But China remains Japan's most important trading and economic partner and the business communities in both countries have tried to keep a positive and constructive relationship going.The challenge of keeping that constructive relationship alive is more intense in Japan than it is in Canada, but the problems facing both countries are not dissimilar. China is deeply embedded in the supply chains of Western democracies.And there lies the problem shared by Canada and Japan, Nishino said. Japan has been trying to strike a balance between a tough security policy and a healthy trading relationship. The Trump administration can afford to be bellicose and fight a trade war with China. Canada and Japan cannot.Japan has been working hard to find a way to ""co-exist"" with China without being pushed around, Nishino said.What's left unanswered — especially in light of Beijing's hostage diplomacy over Canada's detention and possible extradition of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou — is how difficult co-existence will be going forward."

It's a well-travelled road in the middle of Beijing, normally full of dangerous cars and hurtling buses.On this day, it's a safe stroll to the other side.For almost three weeks, Beijing has been a ghost town, eerily empty from Tiananmen Square to its freeway-like ring roads.People are just starting to trickle back after China's listless Lunar New Year holidays, extended this year to keep them from spreading the coronavirus further through travel and a return to work.""I can feel how serious it is,"" said Jin Yang, on his first day back as a foreign exchange worker. ""I've never experienced anything like it.""Iconic attractions like the Forbidden City are shuttered, subways largely unridden, malls and airports avoided. Schools and universities have been closed indefinitely.At some of the restaurants and stores that are open, masked shopkeepers hand you your purchase at the door to limit contact.Indeed, the entire megacity of more than 20 million people echoes with the epidemic.The virus's epicentre may be a thousand kilometres south in the province of Hubei, where more than 60 million people are locked down by decree, but the nervousness has spread to the capital and engulfed the whole country.With more than a thousand dead and tens of thousands infected in China, Beijingers are hunkered down in their apartments — partly because of new rules about who can come and go, but mostly because of fear.Residents have built improvised barricades out of bamboo sticks, traffic barriers and even bikes piled high and chained together around their compounds. Signs warn strangers away, especially those from the infected city of Wuhan.""I'm upset and worried about the virus,"" said Liu Likun, reached by video chat inside his apartment.He and his wife have locked the door, stocked the fridge and sent their three-year-old son to stay with grandparents in a village outside Beijing.""I miss my son,"" said mother Liu Yingjie, appearing on the video screen next to her husband. ""We talk to him twice a day, worrying about what he eats and does, but he's better off in the countryside.""""Is it safer there? I don't know,"" said Likun. ""These days, there is no absolute safety from the virus in China. But it's the best we can do.""Indeed, daily life everywhere is improvised or suspended. Most office workers do their jobs online or on the phone from home. Many factories and workshops are idle, despite government attempts to keep the economy from stalling completely.There's a lot of spare time. Videos circulating on the internet show families playing catch and ring-toss in cramped living rooms, singing karaoke and building intricate cityscapes out of Lego blocks.""I've been learning how to make dumplings,"" said Zhang Xingang, also by video chat from his apartment. He works in construction and all of his company's projects have been stopped.Those who do venture outside find large red propaganda banners telling them ""you are a piece of garbage if you go out with a mask,"" not to mention roadblocks and health checks at every turn.Officials armed with thermometers look for high fever, the tell-tale sign of infection and a sure trigger for testing and quarantine in today's China, whether or not coronavirus is to blame.In some areas, police officers in hazmat suits have been going door to door, looking for the infected and the suspected. They act on tips from neighbours and then — as online videos have shown — squads arrive to forcefully remove entire families and send them off to quarantine in police vans.Is all of this really necessary?""Probably,"" said Ian Lipkin, an American epidemiologist who has been in Beijing to advise the Chinese government on how to handle the coronavirus epidemic.Mass lockdowns on this scale are unprecedented, he said, and it's unclear if they will work.""We don't have anything else to offer at present,"" Lipkin said. ""This is really the most transmissible virus that I've seen in many, many years.""With no proven medicine or treatment, and a vaccine at least 18 months away according to the World Health Organization, ""isolation"" is the only alternative, Lipkin said.""And unfortunately, I don't think that's going to be voluntary. It's difficult.""WATCH | Workers at an industrial complex in Chongqing make their way through disinfecting mist tunnels:WorldIf the virus spreads more widely around the globe, Lipkin said, countries like Canada and the United States will also have to consider measures such as involuntary quarantine, even if it raises far more complicated questions of personal rights than it does in an authoritarian state like China.Even here, some don't accept the need for heavy-handed lockdowns or even quarantines.Outside an apartment building in Beijing, Zhao Zaixin plays in the snow with his three-year-old daughter. He wears a mask, she doesn't.They're out here every day, he said, because ""it's healthier.""""This virus can't be prevented,"" Zhao said. ""If we are going to get it, we'll get it.

China reduces imports from North Korea | CBC News,"China has reduced its total imports from North Korea by as much as 86 per cent, while exports to the North have dropped by as much as 34 per cent.",2018-04-07T10:37:21.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/china-north-korea-imports-1.4609739,"As the U.S.-North Korea summit looms, President Donald Trump's maximum pressure policy on North Korea may be working — thanks to China.Beijing appears to have gone well beyond UN sanctions on its unruly neighbour, reducing its total imports from North Korea in the first two months this year by 78.5 and 86.1 per cent in value — a decline that began in late 2017, according to the latest trade data from China. Its exports to the North also dropped by 33 per cent to 34 per cent both months.The figures suggest that instead of being sidelined while North Korean leader Kim Jong-un made his surprising diplomatic overtures to Seoul and Washington, China's sustained game of hardball on trade with Pyongyang going back at least five months may have been the decisive factor in forcing Kim's hand.Trade with China is absolutely crucial to North Korea's survival.It accounts for the largest share of the North's dealings with the outside world and provides a lifeline to many of the necessities Pyongyang relies on to keep its nation fed and its economy from breaking down. Estimates vary, but it is believed that roughly half of all transactions in the North Korean economy are made in foreign currencies, with the Chinese yuan being the most common.That gives Beijing tremendous leverage, though for political and national security reasons it has generally been reluctant to exert too much pressure on Pyongyang.That reluctance is clearly wearing thin.The statistics need to be taken with a dose of caution. Neither country is known for its commitment to transparency. Even so, more specific data reveal an even tougher, targeted crackdown, according to Alex Wolf, a senior emerging markets economist with Aberdeen Standard Investments:""While China's role over the past few months has often been overlooked or little understood, it appears a strategy could be emerging: China wants to play a central role in 'resolving' this crisis, but wants to do it on its own terms,"" he wrote. ""It's increasingly clear that Chinese pressure is a driving force and China will play a central role in any future talks.""Kim announced in his New Year's address he would reach out to the South to ease tensions on the Korean Peninsula. He then agreed to hold a summit with South Korean President Moon Jae-in on April 27 and with Trump after that. But to the surprise of many, Kim suddenly showed up in Beijing first for a summit with President Xi Jinping last month, underscoring the continued primacy of China in North Korea's foreign relationships.Lu Chao, director of the Border Study Institute at the Liaoning Academy of Social Sciences, noted that China accounts for almost 80 per cent of the North's total trade, meaning the onus for implementing UN sanctions has been mainly borne by Beijing, whose enforcement has created ""huge pressure on North Korea.""""There is no doubt China is doing more than ever when it comes to sanctions,"" he said, adding restrictions on sales of textile and seafood products to North Korea imposed by China last autumn ""have dealt a huge blow to the country.""""China has played a very important role in promoting the current change of the situation,"" he said.The decrease in trade isn't just about politics.China's economy is also dealing with overproduction in many industries and its demand for North Korean imports is low. Efforts at joint development projects have languished and difficulties suffered by Chinese firms in North Korea — especially problems receiving payment — have soured enthusiasm for cross-border trade.But the deficit presents an obvious dilemma for the Kim regime: the more it depletes its foreign reserves by buying in excess of what it sells, the less money it has to buy anything at all. Normally, that would lead to inflation — and even hyperinflation — as imported necessities become scarcer and people who can afford to do so dump their holdings in the local currency to buy safer U.S. dollars or Chinese yuan.Georgetown University economist William Brown said he believes the North's current account deficit has risen dramatically since the strengthening last November of sanctions on North Korean exports by China, which he said are by now ""certainly biting.""""Why is Kim venturing his offer now? My impression is he is feeling very strong pressure from China's virtual embargo on North Korea's exports, and what he must see as a gradual ratcheting down of needed imports, even petroleum,"" Brown wrote in a recent blog post. ""This is an enormous economic hit of a sort the country has never had to deal with on this scale.""Brown believes an important indicator of the North's economic health will be movement of the unofficial but widely used exchange rate for the North Korean currency, which has been surprisingly stable at around 8,000 to the U.S. dollar for years but should now be under intense inflationary pressure.""China is giving us the chance, and (we should) use it cleverly to get what we want out of the nuclear program and systemic reform,"" he added. ""It's not so impossible if you realize everyone, even young Kim, can benefit.""​"

""We will ignore it at our peril.""His speech also touched on emerging threats in cyber warfare.Many western democracies have not felt threatened in the globalized world of the last three decades — but that era is ending now, said Fadden, and Canadians have to face new sources of risk.""This issue is especially visible in Canada,"" he said. ""We are surrounded by three oceans and the U.S., so we don't really feel threatened when, in a totally globalized world, that is unrealistic."""

Thousands of people, including mainstream political leaders and young people, have also been detained.During a meeting with Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan in Beijing on Wednesday, Xi said that he was watching the situation in Kashmir closely, the official Xinhua News Agency reported.Xi said that the right and wrong of the situation was clear and India and Pakistan should resolve the dispute via peaceful dialog, according to Xinhua.India says its revocation of the special status of Muslim-majority Kashmir, which was accompanied by a crackdown on dissent by the security forces, is an internal matter aimed at developing the Himalayan territory, which is also claimed by Pakistan, more quickly.India will make clear that any change to its Jammu and Kashmir state is an internal affair if the Chinese side were to raise the matter in the forthcoming talks, a government source said.he Himalayan region of Kashmir is divided between India, Pakistan and China. India rules the populous Kashmir Valley and the Hindu-dominated region around Jammu city, while Pakistan controls a wedge of territory in the west, and China holds a thinly populated high-altitude area in the north.China's close security ties with Pakistan have long been a matter of concern in New Delhi and in recent years India has drawn closer to the United States to help balance China's rising weight across the region.""The forthcoming Chennai Informal Summit will provide an opportunity for the two leaders to continue their discussions on overarching issues of bilateral, regional and global importance and to exchange views on deepening India-China Closer Development Partnership,"" the Indian ministry said in a statement.China, which has been criticized by the United States for its treatment of members of Muslim ethnic minorities, said it believed India and Pakistan must refrain from taking unilateral action in Kashmir and has expressed concern over human rights violations there. India has dismissed those concerns.Srikanth Kondapalli, professor of Chinese studies at New Delhi's Jawaharlal Nehru University, said it was important for the nuclear-armed neighbours to stabilize relations as both dealt with domestic and regional issues.""The second informal meeting as such is significant given these ominous signals at bilateral, regional and global levels,"" he said.During Xi's visit, Modi is expected to raise economic issues, including India's $53 billion trade deficit with China in 2018/19, and the smaller presence of Indian companies in China compared with that of other major economies.Xi will also make a state visit to Nepal at the end of his India visit, the first by a Chinese president in 22 years, the Nepali foreign ministry said.China has deepened ties with India's neighbours, building ports and power stations in an arc stretching from Bangladesh to Sri Lanka and Pakistan as part of its grand Belt and Road energy and infrastructure plan."
2-week quarantine for coronavirus patients showing no symptoms could be enacted in China: official | CBC News,"China will start releasing information from Wednesday on coronavirus patients who show no disease symptoms, ordering them into quarantine for 14 days, a health official said, after the mainland witnessed its first rise in infections in five days.",2020-03-31T14:36:45.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/china-coronavirus-reporting-1.5515914,"China will start releasing information from Wednesday on coronavirus patients who show no disease symptoms, ordering them into quarantine for 14 days, a health official said, after the mainland witnessed its first rise in infections in five days.As local infections peter out and new cases surface among travellers returning home, the existence of virus carriers with no symptoms is fuelling public concern that people could be spreading it without knowing they are ill.From April 1, the daily report of the National Health Commission will include details of such cases for the first time, Chang Jile, a commission official, said during a briefing. People in close contact with them face 14 days of medical observation.Asymptomatic patients under observation numbered 1,541 by Monday, with 205 of the cases having come from overseas, the commission said separately.Monday's 48 new infections, and one death, in mainland China were up from 31 the previous day, the commission said, reversing four days of declines. All were imported, taking China's tally of such cases to 771, with no new local infection reported.Many were students returning from overseas. About 35 infected Chinese citizens are still studying abroad, with 11 already cured, education ministry official Liu Jin said.Fearing a second wave of infections sparked by such inbound travellers, China will delay its college entrance exam by a month, until July 7 and 8, China Central Television said. Hubei province, where the virus emerged late last year, and Beijing, the capital, will get more leeway in scheduling it.The annual two-day ""gaokao"" test drew more than 10 million candidates last year, state media have said.The total number of confirmed cases on the mainland stood at 81,518 at the beginning of Tuesday, with 3,305 deaths. China on Tuesday reported just one new death from the coronavirus and 48 new cases, claiming that all new infections came from overseas.Last week, a study in British medical journal the Lancet Public Health recommended that China extend school and workplace closures, since an earlier relaxation of curbs could bring a second peak in the outbreak by August.""China has slowed transmission of the virus and in so doing, has passed one peak in the outbreak,"" said Tarik Jasarevic, a representative of the World Health Organization. ""The challenge now is to prevent a resurgence of new cases.""Meanwhile, tax authorities acknowledged the pandemic's impact on exporters, saying they were studying policies to reduce pressure on businesses, from tax cuts to an extension of preferential policies for foreign firms.New data from a survey of manufacturers showed that factory activity expanded in March from February's collapse as businesses returned to work, but analysts warned that slumping external demand could prevent a durable recovery.""The situation could be very fluid as the virus outbreak remains unpredictable,"" analysts at ANZ bank said in a note. ""Chinese policymakers will likely step up and expand the stimulus program if needed.""The commercial hub of Shanghai saw 11 new imported cases on Monday, mainly among returning Chinese nationals, while Beijing had three.Wuhan, the capital of central Hubei province, reported no new infections for a seventh straight day. Groups of medical teams in brightly coloured jackets took photographs around the city as they prepared to leave.""Thank you, Wuhan. We are back,"" read a message on a building that houses a Levi's clothing store."

Coincidentally, it was the same day the Chinese government formally arrested Canadian citizens Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor and accused them of espionage.Kovrig and Spavor have been detained by Chinese officials since December, not long after Canadian authorities arrested Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer of Huawei, in Vancouver.The premier acknowledged there are difficulties with the China-Canada relationship right now, but he said that can only be fixed through communications.""Not having a conversation solves nothing,"" he told reporters following a cabinet meeting in Halifax.""Walking in and building a connection with each other allows you to have those kind of conversations.""McNeil may have some of the best connections with China of any elected official in Canada and his most recent trip was the first by a Canadian politician since the arrest of Meng.He's been to China seven times since becoming premier in 2013, each time pursuing growth in exports and tourism, and the establishment of a direct flight between Halifax and China.Nova Scotia's exports to China are worth almost $800 million, with seafood — particularly lobster — accounting for much of that. McNeil believes that success is built largely on the relationship he's established with Guangdong province Gov. Ma Xingrui.""We're pretty direct with one another,"" said McNeil. ""I think he appreciates that.""That directness led to conversations about the issues between the two countries.McNeil said the two sides talked about the need for people to feel safe travelling to one another's country, particularly as they try to promote tourism links. Part of the Nova Scotia delegation included art exhibits featuring the work of Maud Lewis and six other Nova Scotia artists.""If I'm coming here and asking Nova Scotians and Canadians to go into Guangdong province as a tourist, I need to be reassured that they can do so and feel free to experience what that province has to offer and, at the same time, be able to come back home when their vacation is over,"" said McNeil.He said his experience travelling to China was no different than any of his previous trips.""I couldn't have been greeted any better, quite frankly. I was greeted by an old friend,"" said McNeil.The premier said he offered to play a role in easing tensions between the two sides if Chinese officials thought that would be helpful, and he'd make the same offer to Ottawa.While there's been no ask at this time, he said China's ambassador to Canada is scheduled to visit Nova Scotia at the end of the month and a cultural and business delegation from Guangdong would also visit later this year, ahead of another trip McNeil plans to China this year.While other parts of Canada have felt the effects of China closing its borders to products such as canola and soybeans, Nova Scotia has so far been immune from such actions. McNeil said it's ultimately up to the Chinese government to make such decisions, but he's hopeful he's made the case during his visits for why no action should be taken against Nova Scotia exports by touting the province's quality control measures.""They understand the importance of the seafood going into that marketplace and it's certainly our hope — and I think it's [Ma's] as well — that that trade continues at the rate and proceeds as it has been.""McNeil's trip also included stops in parts of Europe, where he promoted seafood exports, as well as direct travel links to Halifax. The premier said broadening trade customers leads to sustained high prices, which benefits the industry and its workers here."

Conservatives ask CSIS to investigate ex-ambassador's China comments | CBC News,The Conservative Party is asking Canada's spy agency to investigate whether recent comments by Ottawa's former ambassador to China pose a threat to the upcoming fall election.,2019-07-12T14:14:39.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/china-mccallum-csis-conservatives-1.5209439,"The Conservative Party is asking Canada's spy agency to investigate whether recent comments by Ottawa's former ambassador to China pose a threat to the upcoming fall election.John McCallum, who was fired as ambassador in January amid mounting tensions between Canada and China, said in a recent interview he has warned former contacts in China's Foreign Affairs Ministry that any further ""punishments"" imposed on Canada's exports could trigger a change of government that would be unfavourable to Beijing.""Anything that is more negative against Canada will help the Conservatives, [who] are much less friendly to China than the Liberals,"" McCallum was reported as telling the South China Morning Post. The story was published Wednesday.In a letter to Canadian Security Intelligence Service director David Vigneault, Conservative Party deputy leader Lisa Raitt and its public safety critic Pierre Paul-Hus ask CSIS to investigate whether McCallum's ""disturbing"" comments pose a threat to the security of Canada.""This advice was partisan in nature and encouraged the government of China to take specific actions in order to influence Canada's democratic process,"" they write.""This is highly inappropriate, for a myriad of reasons, not the least of which is the fact the Government of China continues to arbitrarily detain two Canadians, Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, and has taken other hostile actions towards Canada.""The party told Radio-Canada the letter was sent today.A spokesperson for CSIS confirmed it had received the letter.""As you can expect, we do not publicly comment or confirm or deny the specifics of our investigations,"" said John Townsend.The letter also asks that McCallum's activities be included as part of the regular briefings to the critical election incident protocol panel — the new team set up to sound the alarm if it sees evidence the October federal election is being undermined.""Canadians expect that the upcoming election will be conducted in a free and fair manner, and that any and all incidents of foreign interference will be fully investigated, with action taken to prevent said interference,"" wrote Raitt and Paul-Hus.""We believe Mr. McCallum's actions, as confirmed by his own public statements, deserve the utmost scrutiny of your agency.""McCallum's interview comes after China suspended imports of Canadian canola, pork and beef following the arrest of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou in Vancouver in December at the behest of American officials.""This problem will pass,"" McCallum was quoted as saying in the article. ""It's important for Canadian business people not just to come to China but to come often … especially when the going is tough.""McCallum was fired from his ambassadorial post after suggesting publicly that Meng, daughter of the founder of the Chinese telecom giant, had a strong case to fight extradition to the U.S.CBC NewsHe also said any deal to spare Meng from prosecution in the U.S. should include the release of Kovrig and Spavor.Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland also took exception to her former cabinet colleague's comments while speaking to reporters at an event in London on Thursday.""Mr. McCallum does not speak in the name of the Canadian government,"" she said.""I think it is inappropriate for any Canadian to be advising any foreign government in ways it ought or ought not to behave to secure any particular election outcome in Canada.""When asked about the letter during a stop in Edmonton today, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau pointed to Freeland's comments the night before.""The foreign minister addressed yesterday the comments by Mr. McCallum,"" Trudeau said.""We will be unflinching about that in our communications both public and private as a government, because that is the path to both defending Canada's interests and defending the Canadians that are unjustly held."""

She accused them of ""intimidation"" and ""harassment.""Tempers flared and tensions ran high as the two sides tried to drown out each other with shouts of  ""One China"" and ""Hong Kong belongs to China"" coming from the pro-China group.Shouts of ""no violence"" came from the other side.""We have got the police permit to launch a peaceful march, however, before we could go out to start a march, we noticed that there's a very well-orchestrated counter-rally here by the pro-China camp,"" Fung told CBC News.Members of the Toronto Police Service had to separate the two sides more than once.The protests in Hong Kong, which have been ongoing since June, were sparked by a proposed extradition law.""This extradition bill, if enacted, is going to allow China to arbitrarily arrest anybody who is working, travelling, living or even in transit via Hong Kong,"" Fung, told CBC News at an earlier march in June."

Even the Peking papers haven't written much about Pierre Elliott Trudeau's meeting with Chinese Premier Zhao Ziyang. The two world power figures discuss nuclear disarmament over ornamental pots of Chinese tea. This is not Prime Minister Trudeau's first visit to China. Trudeau travelled there in October 1973 after the Canadian government officially recognized the communist country, opening diplomatic relations between the two nations. He had been continuing the initiative started by his successor Liberal Senate Leader Paul Martin of recognizing communist states, something Western powers have avoided since the beginning of the Cold War. Over tea Ziyang welcomes the spirit behind Trudeau's peace initiative, part of a larger mission where he'll visit various world leaders attempting to ease tensions between the superpowers and their allies over the next year. But when the meeting continues at a banquet dinner, the Chinese premier becomes more skeptical. The Chinese worry about missiles sitting along the Soviet Border. In this news report, Trudeau explains why the Chinese premier won't budge on foreign policy.

Lessons from quarantine: Saint Johner in China says 'there's light at the end of tunnel' | CBC News,"Samantha Dean, who was born in New Brunswick, was in her third year living and working in China when strict government measures meant only one person per household can leave the house, and only to get groceries.",2020-03-22T11:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/china-quarantine-coronavirus-saint-john-covid-19-1.5505102,"For six weeks, Samantha Dean didn't set foot outside. She was quarantined alongside her partner in Chongqing, China, a municipality bordering the Hubei province, where the novel coronavirus first started infecting people.Dean, who was born in New Brunswick, was in her third year living and working in China when strict government measures meant only one person per household could leave, and only to get groceries.People in masks checked temperatures at shop and apartment building entrances. For two months, Dean said, life was pretty tough.But the Saint John native said she's seeing the ""light at the end of the tunnel"" this week. Her favourite restaurant reopened for takeout, and she took her first leisurely walk outside just a few days ago.As COVID-19 case numbers drop in China, they're rising in many other countries around the world, including Canada. New Brunswick has 17 presumptive and confirmed cases, and the nationwide death toll has reached 13.Dean made a video to share lessons from quarantine with people back home. In her experience, it got worse, then it got better.""People are functioning on, like, two extremes,"" she said in an interview by Skype. ""Either they're over–panicking and hoarding supplies or they're not panicking at all and they think it's no big deal."" ""You need to find a happy middle.""Dean said she's been getting questions from family, friends, people she hasn't seen since middle school and complete strangers. Most of them are wondering what's coming for Canada, since China had already gone through the worst of it.So she made a YouTube video urging people to not take this virus lightly.""I just felt I should reach out again and give some positivity that things are getting better here,"" she said. ""But also, like, that's up to everybody to get there, right.""She said the biggest lesson she has learned is the importance of social distancing. She said China made quarantine mandatory right away, which is not something Canada would do as easily in a democracy.That's why it's important for each person to make sure they're fulfilling their social responsibility to follow the rules, she said, such as not gathering in large numbers and not hoarding food and supplies.""Like everybody says, you flatten the curve, you'll slow the spread. So our hospitals don't get overwhelmed. So medical workers don't end up sick.""""Be mentally prepared for the fact that it's going to get worse. You're going to see reports of, unfortunately, people passing away,"" she said. ""But just remember that there is a light at the end of the tunnel.""Dean said she lives in a gated community, where a ticket system was used. Everybody was required to stay inside, and the ticket would allow people to leave the compound on certain dates to get groceries.""Only one person per family could leave on these certain dates to get supplies. But mostly we were encouraged to use delivery systems to order our groceries.""Dean said the first first few weeks were the toughest.""It did cause a lot of panic attacks. I had a lot of anxiety, a lot of sleepless nights.""She and her partner had to come to an agreement, as a couple, about how seriously they were going to take the outbreak. It was ""exhausting mentally,"" she said. And she doesn't doubt this is what a lot of people are going through in her hometown now.But slowly, life during a pandemic came to feel normal. She stopped obsessing over the news of new deaths every day, because that caused her a lot of anxiety.Being prepared helped.""Prepare for a month, maybe two weeks to a month of stuff if you can. Freeze some veggies, freeze the meat, like that's enough, but you don't need to buy six packs of toilet paper.""She said quarantine was ""totally worth it.""Dean went for a walk without using the ticket system for the first time the other day, she said.She saw children playing and women dancing in the park.""It's been great. A bit emotional actually."" Something she didn't think she'd miss so much, is getting a cup of coffee at a cafe. She still can't sit in a dine-in area, but she did grab one to go.""I learned to appreciate the little things,"" she said."
China warns of retaliation after Trump threatens fresh tariffs | CBC News,"China has warned of retaliation after U.S President Donald Trump vowed to slap a 10 per cent tariff on $300 billion US of Chinese imports, sharply escalating a trade row between the two countries.",2019-08-02T11:48:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/china-retaliate-trump-threatens-fresh-tariffs-1.5234224,"China on Friday said it would not be blackmailed and warned of retaliation after U.S. President Donald Trump vowed to slap a 10 per cent tariff on $300 billion US of Chinese imports from next month, sharply escalating a trade row between the world's biggest economies.Trump on Thursday stunned financial markets by saying he plans to levy the additional duties from Sept. 1, marking an abrupt end to a truce in a year-long trade war that has slowed global growth and disrupted supply chains.Beijing would not give an inch under pressure from Washington, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said.""If America does pass these tariffs then China will have to take the necessary countermeasures to protect the country's core and fundamental interests,"" Hua told a news briefing in Beijing.""We won't accept any maximum pressure, intimidation or blackmail. On the major issues of principle we won't give an inch,"" she said, adding that China hoped the U.S. would ""give up its illusions"" and return to the right track of negotiations based on mutual respect and equality.Trump also threatened to further raise tariffs if Chinese President Xi Jinping fails to move more quickly to strike a trade deal.The newly proposed wave of duties would extend Trump's tariffs to nearly all of the Chinese goods that the United States imports.Trump made his threat in a series of Twitter posts after his top trade negotiators briefed him on a lack of progress in U.S.-China talks in Shanghai this week....during the talks the U.S. will start, on September 1st, putting a small additional Tariff of 10% on the remaining 300 Billion Dollars of goods and products coming from China into our Country. This does not include the 250 Billion Dollars already Tariffed at 25%...The president later said if trade discussions fail to progress he could raise tariffs further — even beyond the 25 per cent levy he has already imposed on $250 billion US of imports from China.Senior Chinese diplomat Wang Yi told reporters on the sidelines of an Association of Southeast Nations event in Thailand the additional tariffs were ""not a correct way"" to deal with the bilateral dispute.The news hit U.S. and Asian financial markets hard. Oil prices plummeted seven per cent and retail associations predicted a spike in consumer prices. Asked about the impact on financial markets, Trump told reporters: ""I'm not concerned about that at all.""""President Trump is, in effect, using American families as a hostage in his trade war negotiations,"" said Matt Priest, president of the Footwear Distributors and Retailers of America.Stephen Lamar, executive vice president of the American Apparel & Footwear Association, said his group's members were shocked that Trump had not allowed the resumed U.S.-China trade talks to proceed further before acting.Chinese manufacturers produce 42 per cent of apparel and 69 per cent of footwear purchased in the U.S., Lamar said.Moody's said the new tariffs would weigh on the global economy at a time when growth is already slowing in the U.S., China and the eurozone.Possible retaliatory measures by China could include tariffs, a ban on the export of rare earths and penalties against U.S. companies in China, analysts say.So far, Beijing has refrained from slapping tariffs on U.S. crude oil and big aircraft, after cumulatively imposing additional retaliatory tariffs of up to 25 per cent on about $110 billion US of U.S. goods since the trade war broke out last year.China is also drafting a list of ""unreliable entities"" - foreign firms that have harmed Chinese interests. U.S. delivery giant FedEx is under investigation by China.U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin briefed Trump on their first face-to-face meeting with Chinese officials since Trump met Xi at the G20 summit at the end of June and agreed to a ceasefire in the trade war.""When my people came home, they said, 'We're talking. We have another meeting in early September.' I said, 'That's fine, but until such time as there's a deal, we'll be taxing them,"" Trump told reporters.A source familiar with the matter said Trump grew frustrated and composed the tweets shortly after Lighthizer and Mnuchin told him China made no significant movement on its position.Previous negotiations collapsed in May, when U.S. officials accused China of backing away from earlier commitments."
Liberals block committee probe into claims of inappropriate pressure on ex-China diplomats | CBC News,Liberal members of the House committee on foreign affairs Tuesday shut down opposition parties' attempt to launch an investigation into claims a federal official pressured two former diplomats over their statements on Canada-China relations.,2019-07-30T12:25:02.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/china-comments-committee-1.5229956,"Liberal members of the House committee on foreign affairs Tuesday shut down opposition parties' attempt to launch an investigation into claims a federal official pressured two former diplomats over their statements on Canada-China relations.Opposition parties allege the government tried to muzzle two ex-ambassadors who have been outspoken about Canada's ongoing diplomatic conflict with China. The bid to open an investigation failed after the Liberals, who hold a majority of the committee's seats, defeated the motion in a 5-4 vote Tuesday afternoon.The Globe and Mail reported last week that former Canadian ambassador to China David Mulroney said Paul Thoppil, an official with Global Affairs Canada, instructed him to clear any public comments on Canada's China policy with the department beforehand. The official reportedly cited the ""election environment"" and said he was passing on a request from the Prime Minister's Office.Mulroney told the Globe and Mail Thoppil also cautioned against telling Canadians to suspend non-essential travel to China. The former diplomat said he found the request troubling and claimed the department official implied he should soften his tone.Another former ambassador, Guy Saint-Jacques, also said he had been contacted by Thoppil. But in several recent interviews he said he didn't interpret the government's outreach as an attempt to filter his views.Last week, Conservative and NDP MPs wrote a letter to the committee asking for a summer meeting to talk about the allegation.""We believe it is incumbent on the committee to study these matters and ensure that Canada's non-partisan public service is not being unduly exploited for political purposes,"" they wrote.Ahead of the committee meeting, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told reporters in Vancouver on Monday that his office did not pressure Mulroney to avoid recommending that Canadians avoid non-essential travel to China.Conservative Party Leader Andrew Scheer said Trudeau's comments mirrored ones the prime minister made after the SNC-Lavalin scandal erupted, when the PMO was accused of exerting inappropriate influence over the office of then-attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould.""Justin Trudeau's office stands accused once again of political interference,"" Scheer said. ""Today he borrowed from the SNC playbook.""Conservative committee member MP Leona Alleslev said she was ""not surprised, but disappointed"" when the Liberals voted against an investigation. Alleslev said the opposition hoped to call several witnesses: Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland, Thoppil, Mulroney and St-Jacques.In an interview with CBC's Power and Politics Tuesday, Saint-Jacques said he would have testified before the Foreign Affairs Committee, if called. But he said he didn't know what help his evidence would provide. ""I never felt that they were trying to muzzle me or that they were threatening me,"" Saint-Jacques said. ""I think basically it is another example of miscommunication.""Saint-Jacques also told Power and Politics host Vassy Kapelos that Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland called him last week to assure him personally that the government wasn't trying to silence him.Parliamentary secretary to the minister of foreign affairs Rob Oliphant accused the Conservatives of calling an emergency committee meeting purely to score political points. Oliphant said politicians on all sides should not be playing politics with the lives of the two detained Canadians — entrepreneur Michael Spavor and former diplomat Michael Kovrig — caught up in the diplomatic and trade confrontation between Canada and China.""There are times in politics, there are times in public policy, there are times in Canadian shared life that we let some of that go,"" Oliphant told the committee. ""There should be nothing more on our minds than assuring their safety and considering their well being.""In addition to the lives of the two ""arbitrarily detained"" Canadians, Oliphant called on the members to remember the plight of canola farmers and meat producers whose livelihoods also have been affected by the diplomatic row.Oliphant also echoed a statement from Global Affairs Canada, which said the department's message to the former diplomats ""was not clearly communicated.""""We undertake such engagement in part to ensure informed public discussion of important foreign policy issues so that comments of others such as former diplomats are well informed by current circumstances. The call with Mr. Mulroney was made with this intention,"" wrote Sylvain Leclerc in an email.""We welcome the views and advice of informed Canadians such as Mr. Mulroney on these complex issues and regret that this message was not clearly communicated.  There was no intention, nor was there any instruction from anyone, including the PMO, that Mr. Mulroney clear his public comments with the government.""The Liberal government tried to distance itself earlier this summer after former cabinet minister John McCallum, who was fired as ambassador to China in January amid mounting tensions between Canada and China, said he had warned former contacts in China's Foreign Affairs Ministry that any further ""punishments"" imposed on Canada's exports could trigger a change of government that would be unfavourable to Beijing.""Anything that is more negative against Canada will help the Conservatives, [who] are much less friendly to China than the Liberals,"" McCallum was reported as telling the South China Morning Post.The Conservatives have asked the Canadian Security Intelligence Service to investigate McCallum's statement.Diplomatic and trade relations with China have been deteriorating since Canada began extradition proceedings against Meng Wanzhou, a top executive with the Chinese telecommunications firm Huawei. Wanzhou faces charges in the United States of fraud and violating international sanctions against Iran."

The pastor was listed as Yu's emergency contact.  That first day, Yu spoke to no one about Zhao's death, except members of her church. The next day, she received a call from Global Affairs Canada, and used a friend to interpret. In that conversation, Yu was told that her husband had suffered a ""sudden death,"" she said.Emails between Yu and Global Affairs show that the initial examination of Zhao's body in China concluded he died of a heart attack. Yu alleges that on Jan. 30 she was told by Global Affairs that the ""government is willing to help"" and that Global Affairs Canada and the Canadian embassy in Beijing could represent her in the search for an autopsy report.""I want to know the true reason for David's death,"" she said. But the next day, Jan. 31, she was told such authorization could not be granted. Instead, Yu was told she would either have to authorize a family member in China, or the funeral home where Zhao's remains are being kept, to represent her interests for an autopsy. Initially, she was told that a person would have to meet the Chinese officer handling the case in person.She was also asked by the Chinese police why she wanted to have the autopsy done. The mother of two was told, with Global Affairs acting as intermediary, that if it was simply to find out why Zhao had died, then a nearby forensic centre could do the examination. But if she was specifically trying to find out if he died of COVID-19, then China's Disease Control Centre would handle the case.Yu said her parents, both in their seventies, are unable to travel to Beijing because of travel bans within the country. She said none of her other family in China can travel to the city.""Aijun is under a lot of pressure by the Chinese officer, to ask from her, to cremate the body as soon as possible,"" the interpreter said on Yu's behalf. She said the officer has also contacted Yu's mother and repeatedly asked for authorization to cremate the body. Yu hasn't had any direct contact with any Chinese official, she said, and feels uneasy about talking to authorities without Global Affairs representing her interest. ""She doesn't know what to say or what not to say,"" the interpreter said. In an emailed statement, a spokesperson for Global Affairs Canada said the department ""is aware of the death of a Canadian citizen in China and our thoughts are with the family.""The statement also said ""consular officials are in contact with the relatives of the deceased and are providing consular assistance.""The department wouldn't comment further on the case, citing privacy concerns. ""Canadian consular officials in Beijing, China, remain in contact with local authorities to assist with the request for a post-mortem examination,"" the spokesperson said.Yu describes her husband as a caring, family man. She calls losing him, and the past month of fighting to learn more about his death, her ""darkest hour.""She said she can't stop thinking about him ""lying on a cold place, alone."" She said she was ""devastated.""""There are a lot of things David [was responsible for] doing, like with the family. A lot of things [I] don't even know what to do without David."" Yu said she's lost without her husband, who often helped her with speaking English. She might have to leave Surrey, uncertain if she'll be able to afford it without her husband's income. She said her two children were devastated by the news, but have been comforted by their faith. ""They know their dad went to heaven,"" she said."
China considering halting all meat products from Canada over fake veterinary health certificates | CBC News,"China is considering halting all meat imports from Canada starting Wednesday after the Canadian Food Inspection Agency notified China that it had discovered a number of fabricated veterinary health certificates in meat products bound for China, according to a government official.",2019-06-25T22:20:01.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/china-ban-canadian-meat-1.5189874,"China is considering halting all meat imports from Canada starting Wednesday after the Canadian Food Inspection Agency notified China that it had discovered a number of inauthentic veterinary health certificates in some meat products bound for China, according to a government official.China already has halted imports from three Canadian pork producers over food safety issues — two in May and another earlier this month — as trade tensions between the two countries have escalated.A Canadian government official, who spoke to CBC News on the condition they not be named, confirmed the CFIA notified its Chinese counterparts it had uncovered faked veterinary certificates for some Canadian meat products.In response, the official said, China was considering halting all meat shipments from Canada. The official also said the federal government expects developments to emerge throughout the evening.According to a statement released by China's embassy, a batch of pork from Canada was found to contain residues of ractopamine, a feed additive banned in many countries. Imports of pork from that facility were halted pending an investigation on the Canadian side.""The subsequent investigation revealed that the official veterinary health certificates attached to the batch of pork exported to China were counterfeit and the number of those forgery certificates was up to 188,"" the statement said.The documents, called export certificates by Canadian authorities, include a number and a veterinary's signature.The move comes on the eve of the G20 leaders summit in Japan, which brings together leaders of the leading 20 industrial and developing nations, including Canada, China and the U.S.""The CFIA has taken measures to address this issue and is continuing to work closely with industry partners and Chinese officials,"" said Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food Marie-Claude Bibeau in a statement. ""CFIA is investigating this technical issue and has informed appropriate law enforcement agencies.""This incident is specific to export certificates to China. Export certificates to other countries are not affected.""Bibeau said that her government will back Canadian producers and continue to work to diversify trade to ""ensure farmers have access to new markets.""The Canadian Pork Council said in a statement Tuesday night that the halt in Canadian exports is not the result of a food safety issue but ""the misuse of Canada's reputation as a supplier of safe quality products.""It said the Canadian Pork Council, Canadian Meat Council and Canada Pork International are working with government to identify potential next steps. ""Demand for pork products remains strong in China and Canadian producers look forward to having the opportunity to continue to meet the needs of our Chinese customers."" The Conservatives say Prime Minister Justin Trudeau should personally raise the issue with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the forthcoming G20 summit. ""Conservatives know that Canadian farmers produce some of the highest quality meat in the world. Any assertion by the Chinese government to the contrary is both false and baseless,"" said Conservative agriculture critic Luc Berthold in a statement. ""It is clear that this is not an issue of food safety, but a political issue caused by Justin Trudeau's incompetence and weakness on the world stage.""Canada's former ambassador to China Guy Saint-Jacques told CBC News Network's Power & Politics that the ongoing tussles with Beijing over trade may remain a fixture of relations between the two countries for some time to come. ""I think we have to expect, unfortunately, that this kind of pressure … will continue,"" he told host Vassey Kapelos.  Last week, the Xinhua state news agency said China was halting imports from a Canadian pork producer after food safety issues were detected in one batch of pork.Xinhua said customs authorities in the eastern city of Nanjing found traces of ractopamine in pork products from Frigo Royal. It said China will suspend imports from Frigo Royal and also stop accepting health certificates issued by the company's veterinary officer.Ractopamine is known as a ""muscle drug"" that accelerates pigs' growth. It is banned in China, Russia and EU countries, but has been approved for use in the U.S. and Canada.China said it would open all containers of Canadian meat and meat products and, in some cases, 100 per cent of the contents would be inspected.In May, China halted pork imports from two other Canadian producers — Olymel LP and Drummond Export — because of labelling problems.Relations with China have been fraught ever since Chinese authorities detained Canadians Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor in December. The arrests were widely seen as retaliation for Canada's arrest of technology giant Huawei's chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, in Vancouver on an extradition request from the U.S.She was later granted bail and is now awaiting court proceedings.In March, the ruling Communist Party's Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission accused Kovrig of stealing state secrets passed on to him by Spavor.China cancelled Winnipeg-based agricultural handler Richardson International's registration, effectivity forbidding the company to export canola seed to the country.China said it made the move due to fears that Canadian canola was tainted by an insect infestation. Canada says it has conducted tests on the canola and has not found any pests or bacteria of concern.Canada exported more than $5 billion worth of canola last year, nearly half of it destined for the Chinese market — almost five million metric tonnes, according to the Canadian Canola Growers Association.The Canadian government official said this most recent issue with meat exports bound for China is not on the same scale as the canola ban."

What they are doing at most is lip service, because after all it is a matter between China and Canada.""Tensions between the two countries have risen since Canadian officials arrested Huawei telecommunications executive Meng Wanzhou on a request from the U.S. in December.Soon after, China imprisoned Canadian businessman Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig, a diplomat on leave to work for a non-governmental organization, accusing them of espionage.Trump had promised to raise the case of Spavor and Kovrig during his June 30 meeting with Xi. On Saturday, he said he did not talk with Xi about Meng.However, Trudeau later told reporters he was ""confident"" Trump had raised the subject of the two detained Canadians.The government source said Canada has confirmed that Trump brought up the detained Canadians with Xi.Trump and Xi, whose governments are embroiled in a swelling trade war, agreed to resume trade talks after the U.S. offered concessions — including a promise of no new tariffs and an easing of restrictions on Huawei.The Trump administration has said the telecommunications company is too close to the Chinese government and poses a threat to U.S. national security.Trudeau said he personally discussed the detention of Kovrig and Spavor, along with ""the larger issue of Canada-China relations,"" with Xi on the sidelines of the G20.""This is an issue we take extremely seriously,"" he said.In recent months, China has blocked Canadian exports of canola seed and recently took the step of halting pork and beef imports.

Mulroney urges government to send Chrétien to China to win release of detainees | CBC News,Former prime minister Brian Mulroney says the government should enlist a former prime minister to lead a high-powered delegation to China to win the release of two imprisoned Canadians — but not him.,2019-06-06T22:28:03.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/mulroney-says-send-chretien-china-1.5165716,"Former prime minister Brian Mulroney says the government should enlist a former prime minister to lead a high-powered delegation to China to win the release of two imprisoned Canadians — but not him.""What they might want to do is take a look at sending over someone like Jean Chrétien, who has a lot of respect of the Chinese,"" Mulroney told The Canadian Press.Mulroney said the former Liberal prime minister should be accompanied by another well-placed Canadian: Chrétien's son-in-law André Desmarais, the deputy chairman and co-CEO of Montreal's Power Corporation. Desmarais is also the honorary chairman of the Canada-China Business Council.Desmarais ""is held in extremely high regard by the Chinese and probably knows more about China than any other living Canadian that's not in public life,"" said Mulroney.""You could put a delegation together led by former prime minister Chrétien and a few others, but mostly Chrétien and Andy Desmarais, and go over there and sit down with people Jean has grown up with in politics, who hold senior positions, leadership positions, in the government of China and say, 'Hey, let's get this done,'"" said Mulroney.Ex-diplomat Michael Kovrig and entrepreneur Michael Spavor are under arrest in China facing allegations of espionage and endangering national security. Their imprisonment has sparked international condemnation that their detention is arbitrary, but China has rebuffed the government's many attempts to engage on the matter.Many see their imprisonment as retribution for Canada's decision to arrest Chinese high-tech scion Meng Wangzhou on an extradition request from the U.S. China has also barred some Canadian canola shipments and is cracking down on other agricultural exports.Rumours of such a delegation of special Canadian envoys to China have been circulating in Ottawa, but it hasn't happened so far.""This is not the first time we've been asked the question, but we don't have any announcements planned or decisions planned in the near future,"" said Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's spokesman, Cameron Ahmad.A Power Corp. spokesman said Desmarais declined to comment, while a spokesman for Chrétien did not reply to a request for comment.Mulroney has also advised the current Liberal government on the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement. The former Progressive Conservative leader was granted unprecedented access to a Liberal cabinet meeting to advise on how to deal with U.S. President Donald Trump — a neighbour Mulroney befriended in their Florida vacation communities.But regarding who has the ear of China, Mulroney deferred to his one-time political opponent, who clashed with him as the leader of the official Opposition in the early 1990s.During his 10 years as prime minister, Chrétien made half a dozen trips to China. He rebooted Canadian relations with the People's Republic after a long pause following the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre, in which the Chinese military killed hundreds, perhaps thousands, of unarmed student protesters.Chrétien also created the Team Canada concept, leading delegations of provincial premiers and business leaders to China to grease the wheels of new business deals.In his post-political life, Chrétien has remained actively engaged in China-related issues in his work with the law firm Dentons. His frequents visits to China occasionally garner headlines, including an April 2016 visit when he met with Chinese Premier Li Keqiang.""Premier Li noted that China-Canada relations developed into a 'golden decade' during Mr. Chrétien's administration, and that China appreciates Mr. Chrétien's contributions to promote the development of China-Canada relations,"" said a statement accompanying a photo of the two men warmly shaking hands, on the website of the Chinese government's State Council.Desmarais's August 2016 visit to Beijing was also noted on the Canada-China Business Council's website with a photo supplied by China's state-controlled Xinhua news agency, which depicts his smiling handshake with Chinese Vice-Premier Wang Yang.Power Corp. has had ties with China's largest business conglomerate dating back to the mid-1980s, when Mulroney was in power in Canada.In 2017, the company further entrenched that relationship by buying an additional 3.9-per-cent equity interest in China Asset Management Co. Ltd., also known as China AMC. The deal brought Power Corp.'s equity interest in China AMC to 13.9 per cent.China AMC is an affiliate of CITIC Group Corporation Ltd., which is ""China's largest conglomerate, with which Power Corporation has had an association since 1986,"" said a company statement.Mackenzie Investments, an indirect subsidiary of Power, also completed a 13.9-per-cent acquisition in China AMC in separate transactions in late 2016 and early 2017.""Power Corp. and Mackenzie Investments therefore hold a combined 27.8-per-cent interest in China AMC,"" said a Power Corp. statement.Mulroney acknowledged that his suggestion has echoes of the 2009 visit that former U.S. president Bill Clinton made to North Korea, where he was able to secure the release of two imprisoned journalists. He suggested there might be a lesson for Canada in how the U.S. sometimes taps its ex-presidents for delicate diplomacy.""They know how to use their former leaders."""
"China curtails speech, anthems at NBA pre-season game in Shanghai | CBC Sports","In response to the NBA defending Daryl Morey's freedom of speech, Chinese officials took it away from the Los Angeles Lakers and Brooklyn Nets.",2019-10-10T15:13:27.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/sports/lakers-nets-china-exhibition-recap-1.5316055,"In response to the NBA defending Daryl Morey's freedom of speech, Chinese officials took it away from the Los Angeles Lakers and Brooklyn Nets.All of the usual media sessions surrounding the Lakers-Nets preseason game in Shanghai on Thursday — including a scheduled news conference from NBA commissioner Adam Silver and post-game news conferences with the teams — were cancelled. It was the latest salvo in the rift between the league and China stemming from a since-deleted tweet posted last week by Morey, the general manager of the Houston Rockets.""There will be no media availabilities for tonight's game between the Brooklyn Nets and Los Angeles Lakers,"" the NBA said in a statement Thursday, released a few hours before the game.The game was held as scheduled, with Lakers forward LeBron James and Nets guard Kyrie Irving getting loud ovations when they were introduced as starters. But neither national anthem was played before the game, and no players addressed the crowd before tip-off in a departure from tradition before such international games. Fans arriving at the arena to watch — many of them donning NBA jerseys — were handed small Chinese flags to carry with them inside, and at least one person carried a sign critical of Silver.WATCH | A muted welcome for NBA:The Nets won, 114-111. James walked off with his arms held high, acknowledging cheers from the crowd. He flicked his wristbands toward fans clamouring for a souvenir and tossed his headband into the seats before entering the walkway leading to the Lakers' locker room.He was seen and not heard, just like everyone else on the rosters.""I understand that there are consequences from that exercise of, in essence, his freedom of speech,"" Silver said at a news conference in Tokyo earlier this week. ""We will have to live with those consequences.""And this move was one of those consequences.Most seats were filled, and fans reacted as they would normally — oohs and aahs for good plays, applause for baskets, the loudest cheers coming whenever James touched the ball. Some fans may be upset with the NBA, but they still seem to have their favourite players.""If we have to choose, we will choose to support our country,"" said fan Ma Shipeng, who brought 900 flags to hand out to fellow fans. ""We only like some particular basketball players, but we don't like NBA anymore. I give away Chinese flags tonight, as I hope people to put the national interest in front of following NBA. I will continue to support James. But none of our Chinese people would accept what Morey and Silver said.""WATCH | Chinese fans stand by government in battle against NBA:Morey's tweet expressed support for anti-government protesters in Hong Kong, and sparked fallout that has completely overshadowed the NBA's annual trip to China — which typically takes on a celebratory tone.Not this year. Most events in advance of the game, such as NBA Cares events to benefit educational causes and the Special Olympics, were called off, as was a ""fan night"" where Lakers and Nets players were to interact directly with some Chinese ticketholders. Signage in Shanghai to promote the game — huge photos of James, Anthony Davis, Irving and other players — was ripped down, and mentions of the game were scrubbed from the arena website.All that comes as many Chinese corporations suspended their business ties to the NBA. Chinese state broadcaster CCTV said it was not going to show the Lakers-Nets games on Thursday or in Shenzhen on Saturday, and NBA broadcast partner Tencent also said it was changing its coverage plans for the league.Silver said earlier this week that Rockets great Yao Ming, a Basketball Hall of Famer and now the president of the Chinese Basketball Association — which has also suspended its ties with Houston as part of the Morey tweet fallout — is angry as well.""I'm not sure he quite accepts sort of how we are operating our business right now, and again, I accept that we have a difference of opinion,"" Silver said. ""I also think that as part of our core values, tolerance is one of those as well.""In the U.S., there was governmental reaction as well leading up to the game.On Wednesday in Washington, a bipartisan group of lawmakers — including the rare alignment of Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York — sent a letter to Silver saying the NBA should show the ""courage and integrity"" to stand up to the Chinese government. They asked the NBA to, among other things, suspend activities in China until what they called the selective treatment against the Rockets ends.""You have more power to take a stand than most of the Chinese government's targets and should have the courage and integrity to use it,"" the lawmakers told Silver.The Rockets were extremely popular in China, largely because of Yao. But the team's merchandise has been taken off e-commerce sites and out of stores selling NBA apparel in the country, murals featuring the team's stars and logo were painted over and even the Chinese consulate office in Houston expressed major displeasure with Morey and the Rockets.Morey has been silent on the matter since a tweet Sunday where he attempted to make some sort of amends.Saturday's game between the Lakers and Nets in Shenzhen also remains on as scheduled."

Recycling 'crisis' leaves Cosmo Industries in the red after China's crackdown on foreign waste | CBC News,A Saskatoon business is feeling the pinch as China cracks down on foreign waste and recyclables.,2019-08-20T17:21:43.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatoon/saskatoon-cosmo-china-recyclables-1.5253198,"China's 2018 restriction on foreign recyclables puts pressure on the entire industry and Saskatoon-based social enterprise Cosmo Industries is also feeling the pinch.Before the ban, Canada and other countries sent material needed for manufacturing in China — and made a large profit; the country represented a quarter of the world market for recyclabes.While China builds its own domestic market, foreign shippers are suffering financially without the return they used to rely on.""It's an unprecedented attack on recycling,"" said Ken Gryschuck, manager of business development and community relations at Cosmo. ""Prices have just dropped to the floor.""A few years ago, milk jugs brought in a return of approximately $775 per ton. Now the same amount goes for $175. Old cardboard prices have suffered a 90 per cent drop.The sting of China's ban is especially painful for Cosmopolitan Industries, which has long supported individuals with intellectual disabilities.""We have a thing called an inspiration guide. So we use funds from recycling and from shredding programs for people,"" said Gryschuck.""You can go to the website and say 'Oh, it costs around $3,000 for art supplies for the Cosmo program. I'm interested in art. I could help sponsor that.'""The new program is an attempt to bring in more money to run the operation. Gryschuck said Cosmo is focusing on education in order to cut costs. The materials sent to be processed must be cleaner to increase efficiency.""We spend between $130,000 and $150,000 on things that should never be in the recycling bin to start with.""The centre routinely sees materials like bicycles, dirty diapers and garden hoses come in with permitted recyclablesChina's crackdown on foreign recyclables has put pressure on the North American and European markets, but Gryschuck doesn't blame the country.The recycling that was sent to China prior to 2018 was ""really bad,"" he said.Some importers were lax in their rules specifying clean materials.""They decided they want to clean it up and wanted to create their own recycling domestic industry.""Municipalities may have to look closer at single stream recycling where people put all recyclables in one bin, which costs money to sort and increases contamination.Cosmopolitan Industries has been recycling in Saskatoon since 1971 and it has seen hardship and recessions before.""But it feels different than the ones in the past because it will affect so many municipalities.""People in Saskatoon can help, though. The well-meaning 'wishful recyclers'  use their bins, but they don't always drop their materials in the right one. Others just don't care — those are the people emptying kitty litter and diapers into the recycling bin.Further education may help them become better recyclers. Cosmo is trying to train future recyclers and teach them about the process — and the core of the organization.""We teach them about the contribution of people with disabilities in the community,"" said Gryschuck""They don't deserve to to be having to sift through kitty litter."""

She and the company have denied the charges and China has called for her release.""We hope that the Canadian side can have a clear understanding of the consequences of endangering itself for the gains of the U.S. and take immediate actions to correct its mistakes so as to spare itself the suffering from growing damage,"" Geng said at a daily news briefing.Asked about Pence's comments that U.S. President Donald Trump would speak with Chinese President Xi Jinping about the detained Canadians at a G20 meeting in Japan in June, Geng implied Canada was to blame for its problems in China.Pence, who has taken a hard line on China, discussed the detained Canadians with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in Ottawa on Thursday, where they also talked about Huawei and China trade issues.Kovrig and Spavor were formally charged with espionage this month. China has also cut off imports of key Canadian commodities in an effort to press it.Canada has called the arrests arbitrary.During his visit, Pence thanked Canada for standing up for the rule of law in detaining Meng.While Canada says China has made no specific link between the detentions of the two men and Meng's arrest, experts and former diplomats say they have no doubt it is using their cases to pressure Canada."

For the first quarter of 2018, China accounted for about 18 per cent of Clearwater's sales.The Nova-Scotia based company said sales in China increased 52 per cent in the first quarter compared to the year before because of ""a broad-based shift into China across multiple species.""Clearwater also cited growing demand for lobster.The company appears to be another Canadian beneficiary of the Chinese imposition of a 25 per cent tariff on American lobster in 2018.The move crippled sales of Maine lobster.This spring, Canadian farm exports began hitting obstacles at Chinese ports with claims from authorities that shipments of canola, soy beans and pork from Canada did not meet regulatory standards.Canadian businesses say China is using non-tariff barriers to express its anger over the arrest of Huawei Technologies executive Meng Wangzhou in Vancouver on a U.S. warrant.Clearwater said it is meeting Chinese standards.""We have seen no indications of a slowing of our business with China. And we continue to remain in full compliance with all food-related regulations,"" Smith said.Canola has taken the brunt of Chinese measures with shipments blocked on the grounds it is contaminated, leading to fire-sale prices in other countries.One Canadian exporter has said the goal has been to scare Chinese customers off Canadian products.Clearwater customers are sticking with the company, Smith said.""Our relationships with our Chinese customers remain strong, and importantly, our Chinese customers remain cautiously optimistic,"" he said.China is an increasingly important market for Nova Scotia seafood with sales now in the hundreds of millions of dollars.Clearwater said it achieved sales of $120 million for the first quarter of 2019."

Southern Ontario pushes back against China's steel dumping | CBC News,"Barry Zekelman, owner of Atlas Tube, wants to see measures taken against China to stop its illegal dumping of steel on the world market.",2017-04-04T23:33:34.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/windsor/zekelman-atlas-tube-steel-china-jobs-1.4046388,"Southern Ontario's manufacturing sector wants the federal government to help steel producers remain competitive in an international market that they say is unfairly dominated by shoddy practices in China. Members of the Windsor-Essex Chamber of Commerce teamed up last year with counterparts in Hamilton and Sault Ste. Marie to push the government to stand up to ""steel dumping"" by China. Members of the three Chambers of Commerce say China does not adhere to the same environmental standards and basic labour laws as Canadian companies.After eight months of lobbying, the group presented its case before members of the House of Commons standing committee on international trade in Ottawa on Tuesday. Without a level playing field, Canada can't compete internationally in the steel industry, explained Matt Marchand, president and CEO of the Windsor-Essex Chamber of Commerce.""The instability of the steel market, in large part due to China's steel dumping and non-market economy, has led to the sharp decline in the ability of our steel industry to compete globally, costing middle-class jobs,"" he said.  The owner of Atlas Tube, a steel tube manufacturing company in Harrow, wants action taken against China to stop that country's dumping of cheap steel on the market.Barry Zekelman says China is dumping steel on the global market at a drastically reduced cost, compared to North American steel, by ignoring environmental protection measures.""They're not working on the same playing field that any of us are,"" he told CBC News.Zekelman echoed the Chamber, saying shoddy practices in China threaten the steel industry in Canada and the thousands of jobs that go with it.""All the countries that are being hurt by China have to push back on China and restrict their shipments of steel and steel-related products into those countries,"" he said."
"Meat industry groups concerned over China import ban, working with government | CBC News","China's sudden ban on Canadian beef and pork imports ""will create a huge financial loss"" for the sector that counts the Asian country among its top five international markets, says an industry group.",2019-06-26T19:58:34.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/china-meat-ban-industry-goverment-canada-reaction-1.5191153,"China's sudden ban on Canadian beef and pork imports ""will create a huge financial loss"" for the sector that counts the Asian country among its top five international markets, says an industry group.""It's everybody, right. It's the whole value chain,"" said Chris White, president of the Canadian Meat Council. Farmers sell their product to packers and then it is shipped overseas, he explained.""It implicates everyone.""The Chinese Embassy said Tuesday it asked Canada to suspend all meat exports after Chinese customs inspectors detected residue from a feed additive that is restricted in China in a batch of Canadian pork products. A subsequent investigation found forged veterinary health certificates attached to the batch.The council said the Canadian government is seeking clarification on why beef products have also been suspended since the falsified certificates were for a pork product.So far this year, Canadian beef and pork exports to China had been experiencing a boon. That's partly because of Canadian meat's world-class reputation, said White.About 388 per cent more beef and veal was exported to China as of April 2019 compared with the same timeframe last year, and nearly 53 per cent more pork, according to Statistics Canada.That amounts to roughly $63.6 million in beef and veal, and about $310.2 million in pork exports, according to the agency.Last year, China was the second-largest market for pork exports, valued at $514.3 million, and the fifth-largest for beef, valued at $97.3 million, according to the meat council. The group represents Canada's federally registered meat packers and processors, and suppliers of goods and services in the industry. It focuses on international trade as one of its priorities.""China is a very important market for Canadian producers,"" said the Canadian Pork Council in a statement. It is a federation of nine provincial pork industry associations that represent 7,000 farms. The council did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The pork council noted the increase in sales to China so far this year ""was reflected in higher prices for live hogs.""'In a statement, the Canadian Cattlemen's Association says exports to China accounted for 2.6 per cent of Canada's total beef exports in 2018. The association called the ban ""unfortunate"" but said trade agreements provide the opportunity to shift demand to other countries. ""We are fully confident in our meat production systems in Canada and the safeguards we have in place,"" said Bob Lowe, vice-president of the Canadian Cattlemen's Association in a news release.""We will work closely with the Government of Canada to identify a solution to the suspension from China, while at the same time we will continue to work on expanding other export markets."" That sentiment was echoed by White, who said companies will be looking at what other markets they could send their product to.Canada's biggest pork markets aside from China include the United States, Japan, Mexico and South Korea, according to Statistics Canada's data for this year up to and including April, while beef and veal are also widely exported to the U.S., Japan, Hong Kong and Mexico.However, it can be difficult to change markets suddenly, White said.Many countries will already have their quotas filled by others and may not want to spend time building a relationship with Canadian exporters if they believe the China ban is a temporary interruption. Exporters may also have to offer lower prices to these new markets, he said.The government is taking the matter very seriously and an investigation is underway, International Trade Minister Jim Carr told reporters in Toronto while attending the Canada-India Partnership summit.Carr said it's too early to say if the government would offer any assistance to meat producers who are likely to struggle in the short-term.""Obviously, we're looking at the situation over time and we want that time to be as short as possible,"" he said, adding that the government is trying to get to the bottom of the situation as fast as it can.White said government support has not been substantively discussed.The Canadian Meat Council, Canadian Pork Council and Canada Pork International are working closely with government officials to understand the current situation and help identify next steps. The two councils said they are hopeful for a quick resolution.""Demand for pork products remains strong in China, and Canada producers look forward to having the opportunity to continue to meet the needs of our Chinese customers,"" said the pork council.The ban comes amid a diplomatic dispute over the December arrest of Chinese national, Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou, in Vancouver.China has also stopped imports of Canadian canola and has suspended import permits for three pork producers, and detained two Canadians since the arrest."

A Chinese woman has been quarantined in Thailand with a mystery strain of coronavirus, Thai authorities said on Monday, the first time the virus has been detected outside China.In all, 41 cases of pneumonia have been reported in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, which preliminary lab tests cited by state media showed could be from a new type of coronavirus, and one patient has died. There have since been no new cases or deaths, Wuhan health authorities said on Tuesday.""From the information that we have it is possible that there is limited human-to-human transmission, potentially among families, but it is very clear right now that we have no sustained human-to-human transmission,"" said Maria Van Kerkhove, acting head of WHO's emerging diseases unit.The WHO is however preparing for the possibility that there could be a wider outbreak, she told a Geneva news briefing. ""It is still early days, we don't have a clear clinical picture.""Some types of the virus cause less serious diseases, while others — like the one that causes MERS — are far more severe.The UN agency has given guidance to hospitals worldwide about infection prevention and control in case the new virus spreads. There is no specific treatment for the new virus, but anti-virals are being considered and could be ""re-purposed,"" Van Kerkhove said.With Chinese New Year approaching on Jan. 25, when many Chinese tourists visit Thailand, the WHO called on Thai authorities, the public and holidaymakers to be on alert.Richard Brow, the agency's representative in Thailand, said anyone with a fever and cough who had spent time in Wuhan should get checked out by a health worker."
China top of mind as Trudeau hosts Japan's Shinzo Abe | CBC News,"Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Japan's Shinzo Abe met in Ottawa to celebrate the 90th anniversary of their bilateral bond and to commit to further the business relationship. It was a chance to tout their strong relationship in the face of trade woes with Canada's two biggest partners, but it's clear Trudeau's focus was elsewhere.",2019-04-28T17:53:50.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/trudeau-abe-canada-japan-china-1.5114457,"China was top of mind for Justin Trudeau during a visit from Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe this weekend.The two leaders met in Ottawa to commit to further the business relationship between the two countries. It was a chance to tout their strong relationship in the face of trade woes with Canada's two biggest partners, but it's clear Trudeau's focus was elsewhere.During an appearance with Abe, he spoke about the diplomatic relations between ""Canada and China,"" before quickly correcting himself. Later on, he accidentally referred to Japan as China again.China's detention of Canadian citizens and its blocking of canola shipments came up during the meetings between the leaders.Two Canadians, Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig, have been held in China since December. Japanese citizens are also regularly imprisoned in China, and Abe said Japan has been monitoring the situation with the detained Canadians.On the trade front, China recently cancelled canola imports from Canada, claiming the product from two Canadian companies is contaminated, though it did not provide any evidence to officials. It's a blow to farmers here, as China buys 40 per cent of this country's canola exports.Trudeau briefly mentioned that he and Abe had discussed potentially sending some canola to Japan instead. Canada's exports to Japan nearly topped $13 billion in 2018, versus exports of $27 billion to China, according to Global Affairs.Japanese officials said Trudeau had raised it and Abe listened, but the conversation didn't go beyond that.The two prime ministers, their ambassadors, several Japanese ministers, plus Canadian ministers Bill Morneau and Chrystia Freeland were part of the official delegations that met Sunday morning. Trudeau and Abe had a short meeting before the larger gathering, as well as a 90-minute private dinner Saturday night with their spouses and interpreters.Trudeau said, while the two countries engage economically with China, both have to be wary of China's attempts to ""impose"" its approach on the world.Abe took a softer approach, saying that Japan agrees with Canada about human rights and rule of law, but it's important to try to foster international ties with China. He was frank about the challenges.""Canada and Japan are facing challenges when it comes to China,"" he said through a translator.""The global community must unite and convince China to play a constructive role.""That's an increasingly hard goal, as longstanding rules-based systems, like the World Trade Organization, are tested by players like China and the U.S. — both countries with leaders who aren't inclined to play by the established rules.""Obviously with issues like the rise of China and the approach that the United States has taken recently, there are real challenges,"" Trudeau admitted.The Trump administration's approach to trade has caused headaches for the Liberal government, as issues negotiating a new NAFTA agreement and tariffs on steel and aluminum put the North American countries at odds.Abe and Trudeau devoted much of their remarks to hailing the benefits of the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), the new trade deal for 11 Pacific Rim nations that was revived and ratified after the U.S. backed out following Trump's election.Trudeau said the gains Canada has been able to make, including upping beef and pork exports to Japan,  show Canada ""stands in stark contrast,"" to the approach of the U.S.Abe was in Washington meeting with Trump directly before he flew to Ottawa. He refrained from taking the same firm tone as Trudeau about the U.S. ""I think that we share the same position, but we should co-operate together so that the United States will be encouraged to be the leader of the liberal free world and we will co-operate with Canada,"" he said.Trudeau and Abe signed two memorandums that agree to invest more in robotics and AI between the countries, as well as an announcement that Canada would recommit to devoting resources to monitor North Korean activity in Pacific waters.Japan will host the G20 summit in June and Abe and Trudeau will likely meet again at the G7 gathering in France in August."

The landing was announced by state broadcaster China Central Television at the top of its noon news broadcast.The landing highlights China's growing ambitions as a space power to rival the U.S., Russia and Europe. In 2013, Chang'e 3, the predecessor craft to the current mission, made the first moon landing since the then-Soviet Union's Luna 24 in 1976. The United States is the only other country that has carried out moon landings.""The space dream is part of the dream to make China stronger,"" President Xi Jinping said in 2013, shortly after becoming China's leader.In year-end wrap-ups, Chinese media and officials hailed the Dec. 8 launch of Chang'e 4 as one of the nation's major achievements in 2018. Thursday's landing was announced to the public by state broadcaster CCTV at the top of the noon news.""On the whole, China's space technology still lags behind the West, but with the landing on the far side of the moon, we have raced to the front,"" said Hou Xiyun, a professor at Nanjing University's school of astronomy and space science.He added that China has Mars, Jupiter and asteroids in its sights: ""There's no doubt that our nation will go farther and farther.""The work of Chang'e 4, which is carrying a rover, includes carrying out astronomical observations and probing the structure and mineral composition of the terrain.""The far side of the moon is a rare quiet place that is free from interference of radio signals from Earth,"" mission spokesperson Yu Guobin said, according to Xinhua. ""This probe can fill the gap of low-frequency observation in radio astronomy and will provide important information for studying the origin of stars and nebula evolution.""One challenge of operating on the far side of the moon is communicating with Earth. China launched a relay satellite in May so that Chang'e 4 can send back information.China plans to send its Chang'e 5 probe to the moon next year and have it return to Earth with samples — the first time that will have been done since the Soviet mission in 1976.A Long March 3B rocket carrying Chang'e 4 blasted off on Dec. 8 from Xichang Satellite Launch Center in southern China. Chang'e is the name of a Chinese goddess who, according to legend, has lived on the moon for millennia."

The Republicans and Democrats backing the measures said they viewed the company as a security threat.""American companies shouldn't be in the business of selling our enemies the tools they'll use to spy on Americans,"" Republican Sen. Tom Cotton, one of the sponsors, said in a statement.The United States placed Huawei on the Commerce Department's so-called Entity List in May over national security concerns. U.S. parts and components generally cannot be sold to those on the list without special licenses.However, Trump, who is seeking to revive trade talks with China, announced late last month that U.S. companies would be allowed to sell products to Huawei.The ""Defending America's 5G Future Act"" was introduced in the Senate by Republicans Cotton, Marco Rubio and Mitt Romney and Democrats Chris Van Hollen, Mark Warner and Richard Blumenthal.A companion bill was introduced in the House by Democratic Representatives Jimmy Panetta and Ruben Gallego and Republicans Mark Gallagher and Liz Cheney.Washington also has launched a lobbying effort to persuade U.S. allies to keep Huawei out of next-generation 5G telecommunications infrastructure, citing concerns the company could spy on customers. Huawei has denied the allegations.Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told a news briefing in Beijing on Wednesday that the United States should immediately cease its ""suppression"" of Huawei.Geng said that relevant U.S. legislators were ""clinging to a Cold War mentality"" in trying to contain China's development, and that such actions ""seriously damaged the United States' national image."""

They have become two of the most popular terms in China's vast social media world.""The Sherlock production team shoot something more like a movie, not just a TV drama,"" said Yu Fei, a veteran writer of TV crime dramas for Chinese television.Scenes in which Holmes spots clues in a suspect's clothes or picks apart an alibi are so richly detailed that ""it seems like a wasteful luxury,"" Yu said.Even the Communist Party newspaper People's Daily is a fan.""Tense plot, bizarre story, exquisite production, excellent performances,"" it said of the third season's premier episode.With its mix of odd villains, eccentric aristocrats and fashionable London settings, Sherlock can draw on a Chinese fondness for a storybook version of Britain.Wealthy Chinese send their children to local branches of British schools such as Eton and Dulwich. Rolls Royce Motor Cars Ltd. says China passed the U.S. last year to become the biggest market for its luxury sedans. On the outskirts of Shanghai, a developer has built Thames Town, modeled on an English village with mock Tudor houses and classic red phone booths.""The whole drama has the rich scent of British culture and nobility,"" Yu said. ""Our drama doesn't have that.""The series has given a boost to Youku.com, part of a fast-growing Chinese online video industry. Dozens of sites, some independent and others run by Chinese television stations, show local and imported programs such as The Good Wife and The Big Bang Theory.Youku.com says that after two weeks, total viewership for the Sherlock third season premiere had risen to 14.5 million people. That compares with the 8 to 9 million people who the BBC says watch first-run episodes in Britain. The total in China is bumped up by viewers on pay TV service BesTV, which also has rights to the program.Appearing online gives Sherlock an unusual edge over Chinese dramas. To support a fledgling industry, communist authorities have exempted video websites from most censorship and limits on showing foreign programming that apply to traditional TV stations. That allows outlets such as Youku to show series that might be deemed too violent or political for state TV and to release them faster.""Our writers and producers face many restrictions and censorship. We cannot write about national security and high-level government departments,"" Yu said.Referring to Mycroft Holmes, a shadowy government official and key character, Yu said, ""Sherlock's brother could not appear in a police drama in China.""Terigele, a 25-year-old geological engineer in the northern region of Inner Mongolia, started an online Sherlock fan club in 2010. The group has grown to become the biggest on the popular QQ social media service, with more than 1,000 members.""I've watched several versions of Sherlock Holmes, and this is my favorite one,"" said Terigele, who like many ethnic Mongols uses one name. ""The fans in my group, and I too, think it is especially interesting to bring these two men into modern society, with the Internet and high technology.""And Chinese fans have fallen in love with Cumberbatch.""I am always super excited to see him on the screen and murmur, 'Wow, so beautiful' every single time,""' said Zhang Jing, 24, who works for an advertising company in the eastern city of Tianjin.That fondness for the performers has helped fuel a fad for Sherlock fan fiction in China. Some stories play on the complicated relationship of Holmes and Watson by making them a gay couple.""The sexual orientation is also an interesting point,"" Terigele said. ""Their relationship is a bit more than friendship. They appreciate each other. It is cute, and it makes the audience more eager to watch it.""And Sherlock makes a helpful cultural ambassador for Britain.When Prime Minister David Cameron visited China last year, fans posted appeals on microblogs for him to press the BBC to speed up the release of a new season.Today, a popular online comment aimed at Cameron is, ""Thank you for Sherlock."""
"Sask. canola farmers 'collateral damage' in Canada-China dispute, says former diplomat | CBC News","An expert on Canada-China relations says a recent move by China to stop canola seed export from a major Canadian agriculture company is ""ridiculous and completely unjustified.""",2019-03-06T18:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/sask-canola-farmers-collateral-canada-china-dispute-1.5044826,"Charles Burton says a recent move by China to stop canola seed export from a major Canadian agriculture company is ""ridiculous and completely unjustified.""China halts canola shipments from major Canadian supplierChina says pest concerns justify ban on Canadian canolaA Chinese customs document dated March 1 says the country has cancelled Winnipeg-based agricultural handler Richardson International's registration, which means the company is forbidden to export canola seed to China.The decision could have serious consequences for Saskatchewan farmers as China is the province's top customer for canola seed, accounting for about $2 billion in trade.In the past, China has wanted to limit the amount of ""dockage"" — material such as weeds, stems and other seeds —  it allows in Canadian canola to help fight the spread of a fungal crop disease known as blackleg.Burton, a professor of Canada-China Relations at Brock University and a former diplomat to China, says the move is politically motivated.Political tensions have been rising between Canada and China since Meng Wanzhou, CFO of Chinese technology firm Huawei, was arrested in Canada.The arrest came at the request of U.S. tax authorities and was made as Wanzhou was boarding a flight in Vancouver.Meng Wanzhou scheduled to appear in B.C. court for extradition hearing date'Highly personal': Huawei charges follow years of concern and questionsBurton told CBC Radio's The Morning Edition that China is trying to get Wanzhou released before she is extradited to the U.S.""She has, possibly, information about Huawei's connection to security and intelligence apparatus and in China that would be very damaging to China's interests if it became known,"" Burton said.""Our farmers seem to be the collateral damage in a geo-strategic struggle between China and the west over intelligence and security matters.""Burton recommends farmers lobby government officials to get tougher with China, which will ""pressure the regime to recognize that this kind of arbitrary action to damage the interests of Saskatchewan canola producers is not something which is acceptable in the relationship.""Burton said the move has no possible benefit for China or Canada and will not lead to the release of Wanzhou.""This matter is just ridiculous and completely unjustified,"" he said.""The damage to Saskatchewan farming families is just not something that our government should take lying down.""Burton said Canada should address the ""parking of [China's] enormous assets into Canadian real estate,"" as a means of countering China's decision, ""There are laws about this that we should be enforcing.""Businessman from China investing in Vancouver real estate ordered to repay millionsChinese bought $1.3B of Canadian commercial real estate this yearHe said Canada in general needs to change the way it approaches its political and trade relationship with China.""I think we ought to stand up for our Saskatchewan farmers,"" he saidSaskatchewan Agriculture Minister Dave Marit, who is also a canola producer, said canceling canola seed shipments from Richardson Industries could have a ""huge implication"" on the provincial economy.Sask. canola farmers find themselves in middle of Canada-China dispute""China is a big market and a big player,"" Marit said. ""Hopefully we can come to some [resolution] and some conclusion to this real quickly,"" he told reporters after question period on Tuesday.Marit said he has talked with his federal counterpart, Marie-Claude Bibeau, and she told him resolving the issue is a priority.In a statement to CBC News, Bibeau said the government, ""will work with China to resolve this issue as quickly as possible.""The statement said the federal government is ""closely monitoring the situation and any potential impact on Canada's agricultural trading relationship with China. We are in regular contact with industry stakeholders regarding this matter, and we will keep them informed as additional information becomes available.""Premier Scott Moe told reporters his government is reaching out to the Canadian ambassador's office in China, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency and Richardson International on top of discussions with the federal government."

""It doesn't mean that they're suspended, either, at this time. So, we will obviously keep working with them and see how it goes.""In recent weeks, citing concerns about pests, China has sent non-compliance notifications to Richardson International Ltd. and Viterra Inc., two major Canadian exporters of canola seed. Chinese officials also suspended their licences.China's moves to choke off Canadian canola-seed imports have been widely viewed as the superpower applying economic pressure on Canada following the December arrest of senior Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou in Vancouver at the behest of the United States.Curt Vossen, the CEO of Richardson, told another House of Commons committee Tuesday that canola products alone were just over 15 per cent of all of Canada's exports to China and, last year, were worth more than $4 billion.China imported $2.7 billion worth of Canadian canola seed last year, which ensures any prolonged feud would be felt by farmers, the industry and the broader economy. The seeds are the raw material for canola oil, which is widely used for cooking and in some industries.Vossen, whose Winnipeg-based company has been doing business in China for more than a century, said he cannot emphasize enough the importance of finding a solution to the feud — and quickly.As the federal government searches for that solution, it's been trying to find new markets and cabinet ministers have been touting Canada's recently ratified trade deals with the Asia-Pacific region and the European Union.""If the current disruption continues over the longer term, we will have no choice but to find other markets for Canadian canola seed, however doing so will be no easy task,"" said Vossen. ""While we are confident that we can eventually find other markets, it will not be a painless exercise.""He urged the federal government to be ""more aggressive"" in defending the interests of Canada's agriculture exporters in China and around the world, where they're facing trade barriers in several jurisdictions.""To say that canola is important to Canada's trading relationship with China would be a gross understatement — canola and, indeed, the entire grains and oilseeds complex is the foundation of Canada's trading relationship with China,"" he said, noting the disruption comes at a critical time right before seeding season, when farmers are deciding how much to grow.The Liberal government has insisted it wants to find a scientific solution to the dispute and Bibeau has said she sent a letter to her Chinese counterpart with a request to send a delegation of experts to China to examine the issue. Officials are examining options to support farmers through the possible expansion of existing programs, Bibeau said.The federal Liberals have also established a working group that includes officials from Richardson and Viterra and representatives from the governments of Alberta, Manitoba and Saskatchewan.On March 1, the same day China suspended Richardson's licence, Canada's Justice Department gave the go-ahead for the extradition case against Meng.It marked the formal start of the high-profile process that has thrust Canada into a highly uncomfortable position between China and the United States.In the days following Meng's arrest, China arrested Canadian citizens Michael Kovrig, a Canadian diplomat on leave, and Michael Spavor, an entrepreneur, on allegations of engaging in activities that have endangered Chinese national security."
Trudeau's trip to China cost taxpayers $1.8M | CBC News,"Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s trip to China last year was the most expensive trip by a Canadian prime minister in a decade. According to figures obtained by CBC News, Trudeau’s 10-day trip to Beijing, Shanghai, Hangzhou and Hong Kong cost Canadian taxpayers $1.8 million.",2017-02-13T10:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/trudeau-china-canada-trade-1.3979264,"Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's trip to China last year was the most expensive trip by a Canadian prime minister in a decade.According to figures obtained by CBC News, Trudeau's 10-day trip to Beijing, Shanghai, Hangzhou and Hong Kong to attend the G20 summit and meet Chinese business and political leaders cost Canadian taxpayers $1.8 million.Former Conservative Prime Minister Stephen Harper's six-day trip in 2014 to Hong Kong and Beijing, which cost $1.7 million, was the second highest tab for prime ministerial trips in the past 10 years. Harper's trip to Japan for the 2008 G8 summit was $1.4 million.But while Trudeau's trip was the most expensive by a prime minister in a decade, it is not the most expensive trip to China by a Canadian leader. For example, in 2001, Liberal Prime Minister Jean Chrétien's Team Canada made an 11-day trip to China accompanied by provincial and business leaders, racking up a price tag of $6.7 million. Liberal Prime Minister Paul Martin's nine-day, five-country trip to Thailand, India, Sri Lanka, Japan and China cost $2 million.While the costs of all of Trudeau's trips to date is not yet known, most of the others were shorter trips or headed to less expensive destinations. For example, Trudeau's trip to the United Kingdom, Malta and then on to Paris for the climate conference in November 2015 came in at $1 million. His trip to Davos, Switzerland, for the World Economic Forum in January 2016 cost $855,379.An analysis by CBC of travel costs by Canadian prime ministers from 2003 to the present shows that trips to China are often among the most expensive. Trips to other countries or other cities are often tacked onto the itinerary and distance also adds to the costs.According to figures obtained by CBC, the cost for the plane alone for Trudeau's trip from Aug. 29 to Sept. 7, 2016, was $543,682 — $416.250 in flying time for the CC-150 Polaris (Airbus) and another $127,432 for catering on the plane.The Privy Council office had $246,613 in costs — $157,260 of it in commercial flights for those who didn't travel with Trudeau on the government airbus.The Global Affairs department had the highest tab of all — $1,012,509. While a breakdown of the costs was not available, Natasha Nystrom, spokesperson for Global Affairs, said the pricetag included the cost of an advance visit to China to lay the groundwork for Trudeau's trip.Trudeau's government has been actively reinforcing the relationship with China – particularly in the wake of U.S. President Donald Trump's election. In January, Trudeau appointed senior cabinet minister John McCallum as Canada's new ambassador to China. The government has also overturned at least one decision by the Harper government, allowing a Chinese firm to purchase Montreal-area high-tech company ITF Technologies.Olivier Duchesneau, spokesman for Trudeau, said the government ""has made it a top priority to create a stronger, more stable and long-term relationship with China.""""In stark opposition to the former government's cold relations with China, we have embarked on a new relationship on an equal footing, one where trade interests are met by human rights concerns and Canada's commitment to the rule of law.""Among the things Trudeau accomplished on the trip to China were ensuring access for Canada's $2-billion canola industry to China, the announcement of several new initiatives, exploratory talks towards a Canada-China free trade agreement and setting a goal to double trade by 2025, said Duchesneau.However, Duchesneau said the government isn't ignoring the question of human rights in China as it tries to improve trade ties.""The prime minister intends to continue regular, respectful and frank discussion with China, including on issues like good governance and the rule of law,"" he wrote in an e-mail.""As we work toward a stronger, more stable and long-term relationship with China, we will have more opportunities to share our culture, increase our people-to-people ties, bolster our shared prosperity, grow Canada's middle class and hold regular, frank dialogue on issues of importance to Canadians like respect for democracy, human rights and the rule of law.""Elizabeth Thompson can be reached at elizabeth.thompson@cbc.ca"

Almost half of Chinese tourists who arrive here, end up in B.C.The concerns being relayed now are a stark change from last year, when the organization dubbed 2018 the Canada-China year of tourism.It's not just Chinese tourists who are having second thoughts, Canadians are also rethinking whether they should spend time in China.""I just feel unsafe,"" said Vancouver's Jonathan Wong about visiting China after stepping off a flight from Hong Kong on Tuesday.Fellow passenger Lorna Hernandez, says she feels ""a little bit scared"" after seeing several Canadians being detained while another was sentenced to death for drug smuggling.On Tuesday, Canada issued an updated travel advisory for China, warning citizens about the risk of arbitrary enforcement of laws in that country.Hours later, China criticized the move and issued its own travel warning for Chinese citizens travelling to Canada."

U.S. businesses beg Trump not to escalate tariffs on China | CBC News,U.S. businesses are imploring President Donald Trump not to expand his tariffs to $300 billion US in goods from China that have so far been spared in his trade war with Beijing.,2019-06-17T18:05:14.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/hearings-tariffs-china-imports-1.5178526,"U.S. businesses are imploring President Donald Trump not to expand his tariffs to $300 billion US in goods from China that have so far been spared in his trade war with Beijing.These companies warn that the additional tariffs would drive up prices for consumers, squeeze profits and leave U.S. companies at a competitive disadvantage to foreign rivals that aren't subject to higher taxes on the components they buy from China.And in a sign that commercial combat between the world's two biggest economies is hurting business on both sides of the Pacific, the Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei warned that the hostilities with the Trump administration will shrink its expected revenue by $30 billion over the next two years.Huawei is at the heart of the trade war that Beijing is engaged in with the Trump administration, which has accused Chinese companies like Huawei of committing forced technology transfers from American companies and stealing their trade secrets. Last month, the U.S. placed Huawei on its ""Entity List,"" which effectively bars American companies from selling components to Huawei without government approval.In the meantime, American businesses, trade groups and individuals are pleading with the administration to drop its threat to tax the remaining Chinese imports that Trump hasn't already hit with tariffs — or at least spare the particular imports that they and their customers rely on. Some are appearing in person to air their grievances in seven days of hearings in Washington that began Monday.A common theme in their pleas is that American businesses — not China, as Trump often asserts — must pay the import taxes the president is imposing on Chinese goods. And in the end, many of these companies will pass their higher costs on to their customers.Trump has already imposed 25 per cent tariffs on $250 billion in Chinese imports. The goal is to pressure Beijing to stop stealing American technology, forcing U.S. businesses to hand over trade secrets and unfairly subsidizing Chinese tech companies.Eleven rounds of negotiations have failed to resolve the dispute over China's aggressive drive to surpass America's technological dominance. Businesses and investors say they hope the negotiations will gain momentum if Trump and President Xi Jinping hold a face-to-face meeting at a Group of 20 summit in Osaka, Japan in two weeks.""Most businesses are almost praying for a solution,"" said Patrik Berglund, who tracks global trade as the CEO of Xeneta, an Oslo, Norway, a firm that provides data on the shipping industry. ""These things will have enormous consequences. We're so connected in this global world.""This week, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer is sure to hear more complaints when he goes to Capitol Hill. Lighthizer is to testify Tuesday to the Senate Finance Committee and Wednesday to the House Ways and Means Committee. Lawmakers from both political parties have been increasingly inclined to speak out against Trump's aggressive use of tariffs.They were especially alarmed last month when Trump unexpectedly threatened to impose crippling tariffs on Mexico in a push to stop the flow of Central American migrants into the United States. Trump dropped the tariff threat after Mexico agreed to do more to block the migrants.But the combat with China continues. And Chinese companies are being bruised. Huawei's founder and CEO, Ren Zhengfei, likened his company to a ""badly damaged plane"" because of the U.S. actions against it.Ren said Huawei will reduce capacity and expects revenue of about $100 billion annually for the next two years, compared with $105 billion in 2018. In February, he had said the company was targeting $125 billion in 2019. Huawei's overseas cellphone sales will drop by 40%, Ren predicted.The Trump administration asserts that Huawei poses a national security threat because it is beholden to China's ruling Communist Party. But American officials have presented no evidence of any Huawei equipment serving as intentional conduits for espionage by Beijing. Huawei's placement on the Entity List is widely seen as intended to persuade resistant U.S. allies in Europe to exclude Huawei equipment from their next-generation wireless networks, known as 5G.The action against Huawei marked an escalation in a yearlong dispute with China. Trump's earlier tariffs largely spared American consumers by focusing on industrial goods that don't show up directly in the mall or big-box stores. But the new round would inflict financial pain on ordinary households because it will affect many consumer goods, from cellphones and computers to shoes and silk scarves.""There's certainly a lot of business pressure to resolve the China trade wars,"" said Amanda DeBusk, chair of the international trade practice at the law firm Dechert and a former U.S. Commerce Department official.She added: ""The president looks at all of this as a negotiation. As we have seen, sometimes these things have a way of working themselves out as they did with his tariffs on Mexico.""If Trump does expand his tariffs to all remaining goods from China, though, it could prove costly. A report commissioned by the National Retail Federation found that American consumers would pay an additional $4.4 billion a year for clothing, $2.5 billion more for shoes and $1.6 billion more for household appliances.More broadly, economists say the tariffs could weaken a U.S. economy that appears to be on shakier footing. Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, said the higher import taxes would leave the United States with 900,000 fewer jobs than it would have had otherwise.""The U.S. economy will be flirting with recession later this year and early next,"" Zandi said.Jeffrey Pratt, leader of the supply chain practice at the accounting and consulting firm BDO, called the looming tariffs ""a bit of gamechanger"" for his clients. Many can't afford to absorb the taxes themselves and would pass along the higher costs to their customers.Atlas PyroVision Entertainment in Jaffrey, New Hampshire, relies on China for 90 per cent of the fireworks it sells.""Simply imposing a 25 per cent tariff will ultimately cause significant harm to our family business,"" CEO Stephen Pelkey said in a filing with the U.S. Trade Representative. ""We would be forced to pass along the increase directly to our customers.""Noting that community non-profits often use the fireworks for Independence Day celebrations, Pelkey wrote: ""In most cases, a 25 per cent hike in price will force their skies to go dark on the 4th of July.""Bracing for the new tariffs, Yedi Houseware, a Los Angeles family business, has postponed plans to hire and move into a bigger warehouse. Bobby Djavaheri, a company executive, echoed a common complaint: The administration is taxing products — in his case, things like air fryers — that aren't made by American companies. They must be imported. So no U.S. producer benefits from the tariffs; U.S. importers just get socked with a tax.""It's really dumbfounding,"" he said."

Days later, two Canadians — Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor — were detained in China in apparent retaliation.Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau condemned Schellenberg's sentencing in January and accused China of ""arbitrarily"" applying the death penalty.Schellenberg, who was arrested in 2014, has maintained his innocence.More than 200 kilograms of methamphetamine were seized as part of Schellenberg's case, the court said. It called the 36-year-old Canadian the ""principal offender"" and said the evidence presented was ""true and sufficient.""Canadian Embassy officials were notified and Schellenberg's litigation rights were lawfully protected during Thursday's proceedings, the court added.Schellenberg's attorney Zhang Dongshuo said it was not clear when the court would announce a decision.""Both sides comprehensively debated what each believes to be the issues in the case,"" Zhang said, adding that at this stage he cannot assess what the final judgment will be.The appeal hearing followed Meng's court appearance Wednesday in Vancouver.Meng is accused of lying to banks about the company's dealings with Iran in violation of U.S. trade sanctions. Her attorney, Scott Fenton, has argued that comments by U.S. President Donald Trump suggest the case against her is politically motivated.Washington has pressured other countries to limit use of Huawei's technology, warning they could be opening themselves up to surveillance and theft of information.China and the U.S. are currently embroiled in a trade dispute that has beleaguered global financial markets."
Protesters in Hong Kong decry government's 'empty rhetoric' amid warning from China | CBC News,"Hong Kong protesters held an inaugural ""People's Press Conference"" on Tuesday to condemn what they called the government's ""empty rhetoric"" and instances of alleged police abuse.",2019-08-06T06:16:06.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/hong-kong-protests-news-conferences-1.5237036,"Hong Kong protesters held an inaugural ""People's Press Conference"" on Tuesday to condemn what they called the government's ""empty rhetoric"" and instances of alleged police abuse.Three protesters who spoke to reporters said the briefing was intended to counter the regular government and police news conferences in which authorities have repeatedly decried violent acts by some pro-democracy demonstrators.Some officers have shown ""total lack of self-discipline,"" said an activist using the pseudonym Jerry Chan, who added that some tear gas was fired on residential buildings during clashes across several districts Monday.Many rally participants have chosen to hide their identities because they fear official retribution.Hong Kong has seen a string of demonstrations that began in June against proposed extradition legislation that would have allowed some criminal suspects to be sent to mainland China to stand trial. While the government has since suspended the bill, protesters have pressed on with broader calls for democratic reforms, an investigation into the police brutality allegations and for the region's leader to step down.A Chinese official responsible for Hong Kong affairs, meanwhile, said punishment for those behind weeks of sometimes violent protests in the Chinese special administrative region is ""only a matter of time.""The comments Tuesday by Yang Guang, spokesperson for the Chinese Cabinet's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, appeared to indicate Beijing will take a hard line against the protests and has no plans to open a dialogue on their demands for political reforms.Yang singled out ""brazen, violent and criminal actors"" and the ""meddling hands behind the scenes"" as the focus of law enforcement efforts, and also called on Hong Kong citizens to turn on the protesters by refusing to accept their promotional materials and opposing disruptions to public transport.China so far has not visibly intervened in the situation, though it has published a series of strongly worded editorials in state media condemning ""violent radicals"" and ""foreign forces"" allegedly inflaming them.Speculation has grown that the Communist Party-led central government will deploy the military to quell demonstrators after Chinese officials pointed to an article in Hong Kong law that allows troops already stationed in the city to help with ""public order maintenance"" at the Hong Kong government's request.While Hong Kong authorities have said they don't anticipate any need to bring in troops or police from China to help impose order, the Hong Kong army garrison and police in the city of Shenzhen across the border have both released videos recently of their officers training to disperse groups of people dressed in black and wearing masks and construction helmets like many of the Hong Kong protesters.A former British colony, Hong Kong was returned to China in 1997 under the framework of ""one country, two systems,"" which promised the region certain democratic freedoms not afforded to the Communist Party-ruled mainland. But some Hong Kong residents feel that Beijing has been increasingly encroaching on their freedoms.A string of demonstrations began in June against proposed extradition legislation that would have allowed some suspects to be sent to mainland China for trial. While the government has since suspended the bill, protesters have pressed on with broader calls for democratic reforms, an investigation into allegations of police brutality and for the region's leader to step down.In the latest confrontation for the Chinese city, protesters surrounded a police station late Tuesday and early Wednesday to demand the release of a university student arrested for apparently buying laser pointers. Police used tear gas at one point to try to clear the demonstrators from the blue-collar Sham Shui Po neighbourhood.At the protesters' news conference, they apologized for the inconveniences brought on by a general strike Monday that paralyzed regular workday operations in the city. Major roads and public transit lines were blocked, while at least 77 flights out of the airport were cancelled.Protesters challenged law enforcement in at least eight districts Monday, responding to continuous rounds of tear gas with practiced swiftness. Some started fires outside police stations and hurled bricks and eggs at officers.Chan said Tuesday that he hopes Hong Kong residents will carefully consider how to respond if the army does intervene.""I believe the protesters and Hong Kong citizens will 'be water' and know what to do,"" he said, referring to the protesters' philosophy of taking a fluid approach to their demonstrations.The three protesters organized their briefing through LIHKG, an online forum that has been vital to the movement. They emphasized that they cannot represent all demonstrators, but instead hope to provide a platform to respond to what they say are ""rumours"" spread by the government."
"China 'firmly supports' Hong Kong leader amid crisis, Beijing rep says | CBC News","China's top representative in Hong Kong said Thursday the central government in Beijing maintained its support for Carrie Lam, the city's chief executive who is grappling with Hong Kong's greatest political crisis since it returned to Chinese rule in 1997.",2019-07-11T12:03:39.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/china-backs-hong-kong-leader-1.5207793,"China's top representative in Hong Kong said Thursday the central government in Beijing maintained its support for Carrie Lam, the city's chief executive who is grappling with Hong Kong's greatest political crisis since it returned to Chinese rule in 1997.Millions of people have taken to the streets of Hong Kong in the past month in some of the largest and most violent demonstrations in decades to protest against a proposed extradition bill that would allow people to be sent to mainland China for trial.Wang Zhimin, director of the Liaison Office of the People's Government in Hong Kong, criticized the violence at some of the protests, including the July 1 break-in and ransacking of the territory's legislature.""If we indulge crimes and breaches of the law, even whitewash, exonerate or give them support, that would be a blatant challenge to the rule of law in Hong Kong, which will eventually hurt the interest of all the Hong Kong people,"" he said.""Hence, the central government firmly supports Chief Executive Carrie Lam and the Special Administrative Region government.""Wang was speaking at a pro-Beijing event in Hong Kong that was carried live on television.Hong Kong was returned to China from Britain in 1997 as a Special Administrative Region (SAR) with the promise of a high degree of autonomy, although many in the territory say Beijing has tightened its grip in recent years.Many in Hong Kong see the extradition bill as another step in increasing Beijing control over the financial hub.In the face of the opposition to the bill, Lam suspended it in mid-June and this week said it was ""dead."" She has declined to formally withdraw it from the legislative process, though, leaving protesters unsatisfied.In addition to calling for the withdrawal of the bill, demonstrators have asked for Lam to resign, for an inquiry into the use of force by the police at a June 12 protest and for detained and arrested protesters to be set free.Analysts say that after Lam's handling of the turmoil over the extradition bill, her eventual departure — which will require Beijing's blessing — is only a matter of time.Wang repeated a Chinese government assertion that ""foreign forces"" were behind the unrest, and a small number of Hong Kong people were willing to be used to create trouble.""We should give the SAR government time and room. Everybody should unite and move forward, help each other out, and build Hong Kong, our common home,"" Wang said.Thousands of people in Hong Kong laid sunflowers and white lilies at a memorial site Thursday for a man who fell to his death during protests against the extradition bill.Marco Leung, 35, fell from construction scaffolding in June after unfurling banners against the now-suspended legislation. More protests are planned for the weekend.People of all ages attended the outdoor service for Leung at a public playground, where volunteers offered tissues to mourners, and Red Cross workers stood by to provide advice.Hundreds lined up in intermittent rain to pay respects, with the crowd swelling in the evening as people came from work.""Life is indeed precious ... but for freedom, life can be sacrificed,"" Methodist minister Yuen Tin-Yau, one of the event's organizers, said in a speech. ""The reason why human beings on Earth are human is to sacrifice themselves for the sake of benevolence, justice, friendship and freedom.""Stress and trauma over the turmoil have created an unprecedented mental health problem that the city is not equipped to deal with, medical professionals say.Psychologists and social workers also attended the memorial to provide support.Hong Kong's youth have been at the forefront of the city's biggest and most violent protests in decades, with police firing rubber bullets and tear gas in chaotic scenes.Organizers read out a statement from Leung's parents that thanked the community and expressed hope Hong Kong would see better days.""Every brave Hong Konger going to the streets is doing so because they love Hong Kong so much,"" the message said.""Young people, please protect yourselves, and keep your body and soul together, then you have a chance to speak out about injustices in society."""
China vows to battle corruption in organ harvesting | CBC News,Surgeons from around the world gathered at a conference in Beijing on Monday in China's latest effort to fight persistent skepticism about whether its hospitals have stopped performing transplants with the organs of executed prisoners.,2016-10-17T13:21:07.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/organ-transplants-china-1.3808084,"Surgeons from around the world gathered at a conference in Beijing on Monday in China's latest effort to fight persistent skepticism about whether its hospitals have stopped performing transplants with the organs of executed prisoners.Doctors from the World Health Organization and the Montreal-based Transplantation Society who were invited to the conference by China praised Chinese officials for reforms they have made in the transplant system, including a ban put in place last year on using organs from executed inmates.Doubts persist that China is accurately reporting figures or meeting its pledge given its severe shortage of organ donors and China's long-standing black-market organ trade. By its own figures, China has one of the lowest rates of organ donation in the world, and even the system's advocates say it needs hundreds of additional hospitals and doctors.While China suppresses most discussions about human rights, government officials and state media have publicly talked about their commitment to ending a practice opposed by doctors and human rights groups due to fears that it promotes executions and coercion.In a sign of the issue's symbolic importance to China, the conference took place in an ornate, chandeliered ballroom inside the Great Hall of the People, the building next to Tiananmen Square that typically hosts foreign leaders and ceremonial Communist Party events.Doctors at the conference Monday described meeting patients and visiting hospitals around the country, and said the recorded usage of drugs given to transplant patients lined up with China's reported numbers of transplants.Dr. Jose Nunez, an adviser on organ transplants to the World Health Organization, told the audience that he believed China was building the ""next great"" system.""You are taking this country to a leading position within the transplantation world,"" he said.Others offered praise for Chinese officials, but stopped short of saying whether they could confirm China had stopped using executed inmates' organs.""It's not a matter for us to prove to you that it's zero,"" said Dr. Francis Delmonico, a longtime surgeon and a professor at Harvard Medical School. ""It's a matter for the government to fulfil what is the law, just as it is in the other countries of the world that we go to.""China is believed to perform more executions than any other country, though the government does not disclose how many.The former vice minister of health, Dr. Huang Jiefu, publicly acknowledged in 2005 that China harvested executed inmates' organs for transplant, and a paper he co-authored six years later reported that as many as 90 per cent of Chinese transplant surgeries using organs from dead people came from those put to death.Huang has also responded to a report earlier this year that a Canadian patient apparently received a kidney from an executed inmate by announcing that the doctor and the hospital in question were suspended from performing more transplants.A key impediment is that members of a donor's immediate family have the right to veto any transplant once the person is dead. There is also a traditional aversion to the removal of body parts from the dead and a fear that donated organs could be exploited for monetary gain.Dr. Philip O'Connell, the immediate past president of the Transplantation Society, told reporters later that he would work with doctors supporting reform in any country.""The options are that you completely isolate someone, which means that generally their practices get compounded, or you engage with them and you tell them your point of view and explain why it would be better for them to change,"" O'Connell said. ""That is, I think in the simple terms, what we're doing."""
Trudeau accuses China of violating diplomatic immunity in arrest of Michael Kovrig | CBC News,"Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is accusing China of ignoring the “principles of diplomatic immunity” by “arbitrarily and unfairly” detaining two Canadian citizens, one of which is a Canadian diplomat.",2019-01-12T00:26:04.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/trudeau-diplomatic-immunity-michael-kovrig-1.4975759,"Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is accusing China of ignoring the ""principles of diplomatic immunity"" by ""arbitrarily and unfairly"" detaining two Canadian citizens, one of whom is a Canadian diplomat on leave.It marks the first time Trudeau, or the Canadian government, have accused the Chinese government of violating the diplomatic immunity of Michael Kovrig, who was detained on Dec. 10 but was not granted consular access until four days later.Kovrig, who is an employee of Global Affairs Canada, is on leave from the department and working for the International Crisis Group, a non-governmental organization focused on resolution or prevention of violent conflict. According to a government official who spoke to CBC News, Kovrig was not travelling on a diplomatic passport.Kovrig and a second Canadian, Michael Spavor, were arrested in China in December after Canadian officials detained technology giant Huawei's chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, in Vancouver on an extradition request from the U.S.She was later granted bail and is now awaiting court proceedings.""Ms. Meng was given a hearing immediately,"" Trudeau said in Regina Friday. ""She was granted bail. She is now in her own home in Vancouver. This is the way we live up to our rules within our justice system.  ""It is unfortunate that China has arbitrarily and unfairly detained two Canadian citizens, and indeed, in one of the cases, is not respecting the principles of diplomatic immunity.""CBC NewsGuy Saint-Jacques, a former Canadian Ambassador to Beijing, oversaw Kovrig's work in the country. In an interview with The Canadian Press last month, Saint-Jacques said Kovrig's job as a diplomat was to monitor highly sensitive subjects.He said Kovrig tried to ""get the pulse"" of many groups, such as displaced Tibetans as well as Muslim minorities in the northwestern region of Xinjiang, where Beijing has been accused of mass detentions.""He went to remote locations trying to meet with people from these communities to try and understand what they were going through, in terms of the challenges they faced, protecting their cultures,"" Saint-Jacques told The Canadian Press. ""So, all of this, obviously, would have attracted the attention of security people.""Saint-Jacques said Chinese authorities maintain extensive files on all diplomats in China, especially those, like Kovrig, who speak fluent Mandarin.Kovrig continued reporting on sensitive subjects involving China after he joined the International Crisis Group as an adviser in February 2017. His work for the ICG has included the North Korean nuclear crisis, China's relationship with the U.S. and its presence in Africa.Chinese officials have said that the ICG is not registered in China and alleged its activities in the country are illegal.It was also revealed today that Scott Bradley has stepped down from his position as the vice-president of corporate affairs for Huawei Canada after working for the company for more than seven years.In a statement posted to Facebook, Bradley said 2018 was a time of ""both great success and significant challenges"" for the company, but added it ""is time for a change.""Bradley noted Jake Enwright, who was formerly Conservative Party Leader Andrew Scheer's spokesman, had joined the company last year and said ""his vision and strategic thinking are needed in leading the team moving forward.""Concerns have been expressed by Canada's allies about the degree to which Huawei can be trusted to take part in the next generation of mobile phone technology, called 5G. New Zealand and Australia have banned the use of Huawei products in their 5G network development, fearing Huawei could use its access to spy for the Chinese government. In August, U.S. President Donald Trump signed a bill imposing restrictions on government contracts with Huawei and ZTE, citing national security concerns.Last month, the U.K.'s BT Group said it would remove Huawei equipment from its existing 3G and 4G mobile operations.Huawei has long insisted that it is not a state-controlled company and denies engaging in intelligence work for the Chinese government. However, Chinese law dictates that companies must ""support, co-operate with and collaborate in national intelligence work."""

Canada-China canola spat threatens key export market | CBC News,A long-standing dispute involving Canadian canola exports to China threatens to overshadow Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's trip to the economic superpower that begins next week.,2016-08-26T16:35:37.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/canola-canada-china-1.3736908,"A long-standing dispute involving Canadian canola exports to China threatens to overshadow Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's trip to the economic superpower that begins next week.Canada says it wants the canola issue settled before relations between the two countries can move forward, while China has accused Ottawa of inflexibility and says it may look to other suppliers.​At stake is a significant customer for Canadian farmers. Canada currently ships about four million tonnes of canola seed — about 40 per cent of the country's canola seed exports — to China. That represents a market worth around $2 billion to Canada.The 6½-year spat centres on a disease known as blackleg that can affect canola, and the amount of dockage — the stems, pods, weeds and other plants — that winds up in shipments.The current maximum dockage rate of foreign materials is 2.5 per cent, but China, which is worried about the spread of blackleg to its domestic rapeseed crops, is insisting that the rate must be cut to one per cent, and has given Canada a Sept. 1 deadline to make that change.That deadline comes during Trudeau's China visit, which is slated for Aug. 30 to Sept. 6, and includes stops in Beijing, Shanghai, Hong Kong and Hangzhou for the G20 leaders' summit.A representative of Canada's canola industry said if the dockage rate is lowered, the country's big producers would have to look for other markets for their product.""Taking the dockage down to one per cent would mean a lot of additional cleaning, and it would cause significant slowdowns in a system that's really built to move bulk commodities to port and to customers very quickly,"" said Patti Miller, the president of the Canola Council of Canada, in a recent interview on CBC's The Exchange.""You could see some shipments go, you could see some smaller companies meet that demand, but the bulk of our exports would need to remain under current standards,"" she said.Canada is insisting that the 2.5 per cent dockage rate is backed up by science and that the risk of transmission of blackleg to China's crop is low, but China isn't accepting that, Miller said.Earlier this week,  International Trade Minister Chrystia Freeland told the Thomson Reuters news agency: ""We cannot take the next step in our relationship with China until the canola issue is resolved.""A spokesman for Freeland has said the canola issue is a priority for Canadian government officialsIn an interview with The Canadian Press, China's ambassador to Canada, Luo Zhaohui, said Ottawa has lacked flexibility in its negotiations.""Beijing thinks this is unfair,"" said Luo. ""Even so, I'm still quite optimistic and I wish, through joint efforts by both sides, we can resolve these issues,"" the ambassador added.Luo said China gets about 87 per cent of its canola from Canada, but he warned it could look to others sources if required.As canola is Canada's biggest cash crop, denial of entry into the Chinese market would affect farm incomes here, Miller warned."

Who would have imagined a wolf-size otter?"" said Denise Su, Cleveland Museum of Natural History curator of paleobotany and paleoecology.It had enlarged cheek teeth and strong jaws that appear to have been used for crunching hard objects, perhaps large shellfish and freshwater mollusks, and was capable of swimming in shallow, swampy waters.""I think it used its powerful jaws to crush hard clams for food, somewhat like modern sea otters, although the latter use stone tools to smash shells,"" said Xiaoming Wang, head of vertebrate paleontology at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County.""If Siamogale melilutra was not smart enough to figure out tools, perhaps the only option left was to develop more powerful jaws by increasing body size,"" Wang added.The fossils, found at a site in China's Yunnan Province, include a largely complete cranium and lower jaw, various teeth, and limb bones.The skull was crushed eons ago during the fossilization process. The researchers used sophisticated scanning to digitally reconstruct it, discovering it boasted a mix of otter-like and badger-like skull and dental traits.There was intense interest in the fossil site because an important prehistoric ape skull previously had been unearthed there. Others fossils found include elephants, rhinos, tapirs, deer, beavers, crocodiles and water birds including ducks, swans and cranes.The largest otter alive today is the South American giant river otter, weighing up to about 70 pounds. Otters belong to a mammalian family including the weasel, badger, marten and mink. The earliest-known otter lived about 18 million years ago. But otter evolution is not well understood, with fossils rare and scattered around the world.Siamogale melilutra may not be the largest otter ever, with fossils of another one that may be the biggest previously found in Africa.The research was published in the Journal of Systematic Palaeontology."
Saudi crown prince arrives in China to boost relations amid tensions with the West | CBC News,Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman arrived in China on Thursday on the latest stop of a sweep through Asia that seeks to boost relations with the kingdom's neighbours amid frictions with the West.,2019-02-21T23:15:38.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/saudi-prince-salman-china-uighur-visit-1.5028845,"Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman arrived in China on Thursday on the latest stop of a sweep through Asia that seeks to boost relations with the kingdom's neighbours amid frictions with the West.His visit follows trips to India and Pakistan, which send millions of labourers to Saudi Arabia and are seeking closer economic ties.He is to meet Chinese officials, including President Xi Jinping, on Friday, highlighting Saudi Arabia's importance as one of China's top oil suppliers and a market for its exports, including military drones.The visit underscores China's attempts to balance its relationships in the Middle East, a major component of its ""Belt and Road"" initiative to link its markets to those in Asia, Africa and Europe through rail and road networks and infrastructure such as power stations and factories.Bin Salman's visit to Beijing follows one earlier this week by a high-powered delegation from Saudi Arabia's chief strategic rival, Iran.At a meeting Wednesday, Xi told Iranian parliament Speaker Ali Larijani that ""China's resolve to develop a comprehensive strategic partnership with Iran will remain unchanged,"" regardless of the evolving international situation, according to China's official Xinhua News Agency.China has also pursued robust ties with Israel.Bin Salman's trip comes five months after he came under intense pressure in the U.S. and elsewhere following the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul. Some reports allege Khashoggi was killed on orders of the royal family. In the U.S. Congress, criticism over the kingdom's handling of the war in Yemen has also been building for months.China is facing growing international criticism over its treatment of its Muslim minority groups as part of a wide-ranging crackdown on religion and minority languages.Thus far, Turkey has been the only majority Muslim country to criticize Beijing, with its Foreign Ministry this month calling the treatment of minority Uighurs ""a great cause of shame for humanity"" and saying it is ""no longer a secret"" that China has arbitrarily detained more than a million Uighurs in ""concentration camps.""Saudi Arabia's Al Saud royal family has long cast itself as the defender of Muslims across the world. Its king describes himself as the protector of Islam's two holiest mosques at Medina and Mecca. Observant Muslims pray five times a day in the direction of the cube-shaped Kaaba at the mosque at Mecca.Saudi Arabia's silence on the Uighur issue is partly explained as a show of appreciation for China's non-interference policy in other states' domestic affairs, which contrasts with Western states' linkage of foreign and economic relations and human rights, said Jonathan Fulton, a political scientist at Abu Dhabi's Zayed University. It also reflects China's success in framing its policies toward Muslim minorities as a struggle against political Islam, Fulton said. ""Many Arab countries are also concerned with Islamist political groups ... and see these as ideological threats to their governments,"" he said.Commenting Wednesday on the crown prince's visit, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said recent years have ""seen a positive momentum in our co-operation with fruitful outcomes in various areas such as infrastructure and space satellites.""""We hope that through this visit we will enhance our relations enhance mutual trust, deepen co-operation ... and inject momentum into our bilateral relations,"" he said.Bin Salman is to visit South Korea after Beijing. In New Delhi, he offered intelligence sharing and other co-operation with India to help fight extremism and terrorism, as Prime Minister Narendra Modi tackles rising tensions with Pakistan following a suicide bombing last week targeting Indian paramilitary soldiers in disputed Kashmir."

Meng was detained in Vancouver on Dec. 1 for extradition at the request of U.S. officials, who accuse Huawei — a leading global supplier of telecommunications equipment — of using a Hong Kong shell company to sell equipment to Iran in violation of American sanctions.Canadian officials were quick to push back against the detentions of Kovrig and Spavor. Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland said the government is ""deeply concerned"" by the ""arbitrary detention"" of the two men.PoliticsMalley said his company is working to secure his employee's freedom.""Michael [Kovrig] was not doing anything that other people would not have been doing,"" he said.Malley said Kovrig was in China to talk to officials and members of the diplomatic community about the situation on the Korean peninsula and China's investments in Africa.During a rare news conference on Thursday in Beijing, China's top prosecutor, Zhang Jun, weighed in on Kovrig and Spavor's detention, saying ""there is no doubt"" the two Canadians ""violated the laws of our country.""  ""Now, it is proper for them to be investigated,"" Zhang said. ""I believe the case will move forward in accordance with the procedures.""Malley said he wouldn't comment on whether China is a safe destination for business travellers, but argued the Chinese are playing this situation badly.""This is not the message they want to be sending,"" he said, adding that if the two men were to be released soon, it would send a reassuring signal to the international business community.According to Statistics Canada, Canada imported $45.4 billion in goods and services from China in 2017, while exporting $28.8 billion to China.While Freeland wouldn't say whether the Canadians' detentions look like retaliation for Meng's arrest, she said it would be ""highly inappropriate"" if that were the case.The NationalChina has suggested Canada's allies are hypocrites for expressing concern about the detention of the two Canadians while not speaking out against Meng's arrest in Vancouver.Despite the current state of tension between Ottawa and Beijing, Canadian senators and MPs will be visiting China this week on a trip hosted by the Canada-China Legislative Association.Senators Victor Oh and Joseph Day, and MPs Michael Cooper, Geng Tan, Majid Jowhari and Chandra Arya will arrive in China on Jan. 5."

The partnerships to run classes in Canadian schools are signed between Beijing and provincial authorities here.Peterson told The Current's guest host Gillian Findlay that as part of those deals, schools in Canada receive ""valuable financial arrangements and incentives like trips to China for teachers and students,"" as well as building economic ties that can be important to the wider community.""The Chinese government uses these financial levers to gain access to a vulnerable population — students — whose minds are not yet aware of what's happening in China,"" she said.Peterson called it a ""soft power operation,"" and argued that it was inappropriate for foreign governments to fund Canadian school systems.""Foreign governments should not be funding classrooms, and should not be choosing the textbooks and sending over, hiring and vetting the teachers,"" she said.Following complaints from parents, New Brunswick's education minister Dominic Cardy has said he wants the Confucius Institute out of the province's schools by the end of the year.Cardy said it's clear to him the program's real mandate is to present a ""one-dimensional"" view of China and to influence students to only perceive the country in a positive light.Premier Blaine Higgs later said the government may not be able to back out of the program as quickly as Cardy wants, because the contract runs to 2022.The original 2007 contract allowed either side to cancel it with six months' notice, but the 2017 renewal agreement removed that clause at China's request.In 2014, the Toronto District School Board voted to remove the institute from their schools following protests.The Current contacted the Confucius Institute in New Brunswick, and Hanban, the Chinese government agency responsible for the institutes. Neither returned our request for comment.In a statement, the Confucius Institute in the U.S. told The Current that it recognizes ""discussions about Chinese government and political issues are important for education,"" but that ""those discussions should and can take place in the host institution's politics, history, international affairs, or Asian studies departments.""""Nothing about the Confucius Institute programs prevent that from happening,"" the statement continued.Wenran Jiang characterized New Brunswick's move to stop the classes as ""arbitrary"" and ""undemocratic.""With more than 5,450 students taking the classes in the province, ""there were merely five complaints so far to the minister, which is one-tenth of one per cent,"" said Jiang, an adjunct professor at the school of public policy and global affairs at the University of British Columbia.He argued that if Cardy wants to uphold democratic values, ""he should listen to the 99.9 per cent of the people who did not complain.""CBC NewsJiang told Findlay that the Confucius Institute's curriculum is designed to be neutral, focusing on language, and cultural expressions such as food or clothing.""It's not designed to teach human rights, or Chinese politics or international relations,"" he said.Jiang said that concerns are motivated by sinophobia, adding that the Chinese government does not export ""its ideologies around the world.""Click 'listen' near the top of this page to hear the full conversation.Written by Padraig Moran, with files from CBC News.

Could China become a hockey powerhouse? | CBC Radio,"This Saturday, the World Cup of hockey gets underway in Toronto. It includes the usual suspects - Russia, Canada, the U.S. and Sweden.

Canada, the United States, Russia and Sweden are traditionally dominant teams.But right now in China, hockey is quickly growing, with the goal of becoming a more powerful player on the world scene.That's something Boston Bruins' left winger Matt Beleskey saw first hand. This summer he travelled to China to teach hockey skills as part of the Bruins' hockey camps. He explains how the opportunity arose to Day 6 host, Brent Bambury.""The PR guy from our team, Eric Tosi, came up and asked 'would you and your wife be willing to travel to China to help spread the game and grow the game,"" says Beleskey.Beleskey says he was surprised at how advanced the children were at playing hockey.""Going over there I didn't really have an idea as to where their skill level was going to be at,"" he says. ""It may be a little naive, but I thought I was going to be teaching more skating stride and everything, but the kids knew the fundamentals very well.""Beleskey was impressed with the players, as well as their coaches.""They really are goal-oriented. They look at the fundamentals and the skill aspect quite in depth. So their room for improvement is learning the flow of the game, ""says Beleskey. ""Their hockey sense needs to improve a little bit.""The kids in the hockey camp were aged from six through eight, and Beleskey says they reminded him of himself at that age.""They were out there early, staying out late, just working hard, smiling, laughing with each other. I think that's what hockey's really about.""Beleskey doesn't speak Mandarin and so worked with a translator while teaching at the camp. But he says he was impressed with how much English the kids knew.""I could tell when I was talking to them, they could pick up a lot of words. And some of them could actually speak good English back to me.""He says a lot of the kids asked about the height of his teammate, Zdeno Chára, who stands at 2.06 m.""I just said too big,"" laughs Beleskey. ""He's huge.""Some things transcended the language barrier in China, particularly when Beleskey showed the kids cellphone videos of some of his NHL fights.""They were kind of impressed and shocked that you're allowed to do that. I don't know it goes over in their culture, but I think anyone can pick up on that,"" he says with a chuckle. ""To see their faces was pretty priceless.""Beijing is hosting the 2022 Olympic Winter Games, and developing the country's hockey skills is part of their Games plan.""You know, anytime China hosts an event they really want to do well in it, and I'm sure their training regimen will be stepping up in the future."""

Stocks plunge for 2nd day on U.S.-China trade jitters | CBC News,"Stocks took a dive Tuesday morning, with the New York indexes at one point down more than two per cent, amid increased anxiety over the tariff war between China and the U.S. It is the second day of volatility over the trade issue.",2019-05-07T15:43:10.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/stocks-plunge-u-s-china-trade-1.5126051,"Stocks took a dive Tuesday morning, with the New York indexes at one point down more than two per cent, amid increased anxiety over the tariff war between China and the U.S. It is the second day of volatility over the trade issue.Beijing said its top economic adviser will go to Washington for trade talks despite U.S. President Donald Trump's threat to raise tariffs by the end of the week, but China hinted at retaliation for the aggressive tactics.Investors fear the world's two largest economies will fail to reach a compromise and the fallout will be a downturn in global growth.The Dow closed down 1.8 per cent or 473 points to 25,965 and the broader S&P lost 48 points or 1.7 per cent to 2,884. The Nasdaq fell more steeply, losing 1.8 per cent or 159 points, as tech stocks such as Apple and Microsoft are heavily exposed to China.The S&P remains up more than 15 per cent on the year and stocks have had a long bull run, but traders are predicting more volatility in the weeks ahead.In Toronto, the TSX lost a more modest 135 points or 0.8 per cent to 16,357 as oil fell in response to the trade tensions.The main North American crude contract, West Texas Intermediate, was down $1.02 at $61.21 US a barrel, while Brent crude fell $1.66 to $69.58 US.Benchmarks in London and Tokyo declined, while Shanghai, Hong Kong and Sydney rose.""The market had been widely anticipating a positive resolution to the trade dispute and it looks like it's going to be more difficult than that,"" said Larry Berman, ETF Capital Management.He said investors should brace for weeks of uncertainty, with the complicating factor that we are late in a market cycle.""I suspect this could get a lot worse before we see a resolution. I suspect China is going to call his bluff and he will institute the tariffs and that's going to be bad for global trade,"" Berman said.Trump threatened to raise tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods to 25 per cent from 10 per cent, effective Friday. He said he would impose increases on an additional $325 billion of imports, covering everything China sells to the United States.Businesses have said in earnings calls that a round of 25 per cent tariffs will seriously impede growth.The Chinese government said Vice Premier Liu He will go to Washington as planned, dispelling fears he might cancel after Trump threatened to escalate a fight. ""The base case still remains we see a framework agreement reached, but the market is still re-pricing in the risk,"" Edward Moya of Oanda said in a report.In early trading, London's FTSE 100 lost 1.6 per cent  to 7260 and Tokyo's Nikkei 225 plunged 1.5 per cent to 21,923 as trading resumed following a week-long holiday.The Euro Stoxx composite index fell 1.8 per cent after the European Union's executive commission trimmed its forecast for eurozone economic growth this year to 1.2 per cent from 1.3 per cent.The Shanghai Composite Index gained 0.7 per cent to 2,926.39 and Hong Kong's Hang Seng added 0.5 per cent to 29,363.02. Sydney's S&P-ASX 200 picked up 0.2 per cent to 6,295.70 and benchmarks in New Zealand, Taiwan and Singapore advanced.India's Sensex was off 26 points at 38,580.44.Trump's threat Sunday revived jitters that had been largely put to rest by statements from both sides that negotiations were making progress. The American president accused Beijing of backtracking on commitments made in the rapid-fire negotiations.The Trump administration is pressing Beijing to roll back plans for government-led development of Chinese global competitors in robotics, electric cars and other technologies. Trump accused China of reneging on promises to open its markets and made claims those developments in China are based in part on stolen technology.""Beijing is not a big fan of hostage situations,"" said Vishnu Varathan of Mizuho Bank in a report. ""The tight deadline alongside threats of widening the tariff net may not play out favourably for prospects of an imminent deal."""
"140 international scholars, former diplomats urge China to release 2 Canadians | CBC News","A group of 140 academics, former diplomats, and others from around the world are urging China to immediately release of two detained Canadians, warning the situation is causing a chill on China's relations around the world.",2019-01-21T19:39:52.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/academics-diplomats-letter-china-1.4986797,"A group of 140 academics, former diplomats and other officials from around the world are urging China to immediately release two detained Canadians, warning the situation is causing a chill on China's relations around the world.In a letter to Chinese President Xi Jinping, the distinguished collective describes Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor as men who are devoted to building relations between China and other countries. Both have worked to gain a better understanding of China's positions on international issues through meetings with officials, researchers and scholars, it says.""These meetings and exchanges are the foundation of serious research and diplomacy around the world, including for Chinese scholars and diplomats. However, Kovrig and Spavor's detentions send a message that this kind of constructive work is unwelcome and even risky in China,"" the letter reads.Kovrig and Spavor were detained last month on alleged national security offences, not long after Canada arrested Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou at the request of the U.S.Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said the detentions are in retaliation for Meng's arrest, calling them ""arbitrary.""The signatories are from Canada and around the globe, including the United States, the United Kingdom, Sweden, Australia, Germany, Japan and Italy. In their letter, the academics and former envoys say they are ""deeply concerned"" about the detentions.""We who share Kovrig and Spavor's enthusiasm for building genuine, productive, and lasting relationships must now be more cautious about travelling and working in China and engaging our Chinese counterparts,"" the letter reads. ""That will lead to less dialogue and greater distrust, and undermine efforts to manage disagreements and identify common ground. Both China and the rest of the world will be worse off as a result.""The two men face up to four hours of questioning each day and have no access to a lawyer, according to Canada's top diplomat in Beijing.Kovrig and Spavor were both detained in China late last year. The men, who were arrested not long after Canada arrested Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou at the request of the U.S., stand accused of national security offences.Conservative MP Michael Cooper, who just returned from a trip to China with a parliamentary delegation — which was arranged prior to the arrests, to deal with various diplomatic issues — said Canadian officials conveyed the message that until the two men are released, ""it's not business as usual"" between the two countries.There was some pushback from some Chinese officials who focused on Meng's arrest, said Cooper. He said the Canadians tried to explain that that arrest was not a political decision, but was within the purview of Canada's independent courts.""That was something that was perhaps difficult for them to fully understand, given the fact the Chinese court system is by no means independent,"" he said. Cooper repeated the Conservative position that it is time for Trudeau to intervene to try and de-escalate bilateral tensions.""It's clear that this situation isn't getting any better, and in light of that, what is required is intervention by Canadian officials at the highest levels, chief among them the prime minister,"" he said.Last week, Canada's Ambassador to China John McCallum said the detained men are questioned for up to four hours a day, do not have access to a lawyer, and have consular assistance restricted to one visit per month.Those conditions could continue for up to six months under China's extra-judicial system, he said.McCallum has visited both men in prison and met with their families. He has also met with Robert Schellenberg, a Canadian convicted of drug smuggling in China who recently had his 15-year prison sentence changed to a death sentence after a retrial.Canada has issued an updated travel advisory for China, warning its citizens about the risk of arbitrary enforcement of laws in the country. Just hours later, China issued its own travel warning, citing the ""arbitrary detention"" of a Chinese national in Canada at the request of a ""third-party country."" "

Lee's chip left Korda with an 18-footer for eagle from off the back edge that she missed to the left.""It was a good fight out there, and I fought to the end,"" Lee said.Ariya Jutanugarn tied Lee with a two-stroke swing on the par-3 17th, then hooked her 3-wood drive into the water on 18 to end her chances for a tour-high sixth victory.""I knew that I had a good opportunity, but I wasn't getting ahead of myself,"" Lee said. ""I knew Jess was going to make birdie — was probably going to make birdie — and so I thought to myself, `I need to make birdie here.'

The defending champion next week in Malaysia, the 23-year-old American birdied the par-3 11th and par-5 14th. She three-putted the par-4 16th for a bogey, charging a 25-footer 15 feet long.""I think considering we had zero preparation for the tournament and came in on Wednesday, I think I would have taken a second place if you would have told me that that's what I would have gotten,"" Korda said. ""We didn't get a lot of preparation.

Ko and Jutanugarn are playing next week in Kuala Lumpur.Thailand's Pornanong Phatlum (72) and Germany's Caroline Masson (73) tied for a distant fourth at 6 under. England's Charley Hull (69) was 5 under, and Sweden's Pernilla Lindberg (72) 4 under.Brooke Henderson (71) was 3 under. The 19-year-old Canadian has played all four weeks in Asia and plans to make it six in a row with stops in Malaysia and Japan.Michelle Wie was one of the 13 players to break par, closing with a 74 to tie for 10th at 1 under.

A recent CBC Marketplace investigation uncovered that the recyclable coffee cups the chain uses frequently end up at a landfill, even if customers throw them into recycling bins inside Tim Hortons locations.Broadly speaking, permanent dishes are a greener option than disposables because they can be cleaned and used repeatedly rather than end up in a landfill or recycling depot after one use.On its website, Tim Hortons trumpets its plates and mugs for their environmental benefits. ""Tim Hortons is one of the few quick service restaurants to offer china mugs, plates and bowls to guests eating in our restaurants,"" the company says. ""This helps to reduce paper waste being created in the first place."""

It's believed the female tabby survived by licking condensation that had formed on the walls of the container.,2019-04-09T16:42:06.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/cat-shipping-container-china-prince-george-bc-1.5090566,"An orange tabby cat is likely to have used up more than a few of its nine lives during an unauthorized trip from China to British Columbia.The North Cariboo District Branch of the B.C. SPCA says the emaciated, six-year-old female was found inside a shipping container loaded nearly a month ago in Shenzhen.The container arrived by freighter in the Port of Vancouver and was shipped to Prince George, where the unnamed cat was found among the pallets, shredded cardboard and foam pellets inside the container.The animal had no food or water but it's believed it survived by licking condensation that had formed on the walls of the shipping container.Animal control officers say the feline weighed just 1½ kilograms when it was found by staff at a Prince George auto glass distribution company as they unpacked the crates.The cat is quarantined while being nursed back to health and the SPCA estimates the cost to save it will reach almost $2,800.Alex Schare with North Cariboo District SPCA says she knew right away that the cat would have an amazing story, but would also require life-saving care following weeks of starvation.""We rushed her to the vet because she was in such poor condition that we knew she would require intensive veterinary care for an extended period of time to regain her strength,'' Schare says in a news release.The cat is on fluids and is receiving small amounts of food to ensure its body adjusts properly to renewed nutrition.The strict quarantine is to ensure no diseases are passed to people or animals in this country.""She has also undergone blood work and will receive a rabies vaccine and dental work when she is strong enough,'' the release says.Quarantine won't end until two weeks after the rabies shot, so the cat will be under care for some time. The SPCA is appealing for donations to help defray the costs."
"China money, market spur Canadian blueberry deluge | CBC News","Chinese wealth fuelling real estate booms in New York, Sydney and San Francisco is also contributing to an unexpected glut of blueberries.",2016-08-04T16:09:02.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/blueberries-blueberry-bc-market-china-money-land-1.3707048,"An aging mansion sits vacant on an estate outside Vancouver, the garage overtaken by a blueberry sorter and a walk-in cooler packed with the fruit.The owner, an investor from mainland China, leases the estate to Fred Liu at such a bargain the farmer grows blueberries in its fields even though the bottom has fallen out of the market.As it turns out, the same wave of Chinese wealth that has fuelled real estate booms in cities like New York, Sydney and San Francisco and stoked the art market worldwide also has contributed to an unexpected glut of blueberries.Chinese investors riding a hot property market along the Pacific Coast have socked millions into a belt of protected farmland around Vancouver, long a destination for Asian immigrants, and many have taken advantage of Canadian agricultural tax breaks, agents and farmers said.Because much of the land is restricted to farming, rents have remained stubbornly low.Veteran farmers and entrepreneurial newcomers have snapped up the cheap leases, eager to cash in on the blueberry's ascent as a super food and the promise that a trade deal with China would open the world's second-largest economy to fresh Canadian exports.But demand has yet to meet bullish projections.Delayed trade negotiations and a surge in global blueberry production has prevented China's rising middle class from eating enough of the British Columbia bumper crop that Chinese investors helped sow.The result: a bubble for Vancouver area farmland and a bust for berries.Prices for rural property near Vancouver have surged - hitting, in one recent deal, 230 times the per-acre average for Canadian farmland.While blueberry prices have collapsed, dropping to less than a dollar per pound at peak season, half what some growers said they were getting a few years ago.Norm Letnick, British Columbia's agriculture minister, said he doesn't see it as a glut, and he downplayed the sharp price drop at packing houses.Growers may be doing better at roadside stands, he said.""Because they don't have a middle man, they might be making very good net profit.""For many farmers, that view misses the bigger picture.""Rich people, they can buy the farms, but they don't want to do the farming,"" said Liu, who grows organic berries for export to Asia.""It's very, very, very cheap to lease their farmland...[but] farmers are not getting rich.""About half the listings in recent years for smaller farms and nearly all the larger ones near Vancouver have been purchased by buyers with ties to mainland China, agents said.Canada doesn't track the nationality of property owners, and British Columbia only began doing so in June.It reported 18 per cent of sales in recent weeks in Richmond, home to one of the most well-established Chinese communities in Canada, were to unspecified foreign nationals living abroad.Chinese nationals with resident status in Canada were excluded.The buying spree has set records.A 4.5-acre blueberry farm with no house sold late last year to a Chinese investor for $2.58 million, that is $573,000 per acre.Nationwide, farmland averages $2,460 per acre, according to Farm Credit Canada.The British Columbia Blueberry Council, a trade group representing hundreds of growers, said much of the interest was from Chinese business people who see berry farms as an export opportunity, much like those who have bought vineyards in recent years to export British Columbia wine to China.Real estate agents said some Chinese nationals were looking at the redevelopment potential, viewing farms as lottery tickets that would pay out if urban sprawl one day forces officials to scrap strict prohibitions.""They're playing the long game,"" said agent Michael Lu.Others have built luxurious estate homes with an eye toward retirement and surrounded them with berries.Owners cut their taxes by using the land for farming, often leasing it out to local growers.Owners like blueberries because they are pretty and easy to maintain, especially compared to the province's No. 2 produce export - mushrooms.The province produces 80 percent by value of fresh blueberries exported by Canada, the world's No. 2 producer.Like farmers elsewhere, they went big into blueberries, encouraged that the touted health benefits would stoke the market.They also were banking on trade talks with China.A China cherry deal, finalized in 2014, boosted export values 70 percent in one year.Newcomers have leased plots from absentee landlords because they can't afford to buy their own, and long-established farm families have rented additional plots because they are cheap.Together, they pushed British Columbia's blueberry yields up 71 percent from 2010 to 2015."
How China's 'social credit' system blocked millions of people from travelling | CBC Radio,"Since 2014, the Chinese government has been experimenting with a system that rewards — and punishes — people for their public behaviour through so-called ""social credit"" points. We hear from experts worried about government control, and people who say those fears are overblown.",2019-03-07T20:45:31.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/radio/thecurrent/the-current-for-march-7-2019-1.5046443/how-china-s-social-credit-system-blocked-millions-of-people-from-travelling-1.5046445,"Read Story TranscriptMillions of people were blocked from buying airline tickets or booking train journeys in China last year after being blacklisted under the country's controversial ""social credit"" system.The National Public Credit Information Center revealed in its annual report that people with low scores had been blocked from buying airline tickets 17.5 million times in 2018, according to the Associated Press.People were barred from buying train tickets 5.5 million times, and 128 people were blocked from leaving the country due to unpaid taxes, the report said. Additionally, there were 290,000 instances where a person's low score stopped them from getting a senior management job or acting as a company's legal representative.""If you're on one of these blacklists, you are barred from buying luxury goods on some of China's online shopping platforms, you can't buy a plane ticket, you can't get a mortgage,"" said Nathan Vanderklippe, the Globe and Mail's Asia correspondent.""In some places, if you are on this blacklist, there's been experiments where the government will automatically change your cellphone ringtone,"" he told The Current's Anna Maria Tremonti.""So if your friends call you, instead of hearing a phone ringing, they get a message saying this person's on the blacklist, as a method of public shaming.""Originally conceived in the 1990s, the Chinese government has been experimenting with the current form of the social credit system since 2014. Citizens have points deducted from their score for breaking the law or more minor offences like walking a dog without a leash. Currently, the system is only in effect in certain areas, run by local officials. But the Chinese government wants to have it implemented across the whole country by 2020.While a low score can limit your chances of getting a government job, Vanderklippe pointed out that under the system, citizens also receive rewards for good behaviour.""You can earn points for example by volunteering, perhaps by donating blood, by doing things that are considered pro-social,"" he said.That could result in financial advantages like lower heating bills, or perks and bonuses when booking hotels, he said.Human Rights Watch has called the system an attempt by Chinese authorities to ""create a reality in which bureaucratic pettiness could significantly limit people's rights,"" but one legal expert says those fears are overblown.""I understand why people worry about this because it does seem like a big overreach, collecting these massive amounts of data,"" said Jamie Horsley, senior fellow and lecturer at Yale Law School's Paul Tsai China Center.""It clearly could be abused. I mean, we all worry about the privacy issues,"" she told Tremonti.""But this system doesn't just sweep in all kinds of information. It has to be that there has been a fine imposed, or a court judgment, and information about that specific act gets put in the system.""The WeeklyShe pointed out that the system has encouraged people to obey the law, and pay fines promptly when there are infractions.""It's ... been very effective, and one thing that never seems to be reported is that people are getting off the blacklist as well as being put on them,"" she said.""So something seems to be working."" While the west may view the social credit system ""as a form of state repression tool,"" Lynette Ong argued that view isn't shared everywhere in China.""From the Chinese perspective … they see this as a form of social management,"" said Ong, associate professor of political science at the University of Toronto.In China, which has a population of almost 1.4 billion, there is ""very low trust among strangers, much lower than in our society,"" she told Tremonti.""I think they see [the] social credit system as a way to collect data and build a database, for people to be discerning of who is actually trustworthy,"" she said.However, Ong suggested that the system may be impossible to implement across a country as vast as China.""With slowing growth in China, this needs a lot of resources to fully implement this. And where is the money coming from? I think people are going to question whether it is OK to spend so much money in social credit.""Click 'listen' near the top of the page to hear the full conversation.Written by Padraig Moran.

"Starbucks will deliver from 4,000 stores in the U.S., China | CBC News","The company says it will offer delivery from 2,000 U.S. stores by next summer through a partnership with Uber Eats. It isn't yet saying which stores will offer it.",2018-12-14T15:53:18.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/starbucks-delivery-us-china-1.4946187,"Starbucks is expanding delivery to more stores in the U.S. and China as it tries to accelerate growth in those two markets.The company says it will offer delivery from 2,000 U.S. stores by next summer through a partnership with Uber Eats. It isn't yet saying which stores will offer the service.In China, delivery will be offered from 2,000 stores in 30 cities by the end of this year, up from 150 stores at the end of September. Starbucks began working with its Chinese delivery partner, Ele.me, three months ago.Starbucks made the comments at an investor presentation Thursday in New York. The Seattle-based company said it has simplified its business in recent years — by closing its Teavana stores and selling many European stores to franchisees, for example — so it can focus more directly on the U.S. and China.In the U.S., its largest market, Starbucks says it still sees significant opportunities to expand and expects to open 550 net new stores annually over the next few years. The company also plans to close 150 underperforming stores in 2019.In China, Starbucks plans to open 600 stores annually through 2022, bringing it to a total of 6,000 stores.Delivery is one area where it could expand. Investors questioned the economics of Uber Eats, asking whether Starbucks will earn less because of the fees Uber charges.Roz Brewer, Starbucks' group president of the Americas, said the company is still studying that. In Miami, where it has been running a pilot program with 200 stores, she said the company has found that delivery works best in dense urban areas where Uber Eats' delivery fees are lower because of high demand.And CEO Kevin Johnson noted that customers are spending two to three times more on delivery orders than they would in the store, so that makes the partnership more appealing.Johnson says Starbucks has learned a lot about delivery since launching it in China in September. The company has special spill-proof cups, for example, and is making beverages hotter so they will be the right temperature to drink when they arrive.Johnson said the company has also opened two small kitchens in the back of grocery stores in China so it can quickly fulfil delivery orders. That is one idea that could eventually come to the U.S., he said. The company is also packing orders in tamper-resistant bags, so customers will feel more comfortable getting them from a third-party driver.Johnson said it's difficult to say what percentage of orders either in the U.S. or China will eventually come from delivery. Starbucks' mobile ordering and payment for pickup in U.S. stores more than doubled to 12 per cent of orders between 2016 and 2018, and that could also happen with digital ordering, he said.""Customer behaviours are shifting rapidly,"" Johnson told The Associated Press. ""We must continue to adapt and adapt rapidly to meet our customers where they are.""Even as it's expanding delivery, Starbucks is continuing to try to improve its in-store experience. Brewer said Starbucks plans to renovate one-third of its U.S. stores this year to add equipment and redo delivery and mobile pickup areas.Starbucks is also opening a high-end Reserve Roastery in New York on Friday. The 23,000-square-foot store includes a bar with coffee- and tea-themed cocktails, Italian pastries and rare small-batch coffees roasted on site.Johnson said Starbucks plans to open two more roasteries, in Tokyo and Chicago, next year, but hasn't committed to more after that. The company also has them in Seattle, Shanghai and Milan.""It acts as a brand amplifier,"" Johnson said, noting that customers are still lining up to get inside the Shanghai store a year after its opening."

WTO says China can apply $3.6B worth of retaliatory sanctions to U.S. imports | CBC News,A World Trade Organization (WTO) panel said on Friday that China was entitled to slap compensatory sanctions on U.S. imports worth $3.579 billion annually for the U.S. failure to remove anti-dumping duties — roughly half the amount China had sought.,2019-11-01T16:42:58.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/wto-china-us-dispute-1.5344444,"A World Trade Organization (WTO) panel said on Friday that China was entitled to slap compensatory sanctions on U.S. imports worth $3.579 billion US annually for the United States' failure to remove anti-dumping duties – roughly half the amount China had sought.The decision came as the world's two biggest economies try to clinch Phase 1 of a trade deal. U.S. President Donald Trump and U.S. negotiators are ""very optimistic"" about concluding it, White House adviser Larry Kudlow said.In the WTO ruling, a three-member arbitration panel said Chinese exporters suffered impairment to trade valued at $3.579 billion annually. China may now ask the WTO's Dispute Settlement Body for a green light to impose the retaliatory tariffs on imported U.S. goods valued up to that amount each year.China told the WTO in September 2018 that it had suffered $7.043 billion in damages annually due to U.S. anti-dumping duties ruled illegal by a WTO panel in 2016 and later upheld. China therefore requested permission to raise trade barriers on U.S. goods to the same amount, as allowed under WTO rules.As the Trump administration objected to the amount, the issue was sent to arbitration.The case relates to U.S. dumping duties on industries including machinery and electronics, light industry, metals and minerals, and the U.S. Commerce Department's way of calculating the amount of ""dumping"" — Chinese exports that are priced to undercut American-made goods on the U.S. market.The U.S. calculation method, known as ""zeroing,"" tended to increase the level of U.S. anti-dumping duties on foreign producers and was repeatedly ruled to be illegal in a series of trade disputes brought to the WTO.The U.S. Trade Representative's office in Washington had no immediate response."

CBC has not independently verified the authenticity of the footage.Sintash's father Qurban Mamut, a friend of Heyit's, is one of an estimated one million Uighur Muslims locked up in massive Chinese detention or ""re-education"" camps. He spoke to As It Happens host Carol Off from his home in Chantilly, Va. Here is part of their conversation: First there were these rumours of his death and then this video that purports to show Abdurehim Heyit alive. So what has this been like for you in the past days as you watch this unfold?Recently, we received the news about his death, so the Uighur diaspora around the world, we are shocked about the news.We see the video, and it makes us even more angry.In two days we got two kinds of emotion, and the second one is even worse. My father is in detention camps right now. Actually, we call it concentration camps. We all speak up: ""Where's our family? If you can show Abdurehim Heyit's video, show our family members' video right now."" Abdurrehim Heyit ölmedi, Türkiye Dışişleri’nin <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/Xinjiang?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#Xinjiang</a> iddiaları asılsız.

And this raises now questions as to why Chinese authorities can't confirm or give videos of all the other Uighurs who they have detained, including your father.We are demanding: ""You have to show all of our Uighurs, including not the famous people. Like somebody's mother or son or anyone.""[Heyit] says in the video that he is there because of having violated Chinese law. Why do you think that they have detained Mr. Heyit?This is so funny. No one will believe in that because Mr. Heyit is one of the most well-known and most respected Uighur artists.He did nothing against China's law, China's politics. He's just — he's an artist.China arrested him only because of his fame.There are hundreds of Uighur famous people — professors at universities, artists, writers — a lot of people are in the camps. People who are reporting on this say that the Communist Party of China is doing this, arresting Uighurs, because it has some kind of a social engineering plan — that it wants to, well, eliminate that Uighur identity. Why would it be so important to have a man who's a singer arrested? They're doing social engineering by starting the arrests of famous Uighurs like my father and Abdurehim Heyit. That means that one step [is] to destroy our culture. The other step [is] to stop [us] experiencing our own culture and the language, also religion.Then, who knows what will happen to the next generation of Uighurs?When was the last time you had any contact, any word, with your father?I lost connection with my family members since February 2018.Even before that time, I ask my mother to let my father pick [up] the phone. She said, ""Your father's not here.""At the time, I didn't realize he's in a detention camp. Is it dangerous, then, to ask your family what's going on and have those conversations on the phone?It's dangerous to call to them right now. ... If I call to them, this will be a reason they are taken to camps.There's been so little international condemnation or outcry about what's happened to the Uighurs. But we've just seen Turkey has issued a very forceful statement calling on China to close these camps. ... What does that mean for Uighurs?We are so happy with Turkey's action. ... [If] Western countries and Islamic countries join together and do some kind of political pressure to China, then we can save those Uighurs.Written by Sheena Goodyear with files from The Associated Press.

Stock markets remain jittery even as Trump and China try to ease trade war fears | CBC News,"The United States and China sought to ease trade war tensions on Monday, with Beijing calling for calm and U.S. President Donald Trump predicting a deal after markets fell in response to new tariffs from both countries.",2019-08-26T00:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/trump-china-markets-trade-1.5259741,"The United States and China sought to ease trade war tensions on Monday, with Beijing calling for calm and U.S. President Donald Trump predicting a deal after markets fell in response to new tariffs from both countries.Trump, speaking on the sidelines of the G7 summit of world leaders in France, said Chinese officials had contacted U.S. trade counterparts overnight and offered to return to the negotiating table.Vice-Premier Liu He, who has been leading the talks with Washington, said on Monday China was willing to resolve the trade dispute through ""calm"" negotiations and resolutely opposed the escalation of the conflict.Trump welcomed that language and, days after referring to President Xi Jinping as an enemy, heaped praise on his Chinese counterpart.""They want calm, and that's a great thing, frankly. And one of the reasons that he's a great leader, President Xi, and one of the reasons that China's a great country is they understand how life works,"" Trump said.""China called last night our top trade people and said 'Let's get back to the table', so we'll be getting back to the table, and I think they want to do something,"" he said.In Beijing, Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said he had not heard that a phone call between the two sides had taken place. However, China's Commerce Ministry typically releases statements on trade calls. It did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The increasingly bitter trade war between the world's two largest economies escalated on Friday, with both sides levelling more tariffs on each other's exports.Trump announced an additional duty on some $550 billion of targeted Chinese goods, hours after China unveiled retaliatory tariffs on $75 billion worth of U.S. goods.On Sunday, the White House said Trump regretted not raising the tariffs even more. But the president also appeared to back off of his threat to order U.S. companies out of China.Liu, speaking at a tech conference in southwest China's Chongqing, said nobody benefited from a trade war.""We are willing to resolve the issue through consultations and co-operation in a calm attitude and resolutely oppose the escalation of the trade war,"" Liu, who is Xi's top economic adviser, said, according to a government transcript.""We believe that the escalation of the trade war is not beneficial for China, the United States, nor to the interests of the people of the world,"" he said.The trade war has damaged global growth and raised market fears that the world economy will tip into recession.Geng, the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, said China would retaliate if Trump enforced the latest U.S. tariffs.Asked if he would abandon the tariffs, Trump said: ""Anything is possible. I can say we are having very meaningful talks, much more meaningful I would say than any time, frankly.""Before Trump spoke on Monday, global stock markets reeled, while China's yuan currency fell to an 11-year low. Investors streamed into the safe harbours of sovereign bonds and gold.The U.S. president, who at times predicts a deal will happen and at other times says he is happy with the tariff situation, said talks would start again soon and a deal would come.""I think we are going to have a deal,"" he said.The two sides had been slated to meet in September in Washington, but it was unclear last week whether the new tariff tit-for-tat would alter those plans.The United States accuses China of multiple economic sins, including intellectual property theft, currency manipulation, and forced technology transfer by U.S. companies to their Chinese partners as a requirement for doing business in China. China denies the U.S. allegations.Beijing and Washington were close to a deal last spring but U.S. officials said China backed away from an agreed text over a reluctance to change laws to address U.S. complaints.The trade war has affected businesses all over the world and disrupted supply chains. Trump recently urged U.S. companies to move their operations out of China, but it was not clear how or whether his efforts to order such a move would work.Liu said on Monday: ""We welcome enterprises from all over the world, including the United States, to invest and operate in China.""We will continue to create a good investment environment, protect intellectual property rights, promote the development of smart intelligent industries with our market open, resolutely oppose technological blockades and protectionism, and strive to protect the completeness of the supply chain.""U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Trump could order companies out of China under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act if he declared a national emergency.Chinese state media on Monday hit out at the United States.The official China Daily said Washington would ""never be allowed to control China's fate.""""It has become unquestionably clear that his administration's tariff war against China is politically motivated. What Washington wants from its largest trade partner is for it to be content to play second fiddle and meekly do as it demands,"" the English-language paper wrote in an editorial.The Global Times, a widely read tabloid published by the ruling Communist Party's official People's Daily, said: ""U.S. companies are welcome to invest and operate in the Chinese market, but if some U.S. companies want to obey Trump's order and join Washington's trade war, the result is bleak. A decision to give up the Chinese market is just suicide."""

AEG also apologized ""for the inconvenience and disappointment that this will cause.""A representative for Jon Bon Jovi didn't immediately reply to an email seeking comment.The Financial Times newspaper reported that the shows had been called off because the Culture Ministry had discovered that the band once included a picture of the Dalai Lama in a video backdrop during a concert in Taiwan in 2010, citing people familiar with the matter.The ruling Communist Party is sensitive to any perceived support from foreign governments and celebrities for the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader, who they denounce as a separatist.A recently released video shows Jon Bon Jovi singing a famous Chinese love ballad from the 1970s in Mandarin, adding to the buzz in China around this tour. Chinese fans expressed their disappointment and anger on social media, with some complaining that they had booked airline tickets and time off work to see the concerts.Authorities tightened scrutiny over foreign musicians performing in China after Icelandic singer Bjork shouted ""Tibet, Tibet"" following a song called Declare Independence at a Shanghai performance in 2008. A concert by U.S. pop group Maroon 5 planned for Saturday in Shanghai was cancelled in July following a reported tweet by a band member about meeting the Dalai Lama.China vows more scrutiny of foreign performers after Bjork outburstBjork riles Shanghai concertgoers with cry for TibetThe announcement of the Bon Jovi cancellations came on the same day as the Communist Party held grand celebrations in the Tibetan capital of Lhasa to mark 50 years since it established Tibet as an ethnic autonomous region firmly under Beijing's control.China claims Tibet has always been part of its territory, but many Tibetans say the Himalayan region was virtually independent for centuries and that Beijing's tight control is draining them of their culture and identity."

6 questions on China's currency devaluation answered | CBC News,China has allowed its tightly controlled yuan to drop in value to a four-year low. Here's what you need to know about the country's currency devaluation and where it might be headed.,2015-08-13T09:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/china-s-currency-devaluation-what-you-need-to-know-1.3188290,"China's central bank is allowing its tightly controlled currency, the yuan, also known as the renminbi, to fall in value.The People's Bank of China allowed the yuan to fall to a four-year low on Wednesday, after it devalued the national currency by almost two per cent the day prior.The move signals a shift in the bank's monetary policy, financial analysists say, one that may indicate the country is moving towards a more market-oriented approach for its currency, which Beijing has been hinting at.Here's what you need to know about this recent devaluation of the yuan.Despite the Chinese economy being the second largest in the world, after the U.S., it has been underperforming for the past year or so, says Loren Brandt, a professor at the University of Toronto's department of economics. So it clearly felt it had to do something to get exports moving again.""This is kind of a normal course of action"" that is seen in most weak economies, Brandt says. ""Their exchange rate adjusts and it provides a margin with which to try to help the economy recover.""In 2014, China's economic growth fell to 7.4 per cent, a noted drop off from years of double-digit growth.In July, exports fell by 8.3 per cent and the country's manufacturers are seeing their fourth year of price deflation, Reuters reports.What's more, Chinese investors were dismayed this summer when the Shanghai Stock Exchange fell steeply, losing 30 per cent of its value in June, and then plunged more than eight per cent in one day.China's slowed economy makes this type of action unsurprising to Brandt, who says it was a question of when, not if, the government would intervene.The Chinese government has already taken several steps to remedy its economic downturn, says Peter Dungan, an economics professor at the University of Toronto's Rotman School of Management.""This is not just one thing, one time.""The central bank lowered interest rates a number of times since November 2014. Most recently, in June, it cut the rate for both one-year loans by commercial banks and for one-year deposits by 25 basis points.The bank also lowered reserve requirement ratios for small businesses. A few months prior, it had done the same for banks to free up more of their money for lending.Currency exchange rates are determined one of two ways, Dugan says.Most countries, like Canada, have a floating exchange rate that's determined by market forces. The government has some ability to indirectly influence the exchange rate. For example, the Bank of Canada can help push the Canadian dollar down by lowering its benchmark lending rate.A small number of nations, like China, have an exchange rate that is ""fixed in some way or other by the authorities."" The Hong Kong dollar and the Danish krone are also at least somewhat fixed rates.In China, the bank determines the yuan's exchange rate based on its own basket of foreign currencies, which economists tend to believe is primarily made up of the U.S. dollar. Generally, the central bank allows the yuan to move two per cent above or below the rate it sets for that day, which it calls the daily fixing. But more often of late it has been following a strong-yuan policy, designed to encourage more imports and consumer spending.Tuesday's move was described by the bank as following more supply and demand forces, which at least some outside bankers saw as a good thing. The yuan dropped 1.9 per cent Tuesday and then a further 1.6 per cent Wednesday. Some suggest it could drop by as much as 10 per cent over the next little while.The intended effect of the lowered exchange rate is to boost exports from the country, Brandt says, to make Chinese exports less expensive and thus, more desirable.Local Chinese businesses could also benefit as imported goods could prove too costly for most consumers.However, Brandt says, ""in the short run, it's very difficult to say"" if the strategy will work for China.One of the concerns is that China now appears to be entering the currency wars and that others may follow suit, perhaps by using other monetary tools like lending rates to attempt to influence their currencies, as the Bank of Canada did earlier this year, which led to the falling dollar.""If one country goes ahead and devalues their currency, then everyone feels like they need to devalue their currency even more to remain competitive with them,"" says Brandt.In some ways, China is coming late to this game. Japan embarked on the devaluation of its yen two years ago, using U.S.-style quantitative easing to drive down its value, and Britain and the European Central Bank have also deployed monetary polices, as recently as the spring, aimed at bringing down the value of the pound and euro as well. The central bank's move to let its rate fall is ""revolutionary,"" says Donald Brean, a finance and business economics professor at the Rotman School of Management, as it is ""moving more towards market signals."" The move hints at the beginnings of reform where eventually the exchange rate could be set solely by market forces, like in Canada, rather than a combination of that and government intervention, Brandt says. ""Time will tell.""A market-based rate is the track China needs to be on to achieve its goal of the yuan becoming a global currency, says Farrokh Zandi, an economics professor at York University's Schulich School of Business in Toronto.China wants the International Monetary Fund to include its currency in the Special Drawing Rights, a basket of reserve currencies it uses to lend to sovereign borrowers and which includes the U.S. dollar, the Japanese yen, the European Union euro and the British pound.The IMF has insisted that China needs to have a floating exchange rate to be admitted into the pool of currencies in the SDR.China's move to devalue its currency ""is perhaps a step in the right direction"" to meet those conditions, Zandi says."

China wins support for Asia-Pacific trade proposal | CBC News,"Leaders of Asia-Pacific economies agreed Tuesday to begin work toward possible adoption of a free-trade pact proposed by China, giving Beijing a victory in its push for a bigger role in making trade policy.",2014-11-11T10:49:03.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/apec-meeting-china-wins-support-for-asia-pacific-trade-proposal-1.2830913,"Leaders of Asia-Pacific economies agreed Tuesday to begin work toward possible adoption of a Chinese-backed free-trade pact, giving Beijing a victory in its push for a bigger role in managing global commerce.In a joint statement after a two-day Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit, the leaders including U.S. President Barack Obama and Russia's Vladimir Putin agreed to take a first step by launching a two-year study of the initiative.""This is a historic step in the direction of an Asia-Pacific free trade area,"" said Chinese President Xi Jinping at a news conference.China is promoting the proposed Free-Trade Area of the Asia Pacific despite U.S. pressure to wrap up other trade negotiations. Analysts see it as a response to a U.S.-led initiative, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which includes 12 countries but excludes China.The APEC leaders also promised to work more closely to combat official corruption. That is a special concern for Beijing, which is stepping up efforts to pursue officials who flee abroad with stolen public money.Beijing has launched a series of trade and finance initiatives in pursuit of a bigger role in U.S.-dominated economic and security organizations to reflect Beijing's status as the world's second-biggest economy.APEC was the first major international gathering in China since Xi took power and gave Beijing a platform to lobby for a bigger leadership role.On the eve of the summit, Beijing announced a free-trade agreement with South Korea. Also Monday, regulators approved a plan to open Chinese stock markets wider to foreign investors by linking exchanges in Hong Kong and Shanghai. That followed the weekend announcement of a $40 billion Chinese-financed fund to improve trade links between Asian economies.Earlier this year, Beijing launched a regional development bank with 20 other governments. In May, Xi called for a new Asian structure for security cooperation based on a group that includes Russia and Iran but excludes the United States.China says its motives are benign, but its growing economic weight as the top trading partner for most of its neighbours from South Korea to Australia could erode U.S. influence.The Asia-Pacific trade pact was first proposed by an APEC business panel but China took the lead in promoting it. It marks the first time Beijing has played a leading role in a multinational trade agreement.""(The U.S.-led) TPP is being used to push aside China and to weaken China's economic core status,"" said Wu Xinbo, director of the Center for American Studies at Fudan University in Shanghai. Promoting its own initiative ""will give China a bigger right to speak in the Asia-Pacific — to have a new status.""Obama said Monday the United States ""welcomes the rise"" of a prosperous, peaceful and stable China. Still, American officials chafe at Beijing's insistence on promoting the Free-Trade Area of the Asia Pacific.U.S. trade officials say the two proposals are not competitors. But they want Beijing to wrap up a U.S.-Chinese investment treaty and a separate agreement to lower barriers to trade in information technology. Washington and some other governments argued the Chinese proposal would be a distraction at APEC but Beijing made it the centrepiece of the meeting."
"Russia, China sign natural gas deal worth $400B | CBC News","China signed a landmark deal Wednesday to buy Russian natural gas worth about $400 billion, giving a boost to diplomatically isolated President Vladimir Putin and expanding Moscow's ties with Asia.",2014-05-21T12:53:40.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/russia-china-sign-natural-gas-deal-worth-400b-1.2649241,"China signed a landmark deal Wednesday to buy Russian natural gas worth about $400 billion, giving a boost to diplomatically isolated President Vladimir Putin and expanding Moscow's ties with Asia.Price negotiations on the 30-year deal continued into the final hours of a two-day visit by Putin to China, during which both sides had said they hoped to sign an agreement.Putin was in Shanghai for an Asian security conference where China's president called for a new model of Asian security cooperation based on a regional group that includes Russia and Iran and excludes the United States.The gas deal gives Moscow an economic boost at a time when Washington and the European Union have imposed visa bans and asset freezes on dozens of Russian officials and several companies over Ukraine. It allows Russia to diversify its markets for gas, which now goes mostly to Europe.The agreement ""opened the door for Russia to enter into Asia's gas market,"" said Keun-Wook Paik, senior research fellow at the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies.Politically, the deal has provided ""a breathing space for Russia,"" Paik said. ""Russia, and Putin, can demonstrate it's not completely isolated because of the Ukraine crisis. Russia has demonstrated that they have a very reliable strategic partnership with China.""Russia's economy has been bruised by its dispute with the West over Ukraine's tilt toward the European Union, a shift that inflamed Moscow's insecurities about declining influence and sparked its annexation of Crimea in March.The supplies will help to ease gas shortages in China, the world's second-largest economy, and curb reliance on coal.The agreement calls for Russian government-controlled Gazprom to supply state-owned China National Petroleum Corp. with 38 billion cubic meters of gas annually, Gazprom spokesman Sergey Kupriyanov told The Associated Press. That would represent about a quarter of China's current annual gas consumption of nearly 150 billion cubic meters.The contract is worth a total of $400 billion, Gazprom CEO Alexei Miller told Russian news agencies. That figure is greater than the GDP of South Africa. Gas is due to begin flowing to China as early as 2018.The U.S. treasury secretary, Jacob Lew, appealed to China during a visit last week to avoid taking steps that might offset sanctions. However, American officials have acknowledged China's pressing need for energy.The contract is ""particularly important"" at a time when Europe has threatened to cut gas imports and reduce its dependence on Russia because of the Ukraine crisis, said Alexander Lukin, a deputy head of the Russian Diplomatic Academy under the country's Foreign Ministry, quoted by the RIA Novosti news agency.""We will be able to show to Europe that we have other customers,"" Lukin said.Alexei Pushkov, a Kremlin ally who is head of the international affairs committee of the Russian parliament's lower house, said on Twitter: ""The 30-year gas contract with China is of strategic significance. Obama should give up the policy of isolating Russia: It will not work.""""I think it is very plain that Russia would like China to join with it as a counterforce to US strength and  dominance,`` Carlin Romano, a former Russian correspondent now based in Beijing told CBC News.""I think China is wary of that. I think China does want good relations with the U.S.,"" he added.CNPC announced it had signed a deal but it gave no details.Putin met Tuesday with Chinese President Xi Jinping while gas negotiations continued in private.The Russian leader's visit is a ""major step toward a strategic partnership of the two nations,"" said Mikhail Margelov, head of the foreign affairs committee in the upper house of the Russian parliament, according to RIA Novosti.The Ukraine crisis and Western sanctions on Russia had raised expectations Moscow would compromise to secure the gas deal.The price appears to be closer to the level Russia wanted, according to analyst Xizhou Zhou of IHS Energy. In exchange, the two sides dropped a requirement for prepayment that was a feature of Chinese purchases of Russian oil, he said.""This higher price level reflects China's willingness to pay more for cleaner fuel,"" said Zhou in a report.China and Russia have been negotiating the deal for more than a decade but had been hung up over the gas price.""Gazprom is under increasing geopolitical and competitive pressure to diversify its market toward the East, while China's gas market remains supply constrained as demand continues to surge,"" said Zhou.Russia will invest $55 billion in fulfilling the contract while China will invest $22 billion, Putin told Russian reporters in Shanghai. He said the gas price would be based on a formula linked to that of oil and oil products.Plans call for building a pipeline to link China's northeast to a line that carries gas from western Siberia to the Pacific port of Vladivostok. The development of a gas center on the Pacific will allow Russia to export to prosperous markets in Japan and South Korea."
China orders actor Fan Bingbing to pay massive tax fine | CBC News,"Chinese tax authorities have ordered X-Men actor Fan Bingbing and companies she represents to pay taxes and penalties totalling $130 million US, ending months of speculation over one of the country's highest-profile entertainers since she disappeared from public view three months ago.",2018-10-03T13:15:34.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/fan-bingbing-tax-china-1.4848402,"Chinese tax authorities have ordered X-Men actor Fan Bingbing and companies she represents to pay taxes and penalties totalling $130 million US, ending months of speculation over one of the country's highest-profile entertainers since she disappeared from public view three months ago.Of the total amount, Fan is being personally fined around $70 million US for tax evasion, according to an announcement carried by China's official Xinhua News Agency Wednesday, citing tax authorities.Fan would not be investigated for criminal responsibility for tax evasion as long as the taxes, fines and late fees amounting to nearly 900 million yuan (about $130 million US) were paid on time, the report said.The announcement gave no indication as to Fan's whereabouts but indicated her agent was being held by police for allegedly obstructing the investigation.Fan has starred in dozens of movies and TV series in China and is best known internationally for her role as Blink in 2014's X-Men: Days of Future Past, a cameo in the Chinese version of Iron Man 3, and star turns on the red carpet at Cannes as recently as May.Before her disappearance, she had been booked to star with Penelope Cruz, Marion Cotillard, Lupita Nyong'o and Jessica Chastain in the Hollywood spy thriller 355. She also has a role in the upcoming Bruce Willis-Adrien Brody feature Air Strike.Top secret no more.

In June, regulators capped star pay at 40 per cent of a TV show's entire production budget and 70 per cent of the total paid to all the actors in a film.The NationalFan evaded 7.3 million yuan in taxes by using a secret contract worth 20 million yuan that she signed for starring in the film Air Strike, the report said. She had instead paid taxes on a contract for only 10 million yuan, Xinhua said. The example described in the report referred to a reportedly common entertainment industry practice — an actor having a public contract stating an official salary and a private contract detailing actual, much higher pay.A talk show host, Cui Yongyuan, had said in May that Fan had such an arrangement, which allegedly helps facilitate tax evasion, and revealed details that sparked a public outcry. Cui later apologized."
'Wild West of aviation': Edmonton pilot ready for wild air race in China | CBC News,"For air racing pilot Scott Holmes, the fastest motorsport in the world is pure “hair on fire” excitement.",2018-11-18T00:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/edmonton-pilot-air-race-china-1.4906791,"Update Nov. 18: Holmes placed seventh in the races. The original story appears below.For air racing pilot Scott Holmes, the fastest motorsport in the world is pure ""hair on fire"" excitement.And he's ready for his next adrenalin rush.The Edmonton pilot will be competing this weekend at the Air Race 1 China Cup, racing against seven other pilots — wing tip to wing tip — at speeds of over 450 kilometres per hour, just 10 metres above the tarmac.It's like NASCAR in the air where there is zero margin for error, Holmes said in a phone interview Wednesday from Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province.""We're all jockeying for the lead. You're in your zone. Nothing else matters, right from when the engine starts and you close the cockpit, to the end of the race.""The five-kilometre circuit at Hannan Municipal Airport is designed to challenge even the most experienced pilots.""The only thing that matters is the person you're trying to pass because if you screw up, or you make a mistake, or you stop thinking about that, you could hit and the consequence of that at 50 feet are terrible.""The race, from  Nov. 16 to 18, will be the first event of its kind ever to be held in China — and it comes with its own set of perils.""Especially in Asia, it's a bit like the Wild West of aviation,"" said Holmes, who will be flying his purpose-built Cassutt airplane named Outlaw.""They don't have a lot of the typical rules and laws and best practices that we've built in North America over the years. So we have to kind of use our best judgment in a lot of situations.""Smog is expected to make visibility extremely poor for the pilots, Holmes said. And they will by flying perilously close to a military base.""The normal course that we fly in is in Reno, Nev., which is a big open desert,"" Holmes said.""We're flying in China and it's over like rice paddies and very tall trees and the river, the Yangtze River, is right beside us.""They told us if we fly east of the river, that's the military zone, and we don't exactly know what's going to happen.""There's a lot of unknowns in this race that we're a little bit concerned about.""Holmes, 29, is the only Canadian competitor in the race. He's also the youngest and has the least flying hours of the 13 race competitors.Although Holmes, a chemical production engineer and University of Alberta graduate, has had his pilot's licence since he was 17, he's relatively new to the sport.He was invited to compete in Air Race 1 after competing at the 2017 National Formula One Air Racing Championships in Reno, his first professional race.Holmes admits he and his pit crew may be at a disadvantage but said he is looking forward to learning from his veteran competitors.""I think I'm the youngest by quite a bit in this race, actually. I think about that every day,"" Holmes said.""And what's worse is almost everybody is an airline pilot with 20,000 hours so my 350 is not even comparable.""""We're in good company."""
Canada seeks strategic allies as U.S.-China trade war dominates APEC | CBC News,"The leaders from the 21 countries represented at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit found a colourful welcome in Papua New Guinea, but the high-stakes trade conflict between the U.S. and China was spelled out in black and white as soon as talks got underway Saturday.",2018-11-17T13:05:42.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/apec-summit-saturday-us-china-trade-1.4910224,"The leaders from the 21 countries represented at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit found a colourful welcome in Papua New Guinea, but the high-stakes trade conflict between the U.S. and China was spelled out in black and white as soon as talks got underway Saturday.Before the leaders even gathered for their first family photo, Chinese President Xi Jinping and U.S. Vice-President Mike Pence gave back-to-back speeches to an APEC CEO Summit taking place in Port Moresby to coincide with the leaders talks — an audience keenly aware of how disruptive the hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs applied over the last year have been to global supply chains, at a risk to both investment decisions and consumer confidence.Anyone hoping for a conciliatory tone from the U.S. in President Donald Trump's absence was quickly disappointed.""We hope for better, but the United States ... will not change course until China changes its ways,"" Pence told the CEOs.Pence made no apologies, emphasizing instead the military and infrastructure investments the U.S. was making in the region — investments that compete with the now highly visible presence of China.This strategic game between the world's two biggest economies is evident in Port Moresby, the capital of APEC's poorest country. Signs identify new infrastructure as ""China Aid"" and advertise the ""co-operation and peace"" it's meant to signal in both English and Chinese.The road to Papua New Guinea's seat of government is newly paved by the Chinese. A Chinese investment also helped build the Hilton Hotel where the APEC leaders enjoyed their gala dinner Saturday night.Pence tried to portray what the U.S. is doing in the region as more honourable than the Chinese initiatives.""We have a principled approach that stands in stark contrast to other nations,"" he said, saying others offer opaque loan terms for unsustainable projects that come with strings attached.""Do not accept foreign debt that compromises your sovereignty,"" Pence warned. ""Be just like America, and put your country first.""""We don't offer constricting belts or a one-way road,"" the American leader said, in words chosen to reference a centrepiece of Chinese foreign policy: its ""belt and road"" initiative to build land and sea infrastructure that positions the massive Chinese market at the centre of trading networks across Europe and Asia.In a speech to the same audience, Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said Russia is willing to work with China on this initiative.One of the joint outcomes from last weekend's visit to Beijing by Finance Minister Bill Morneau and International Trade Diversification Minister Jim Carr was a commitment from Canada to send a ""high-level"" delegation to the 2019 Belt and Road Forum for International Co-operation.Canada hasn't previously attended this Chinese-organized event. A spokesperson for Carr said this ""high-level"" delegation is unlikely to include Canada's prime minister.In a contrast that would have seemed unimaginable even two years ago, it has fallen to the Chinese president to make the case for multilateralism and rules-based trade, in comments supportive of efforts to reform the World Trade Organization.Xi said that erecting trade barriers is against the trend of history. ""Old practices"" like unilateralism and protectionism won't solve problems, he said. China's setting its sights on ""post-2020 co-operation.""""History has shown that confrontation, whether in the form of a Cold War, hot war, or trade war will produce no winners,"" Xi said, calling for conversation instead.""He's trying to mend fences here, and then you have Vice-President Pence coming in ... and taking an incredibly hard tone against China,"" said Jonathan Pryke, director of the Pacific Islands program at the Lowy Institute, a non-partisan Australian think-tank.""It's worrying where this is all leading, because it doesn't seem like there is much room for conversation or middle ground to be found.""Championing rules-based trade is one of Trudeau's priorities for APEC.All three of the bilateral meetings the Canadian prime minister has scheduled are with partner countries in the Comprehensive and Progressive Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) — the 11-country Pacific Rim trade deal that takes hold Dec. 30.The first country Trudeau met with Saturday — Malaysia — has yet to ratify the CPTPP. Canada is urging Prime Minister Mahathir bin Mohamad's government to do so and start realizing its benefits.The two leaders also discussed liquid natural gas (LNG) development on Canada's West Coast. Malaysian-owned Petronas is an investor in the project.On Sunday, Trudeau will meet with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison.Pryke thinks a change in government has erased the hard feelings Australia voiced after Canada wouldn't commit to the CPTPP at last year's summit.This year, the two countries are caught in the middle of the heated rhetoric of the U.S.-China confrontation.""It's quite disturbing for a lot of middle powers who have ... relied on the U.S. to protect the liberal order that the U.S. helped create,"" he said. ""It's worrying to see that they're retreating from that narrative pretty aggressively.""That makes an APEC focused on trade and economic integration important.""But it also makes it so much harder to get anything done, because the biggest powers in the room aren't all that interested in liberalization and integration,"" he said.""We have to rely less on our relationships with the big players and we have to work more closely with people in the middle,"" Pryke said.Trudeau's other meeting Saturday was one Canada organized with leaders from Pacific Island nations.Part of Canada's commitment at the Paris Climate Conference was $2.65 billion to help small island states. As part of Canada's G7 presidency, it's been talking to small island states about ways to finance climate-resistant infrastructure in the developing world, Trudeau said before the meeting.""Increasing sea level has diminished the land we have to live on, increasing the salinity of our water that impacts on our food security,"" said Baron Waqa, the president of Nauru, an island country in Micronesia. ""The disappearance of our land could threaten our very sovereignty."""
Religious freedom 'violated' in China: Andrew Bennett | CBC News,"The Canadian government intends to raise the issue of religious intolerance with the Chinese, says Canada's ambassador for the Office of Religious Freedom.",2014-08-21T01:50:10.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canadian-ambassador-andrew-bennett-says-religious-freedom-violated-in-china-1.2742340,"The Canadian government intends to raise the issue of religious intolerance with the Chinese, says Canada's ambassador for the Office of Religious Freedom.Andrew Bennett's comments come as Prime Minister Stephen Harper is poised to make another state visit to China some time in the fall.In an interview with CBC News Network's Power & Politics,  Andrew Bennett spoke about growing reports the Chinese government is subjecting members of religious groups to repressive policies and discriminatory laws.""In China, unlike other parts of the world, religious freedom is being violated almost solely as a result of government restrictions.""​""And that's certainly a concern and an issue that we seek to raise with the Chinese,"" Bennett told host Evan Solomon on Wednesday.Under Canada's long-standing ""one China"" policy, the Canadian government takes no position with regard to specific autonomy claims. But with religious freedom now a central tenet of Canada's foreign policy, Bennett said it will take a stance when governments choose to discriminate on the basis of religion.""In China right now, we're seeing increasing state persecution of a variety of religious communities and this has been escalating over the last year or more.""""For example, the case of China's officials prohibiting Uighur Muslims from fasting during Ramadan. You know, this is completely unacceptable,"" Bennett said.""Now we're seeing reports that the Chinese government wants to nationalize Christianity.""Bennett echoed comments made by the U.S. last month when the Department of State released its annual report on international religious freedom.U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said ""In China, authorities harass Christians. They arrest Tibetan Buddhists simply for possessing the Dalai Lama’s photograph.""And they prevent Uighur Muslims from providing religious education to their children or fasting during Ramadan.""Kerry said North Korea, Iran and Russia also stand out for their repression of religious freedom. Turkmenistan was added to the list of countries of particular concernThe report underscores ""a major challenge"" around the world, Kerry said.Kevin and Julia Dawn Garratt 'all right,' Chinese officials tell sonBennet said the case of a Canadian couple detained over allegations they stole China's state secrets is a consular matter.""[Foreign Affairs] Minister Baird engaged with his Chinese counterparts on the case. He's engaged with Chinese officials here in Canada as well,"" Bennet said.Kevin and Julia Dawn Garratt are being held in an undisclosed location in Dandong, China, as they are investigated for stealing Chinese military and intelligence information, allegations their supporters say are ludicrous."

Trump's latest tweets create another twist in U.S.-China trade talks | CBC News,"A high-level Chinese delegation will meet with U.S. officials in Washington on Tuesday for the second round in discussions to head off a trade war, writes Saša Petricic.",2018-05-14T13:59:01.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/trump-china-us-trade-talks-petricic-1.4661639,"With a couple of tweets, U.S. President Donald Trump may have brightened the mood of this week's trade talks between China and the United States.But he's also increased confusion here in Beijing. In this months-long stand-off, does this latest twist from Trump create breathing room or a bargaining chip?A high-level Chinese delegation led by President Xi Jinping's top economic adviser, Vice-Premier Liu He, will meet with U.S. officials in Washington on Tuesday. This is the second round in so-far fruitless discussions to head off a trade war between the world's two biggest economic powers.Trump has pushed for tough measures to force China to reduce a record $375-billion US trade deficit in 2017 and to punish Beijing for what Washington calls theft of intellectual property by Chinese technology companies. Specific targets for U.S. action are set to be finalized next week.So, what to believe from Trump now? A sunny Sunday tweet saying ""be cool, it will all work out!"" Or previous dark threats from Trump that China is engaging in ""unfair,"" ""stupid trade"" that ""cannot continue?""China and the United States are working well together on trade, but past negotiations have been so one sided in favor of China, for so many years, that it is hard for them to make a deal that benefits both countries. But be cool, it will all work out!Notably, Trump is now promising a possible reprieve for Chinese cell phone maker ZTE, which is on the verge of being wiped out by U.S. legal action.In a second tweet, he said he's instructed officials to ease restrictions recently imposed on ZTE so it can ""get back into business, fast.""""Too many jobs in China lost,"" Trump wrote. ""Commerce Department has been instructed to get it done!""President Xi of China, and I, are working together to give massive Chinese phone company, ZTE, a way to get back into business, fast. Too many jobs in China lost. Commerce Department has been instructed to get it done!The big Shanghai company announced last week that it had ceased ""major operating activities"" after the U.S. Commerce Department banned American companies from selling to the firm for seven years. This, as punishment for ZTE breaking an agreement reached after it was caught illegally shipping U.S. goods to Iran.ZTE's 75,000 employees make phones and telecommunications equipment shipped to 160 countries, using key American components such as microchips and operating systems unavailable from China.The ZTE case is technically separate from Washington's broader trade crackdown, but in China, it has become a symbol of what many consider U.S. bullying.""The U.S. should be aware that it must become more cooperative and constructive in the trade talks with China,"" said the China Daily, the country's official English-language newspaper, in a Monday editorial.""It should bear in mind that the outcomes of dialogue should be mutually beneficial and China will not accept its interests being damaged,"" the newspaper said, adding that Washington must ""cast away its unilateral mentality.""Online in China on Monday, reaction to Trump's latest comments was skeptical.""This is Trump's strategy,"" said one comment on Weibo, China's popular (and officially monitored) microblogging platform. ""I hit you when I want to, I save you when I want to.""Another user said with Trump's unpredictability, ""I foresee a tough trip for Chinese negotiator Liu He.""Indeed, increased tensions over trade — and the specific case of ZTE, which highlights gaps in China's technological know-how — have piqued nationalists, including President Xi.Insiders have told western media organizations he is ""irate"" over ZTE's predicament, especially since he has marked his leadership with an emphasis on a ""rising China,"" ready and able to take its rightful place as a world leader.The first round of trade talks in Beijing only seemed to push the sides farther apart.The U.S. delegation, led by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, left a list of demands that was quickly leaked and circulated on Chinese internet.Among other things, it insists China reduce the trade deficit by $100 billion US in the next year and another $100 billion US the year after. It calls for an end to all government subsidies to advanced manufacturing industries, including microchips and artificial intelligence technology. And it demands that Beijing accept U.S. restrictions on Chinese investments in sensitive industries without retaliation.Chinese observers who understand official thinking say Beijing will push back against U.S. ""ultimatums.""""You cannot threaten the biggest market in the world with a trade war,"" says Ding Yifan, senior researcher of the National Strategy Institute at Beijing's Tsinghua University. ""You cannot win a trade war with the biggest market in the world. It's ridiculous,"" he says with a laugh.Economic simulations suggest even the most drastic U.S. moves would result in a 0.8 per cent drop in China's GDP, from 6.8 to six per cent, says Ding.""It's not so much. We can bear this kind of loss,"" he says.Economist Maiojie Yu from Peking University's National School of Development says if Washington does go ahead and impose sweeping trade measures, including tariffs, China's immediate strategy should be two-fold: First, to retaliate by matching the measures, and second to turn to other suppliers, especially European, to make up for shortages in chipsets and other technology.""If the U.S. will not sell chipsets, other European countries will do that,"" Yu says. ""They are almost an exact substitute.""""In the short run, this may have some harm to China's chip industries,"" he says, ""but in the long run, this gives pressure to these industries … they should work on their own innovation.""Yu says it would take about a decade for Chinese companies to come up with domestic alternatives.That is Plan B. For now, both sides say publicly — including in tweets — that a deal to avoid a trade war is still possible."
TDSB delays deal with China's Confucius Institute | CBC News,The Toronto District School Board has postponed its partnership with China’s Confucius Institute so that it can more closely examine the Beijing-run cultural organization.,2014-06-18T20:56:01.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/tdsb-delays-deal-with-china-s-confucius-institute-1.2680015,"The Toronto District School Board has postponed its partnership with China’s Confucius Institute so that it can more closely examine the Beijing-run cultural organization. The motion passed overwhelmingly after hours of at-times testy debate by school board trustees. Some complained they were kept in the dark about the deal — one trustee quipped there was much “confucion” — which was developed for years under former chair Chris Bolton. Rutka was elected as the TDSB’s new chair just hours before the meeting — the last of the school year — and was among those who supported the delay. The delay “will give us time for the due diligence we should have done in the first place,” said Rutka, addressing the board shortly before the vote. The Chinese government oversees the Confucius Institute, which provides teaching materials to school boards. The pending deal raised concerns among parents and activists who object to China’s human rights record and to the possible spread of Chinese propaganda. Trustees said they had been bombarded by letters and emails from constituents on both sides of the issue. Protesters gathered outside TDSB headquarters ahead of the meeting and an online petition opposing the deal had by Wednesday evening gathered 1,161 names. The TDSB had planned to provide Confucius Institute courses to students in September. Rutka is the school board trustee for Ward 12, Willowdale. Shaun Chen of Ward 21, Scarborough-Rouge River, was elected vice-chair of the board and also supported the delay. The TDSB has recently been roiled by apparent in-fighting among trustees and audits which revealed both irregularities in spending, and trustees who had ties to charitable groups that received funding from the school board."

The entire process was videotaped, and the birds were then loaded into sealed vehicles for the trip to Tiananmen Square, the newspaper said.A similar report appeared in the Beijing News, and the People's Daily tweeted about it in English: ""10,000 pigeons go through anal security check for suspicious objects Tue, ready to be released on National Day on Wed.""The reports — which did not say what the suspicious materials might be — drew amused and derisive responses from some Chinese readers, and many news sites, including the Beijing News website, later deleted the reports. However, the Jinghua Times report and the People's Daily tweet were still visible as of midday Wednesday.Members of the Chinese public responded with sarcasm because they see in the bird searches their own plight in what they consider an oppressive society with tight surveillance, censorship and judicial injustice, independent columnist Zhang Ping said in an editorial that was circulated on social media under his pen name, Changping.""The liberty and dignity of citizens are increasingly vulnerable, and can be expropriated at any time, like with the pigeons,"" Zhang wrote. ""They have to go through the pains and insults of the rude anal check and yet they must appear peaceful and happy on the screen of the state broadcaster.""The notched-up security measures reflect heightened concern about violence following a string of attacks blamed on separatist militants from the country's ethnic Uighur Muslim minority, as well as bus explosions and random slashing attacks attributed to disgruntled individuals.Last October, three Uighurs in a vehicle rammed through crowds in front of Tiananmen Gate in central Beijing and set off explosives in an attack that killed themselves and three bystanders.Beijing authorities also are sending police helicopters to monitor highway checkpoints, ring roads within the city, major intersections and areas with heavy traffic, including popular tourist spots such as the Great Wall and the Summer Palace, the Beijing News said. Additionally, the capital has mobilized 850,000 citizen volunteers to help keep a lookout in the city of about 20 million people, the newspaper said."
China's Comac to deliver 1st homegrown jets | CBC News,A state-owned aircraft maker said Wednesday it is ready to deliver China's first homegrown regional airliner and should complete a bigger plane in 2018.,2014-05-21T19:02:39.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/china-s-comac-to-deliver-1st-homegrown-jets-1.2649784,"A state-owned aircraft maker said Wednesday it is ready to deliver China's first homegrown regional airliner and should complete a bigger plane in 2018.The first two of the ARJ21-700 regional jets have been completed for a Chinese carrier Chengdu Airlines, and are coming to the end of the certification process, according to Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China Ltd. The company said it has 252 orders.China launched the ARJ21 project in 2002 in an attempt to break into the Western-dominated aircraft market. The plane was promised for 2007 but delivery was pushed back due to technical problems. The Chinese Civil Aviation Authority had hoped to partner with the FAA to get international certification for the plane, but that has not yet taken place.China is expected to become one of the world's biggest aircraft markets over the next two decades. Boeing Co. forecasts total demand at 5,580 planes worth a total of $780 billion.The ARJ21-700 can seat 78 to 90 passengers depending on its configuration, with a range of 2,225 to 3,700 km. Comac said it successfully completed test flights in North America in March and April and has flown 13,000 km. The company is targeting China's domestic market and flights to Southeast Asia. ""We first want to develop our business in China and then gradually we will go to the international market,"" Comac executive Tian Min told reporters at Comac's assembly and manufacturing centre in Shanghai. Comac's larger C919 is a single-aisle jet meant to compete with Boeing and Airbus Industrie. It can seat up to 168 passengers and has a planned range of 4,000 to 5,100 km.  The C919 is an official initiative ""for China to re-capture the value in aircraft manufacturing that currently goes offshore to Airbus and Boeing,"" said industry analyst Will Horton of CAPA Centre for Aviation. ""With such a large objective, accomplishments will come gradually.""The company has received 400 orders from 16 customers, including aircraft leasing company GE Capital Aviation Services. Low cost carrier Ryanair and British Airways have signed memorandums of understanding about their intention to purchase planes, Tian said. He wouldn't disclose price but said developers were focused on controlling costs. Most orders have come from China's state-owned airline industry under government instructions to support the program. ""Global aviation remains pessimistic on the C919, given the ARJ21 delays,"" said Horton. On May 15, the first front fuselage of a C919 was delivered by a supplier to Comac, Tian said. He said the plane will be assembled in the second half of 2014, its maiden flight is due at the end of 2015 and the first delivery to a customer is slated for 2018. Longer term, Comac is cooperating with Russia to build a next-generation wide-body plane. The two sides signed a memorandum of understanding on Tuesday during Russian President Vladimir Putin's visit to China. Tian said Comac is working on a feasibility study with Russia. From its beginning in 2008, Comac has focused on developing the two passenger planes. It has grown from 3,800 employees to 8,300."

3D dinosaur fossil eggs found in China | CBC News,"A spectacular fossil find in China — a prehistoric egg extravaganza from 120 million years ago — is providing unique insight into the lifestyle and gender differences of pterosaurs, the flying reptiles that lived alongside the dinosaurs.",2014-06-06T18:15:38.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/3d-preserved-pterosaur-eggs-found-in-china-1.2667497,"A spectacular fossil find in China — a prehistoric egg extravaganza from 120 million years ago — is providing unique insight into the lifestyle and gender differences of pterosaurs, the flying reptiles that lived alongside the dinosaurs.Until now, only four pterosaur eggs had ever been found, and all were flattened during the process of fossilization.But Chinese scientists said on Thursday they had unearthed five pterosaur eggs preserved beautifully in three dimensions at a site in northwestern China that also includes no fewer than 40 adult individuals of a newly identified species that lived in a bustling colony near a large freshwater lake.""This is definitely the most important pterosaur site ever found,"" said paleontologist Zhonghe Zhou, director of the Chinese Academy of Sciences' Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology.The creature, Hamipterus tianshanensis, had a crest atop its elongated skull, pointy teeth for catching fish and a wingspan of more than 3.5 metres.The five oblong eggs were ""pliable"" with a thin, hard outer layer marked by ""cracking and crazing"" covering a thick membrane inner layer, making them resemble the soft eggs of some modern snakes and lizards, said paleontologist Xiaolin Wang, another of the researchers.""They are the best-preserved pterosaur eggs ever found,"" Wang said.The site was remarkable for what it reveals about how pterosaurs lived. At least 40 male and female individuals have been identified, and there may be hundreds in all, Wang said.The site indicates pterosaurs lived in large colonies, in this case nesting near the lake and burying eggs in moist sand to prevent them from becoming desiccated, Wang said.""One of the significant (aspects) of this discovery - hundreds of individuals and eggs together from one site - is that it confirmed that pterosaurs were gregarious, and the population size is surprisingly large,"" Zhou said.The fossils illustrated important sex differences in pterosaurs. For example, males possessed distinctly larger head crests.""In Hamipterus, size, shape and robustness are decided by the gender,"" Wang said, adding that this contradicts a previous notion that ""sexual dimorphism in pterosaurs was only reflected in the absence or presence of the crests.""The site, discovered in Xinjiang province in 2005, was preserved probably after the Cretaceous period creatures perished together in a large storm, Zhou said.Pterosaurs were Earth's first flying vertebrates, with birds and bats appearing much later. They thrived from about 220 million years ago to 65 million years ago, when they were doomed by the asteroid that also killed the dinosaurs.Knowledge about pterosaurs has been spotty, with their fragile skeletons not lending themselves well to fossilization. Little has been known about their behavior.""I have been truly amazed by the abundance of bones and the number of eggs as well the great potential of more discoveries from the site,"" Zhou said.The genus name, Hamipterus, means ""Hami wing,"" honoring nearby Hami City. The species name, tianshanensis, refers to the nearby Tian Shan mountains."
China formalizes easing of 1-child policy | CBC News,"China on Saturday formally allowed couples to have a second child if one parent is an only child, the first major easing of its three-decade-old restrictive birth policy.",2013-12-28T15:36:14.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/china-1-child-policy-officially-eased-1.2477858,"China on Saturday formally allowed couples to have a second child if one parent is an only child, the first major easing of its three-decade-old restrictive birth policy.First announced by the ruling Communist Party's leadership in November, the decision was officially sanctioned by the standing committee of China's top legislature, the National People's Congress, the official Xinhua News Agency reported.Implemented around 1980, China's birth policy has limited most couples to only one child, but has allowed a second child if neither parent has siblings or if the first born to a rural couple is a girl.Demographers and policy makers have estimated the easing would benefit some 15 million to 20 million Chinese parents — mostly in cities — and result in one million to two million extra births per year in the first few years, on top of the 16 million babies born annually in China. They say the easing is so incremental that the extra births are not expected to strain resources such as the health care and education.China has credited the restrictive policy with managing its population growth and improving the economy, but critics say it is a violation of human rights.China is the world's most populous country with 1.35 billion people."
Kim Jong-un meets China's Xi Jinping in Beijing visit | CBC News,"North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping sought to portray strong ties between the neighbours and long-time allies despite a recent chill, as both countries on Wednesday confirmed Kim's secret trip to Beijing this week.",2018-03-27T13:17:21.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/china-north-korea-kim-reports-1.4594724,"North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping sought to portray strong ties between the neighbours and long-time allies despite a recent chill, as both countries on Wednesday confirmed Kim's secret trip to Beijing this week.China's official Xinhua News Agency said Kim made the unofficial visit to China from Sunday to Wednesday at Xi's invitation in what was in his first trip to a foreign country since he took power in 2011.Xi held talks with Kim at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing and he and his wife Peng Liyuan hosted a banquet for Kim and his wife Ri Sol-ju, Xinhua said. They also watched an art performance together, the news agency said.Official reports from both countries depicted in effusive terms warm ties between the two leaders in what analysts said appeared to be an effort to downplay recent tensions in relations over Kim's development of nuclear weapons and long-range missiles.In these reports, ""Kim reaffirms the traditional friendship between the two countries as if nothing had ever happened, when the relationship had plummeted to unprecedented lows,"" said Bonnie Glaser, an Asia expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.Ties in recent months have frayed as China supported tougher UN sanctions on North Korea and suspended imports of coal, iron ore, seafood and textiles. Pyongyang last year seemingly sought to humiliate Beijing by timing some of its missile tests for major global summits in China, while its state media accused Chinese state-controlled media of ""going under the armpit of the U.S."" by criticizing the North.Xi hailed Kim's visit as embodying the importance with which the North Korean leader regarded ties with China.""We speak highly of this visit,"" Xi told Kim, according to Xinhua.For China, the visit also reminds other countries that Beijing remains one of North Korea's most important allies and is a player not to be sidelined in denuclearization talks. It also projects to the Chinese public that Xi is firmly in charge of steering Beijing's relations with North Korea in a way that favours China's interests.""Here is Xi Jinping saying, 'Don't worry, everything is going to be great',"" Glaser said.The NationalAnalysts say Kim would have felt a need to consult with his country's traditional ally ahead of his planned meetings with South Korean President Moon Jae-in and U.S. President Donald Trump in the coming weeks. China would also not want Kim's first foreign meeting to be with someone other than Xi.""China was clearly not comfortable with the idea of Kim meeting with Moon and Trump before having ever met with Xi,"" said Paul Haenle, director of the Carnegie-Tsinghua Center for Global Policy in Beijing.""Beijing has significant interests and huge stakes in any outcomes of upcoming summits and did not want to be on the sidelines as a spectator"" as important diplomatic events occurred, Haenle said.Kim was described by Xinhua as saying that his country wants to transform ties with South Korea into ""a relationship of reconciliation and co-operation."" The two Koreas are still technically at war because their 1950-53 war ended in an armistice, not a peace treaty.Kim also said that North Korea is willing to hold a summit with the United States, according to Xinhua.North Korea's official Korean Central News Agency published Kim's personal letter to Xi dated Wednesday, where he expressed gratitude to the Chinese leadership for showing what he described as ""heartwarming hospitality"" during his ""productive"" visit.Kim said the first meeting between the leaders will provide a ""groundbreaking milestone"" in developing mutual relations to ""meet the demands of the new era."" Kim also said that he's satisfied that the leaders confirmed their ""unified opinions"" on mutual issues.""For the North Koreans, it is in their best interests to enter any meetings with Moon or Trump having shored up and repaired to a certain extent their relations with Beijing,"" Haenle said.The North's diplomatic outreach this year follows a tenser 2017 when it conducted its most powerful nuclear test and tested three intercontinental ballistic missiles designed to target the U.S. mainland.The developments are being interpreted as the North being desperate to break out of isolation and improve its economy after being squeezed by heavy sanctions.China remains North Korea's only major ally and chief provider of energy, aid and trade that keep the country's broken economy afloat.In a speech at a banquet in China, Kim described the traditional allies as inseparable ""neighbouring brothers"" with a relationship molded by a ""scared mutual fight"" to achieve socialist ideals, according to KCNA.In addition to the trip being his first abroad as leader, his talk with Xi was his first meeting with a foreign head of state.Kim's father, late North Korean leader Kim Jong-il, visited China several times during his rule, lastly in May 2011. He died the following December.""It's most proper that my first overseas trip would be the capital of the People's Republic of China as it's also one of my noble duties to value the North Korea-China friendship as I do my own life and extend it [for another generation],"" said Kim, according to the agency.Past visits by Kim Jong-il to China were surrounded in secrecy, with Beijing only confirming his presence after he had crossed the border by train back into North Korea."
China confronts Japanese ships near disputed islands | CBC News,China says ships from its newly formed coast guard confronted Japanese patrol vessels in waters surrounding East China Sea islands claimed by both sides.,2013-07-26T07:52:55.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/china-confronts-japanese-ships-near-disputed-islands-1.1395430,"China says ships from its newly formed coast guard confronted Japanese patrol vessels Friday in waters surrounding East China Sea islands claimed by both sides.  The State Oceanic Administration that oversees the service says four of its ships ""sternly declared"" China's sovereignty over the islands called Senkaku by Japan and Diaoyu by China, and demanded they leave the area. The uninhabited archipelago is controlled by Tokyo but also claimed by Beijing.  It was not clear if any action resulted from the Chinese declaration. Such sovereignty declarations are usually made by hailing Japanese boats by radio and loudspeaker, as well as flashing shipboard signs.  Ships from Chinese civilian agencies have maintained a steady presence in the area since tensions spiked in September following Japan's purchase of some of the islands from their private owners.  Those vessels are being replaced by ships from the coast guard, which was formally inaugurated on Monday and merges the resources of four former agencies. China says the move was intended to boost its ability to enforce its maritime claims, upping the stakes in an increasingly tense competition for marine territory and resources in waters off its eastern and southeastern coasts.  Chinese coast guard ships have also been spotted this week at Mischief Reef off the western Philippine coast, according to a confidential Philippine government report obtained by The Associated Press. China occupied the vast reef in 1995, sparking protests from rival claimant Manila.  China says virtually the entire South China Sea and its islands belong to it, a claim based on alleged historical precedents that are strongly contested by the Philippines, Vietnam and others.  While Beijing has mainly used civilian agencies to patrol its claims, the new coast guard gives it greater latitude to do so by centralizing operations in a single body. The body is nominally under civilian control, but closely coordinates with the increasingly formidable Chinese navy that recently added an aircraft carrier to its fleet.  Coast guard ships are mainly repurposed naval or commercial vessels and are equipped with light armaments such as machine guns and deck cannons, unlike in the past when most of China's patrol craft had no weaponry.  Japan has already expressed renewed unease about China's military and maritime activity near the disputed islands, and on Friday released a defense paper calling for an increase in its surveillance capability, possibly including the use of drones capable of wide-range, high-altitude monitoring around the clock.  The paper also proposed creating a marine force to defend the disputed East China Sea islands."

China hints at retaliation as U.S. says $50B in tariffs are back on | CBC News,China's government accused the Trump administration of hurting its credibility by acting erratically on trade and vowed Wednesday to fight back if Washington goes ahead with a threatened tariff hike.,2018-05-30T17:09:42.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/china-tariffs-trade-u-s-trump-1.4684091,"China's government accused the Trump administration of hurting its credibility by acting erratically on trade and vowed Wednesday to fight back if Washington goes ahead with a threatened tariff hike.A foreign ministry spokeswoman complained the U.S. decision to renew a threat to raise duties on a $50 billion list of Chinese goods conflicts with an agreement in mid-May aimed at settling that dispute. Treasury Steven Mnuchin said then that the conflict was ""on hold"" after Beijing promised to buy more U.S. goods to help narrow its multibillion-dollar trade surplus with the United States.The spokeswoman, Hua Chunying, declined to say whether Tuesday's announcement might disrupt plans for Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross to visit Beijing for talks starting Saturday. The Commerce Ministry didn't respond to questions about the status of the meeting, but the American Embassy said a delegation of trade, agriculture and treasury officials had arrived in the Chinese capital to make preparations.Hua gave no indication of whether Beijing planned to act on its own threat to retaliate by raising duties on a $50 billion list of American goods including beef and soybeans.""Every flip-flop and U-turn of a country will be simply depleting and squandering its own credibility,"" Hua said at a regular briefing.""We do not want a trade war, but we are not afraid of one. We will fight back,"" she said. ""We will definitely take forceful measures to defend our legitimate interests.""The White House announcement said it also would impose curbs on Chinese investment and purchases of high-tech exports.Asian financial markets tumbled on renewed worries about a U.S.-Chinese trade spat. China's main market index fell 2.5 per cent and Japan's benchmark lost 1.5 per cent.The White House's latest tariff action focuses on advanced technologies, including those such as robots and electric cars that China has said it wants to develop under its ""Made in China 2025"" program. The White House said a list of products would be announced June 15.Trump's surprise announcement reflects his frustration at criticism of his earlier deal with Beijing, Eurasia analysts said in a report. They said he appears less concerned that he needs Chinese support for his proposed meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.""Trump is going on offence, reverting to his earlier instincts on China and re-empowering the trade hawks in his Cabinet,"" Eurasia Group said. ""This dynamic makes it likely that both tariffs and investment restrictions will go into effect.""The American Chamber of Commerce in China said companies are uneasy about the threat of export and investment controls but see them as a possible way to make progress on longstanding complaints about market access and investment curbs.As a result of Trump's tariff threat, Washington is in very intense negotiations with Beijing ""in a way that we haven't been for so many years,"" said the chamber chairman, William Zarit. He said companies hope Beijing can be persuaded to ""level the playing field"" by easing curbs on foreign investment and business activity in its state-dominated economy.""I wouldn't say we are in favour of, specifically, export controls, investment restrictions,"" Zarit said at a news conference. But he said American companies want equal treatment, ""and this seems to be one of the ways to do that.""Also Wednesday, the Chinese Cabinet announced it planned to complete work by July 1 on another measure sought for years by its trading partners — a ""negative list"" that would make clear what is off-limits to foreign investment, leaving the rest of the economy open.Foreign companies are frustrated by a system that requires them to wait for Chinese regulators to declare individual lines of business open to them.Trump has focused on pressing Beijing to narrow its trade surplus with the United States, but Zarit said American companies see other issues as higher priorities.As Chinese companies expand abroad, the United States, Europe and other trading partners are pressing Beijing to ease controls that keep their companies out of industries including banking, insurance, telecoms and health care.""China's success means that it can no longer credibly defend protectionist policies on the grounds that it is still a 'developing country,""' the American chamber said in a report Wednesday.The tariff threat is a ""very powerful"" negotiating tactic, said Lester Ross, chairman of the American chamber's policy committee. However, he said tariffs are a tax on American consumers and a blunt tool to address ""very complex problems that hamper trade and investment relationships.""Analysts in the United States suggested the newly confrontational stance also might be aimed at appeasing congressional critics of a deal the Trump administration made Friday that allowed Chinese telecom giant ZTE Corp. to stay in business.ZTE agreed to remove its management team, hire American compliance officers and pay a fine. That would be on top of a $1 billion penalty ZTE paid for selling high-tech equipment to North Korea and Iran in violation of U.S. sanctions.In return, the Commerce Department lifted a seven-year ban on ZTE's purchase of U.S. components that it imposed earlier in May. Trump said last month the ban threatened too many Chinese jobs and he wanted to get the company back in business.Chinese leaders have promised piecemeal trade-related changes including allowing full foreign ownership in their auto industry by 2022.However, American companies have ""major concerns"" about unfair conditions, and the recent moves haven't done enough to alleviate those concerns, said the American chamber's Ross.European companies also complain they are blocked from acquiring most assets in China while Chinese companies are on a global buying spree."
Chris Hadfield urges space co-operation with China | CBC News,Retired Canadian astronaut Chris Hadfield is calling for more co-operation with China in space and he wants it to be part of any international effort to return to the moon.,2013-12-28T16:20:07.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/chris-hadfield-urges-space-co-operation-with-china-1.2477871,"Retired Canadian astronaut Chris Hadfield is calling for more co-operation with China in space and he wants it to be part of any international effort to return to the moon.And he's not alone in his thinking. Space experts agree the Chinese can no longer be left out.""I think right now a lot of people see it as kind of crazy to co-operate with the Chinese, but I think it's the next logical step,"" Hadfield recently told The Canadian Press.China sent its first astronaut into space in 2003 and Hadfield noted the country's ambitious space program aims to eventually put an astronaut on the moon.On Dec. 15, a Chinese Chang'e 3 rocket landed a rover on the lunar surface, making China the third country to do so after the United States and the former Soviet Union.It was the world's first soft landing of a space probe on the moon in nearly four decades.He also pointed out that China launched an experimental space station in 2011. It will be replaced with a more permanent one which will be completed in 2020.A Chinese astronaut said in September his country is willing to open its space station to foreign astronauts and even train them for such missions.China was barred from participating in the current orbiting space station, largely because of U.S. objections over political differences.Hadfield added that after the Russians launched the Mir Space Station in February 1986, other nations dropped in for a visit during its 15 years in orbit.NASA says on its website that Mir hosted 125 cosmonauts and astronauts from 12 different nations before it was deorbited and sunk into the ocean in 2001.Hadfield, who became a Canadian astronaut in 1992, visited Mir in November 1995 on the U.S. Space Shuttle Atlantis. He was the only Canadian to ever board the Russian space station.""If you predicted in 1989 that I would fly on an American shuttle to go build a Russian spaceship, people would have said you were crazy,"" said Hadfield, who last March became the first Canadian to command the International Space Station.""So I think looking forward, there's a great opportunity to include the Chinese in the world space program — the international space program.""Hadfield said a logical progression would be to include as many countries as possible in an international mission beyond Earth — ""hopefully including China and India and the other countries that have launch capability and then progress to the next stepping stone, the next natural waypoint out to space, which is the moon.""Iain Christie, executive vice-president of the Aerospace Industries Association of Canada, says China's presence in space cannot be ignored. The association represents the interests of more than 700 aerospace companies across Canada.""I think China is back where we were in North America 50 years ago,"" he said in an interview from Ottawa. ""They're excited about space, they're not spending their time justifying why they're in space, they're spending their time justifying why they're not doing more.""I am hopeful that their enthusiasm for space becomes infectious to the rest of us.""Christie said decisions will have to be made in the coming years.""We're going to have to decide what to do about engaging with China in space — whether it's to be more collaborative or more competitive,"" he said. ""I don't know which one we'll choose.""Walt Natynczyk, the new president of the Canadian Space Agency, was in China in September to attend the annual International Astronautical Congress in Beijing. It was described as an opportunity to visit some major space actors in the country.Meantime, as Natynczyk continues work on a long-term space plan, Hadfield said Canada must look at where the world's space program is headed.""Canada needs to choose what makes sense to us,"" he said. ""There's so much technology that we need in power generation, in navigation, in communications, in environmental recycling — there's all sorts of technical issues that we need to solve that will also have use for us here back in Canada.""Hadfield attracted worldwide attention with his dramatic photos of the Earth, his tweets and his Space Oddity video during his space station visit which began when he blasted off in December 2012. He returned to Earth in mid-May 2013. The David Bowie cover has had close to 20 million views on YouTube."

It was not immediately clear if it caused casualties or significant damage.The U.S. Geological Survey said the magnitude-6.8 quake was centred 269 kilometres east-southeast of Hotan at a depth of 12.5 kilometres. The area is known in Chinese as Yutian, and in the local Uighur language as Keriya. The China Earthquake Networks Centre measured the quake at magnitude 7.3 and said it was followed by at least seven smaller quakes within the following half hour.Yutian county is a mountainous area several thousand metres above sea level on the edge of the Taklamakan desert.The director of the Yutian Civil Affairs Bureau, Zhang Chong, said officials were still gathering information. A police officer in Yutian said he had felt tremors shaking the police station and ran outside.Wang Gang, a fire brigade chief in Yutian County, told the national CCTV broadcaster he was heading from the county seat to the earthquake zone, about 100 kilometres away, with a team of police and firefighters.A magnitude-7.2 quake in that area in March 2008 collapsed some houses but caused no injuries.China's worst earthquake in recent years was a magnitude-7.9 temblor that struck the southwestern province of Sichuan in 2008, leaving about 90,000 people dead or missing."

Pinaults return looted bronze zodiac heads to China | CBC News,"Two rare bronze Chinese zodiac sculptures, looted from Beijing's Old Summer Palace during the 1860s, were officially returned to China on Friday by the Pinault family, owners of the French luxury group Kering.",2013-06-28T19:27:57.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/pinaults-return-looted-bronze-zodiac-heads-to-china-1.1414514,"Two rare bronze Chinese zodiac sculptures, looted from Beijing's Old Summer Palace during the 1860s, were officially returned to China on Friday by the Pinault family, owners of the French luxury group Kering.French mogul and art collector François Pinault received a certificate of donation at a ceremony at China's National Museum in Beijing on Friday, as he unveiled the artifacts to media alongside Chinese Vice Premier Liu Yandong.""By returning these two marvels to China, my family is loyal to its commitment to preserving national heritage and artistic creation,"" Pinault's son, Kering CEO François-Henri Pinault, said at the ceremony.The bronzes, which depict the head of a rabbit and a rat, respectively, were part of a fountain featuring the 12 animals of the Chinese zodiac. During the second Opium War of 1860, British and French troops destroyed the imperial palace and pillaged its treasures, including the bronzes.The rabbit and rat sculptures turned up in 2009 as part of a vast Christie's art auction after the death of French fashion designer Yves Saint Laurent. China disputed the auction but when it failed to stop the proceedings, a Chinese collector successfully bid for the two pieces and then refused to pay, claiming his defiance as a ""patriotic act."" The heads reverted back to Saint Laurent's partner.The Pinault family says it bought the bronze heads from a private collector.The rabbit and rat sculptures will join five other zodiac heads returned to China previously and on display in museums: the ox, monkey, tiger, pig and horse. The whereabouts of the final five — the dog, snake, sheep, rooster and dragon — are currently unknown.The powerful Pinault family controls a massive portfolio of companies. Kering, which recently changed its name from PPR, owns luxury fashion brands such as Gucci, Stella McCartney and Yves Saint Laurent.Meanwhile, billionaire patriarch François Pinault owns international auction house Christie's, famed Bordeaux vineyard Château Latour as well as French and Swiss publications. The Pinault family, which first announced its donation of the two bronze zodiac heads in April, has recently ventured into the Chinese market."
Hong Kong fears pro-China brainwashing in education | CBC News,"The Hong Kong government calls it national education. But parents, teachers and pupils in the former British colony call it ""brainwashing"" and fear it's a ploy by Beijing authorities to indoctrinate the city's young into unquestioning support of China's Communist Party.",2012-09-07T15:46:21.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/hong-kong-fears-pro-china-brainwashing-in-education-1.1296013,"The Hong Kong government calls it national education. But parents, teachers and pupils in the former British colony call it ""brainwashing"" and fear it's a ploy by Beijing authorities to indoctrinate the city's young into unquestioning support of China's Communist Party.Plans by the government to introduce the classes have triggered mass protests and hunger strikes, the latest sign of the widening gulf between Beijing and the freewheeling semi-independent southern Chinese financial center, 15 years after Britain handed it back to China.The dispute deepened as classes started this week, with activists including a handful of hunger-strikers camping out in front of Hong Kong government headquarters in a bid to force officials to drop plans to introduce the subject in primary and secondary schools. They've been joined each evening by thousands of protesters wearing black.A local TV station fanned the flames when it called the activists a ""destructive faction"" controlled by London and Washington. The rising tensions forced the city's Beijing-backed leader, Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying, to call off his trip to a high-profile Asia-Pacific summit this weekend in Vladivostok, Russia.The growing opposition to the new curriculum threatens to undermine the chances of pro-Beijing candidates in elections Sunday for the city's legislature, when for the first time more than half the seats will be chosen by the public. Leung insisted the government had no intention of brainwashing, and reiterated Thursday that a group he set up to listen to public views would consider all options, including dropping the new curriculum entirely. But activists slammed the move as a hedging tactic ahead of the vote.The protesters are afraid of what they see as underhanded attempts to indoctrinate the city's next generation with Beijing-style nationalist education classes used in schools all over China to inculcate support for the Communist government. Many believe Leung, who became the city's leader in July after being picked by an elite, pro-Beijing committee, has close ties to the Chinese leadership.""Those who are opposed aren't against becoming more familiar with China, but they are against being made to mindlessly flatter China,"" said Ben Leung, an 18-year-old secondary school student who has joined the protests with a half-dozen friends for the past few evenings. ""We're afraid of this so that's why we need to take this step.""Many Hong Kongers are people who have either fled mainland China in past decades or have relatives who did. Surveys show a shrinking number identify themselves as Chinese citizens. They are increasingly uncomfortable with Beijing's growing influence on the city, its stunted democratic development and an influx of wealthy mainland Chinese that is driving up property prices.Residents take pride in the city's high degree of autonomy, separate legal system and civil liberties not seen in mainland China such as freedom of speech. Hong Kong was allowed to keep them when Britain handed the territory back to China in 1997 after more than a century of colonial rule.The new curriculum has been on the cards for years but fears rose earlier this year that it could be used for ""brainwashing"" after a pro-Beijing education group published a pamphlet that extolled the virtues of one-party rule. The government stressed that the booklet, called ""The China Model"", was not part of designated teaching material.Senior government officials have repeatedly denied claims that the classes aim to impose a certain mindset.""The government isn't brainwashing, it doesn't want to brainwash, and it will not brainwash, with this subject,"" Leung Chun-ying said Thursday.The government is encouraging schools to begin moral and national education classes this year but is not making it a required subject until 2015. According to curriculum guidelines, students will learn about China's political leaders, the efforts and contributions they have made and the difficulties and challenges they face. They'll also learn how to ""speak cautiously,"" practice self-discipline and get along well with others in a rational and respectful way.""What worries students, parents and the public at large is that a lot of the material that may be used as national education is seen as attempts to brainwash young minds in Hong Kong,"" said Willy Lam, a veteran China watcher and professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. It's seen as ""an attempt by Beijing to impose Chinese values of nationalism patriotism onto Hong Kong so that Hong Kong's high degree of autonomy might be impaired.""In mainland China, ""political education"" classes are required for students all the way up to university. ""A big chunk of it is indoctrination, with at least some kind of crude propaganda about the glory of the nation, the achievements of the Communist party,"" and reasons why people should follow the party's instructions, said Lam.The chairman of a pro-Beijing group inflamed the debate further when he suggested that opponents should indeed ""wash their brains.""""A brain needs washing if there is a problem, just as clothes need washing if they're dirty and a kidney needs washing if it's sick,"" said Jiang Yudui, chairman of the Beijing-friendly China Civic Education Promotion Association of Hong Kong, according to news reports. Jiang's comments in July came at the same time that tens of thousands, including many parents pushing their children in strollers, took to the streets to protest against the plan."

He said there were no deaths among the nine students admitted, although two badly injured children had been transferred to better-equipped hospitals outside the county.A doctor at Guangshan's hospital of traditional Chinese medicine said that seven students had been admitted, but that none were seriously injured.Neither the hospital administrator nor the doctor would give his name.It was not clear how old the injured children were, but Chinese primary school pupils are generally 6-11 years old.A notice posted on the Guangshan county government's website confirmed the number of injured and said an emergency response team had been set up to investigate the attacks.No motive was given for the stabbings, which echo a string of similar assaults against schoolchildren in 2010 that killed nearly 20 and wounded more than 50. The most recent such attack took place in August, when a knife-wielding man broke into a middle school in the southern city of Nanchang and stabbed two students before fleeing.Most of the attackers have been mentally disturbed men involved in personal disputes or unable to adjust to the rapid pace of social change in China, underscoring grave weaknesses in the antiquated Chinese medical system's ability to diagnose and treat psychiatric illness.In one of the worst incidents, a man described as an unemployed, middle-aged doctor killed eight children with a knife in March 2010 to vent his anger over a thwarted romantic relationship."

World's tallest woman dies in China | CBC News,The world's tallest woman has died in eastern China at age 39.,2012-12-05T13:42:13.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/world-s-tallest-woman-dies-in-china-1.1244996,"The world's tallest woman has died in eastern China at age 39.Chinese state media say Yao Defen died on Nov. 13 at her home in the province of Anhui.Guinness World Records in January 2010 had certified her as the world's tallest living woman, at seven-foot-seven. According to its website, Yao may still have been growing due to a portion of a tumour remaining on her pituitary gland. The website states she was too ill to be measured again.The local Xin'an Evening News did not give the cause of death, but said in a report that Yao suffered from gigantism, with a tumour on her pituitary gland disrupting her levels of growth hormone. A government official in her county who gave only his surname, Liu, confirmed Yao's death on Wednesday.Xin'an said Yao learned to play basketball when young, and that she was six-foot-seven by age 15.In a Chinese-language video from three years ago, Yao expressed anguish at her unusual height.""I am very unhappy. Why am I this tall?"" she said from her bed. ""If I were not this tall, others would not look at me like this.""In 2008, Sandy Allen — who back then held the record for being the world's tallest woman at seven-foot-seven — died. She was 53 years old.Allen also suffered from a tumour. She said it caused her pituitary gland to produce too much growth hormone. Prior to her death, Allen had been hospitalized with a recurring blood infection, diabetes, breathing troubles and kidney failure, according to a family friend, Rita Rose.While Yao held the Guinness World Record for the world's tallest living woman, the woman hailed at the tallest woman ever by Guinness is Zeng Jinlian of China. In 1982, she died age 17, measuring eight feet 1.75 inches.The world's tallest living man is Turkey's Sultan Kösen, at eight-foot-three. He was last measured in 2011."

He's now likely the most powerful leader this country's known since Mao Zedong.By far, he is first among 1.4 billion.And in declaring the start of a ""new era,"" he's more determined than ever to leave his mark on China in this second five-year term as president. He may even buck convention to stay in charge long beyond that, to continue leading what he calls the ""great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.""""If one is big,"" Xi said today, ""one must act big.""Xi's manoeuvring at the congress made him bigger.As he stepped out to unveil his seven-member leadership team — the party's politburo standing committee, which the official party voice People's Daily called a ""dream team"" — it was clear he had manoeuvred well.He is among allies, without a challenger. He made sure that none of the new members is young enough to be considered for the top job once this term is over. Everyone is in his 60s. No one has near enough political clout to challenge Xi, 64.Xi also chose not to name a successor, the normal act of a Chinese leader once he reaches the halfway point of his expected decade in power. No potential challenger there, either.He even led the delegates in enshrining what's become known as ""Xi Thought"" in the party's constitution, the first living Chinese leader since Mao to embed himself so firmly in a document that will outlive Xi himself.""The congress unanimously agrees that Xi Jinping Thought shall constitute a guide to the action of the party,"" it was announced at the closing ceremony. The official title of the concept is ""Xi's Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era.""Some worry all of this might have gone a bit too far, raising the risk of a future crisis.Opposing or criticizing Xi has now become tantamount to attacking the party, says Zhang Lifan, an economist and political observer at the Beijing Institute of Technology.""It's clear the leader has tightened his grip on power,"" he said. ""But that also means the risk of making mistakes has also gone up, since there is no adequate mechanism to correct mistakes"" in the party.""Also, the leader has to stay healthy,"" he adds, ""since we are without an heir.""In terms of Xi's policies, China's direction isn't expected to change, though the rules may become better defined — and tougher.Party members will still face discipline. More than a million have already been punished for corruption, including generals, top officials and low-level bureaucrats. The hunt for these ""tigers and flies,"" as Xi calls them, will continue. And targets may well include his political rivals.The party's will — including arbitrary rules on morality — will continue to be imposed on the country. Xi has cracked down hard on human rights activists, NGOs and dissidents. These groups expect things to get even worse.This regime ""can do anything with impunity,"" says Sharon Hom, executive director of Human Rights in China. With the Communist Party's pronouncements, ""there's not a lot of space for independent voices,"" she says.Under Xi, journalists and artists are expected to support the government, and all citizens are expected to toe the line.To make sure they do, China is developing an unprecedented arsenal of tools to follow people's movements and purchases, listen to their calls and censor their words, even in private communications.In Xi's next term China plans to build an enormous database of every citizen's face, to be recognized and monitored electronically.Through this congress, Xi has also sharpened his rhetoric on China's international intentions.His tenure has already seen a new Beijing assertiveness on issues such as sovereignty over land and sea, and an insistence on total control over what he sees as Chinese territory — including Hong Kong and Taiwan.Here, his emphatic insistence on that drew loud applause. ""We will never allow anyone, any group, or any political party,"" Xi told the party delegates, ""to separate any part of Chinese territory from China.""He also reaffirmed plans to strengthen the country's military forces, repeatedly insisting that China is a ""great power,"" and that its ""military is built to fight.""""Our military must regard combat capability as the measure to meet in all its work, and focus on winning when called upon,"" he said.And he made clear China has no interest in taking a cue from the West or to ""copy the foreign political model"" of liberal democracies. It will go its own way, he said, ""different from that of traditional great powers.""Xi even talked about exporting China's ideas through friendship and through financial help along the lines of his massive ""Belt and Road"" infrastructure project that is spreading across Asia and into Africa and Europe, though countries like India have viewed China's motives with suspicion.China's desire to take centre stage globally is expected to grow, now that Xi is more firmly in control and ready to ""act big."""
What does China's new Arctic policy mean for Canada? | CBC News,"The Chinese government has released a policy document on the Arctic, for the first time. The document makes it clear that China intends to pursue a growing role in the Arctic.",2018-01-27T15:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/what-does-china-s-new-arctic-policy-mean-for-canada-1.4506754,"On Friday, China released a white paper describing its Arctic policy in a rare public move.The policy outlines plans to develop shipping routes, expand its research programs, pursue environmental protection and develop resources across the Arctic. ""I'm a little shocked,"" said University of Calgary associate professor Robert Huebert.""The Chinese do not issue white papers. This clearly illustrated how important the Arctic is to the Chinese."" Experts say the policy is attempting to tread a line — between respecting the sovereignty of Arctic nations, like Canada and the United States, and leaving room to gain from disputes in international law.Like the Arctic Council, the document specifically refers to the rights of the Indigenous peoples of the Arctic. It also references environmental protection, scientific research and international cooperation.But it also repeatedly comes back to respect for international law, a choice that Huebert and Université Laval professor Frédéric Lasserre view as an attempt to articulate limits on Arctic states' sovereignty.For example, the United States views the Northwest Passage as an ""international strait"" while Canada sees it as ""internal waters"" — a semantic difference that could mean major changes in how the waterway is managed and who has the right to use it.Lasserre is co-author of China's Arctic Ambitions and What They Mean for Canada, a book coincidentally also released on Friday.""We don't know how China places the hierarchy between Arctic states and international law,"" Lasserre said. ""It's this ambiguity over what China wants to do in the Arctic that's a bit troubling."" Huebert said China is especially interested in issues of sovereignty and access to shipping lanes, as growing and maintaining Arctic shipping is a ""core Arctic interest."" China refers to itself as a ""near-Arctic state"" throughout the policy document. The term that has no formal legal meaning.However, it's been used in the past by non-Arctic countries that were eager to gain Arctic Council observer status.China gained that status in 2013.India has taken that a step further when applying for observer status, saying that its prehistoric geological connection to Antarctica qualifies it as a polar nation.Lasserre said China's Arctic ambitions have largely been carried out thus far in Russia — with investments in a liquefied natural gas project in the Yamal oilfield and more interest in the Northern Sea Route by Russia than Canada's Northwest Passage. But just last year, the Chinese icebreaker Xue Long completed a transit of the Northwest Passage. In addition, Chinese state-owned firms have made tentative forays into Canadian mining.The policy paper specifically refers to an increase in Chinese Arctic tourism, something Yellowknife has been an example of in recent years.In 2016, Chinese tourists outnumbered Japanese for the first time ever in Yellowknife.""They are clearly, clearly aware that there are new opportunities for investment in this region,"" Huebert said, adding that inviting Chinese investment in the Canadian Arctic could be a double-edged sword.""Be careful what you wish for,"" he said. ""If the Chinese do start investing more [in Canada], if the Chinese do start sending more shipping — outside of the obvious economic benefits that would provide — what are some of the longer-term impacts in regards to the environment? In regards to the communities?"" Both Huebert and Lasserre say the document is notable, in part, for what it leaves out.""We're starting to see a little bit of Chinese naval activity, especially around the fringes of the Arctic, and that's always something that we have to keep an eye on,"" Huebert said. Canada has begun making investments in its Arctic surveillance and security systems, including a new network of listening posts and the first of the Harry DeWolf Class Arctic and Offshore Patrol Ships currently nearing completion in Halifax. For Lasserre, the solution is to keep a running dialogue as questions arise across the Arctic.""I think that's what Arctic states should do in the future: ask clearly, 'What do you intend to do?'"" "

I shouldn't have to work out a response to racism as opposed to working out a response to whether the temporary foreign worker policy is an appropriate policy and whether it's being properly applied in this case.""HD Mining has been granted permits for 201 temporary foreign workers. Sixty miners are set to arrive in mid-December; 17 arrived earlier this month.The International Union of Operating Engineers Local 115 and the Construction and Specialized Workers Union Local 1611 have filed an application for a judicial review by the Federal Court, saying there are Canadian workers who can fill those jobs.On Saturday, the legal and political troubles swirling around the plan to bring in the workers prompted another company, Canadian Dehua International Mines Group, to wind down work at its Wapiti River coal project, near the Murray River mine.Canadian Dehua, which is also a minority shareholder in HD Mining, issued a statement saying the shut-down, effective Sunday at midnight, was ""forced"" on the company because of a ""deluge"" of concern from Dehua investors, a result of the temporary foreign worker controversy at HD.Energy and Mines Minister Rich Coleman is attempting to downplay the closure of the Wapiti River coal project, issuing a statement that claims the closure is temporary and noting many mines close for the winter.The unions say HD offered wages that were $10 to $17 an hour lower than the going rates and no benefits. They also claim the mine advertisements said workers had to speak Mandarin — claims the company denies.The company filed an appeal Friday of a court ruling that granted the unions the right to pursue that application, which would have forced the federal government to hand over internal labour market opinions that concluded there is a labour shortage, and therefore a need for the foreign workers.The United Steelworkers Union filed a separate complaint with the provincial mines ministry and the mine inspector alleging the temporary miners don't speak English well enough to understand their right or safety rules.Jody Shimkus of HD Mining didn't want to speculate on whether issues of race are involved.""I would certainly hope that that's not the case,"" she said.Brian Cochrane, business manager of the Operating Engineers, said it has no place in the discussion.""Countries that don't have great records with respect to mining practices and safety records, that gives us some concern,"" Cochrane said.""But primarily, we want to make sure our Canadian standards, safety standards that we fought for long periods of time are upheld and that we manage to grow and build the safety standards and the work opportunities for Canadians.""Wong said the perception of China certainly comes into play.""There's always some human rights thing that they do, and it's magnified when it's reported in the West,"" he said. ""We have our own problems here and we don't tend to talk about our own problems.""China's rising position of power in the world and its growing presence in Canada is perceived as a threat, he said.The real problem is the federal temporary foreign worker program, Wong said.""These types of policies, they tend to be exploitative. The worker is really at the mercy of the employer,"" he said.The government has created a system rife for fraud and exploitation, Wong said, and Jim Sinclair of the B.C. Federation of Labour agrees.""They have no rights,"" Sinclair said.He said temporary workers face the double jeopardy of losing their jobs and being sent home if they complain.""You get fired and you get sent home, so it's tough. The boss has way too much power in these circumstances,"" Sinclair said.Human Resources Minister Diane Finley has announced a review of the program in light of the controversy surrounding the Murray River mine."
Tibet self-immolation protests against China on rise | CBC News,"People setting fire to themselves in Tibet has become an almost daily occurrence, a dire form of protest against what many in the autonomous territory call an oppressive Chinese influence.",2012-12-20T19:26:30.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/tibet-self-immolation-protests-against-china-on-rise-1.1240335,"People setting fire to themselves in Tibet has become an almost daily occurrence, a dire form of protest against what many in the autonomous territory call an oppressive Chinese influence.In this video report, CBC News Beijing correspondent Catherine Mercier travelled undercover into the picturesque Himalayan, and mainly Buddhist, area which borders with China to the north. The disputed traditional Tibetan homeland stretches 2.5 million square kilometres and has been claimed by the Chinese for centuries.According to advocacy groups, since 2009 almost a hundred people have set themselves on fire in protest of the Chinese administration in Tibet, and are reported to have government informants heavily monitoring monasteries.The rate of people choosing self-immolation was almost daily last month. The Chinese government blames the Dalai Lama, the spiritual leader of Tibet's government-in-exile in India.The Tibetan government has denied any claims of its involvement, saying the Chinese forced the confessions. In a monastery where self-immolation had occurred, Mercier spoke to several people who agreed only to speak off camera, saying they would continue to protest. Punishment for anyone caught denouncing the Chinese can be severe.Reports say that monks are being forced into re-education sessions where they must pledge loyalty to the Communist Party.

China replaces leading politician amid public scandal | CBC News,China's Communist Party replaced one of the country's most powerful politicians Thursday after weeks of speculation following a trusted aide fleeing to a U.S. consulate.,2012-03-15T05:29:52.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/china-replaces-leading-politician-amid-public-scandal-1.1148587,"China's Communist Party replaced one of the country's most powerful politicians Thursday after weeks of speculation following a trusted aide fleeing to a U.S. consulate, a move that set off a public scandal affecting the country's looming once-a-decade leadership transition.The move to replace Bo Xilai appears to effectively end the public career of one of China's most highly ambitious and unusually flamboyant leaders, whose professional tribulations had dominated political discussions in recent weeks.Once considered a candidate for a seat on the party's all-powerful Politburo Standing Committee when new members are selected during this fall's major leadership transition, Bo was replaced as Chongqing city Communist Party secretary by Vice Premier Zhang Dejiang, the official Xinhua News Agency said Thursday in a one-sentence report.Bo's removal will likely spur further competition for seats on the Politburo Standing Committee. But it should also put to rest lingering speculation over his fate that had prompted near-obsessive attention from China watchers and overshadowed the just-concluded annual session of the National People's Congress, China's legislature.Zhang, Bo's replacement in Chongqing, is an economics specialist who served for many years in the vibrant provinces of Zhejiang and Guangdong.It wasn't clear if Bo had resigned or been forced out and there was no immediate word on whether Bo remained on the party's 25-member Politburo.Bo's replacement was likely prompted by the scandal surrounding Wang Lijun, his hand-picked chief of police and the enforcer behind a controversial crackdown on Chongqing's gangs and the politicians and policemen who protected them.The campaign won Bo national attention and praise among his constituents, resulting in 2,000 arrests, 500 prosecutions and 13 executions, including that of the former director of the city's Judicial Bureau over bribery, rape, extortion and gang-related charges.But it also drew criticism for ignoring due process at a time when the government is at least paying lip service to calls for strengthened legal guarantees, albeit highly selectively. It also appeared to especially target private businesses, fueling a sense of insecurity among China's entrepreneurial class that is spurring large numbers of them to move abroad.Bo also gained notoriety for a citywide campaign to revive Mao-era communist songs and stories, dredging up memories of the chaotic Cultural Revolution, although Bo claimed he wasn't motivated by politics and only wanted to boost civic pride.Both campaigns fizzled after initial bursts of positive publicity — along with Bo's political prospects.Ties between Bo and Wang appeared to fray amid reports of an investigation into Wang's former subordinates at his former posting in the northeastern city of Tieling. Transferred to a minor city government post, Wang drove to the U.S. consulate in the nearby city of Chengdu on Feb. 6 in an apparent bid to gain political asylum, staying there overnight before leaving and being taken into custody by investigators from the State Security Ministry in Beijing.Wang's present location is unknown, although Xinhua said Thursday he has been removed from his remaining post as one of Chongqing's vice mayors.The announcement comes just after the close of the annual session of the legislature and underscores how party leaders dealt with Bo's troubles behind the scenes while trying to project an image of unity for the public. Bo sparked new rumours by missing a key meeting of the body last week, but sprung back last Friday with a public appearance at which he admitted to mistakes but defended his record in Chongqing.If Bo is stripped of his Politburo seat, it would be the first time a member of the collective leadership has been removed since 2006 when Shanghai's party secretary, Chen Liangyu, was purged and later sentenced for corruption. Chen's removal was seen as a well-orchestrated move by President Hu Jintao to consolidate his power and remove a rival midway through his 10-year term.Unusual for party infighting, Bo's undoing unfolded in public. Wang's trip to the U.S. Consulate was first rumoured on the Internet and, after the U.S. State Department confirmed the visit ,the government was forced to follow suit.Still amid the rumours of political intrigue, no public explanation has been offered of what led to the rupture between Bo and Wang, a trusted aide for much of the past decade, and what transgressions led to Bo's removal. Premier Wen Jiabao offered the bluntest criticism of Bo and the affair on Wednesday telling reporters that Chongqing leaders ""must seriously reflect on the Wang Lijun incident and learn lessons from this incident.""""The public is still in the dark as to what really happened and what has been found in the investigation,"" said Liu Shanying, expert on public administration from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. ""What should Mr. Bo reflect on? His hiring decision? If it was only a firing decision, the consequences wouldn't have been like this. But what else did Premier Wen imply? The public is still puzzled."""

How tankers are avoiding tariffs in the trade war and shipping U.S. ethanol to China | CBC News,The journey of a tanker full of U.S. ethanol to Asia illustrates a broader shift in global trade since U.S. President Donald Trump ignited a trade war with China last spring.,2019-02-07T17:41:56.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/reuters-shipping-ethanol-1.5009665,"In June, the High Seas tanker ship loaded up on ethanol in Texas and set off for Asia.Two months later — after a circuitous journey that included a ship-to-ship transfer and a stop in Malaysia — its cargo arrived in China, according to shipping data analyzed by Reuters and interviews with Malaysian and Chinese port officials.At the time, the roundabout route puzzled global ethanol traders and ship brokers, who called it a convoluted and costly way to get U.S. fuel to China.But the journey reflects a broader shift in global ethanol flows since U.S. President Donald Trump ignited a trade war with China last spring.Although China slapped retaliatory tariffs up to 70 per cent on U.S. ethanol shipments, the fuel can still legally enter China tariff-free if it arrives blended with at least 40 per cent Asian-produced fuel, according to trade rules established between China and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), the regional economic and political body.In a striking example of how global commodity markets respond to government policies blocking free trade, some 88,000 tonnes of U.S. ethanol landed on Malaysian shores through November of last year — all since June, shortly after China hiked its tax on U.S. shipments. The surge follows years of negligible imports of U.S. ethanol to Malaysia.In turn, Malaysia has exported 69,000 tonnes of ethanol to China, the first time the nation has been an exporter of the fuel in at least three years, according to Chinese import data.Blending U.S. and Asian ethanol for the Chinese market undermines the intent of Beijing's tariffs and helps struggling American ethanol producers by keeping a path open to a major export market that would otherwise be closed.""Global commodity markets are incredibly creative in finding ways to ensure willing sellers are able to meet the demands of willing buyers,"" Geoff Cooper, head of the Renewable Fuels Association, said in a statement to Reuters. The group represents U.S. ethanol producers.In at least two cases examined by Reuters, including that of the High Seas, blending of U.S. ethanol cargoes with other products appeared to have occurred in Malaysia before the cargoes were shipped on to China, according to a Reuters analysis of shipping records and interviews with port officials.Chinese merchants, including the state-backed oil company Unipec, notified Chinese authorities about the unusual activity last summer — which represented competition they had not anticipated under the tariff scheme, according to two industry sources.Unipec's parent company, Sinopec, did not respond to requests for comment. A spokesman for China's General Administration of Customs declined to comment.Norazman Ayob, deputy secretary general of the Malaysian trade ministry, confirmed that Malaysia exported ethanol to China this year. The ministry was unable to confirm whether it had been mixed with U.S. fuel, he said, but noted such blending would be legal under the ASEAN-China pact.Malaysia has no track record of significant domestic ethanol production, so it is unclear where the ethanol blended with the U.S. product originates.Additional U.S. ethanol has flowed in unusual volumes to other destinations since Trump's trade war began, including other ASEAN member nations the Philippines and Indonesia, according to shipping and trade data, though Reuters could not confirm its final destination.The High Seas cargo ship was among the first to engage in the rising U.S.-to-Malaysia ethanol trade, according to shipping data from financial information provider Refinitiv and bills of lading from the ports.It loaded 25,000 tonnes of ethanol in Texas City on June 23 and then another 10,000 tonnes in Beaumont on June 27.Some of the ethanol was produced by Green Plains Inc., one of America's top ethanol producers. Green Plains spokesman Jim Stark confirmed the loading of the company's product in Beaumont but said it could not confirm the cargo's ultimate destination.At the time it left Texas, the shipment was owned by units of SOCAR Trading SA, the marketing arm of the State Oil Company of Azerbaijan Republic, according to the bills of lading.The shipment was initially destined for the Philippines.But after it crossed through the Panama Canal and reached the waters near Singapore in mid-August, the High Seas transferred its cargo to the QUDS, another tanker, according to the Refinitiv data.Vincent Mohy, general counsel for SOCAR, said that the firm sold all of the U.S. ethanol at the time of the transfer to the QUDS and that it made clear to the buyer the fuel originated in the United States. Mohy declined to name the buyer.The QUDS landed in the Malaysian port of Kuantan days later and took on another 12,074 tonnes of ethanol before heading to the Chinese port of Zhoushan and emptying its hold by the end of the month, according to the shipping data, a Chinese port official and two Malaysian port officials.According to one of the Kuantan port officials and a source in the Malaysian government, the cargo on the QUDS was sold by Malaysia's Rich Greenergy Sdn Bhd to China's Zhanjiang Industry Petrochemical Company Limited."
"Greenland ruling party has most votes in election tracked by Canadian mining firms, China | CBC News","Greenland Prime Minister Kim Kielsen's Siumut party won the most votes in a parliamentary election, results showed on Wednesday, though it lost ground to centrist rivals.",2018-04-25T09:05:16.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/greenland-election-results-1.4627068,"Greenland Prime Minister Kim Kielsen's Siumut party won the most votes in a parliamentary election, results showed on Wednesday, though it lost ground to centrist rivals.Dog sleds had to ferry voting papers to polling stations across the sparely populated country for Tuesday's vote. Surveys suggested that the 40,769 eligible voters were most interested in improving poor infrastructure and boosting an economy that depends on fishing and annual grants from Denmark.The social-democratic Siumut party won 27 per cent of votes, down from 34 per cent four years ago. That sets the stage for coalition talks with either the left-wing Inuit Ataqatigiit (IA) party or Demokraterne, which emerged as the third biggest party with 20 per cent, taking votes from both Siumut and IA.Greenland, a part of the Kingdom of Denmark but with self-rule since 2009, relies on fishing and annual grants from Denmark.Investors from China to Canada were said to be watching Greenland's election for signs of the political will to get a flagging mining programme on the island back on track.Greenland is hoping rising commodity prices can help attract foreign investment and get its fragile economy up to speed to realize the goal of independence.Hype about a possible mining boom in Greenland after it achieved self-rule from Denmark in 2009 faded in a morass of red tape and a commodity price slump around five years ago. It left the economy reliant on fishing and grants from Denmark.But with the country's sole producing mine starting up last year — a ruby pink sapphire mine operated by Norway's LNS Group — and Canada's Hudson Resource's anorthosite project due to begin operations this year, locals are again hoping more investments will follow.Improved access to and from the Arctic island as the ice melts, and a more favourable investment climate, would go some way to alleviate the barriers to business of perpetual winter darkness and temperatures reaching as low as minus 50 Celsius.Chinese interest in Greenland comes after Beijing laid out its ambitions to form a ""Polar Silk Road"" by developing shipping lanes opened up by global warming and encouraging enterprises to build infrastructure in the Arctic. ""A new government led by Kielsen and Siumut but without IA will create more openness towards attracting investments, including from China,"" said Rasmus Leander Nielsen, assistant professor at the University of Greenland in Nuuk.""IA is more skeptical. They want mining activity, but have more emphasis on the environment,"" Nielsen said. "

However, we have the confidence to conquer all forms of invasion,"" Xi told government leaders and current and retired PLA members gathered at the hulking Great Hall of the People, the seat of the legislature that sits beside Tiananmen Square.""We absolutely will not permit any person, any organization, any political party — at any time, in any form — to separate any piece of Chinese territory from China,"" Xi said to applause.""No one should expect us to swallow the bitter fruit of damage to our sovereignty, security and development interests.""Xi made no reference to any specific conflicts or disputes during his address, which focused largely on the PLA's growth from a scrappy guerrilla force fighting Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalists and Japanese invaders into one of the world's most powerful, if largely untested, militaries.However, China is currently engaged in a weeks-long border standoff with Indian forces near the countries' disputed border high in the Himalayas, with Chinese spokesmen demanding that Indian troops withdraw to avoid a clash potentially worse than the brief but bloody war the two fought in the region in 1962.China has also long been embroiled in a contest with Japan over East China Sea islands, as well as with five other governments over competing claims to territory in the strategically vital South China Sea. Beijing also threatens to use force to conquer Taiwan if peaceful enticements prove insufficient. China considers the self-governing democratic island Chinese territory.In his speech, Xi also emphasized that the military's highest loyalty is to the ruling Communist Party, underscoring the PLA's key role as regime preserver through crises such as the bloody suppression of 1989 pro-democracy protests at Tiananmen Square. Top Chinese leaders have consistently rejected calls to make the PLA loyal to the government and people instead.""The people's army will resolutely safeguard the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and our country's socialist system, resolutely safeguard national sovereignty, security and development interests, and resolutely safeguard regional and world peace,"" Xi said.The speech followed a parade Sunday at a training ground on the edge of the Gobi Desert during which Xi donned fatigues and declared that the military has the ""confidence and capability"" to ensure China's sovereignty, security and national interests.Xi, who commands the PLA as chairman of the central military commission, has frequently spoken of his ""China Dream"" to restore China to a leadership position in international affairs with a modern, far-reaching military force to match.The parade at the Zhurihe base in Inner Mongolia featured troops and advanced weaponry, and was another forceful indication of Xi's iron grip over the PLA and every other political power base within the party ahead of a pivotal congress this autumn that will award him a second five-year term as leader.That followed similarly high-profile military reviews in Beijing in 2015 and Hong Kong in June. Last week, Xi bestowed newly created ""Aug. 1"" honours on servicemen in a further elevation of the armed forces' stature.Xi and his predecessors engineered a radical upgrading of the PLA's capabilities through years of double-digit percentage increases in the defense budget, making China the world's second-largest military spender after the United States, although growth has slowed alongside a cooling of the overall economy.That has also spurred a global role for the PLA, which was formerly overwhelmingly preoccupied with securing China's territorial integrity.Alongside its blue-water navy, China is building its first overseas military base in the Horn of Africa nation of Djibouti, and Chinese ships held drills last month with Russia's navy in the Baltic Sea, more than 10,000 km from their home ports."

Winnipeg's recycling firm needs $1.5M more to meet China's new recycling rules: report | CBC News,The firm responsible for processing all of Winnipeg’s recycling is asking for the city to up its contract by $1.5 million over two years so it can keep sending materials to China for recycling.,2018-01-26T23:15:10.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/winnipeg-recycling-spending-emterra-1.4506356,"The firm responsible for processing all of Winnipeg's recycling needs the city to up its contract by nearly $1.5 million over two years so it can keep sending materials to be recycled in China, according to a city report.If the city doesn't foot the bill, it will have nowhere to export nearly 60 per cent of recyclable paper products — about seven per cent of all recycling and worth about $3.8 million in revenue — says the report, slated to be submitted to the policy committee responsible for the file on Feb. 1.""It's frustrating in a way, because it's not a cost we planned for,"" said Coun. Brian Mayes (St. Vital), the chair of the city's standing policy committee on water and waste, riverbank management and the environment.""On the other hand … if we did nothing then we're just going to come out behind. To me, yeah, it is pretty straightforward that this [additional funding] is the best option.""According to the report, Emterra, the company that handles the processing of Winnipeg's recycling, would use the roughly eight per cent funding boost to bring on additional staff to sort and monitor materials and tackle enhanced equipment maintenance.Without those changes, it won't be able to process recycling to level of new standards set by China that took effect on Dec. 31, 2017.Cities across North America have been struggling to meet the new, more stringent standards, which crack down on recycling shipments contaminated with unusable garbage.China had previously been refusing shipments for months, causing a backlog of materials to build up in some cities that rely on exporting recyclable material there.By this month, Calgary had already stockpiled five million kilograms of recycled waste since October. The City of Halifax wound up burning 300,000 kilograms of film plastics after seeking approval to divert the material to the landfill.Winnipeg generates roughly 30,000 tonnes of old newspapers and mixed-paper materials per year, according to Mark Kinsley, supervisor of waste diversion for the City of Winnipeg.Switching to another export market isn't an option, the report notes, because domestic and other foreign mills are either unwilling or unable to take on new suppliers and have tightened their own quality requirements.""There isn't the same capacity anywhere else in the world,"" Kinsley said. ""That's why everybody is working hard to meet the new [specifications] so that material will still continue to make its way to China.""If the request is approved, Mayes said the increase would have no impact on property taxes or garbage and recycling fees, at least in the short run.The city would strive to find the cash within its existing operating budget, he said, and could get as much as 80 per cent back from its industry funding partner, Multi-Material Stewardship Manitoba.Due to the structure of the MMSM's funding agreement with Winnipeg, that money would flow within a few years, Mayes added, so Winnipeg would still need to find a way to cover the cost until then.""It's like a three-year rolling average they use to calculate payments, so it's always a little behind.

""We don't want to be stockpiling or burning [materials].""According to the report, the city would likely have to provide an additional estimated $694,371 for 2018 and $538,984 for 2019, on top of roughly $226,000 to cover 2017 expenses, for a total increase of $1,459,167.The 2017 change wouldn't require a budget adjustment for that year.The actual numbers aren't clear yet because they're based on fluctuating amounts of recycling, market values and global economies.The report will be presented to committee next week. After that, it will proceed to the executive policy committee and city council."
"Richmond, B.C., man remembers Lunar New Year in rural 1930s China | CBC News","82-year-old Howe Kee Chan of Richmond, B.C., recounts his childhood memories of celebrating the Lunar New Year in rural China.",2018-02-07T22:34:45.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/lunar-new-year-1.4519447,"Out with the rooster and in with the dog.Lunar New Year falls on Feb. 16 this year and, for much of the world, it is a time for elaborate celebrations.Howe Kee Chan says it's easier than ever to make sure the holiday is full of happiness, with all the trimmings for a festive celebration available at the local dollar store and supermarket.But the 82-year-old Richmond, B.C., resident remembers a time when ringing in the new year involved a complex and sometimes difficult set of traditions. Chan remembers spending the holiday with his family in rural China back in the '30s and '40s, when the family faced extreme poverty.""We had chicken no more than four or five times a year,"" Chan told host Sheryl MacKay during CBC's North by Northwest. ""So when there was the festival I always got a drumstick.""Food is a huge part of the Lunar New Year in China, a holiday as important as Christmas is in the Western world, Chan said.No matter how far apart his family members were, they always came together for New Year's Eve dinner.Chan said his mother's baking was renowned in many surrounding villages, and on the morning of the festival he would rise at about 3 a.m. to gather fuel for the fire she would use to bake.Leading up to her baking, Chan and his sister would gather rice stalks to be milled into flour, a process he remembers being quite strenuous.She would then bake Fut Tei, a sweet steamed cake made with molasses his family obtained from the village's sugar mill.Chan's extended family in the nearby villages were also quite poor, so his mother would take it upon herself to deliver Fut Tei to all her relatives.Everything Chan's family had, they made. When they had to travel, they walked.""I had to go with her,"" said Chan. ""It was a lot of walking but I really enjoyed visiting the relatives.""Besides the dinner, Chan said that in his region there were ten days of festivities, each with a theme specific to a certain animal or valued commodity and each with a certain menu.Some years, a lion dance troupe would arrive at their village to perform — his community couldn't afford a troupe of their own.During the celebrations, the younger generations would go to their elders and wish them good health and long life. The elders in turn would wish the children strength and good fortune, before giving them good luck red packets. The packets would contain money, usually copper coins with which they could buy candies and fire crackers.With files from North by Northwest"
"140,000 live Canadian lobster sold to China in 24 hours | CBC News","Chinese buyers snapped up more than 140,000 live Canadian lobsters within 24 hours last week through a Beijing-based online retailer, and the demand can only grow, says a New Brunswick supplier.",2017-07-20T20:04:42.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/canada-lobster-sales-bay-shore-jd-1.4212600,"Chinese buyers snapped up more than 140,000 live Canadian lobsters within 24 hours last week through a Beijing-based online retailer, and the demand can only grow, says a New Brunswick supplier.The live lobsters came from a variety of sources for the sale July 14 on jd.com, one of the largest e-commerce websites in the world.According to a news release from the company, the surge in lobster purchases was part of a sale promoting fresh food from Canada, which also included cherries and blueberries among the offerings.""They want 10,000 pounds a day,"" said Nathan Song, director of the New Brunswick-based Bay Shore Lobster Ltd., one of the suppliers for the website. ""The first stage of the promotion is five days a week, so that's around 50,000 pounds from just us.""Song, who was born in China, said the country has recently emerged as a lucrative market for lobster. Restaurant owners and home chefs alike hold Canadian lobster in high regard, so much so, they are willing to pay a heavy premium on shipping, he said.""The people in China like the live ones,"" Song said. ""They believe if they are alive and are of good quality, they are from Canada. So people will pay more money than for other countries' [lobsters].""Normally, Bay Shore catches enough lobster to have a year-round supply, but with the Chinese demand, the company in Back Bay could sell out by October, Song said.Premier Brian Gallant paid a visit to executives of the website, which is host to 236 million active users, in Beijing last October to promote New Brunswick-based food products.The Canadian promotion coincides with an event at JD headquarters, where a ""Canadian fresh food pavilion"" is serving samples of lobster, blueberries and cherries. At the end of July, JD will be holding seminars in Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver for businesses interested in selling products through jd.com.Song said it is no secret China is a powerful buyer, but the opportunity for wider distribution there is often forgotten about.""We have 1.4 billion people, and the live lobster market is only open to about five per cent of the main country now,"" he said. ""There is lots of opportunity to open an even wider market.""China is the second biggest importer of Canadian lobster next to America. Demand for the crustacean in China has more than quadrupled since 2011, going from buying about $27.5 million worth of lobster that year to about $162.8 million in 2016.Geoff Irvine, executive director of the Lobster Council of Canada, said exports of lobster to China have rapidly increased ""in the last six or eight years,"" although there are some catches to the success.""There's a debate in the Canadian industry about the profitability of the e-commerce channel,"" Irvine said. ""The demand is good, but they don't return the best prices. It's a volume market, not a value market.""However, Irvine said, if a facility is able to produce high volumes of lobster, China's burgeoning middle class can provides the demand for a huge supply of Atlantic Lobster."
Taiwan call 'end of wishful thinking' about U.S.-China relations under Trump | CBC News,"Many in China are starting to fear that, far from ignorant, U.S. president-elect Donald Trump has a deliberate strategy — one that's more rash than irrational.",2016-12-06T17:28:34.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/china-trump-taiwan-call-reaction-1.3883412,"The headline in the Chinese Communist Party newspaper, The People's Daily, sums up a common view: ""Trump's Irrational China Bashing Shows his Ignorance of China.""But many here are starting to fear that, far from ignorant, U.S. president-elect Donald Trump has a deliberate strategy — one that's more rash than irrational. ""I think this is truly a wake-up call for Beijing,"" says Wang Dong, professor of international studies at Peking University. ""I think there's been too much wishful thinking about Donald Trump in China.""For many here, that optimism was swept away late last week when Trump took a phone call from the leader of Taiwan, Tsai Ing-wen. He defended it as nothing more than a congratulatory call.But it did mark the first time a U.S. president or president-elect spoke directly to his counterpart in Taiwan, certainly since 1979. That's when Washington broke off official diplomatic relations with Taipei and recognized Beijing as the government of China.Ever since, U.S. leaders have mostly avoided big shows of support for Taiwan, trying to avoid antagonizing China.Not so Donald Trump.""This is a very deliberate move, calculated to test China,"" Wang says. ""If China reacts strongly, then he might back off a bit. But if he perceives China to be soft he will become bolder.""Trump followed up the call with tweets underlining U.S. military support for Taiwan. He also attacked China for its anti-U.S. monetary policy and a ""massive"" military buildup in the South China Sea.Beijing's official response so far has seemed subdued, perhaps even a bit confused.China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi initially dismissed the call with Taipei as just ""a petty trick.""  But his government later filed a tougher formal complaint with Washington and sent messages of displeasure directly to Trump's team of advisers.""Taiwan-related issues are the most important and sensitive part of China-U.S. relations,"" foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang told reporters in an official briefing. ""We believe Trump's transition team is very clear on that.""Several members of that team are sympathetic to Taiwan and believe China's aim of one day retaking the island needs to be challenged.That's considered a ""dangerous"" idea in Beijing because, despite Taiwan's sovereign government, China still considers it part of its territory. Previous attempts to assert its independence — even in small, symbolic ways — have triggered threatening military exercises by the Chinese navy and threats to turn Taiwan into a ""sea of fire.""And that was in an era when China's military and diplomatic power was much weaker than it is now.""Beijing's message will be: 'This is a matter of China's core interests,'"" says Wang. ""They would say, 'If you cross the line, then definitely we are going to respond very strongly.'""Chinese public opinion also seems to be turning against Trump.Throughout the election, he was seen as a businessman with whom China could sit down and negotiate. He did threaten China with high trade barriers, but that was considered campaign politicking.The discussion on China's internet is now much more hostile, echoing the nationalism that Beijing has been stoking on a number of issues tied to Chinese sovereignty and territorial integrity.""Trump, if you go further with the Taiwan issue, let's see what's going to happen,"" posts one user called Zuo Deng Shan Bo. ""China does not fear a war.""Another user, called Never Walk a Dog, writes, ""It's time to show our muscle. Right now, China is just being a paper tiger.""But will the tough talk from Trump continue?Veteran U.S. diplomat Donald Paal says past experience suggests it won't. He served in both Taiwan and Beijing, and also advised former Republican Presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush Sr. on China policy.He says the hard rhetoric toward Beijing usually doesn't last beyond 18 months in any administration.""There's self-correction that takes place when the American business community and other interests intervene, and the notion of being tough on China has exhausted itself,"" says Paal.""You start getting more co-operation from Beijing, the U.S. president needs to meet with the leaders and get results. Then you start seeing a different approach, very traditional stands that have been the common denominator in the latter half of almost every presidential term.""Besides, he says, if Trump carries through on any of his threats — whether it be trade sanctions or a swing toward Taiwan — China has many means to cause the U.S. trouble.""They may not do it in hasty fashion,"" Paal says. ""But they will get their revenge as a cool dessert.""Taiwan elects pro-independence leader Tsai Ing-wen as president"
China busts massive child trafficking networks | CBC News,"Chinese police arrested 608 suspects and rescued 178 children in busts of two separate child trafficking networks, authorities say.",2011-12-07T00:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/china-busts-massive-child-trafficking-networks-1.1013610,"Chinese police arrested 608 suspects and rescued 178 children in busts of two separate child trafficking networks, authorities said Wednesday.   The Ministry of Public Security said prosecutors were preparing cases against the suspects, suggesting that charges have yet to be filed.Its statement posted online said 5,000 police across 10 provinces co-operated for six months on the investigation and moved in to arrest the suspects last week.   Child trafficking is big problem in China, where traditional preference for male heirs and a restrictive one-child policy has driven a thriving market in baby boys, who fetch a considerably higher price than girls. Girls and women also are abducted and used as labourers or as brides for unwed sons.   Tens of thousands of children go missing every year, though the exact numbers of victims are difficult to obtain.   The rescued children will be put into orphanages while authorities try to reunite them with their families, the ministry said. It didn't give the age range of the abducted children or other specifics.   An investigation into a traffic accident in south China's Sichuan province in May led police to the first ring, which was allegedly selling children abducted or bought in Sichuan to buyers in central China's Hebei province and elsewhere. The ring had links to at least 26 gangs nationwide, it said.   The second ring was uncovered in August and was based in southeast China's Fujian province and led by a female suspect identified as Chen Xiumei.   The statement said police have cracked more than 7,000 gangs or rings that sold women or children since a special campaign against human trafficking started in April 2009. It said 18,518 children and 34,813 women have been rescued."

China dominates diving events at aquatic worlds | CBC Sports,Wang Hao and Chen Ruolin of China never trailed in easily winning the women's 10-metre synchro after Li Shixin won the men's one-metre springboard at the world aquatics championships on Monday.,2011-07-18T13:01:53.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/sports/china-dominates-diving-events-at-aquatic-worlds-1.1073936,"If China is feeling any pressure to maintain its superpower status in diving, it isn't showing it at the world championships.The host country won its fourth gold medal and fifth overall in the outdoor pool Monday in Shanghai, thrilling fans who cheered and chanted ""China!"" each time their divers appeared on the boards.Wang Hao and Chen Ruolin led all every round in easily winning the women's 10-metre synchro after Li Shixin won the men's one-metre springboard and teammate He Min took the silver.Wang and Chen totalled 362.58 points.It was Chen's third consecutive world title in synchro platform, including 2009 in Rome when she also teamed with Wang. China has won six straight world titles in the event.Since Chinese diving superstar Guo Jingjing retired in January, Chen has been considered her successor.""I don't want to think too much about it,"" she said. ""My performance will be affected. Although the 10-metre platform individual gold is also important, it is not my goal. My goal is the London Games.""Australia's Alexandra Croak and Melissa Wu earned the silver at 325.92 — their country's fourth runner-up finish in the event.""It definitely built the confidence that we got a medal,"" said Wu, who finished second in 2007. ""The competition is intense. It's hard sometimes when you have to rely on someone else to do as well as you.""Christin Steuer and Nora Subschinski claimed Germany's second bronze of the day with 316.29.Meaghan Benfeito of Montreal and Roseline Filion of Laval, Que., were seventh with 303.87. It was a surprising result considering the pair had won five international medals this season.""It was a difficult day,"" Benfeito said. ""We struggled in the prelims but we were confident we could bounce back in the final. It started well but it was our fourth dive that really hurt us. Still we ended up with a decent score but you can't make any mistakes here. The level of competition was very high.""Wang and Chen received one perfect 10 for synchronization on their second dive. After ending the five-dive final with a backward 2½ somersault with 1½ twists that barely created a splash, the women climbed out of the pool and hugged.""Our opponents are all on a high level, especially the German and Australia duo,"" said Chen, who has been on China's national team since 2003. ""It's very important to be in control and perform our best.""The Germans received the only other 10 of the competition for their first dive.In the men's one-metre, Li lead all the way on a sweltering day at the Oriental Sports Center's pool.""You don't know how exited I am now,"" he said through a translator.Li's teammate, He Min, claimed the silver after rallying on his last dive to overtake Pavlo Rozenberg. The German, who had held second, settled for bronze.Li totalled 463.90 points in the six-dive final of the non-Olympic event. He had 444.00 and Rozenberg 436.50.Regina's Reuben Ross was sixth at 401.40.""I had no expectations coming into the one-metre, I just wanted to do my best,"" said Ross, whose main focus in the three-metre later this week which is an Olympic qualifying event. ""It was really a warm up for the three-metre. I've had a tough season with injuries and this performance gave me a lot of confidence.""Li walked up to the pool deck camera, smiled broadly and saluted as the partisan fans in the stands cheered loudly.""It's said that the one-metre springboard will be cancelled as a world championships event, so it means that the gold medal is more precious,"" said Li, competing in his first world meet at 23.Li had problems with his third dive, receiving scores ranging from 6.0 to 7.0, but it didn't cost him in the standings.His teammate dropped from fourth to seventh after badly missing his second dive when his legs hit the water upon entry. But He rebounded on his next dive to move into third, where he stayed until the last round.He's last dive was much more difficult than Rozenberg's, which helped him move up to claim silver even though the German's highest mark on his dive was a 9.0 while He's highest was 8.5.""I am making the first appearance in the world championships, so I was a little nervous at the beginning,"" He said. ""But I gradually relaxed. It's a precious experience for me.""Daniel Islas of Mexico drew gasps from the crowd when his right foot struck the board on his last dive. He created a huge splash while landing on his back. He received a no-dive and finished 11th among 12. Islas later came out and practised with his partner for Tuesday's three-metre synchro prelims.""I was just a little too close to the board. I don't know whether I will try the same dive next time,"" he said. ""I'm in a little bit of pain, but I'm OK."""
Trump gets initial approval for 38 new trademarks in China | CBC News,"China has granted preliminary approval for 38 new Trump trademarks, paving the way for U.S. President Donald Trump and his family to potentially develop a host of branded businesses from hotels and golf clubs to bodyguard and concierge services, public documents show.",2017-03-08T17:05:40.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/trump-china-trademarks-1.4015165,"China has granted preliminary approval for 38 new Trump trademarks, a move that offers a potential business foothold for U.S. President Donald Trump's family company and protects his name in a country notorious for counterfeiters.The trademarks cover everything from hotels and golf clubs to bodyguard and concierge services, public documents show.Trump's lawyers in China applied for the marks in April 2016, as Trump railed against China at campaign rallies, accusing it of currency manipulation and stealing U.S. jobs. Critics maintain that Trump's swelling portfolio of China trademarks raises the possibility of conflicts of interest.China's Trademark Office published the provisional approvals on Feb. 27 and Monday.If no one objects, they will be formally registered after 90 days. All but three are in the president's own name. China already registered one trademark to the president, for Trump-branded construction services on Feb. 14, the result of a 10-year legal battle that turned in Trump's favour after he declared his candidacy.Ethics lawyers across the political spectrum say that if Trump receives any special treatment in securing trademark rights, it would violate the U.S. Constitution, which bans public servants from accepting anything of value from foreign governments unless approved by Congress. Concerns about potential conflicts of interest are particularly sharp in China, where the courts and bureaucracy are designed to reflect the will of the ruling Communist Party.Trump Organization chief legal officer Alan Garten said the company has been enforcing its intellectual property rights for more than a decade in China and began registering trademarks relating to its core real estate brand years before Trump announced his presidential run.""The latest registrations are a natural result of those longstanding, diligent efforts and any suggestion to the contrary demonstrates a complete disregard of the facts as well as a lack of understanding of international trademark law,"" he said in an email.China's State Administration for Industry and Commerce, which oversees the Trademark Office, did not immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday.Plane said he would be ""very, very surprised"" if officials from the ruling Communist Party were not monitoring Trump's intellectual property interests. ""This is just way over your average trademark examiner's pay grade,"" he said.The marks include branded spa and massage services, golf clubs, hotels, insurance, finance and real estate companies, restaurants, bars, and a trademark class that covers bodyguards, social escorts, and concierge services.It's not clear whether any Trump-branded businesses will materialize in China. Garten did not elaborate on how the trademarks would be used, but said the company did not apply for a trademark for social escort services.Garten said in an email to the AP that part of the application included concierge and security related services associated with the operation of a hotel or restaurant, but not ""escort services,"" a legal trademark classification.Those hotel-related services fall into the same trademark class as escort services, which were included in the Chinese government's preliminary approval of the mark. The filing lists ""escort service,"" ""bodyguard,"" and ""social escort,"" among others.Many companies register trademarks in China only to prevent others from using their name inappropriately.Janet Satterthwaite, a global trademark attorney and partner at Potomac Law Group in Washington, said nothing about Trump seeking and receiving trademarks in China raises any immediate red flags.""Especially in China, you absolutely need to register defensively so that people do not exploit your name for commercial gain,"" she said. She said that while the marks are moving faster than in her own experience, ""it does not look like China did anything extraordinary here.""Spring Chang, a founding partner at Chang Tsi & Partners, a Beijing law firm that has represented the Trump Organization, declined to comment specifically on Trump's trademarks. But she did say that she advises clients to take out marks defensively, even in categories or subcategories of goods and services they may not aim to develop.""I don't see any special treatment to the cases of my clients so far,"" she added. ""I think they're very fair and the examination standard is very equal for every applicant.""But ethics experts — and Democrats — say a government's discretion to approve trademarks could turn into an opportunity to exercise leverage over the U.S. president.Richard Painter, who served as chief ethics lawyer for former president George W. Bush, said the volume of new approvals raised red flags.""A routine trademark, patent or copyright from a foreign government is likely not an unconstitutional emolument, but with so many trademarks being granted over such a short time period, the question arises as to whether there is an accommodation in at least some of them,"" he said.Painter and Norman Eisen, who served as chief White House ethics lawyer for former president Barack Obama, are involved in a lawsuit alleging that Trump's foreign business ties violate the U.S. Constitution. Trump has dismissed the lawsuit as ""totally without merit.""Three of the new China trademarks are for Scion, a hotel brand Trump's sons are looking to expand in the U.S. Unlike almost all of Trump's China trademarks, they are registered in the name of a Delaware company called DTTM Operations LLC, rather than Donald J. Trump himself. The Trump Organization has transferred ownership of dozens of trademarks from the president to DTTM Operations LLC since its incorporation in January 2016.Trump has said he assigned all his business interests to a trust overseen by one of his sons, Donald Trump Jr., and a longtime Trump Organization executive, Allen Weisselberg. However, Trump retains the ability to revoke the trust at any time and as the sole beneficiary stands to benefit financially from it.Democratic Senator Ben Cardin of Maryland said the Chinese trademarks stand as a prime example of how Trump's refusal to divest from his businesses as previous presidents have done raises ethical questions.""They're trying to curry favour with the president,"" he said."

But now, Arthur Rothstein's rediscovered photographs are finally on display in North America. The exhibit, called ""Stranded in Shanghai: The Hongkew Ghetto through the Eyes of Refugees and the Lens of Arthur Rothstein,"" opened this week at the Jewish Museum of Florida.The photos in the exhibit were taken after the Second World War and feature refugees in the Shanghai ghetto.For Rothstein's daughter, Ann Rothstein-Segan, seeing the photos up close is particularly special because of the lessons they continue to reveal to her all these years later.""I know what it means to me, which is that it's a story of tolerance. I'm sure [my dad] felt it was very important to tell the story of tolerance because we don't have enough in the world,"" she tells Day 6 host Brent Bambury in an interview. The story of how these photos were taken begins in Shanghai in 1946, one year after the Second World War ended. Shanghai had become an unlikely refuge for Jewish people escaping Europe during the war. As the rest of the world closed its doors, it was one of the few places they could go.More than 20,000 refugees ended up in the ""Hongkew Ghetto,"" which was cramped, disease-ridden and dirty, but ultimately safe.At the time, Rothstein was working with the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), a relief agency that had invested $600 million in fixing and rebuilding China's infrastructure. ""He was a first generation Jewish-American whose parents and grandparents happened to be alive because they had escaped anti-Semitic government sanctioned pogroms at the turn of the century,"" says Rothstein-Segan about her father. ""He knew about the many sacrifices his family had made and he was always drawn to stories about immigrants, migrants and the dispossessed."" Inspired, Rothstein took photos of the community, and eventually got them developed and processed. As time passed, the photos got lost and Rothstein went on to work as a photojournalist at major magazines like Look and Parade. But in the 1970s, he finally got a lead on where his lost photos might be. It was from an unlikely source: Kurt Waldheim, an Austrian diplomat who had just become the Secretary General of the United Nations. At the time, the complete picture of Waldheim's wartime connection to the Nazis had yet to emerge. He was later accused of committing war crimes.Rothstein, who had met Waldheim and his family during a photoshoot, tried to get the diplomat to smile by making small talk about his own time working for the UN and the photographs he had taken in Shanghai.""Mr. Waldheim said, 'You know, I might be able to help you Arthur,"" says Rothstein-Segan. ""A week later, dad heard from Waldheim's office. He was directed to a UN warehouse in Queens, New York and he got there and with the help of the staff, he found the box of photos and negatives...and the pictures and negatives were in pristine condition."" Now, more than 70 years since the photos were taken, Rothstein-Segan says the images still resonate. ""I see beautiful images that tell a wonderful story of inclusion and tolerance,"" she says, adding that she hopes people can look at her father's photos and learn to be more accepting of others. ""The Jewish immigrants — the refugees — were welcomed in Shanghai and treated humanely by their Chinese neighbours. And today, victims of religious persecution should be welcomed and offered refuge just like these people in Shanghai were.""This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

This represents co-operation by the two sides,"" Cambodian government spokesman Khieu Kanharith said after a meeting between the Chinese vice-president and Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen.He said 14 agreements totalled $1.2 billion US in grants and loans, ranging from Chinese help in building roads to assistance in repairing Buddhist temples. Earlier, China had provided Cambodia with $930 million US in loans and other aid.Cambodia said it was expelling the Uighurs because they had illegally entered the country.The United States said Sunday it was ""deeply disturbed"" by the forcible deportations.

They were worth $40 million in 2016.That added export demand helps improve prices at home, said MacLauchlan.China is P.E.I.'s second largest international tourism market, after the U.S., and MacLauchlan said there is expectation of great growth opportunities.He said 100 million Chinese travelled internationally last year, and that number is expected to double or triple in the coming years.Much of the trade mission will focus on Hainan province, in the south of China. P.E.I. recently renewed a cooperation relationship with Hainan, which started in 2001."
Dylan dumps tour after China denial | CBC News,Bob Dylan's tour of eastern Asia has been cancelled after Chinese officials refused to let him perform in Beijing and Shanghai.,2010-04-04T15:40:06.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/dylan-dumps-tour-after-china-denial-1.906000,"   Bob Dylan's tour of eastern Asia has been cancelled after Chinese officials refused to let him perform in Beijing and Shanghai.Jeffrey Wu of the Taiwan-based promoters Brokers Brothers Herald said China's Ministry of Culture is likely wary of a counterculture figure like Dylan in the wake of an incident by Icelandic singer Bjork.Two years ago, Bjork caused an uproar when she shouted pro-Tibet remarks at a concert in Shanghai.The dates in China would have marked the 68-year-old Dylan's first concerts in mainland China.He did manage a slate of shows in Japan through out March, ending the month with a concert in Seoul on March 31st, before abandoning the rest of his east Asia tour with more stops in South Korea,Taiwan and Hong Kong. Wu told the South China Morning Post that all those dates are now scrapped.""The chance to play in China was the main attraction for him. When that fell through everything else was called off,"" Wu told the newspaper.""What Bjork did definitely made life very difficult for other performers. They are very wary of what will be said by performers on stage now.""'Bjork shouted ""Tibet! Tibet!"" after performing a song called Declare Independence at her Shanghai concert.The British band Oasis was denied entry in 2009 and ruled ""unsuitable"" for Chinese audiences because the lead guitarist and songwriter, Noel Gallagher, had appeared at a Tibet freedom concert 12 years earlier.Dylan first made a name for himself with politically charged tunes including The Times They Are A-Changin' and the anti-war anthem Blowin' in the Wind.China has insisted that Tibet has been part of its territory for 700 years and invaded shortly after the 1949 communist revolution. China's rule over Tibet has brought condemnation from foreign governments and activists."
"China installs weapons systems on artificial islands, U.S. think-tank says | CBC News","China appears to have installed weapons, including anti-aircraft and anti-missile systems, on all seven of the artificial islands it has built in the South China Sea, a U.S. think-tank reports.",2016-12-14T15:48:26.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/china-weapons-systems-artificial-islands-1.3895829,"China appears to have installed weapons, including anti-aircraft and anti-missile systems, on all seven of the artificial islands it has built in the South China Sea, a U.S. think-tank reported on Wednesday, citing new satellite imagery.The Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative (AMTI) said its findings come despite statements by Chinese leadership that Beijing has no intention to militarize the islands in the strategic trade route, where territory is claimed by several countries.AMTI said it had been tracking construction of hexagonal structures on Fiery Cross, Mischief and Subi reefs in the Spratly Islands since June and July. China has already built military-length airstrips on these islands.""It now seems that these structures are an evolution of point-defence fortifications already constructed at China's smaller facilities on Gaven, Hughes, Johnson and Cuarteron reefs,"" it said, citing images taken in November.""This model has gone through another evolution at [the] much larger bases on Fiery Cross, Subi and Mischief reefs.""Satellite images of Hughes and Gaven reefs showed what appeared to be anti-aircraft guns and what were likely to be close-in weapons systems (CIWS) to protect against cruise missile strikes, it said.Images from Fiery Cross Reef showed towers that likely contained targeting radar, it said.AMTI said covers had been installed on the towers at Fiery Cross, but the size of platforms on these and the covers suggested they concealed defence systems similar to those at the smaller reefs.""These gun and probable CIWS emplacements show that Beijing is serious about defence of its artificial islands in case of an armed contingency in the South China Sea,"" it said.""Among other things, they would be the last line of defence against cruise missiles launched by the United States or others against these soon-to-be-operational air bases.""AMTI director Greg Poling said AMTI had spent months trying to figure out what the purposes of the structures was.""This is the first time that we're confident in saying they are anti-aircraft and CIWS emplacements. We did not know that they had systems this big and this advanced there,"" he told Reuters.""This is militarization. The Chinese can argue that it's only for defensive purposes, but if you are building giant anti-aircraft gun and CIWS emplacements, it means that you are prepping for a future conflict.""They keep saying they are not militarizing, but they could deploy fighter jets and surface-to-air missiles tomorrow if they wanted to,"" he said. ""Now they have all the infrastructure in place for these interlocking rings of defence and power projection.""The report said the installations would likely back up a defensive umbrella provided by a future deployment of mobile surface-to-air missile (SAM) platforms like the HQ-9 system deployed to Woody Island in the Paracel Islands, farther to the north in the South China Sea.It forecast that such a deployment could happen ""at any time,"" noting a recent Fox News report that components for SAM systems have been spotted at the southeastern Chinese port of Jieyang, possibly destined for the South China Sea.China has said military construction on the islands will be limited to necessary defensive requirements.The U.S. has criticized what it called China's militarization of its maritime outposts, and stressed the need for freedom of navigation by conducting periodic air and naval patrols near them that have angered Beijing.U.S. president-elect Donald Trump, who takes office on Jan. 20, has also criticized Chinese behaviour in the South China Sea while signalling he may adopt a tougher approach to China's assertive behaviour in the region than President Barack Obama."

China goes from red-alert pollution to green energy | CBC News,"China has a reputation for lung-choking smog — a country that runs on coal, where smokestacks at outdated steel factories belch black air. But tackling pollution has become a national priority, and the pace of change is often mind-boggling.",2016-10-27T17:17:14.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/china-pollution-green-energy-1.3823786,"The city of Foshan is in the middle of China's manufacturing heartland. It may be big and noisy, factories gushing consumer products and pollution, but its new city bus glides along almost silently, producing no pollution at all.The bus runs on hydrogen fuel cells, unique Canadian technology made in Burnaby, B.C., by Ballard Power Systems, now installed in engines produced locally by a Chinese partner and investor. Ballard has a contract for 300 buses in two cities here.The buses go much farther and take much less time to refuel than the battery-powered electric buses which share the roads here, says Ballard. On today's test run, things are going smoothly. And in today's China, the opportunities are growing quickly.""People do see very serious air quality issues in Beijing and probably 50 other cities in China, particularly last year when you had the red alerts. These issues are driving real change,"" says Ballard president Randy MacEwen, as we stand near a bus stop.China puts more than 300,000 new urban buses on the road every year. MacEwen figures that within a decade, 60,000 of those will run on hydrogen fuel cells. Canadian cities use none.But here, tackling pollution has become a national priority, and the pace of change is often mind-boggling.""The difference in the political and social structure here in China means that the speed of government — and the speed of business and the speed of market adoption — is unlike anywhere else in the rest of the world,"" says MacEwen.Starting with government subsidies that cover up to 60 per cent of the cost of each fuel cell bus.China has a reputation as a country where coal is king and smokestacks at outdated steel factories belch black air, and that is still true in many places around the country.But China's growing middle class has been unusually vocal in its complaints about toxic air in cities like Beijing, which can see day after day of lung-choking smog.A survey by the Pew Research Center this past spring found that seven out of 10 people in China felt air and water pollution are a big problem — either a really, or moderately, big one. And fully half of those surveyed said air pollution should be reduced even if that means slower economic growth.The outcry seems to have been heard at the top political levels.Chinese observers say that's one reason China's parliament ratified the Paris agreement on climate change, despite the accord's ambitious targets. The move was announced jointly with the United States with much fanfare just before the G20 summit last month. Canada ratified the agreement one month later.Under the deal, China commits to increasing its share of energy use that comes from non-fossil fuels to 20 per cent, from about 10 per cent in past years. It also promises that its carbon emissions will peak by 2030 and then gradually decline.That's a far cry from previous climate change negotiations, where China argued it should not be expected to make sacrifices like these because its economy is still developing.In a speech at the summit, Chinese President Xi Jinping said that for him, ""green mountains and clear water are as good as mountains of gold and silver.""""To protect the environment is to protect productivity, and to improve the environment is to boost productivity,"" Xi said. Experts say that has become a priority for the president. There is a recognition that China has ""bigger responsibilities and also capabilities than other developing countries,"" says Wang Tao, a Beijing-based energy and climate expert with the Carnegie-Tsinghua Center for Global Policy.""Xi Jinping has higher ambitions in achieving goals of climate change because he is more proactive in international affairs, and he also wants to see China emerge as a more respected and active international player,"" he says.That may explain China's booming wind and solar energy sectors, spurred on by billions of dollars in subsidies from Beijing.But the development hasn't been entirely trouble free.Those subsidies have been unpredictable and unevenly implemented. Green energy firms have also found themselves sidelined by the coal industry at times. It still has enormous political clout in China and consists largely of state-owned firms, with long-established connections.Still, the move away from fossil fuels is real.A study by the environmental group Greenpeace found that last year, all of China's additional energy needs were met by green energy, as its growth outstrips the use of coal and oil. In fact, the level of coal-generated electricity has declined for three years in a row.Meanwhile, wind turbines have been going up at an average rate of one every single hour. China is already the largest producer of solar panels in the world.Based on this, Li Yan from Greenpeace in Beijing says China is capable of meeting its Paris accord commitments, despite being the world's biggest energy user and emitter of greenhouse gasses.""No one can use China as an excuse of not taking action anymore,"" she says."

Shipments remained reduced Wednesday.State media have said no more oil is leaking into the sea, but the total amount of oil spilled is not yet clear.Greenpeace China released photos Wednesday of inky beaches and of straw mats about two square metres in size scattered on the sea, meant to absorb the oil.Fishing in the waters around Dalian has been banned through the end of August, the state-run Xinhua News Agency reported.""The oil spill will pose a severe threat to marine animals, and water quality, and the sea birds,"" Huang Yong, deputy bureau chief for the city's Maritime Safety Administration, told Dragon TV.At least one person died during cleanup efforts. A 25-year-old firefighter, Zhang Liang, drowned Tuesday when a wave threw him from a vessel, Xinhua reported.Officials, oil company workers and volunteers were turning out by the hundreds to clean blackened beaches.""We don't have proper oil cleanup materials, so our workers are wearing rubber gloves and using chopsticks,"" an official with the Jinshitan Golden Beach Administration Committee told the Beijing Youth Daily newspaper, in apparent exasperation.""This kind of inefficiency means the oil will keep coming to shore.… This stretch of oil is really difficult to clean up in the short term.""But 40 oil-skimming boats and about 800 fishing boats were also deployed to clean up the spill, and Xinhua said more than 15 kilometres of oil barriers had been set up to keep the slick from spreading.China Central Television earlier reported an estimate of 1,360 tonnes of oil has spilled. That would amount roughly to 1.5 million litres — as compared with 356 million to 697 million litres in the BP oil spill off the U.S. coast.China's State Oceanic Administration released the latest size of the contaminated area in a statement Tuesday.The cause of the explosion that started the spill was still not clear. The pipeline is owned by China National Petroleum Corp., Asia's biggest oil and gas producer by volume.Friday's images of 30-metre-high flames at China's second largest port for crude oil imports drew the immediate attention of President Hu Jintao and other top leaders.Now the challenge is cleaning up the greasy plume.""Our priority is to collect the spilled oil within five days to reduce the possibility of contaminating international waters,"" Dalian's vice-mayor, Dai Yulin, told Xinhua on Tuesday.But an official with the State Oceanic Administration has warned the spill will be difficult to clean up even in twice that amount of time.Some locals said the area's economy was already hurting. ""Let's wait and see how well they deal with the oil until Sept. 1, if the oil can't be cleaned up by then, the seafood products will all be ruined,"" an unnamed fisherman told Dragon TV. ""No one will buy them in the market because of the smell of the oil."""

""I think on both sides, more regular visits would make sense,"" he said.In an earlier meeting, Chinese President Hu Jintao also pointed out twice that it was Harper's first visit. Harper said it has been five years since a Chinese leader visited Canada.Despite the gentle proddings, Harper's visit to China seemed to be producing results. In a joint communiqué, the countries said China will bestow the label of ""preferred tourist destination"" on Canada, a move that will make it easier for Chinese tourists to visit Canada.China will also open a consulate in Montreal.The statement only briefly mentioned the issue of human rights, saying the two sides agreed they had ""distinct points of view.""""We always make sure when we bring up these matters — whether they relate to particular cases that you’re aware of in the newspaper that have been discussed from time to time, or whether they’re broader questions such as the situation in Tibet — we always bring these up in a way that is frank, at the same time in a way that is respectful of Chinese sovereignty,"" Harper said.Relations between Canada and China have been cool in recent years as Harper has pressed the Chinese government to improve its record on human rights.In their joint communiqué, the leaders pledged to keep discussing human rights, trade and investment, and to co-operate on ""green"" technology.Commenting on the scolding from the Chinese leadership, Liberal Leader Michael Ignatieff said it was as though Harper ""had received a slap in public"" and that it will cost Canada jobs.""He lost face today,"" Ignatieff said. ""And in that culture, losing face is very important and I do think it's cost Canada economic opportunity today.""Liberal foreign affairs critic Bob Rae charged that Canada has paid a price for four years ""of not just living on the margins, but actually, deliberately disregarding China.""""This was a deliberate decision on [Harper's] part to ignore the relationship and to assert that it had no particular importance for him, and I think we’re now paying a very, very heavy price for that decision,"" Rae told reporters on Parliament Hill.In another development, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman called on Canada to deport Lai Changxing, who is accused by China of running a smuggling empire that netted him more than $10 billion. Changxing has taken refuge in Vancouver for the last nine years after fleeing China.Chinese newspapers have taken a somewhat mixed tone toward Harper's visit.On Wednesday, the government-run China Daily ran a story touting Harper's arrival as a sign that ties between the two countries may ""thaw,"" while another article described Harper's visit as ""late"" but ""still welcome.""An editorial in the Global Times, a publication of the country's Communist Party, accused Harper of criticizing the Chinese government to appease his electoral base and of turning ""a cold shoulder to China."""

They were to marry Friday and stage a wedding banquet for 40 friends and family.The timing of the date was no accident. The Beijing Olympics began at 8:08 p.m. local time, on the eighth day, of the eighth month, of the year 2008.And, as Gao explained: ""Everybody knows eight is a lucky number in China.""Beijing residents have been in a frenzy to link themselves to the number in any way possible. They're planning events as large as childbirth and mundane as picking a cellphone number around the date.The belief is based on Chinese language and culture. The number (ba ) sounds like ""fortune"" in some Mandarin dialects. Double and triple eights are believed to double and triple your fortune.""Getting married on this day will bring us good luck,"" says Zhao, who demurely hides her face when asked what attracted her to her future husband.""I plan to have a celebration every year on Aug. 8. I will always remember the Olympics.""While Gao hoped the lucky wedding day would help his clothing business and his hunt for Olympic basketball and table tennis tickets, his bride-to-be had wishes of a more personal nature.""I would like to start a family next year. I want to have a boy and girl,"" Zhao said.Many others in Beijing clearly did not want to wait, targeting Aug. 8 as a possible birthday for their new additions.""We are very busy. We are very happy because many newborns will come into the world,"" said Dr. Li Shaofen at Beijing's Jishuitan Hospital. ""Women who have babies this year feel very happy and feel they have good luck.""Indeed, Dr. Zhang Yunping, director of the Maternal and Child Hygiene Hospital of the Haidan District in Beijing, told the Reuters news agency that his hospital delivered 30 babies between midnight and 1 p.m. Friday. Twenty of them were by caesarean sections, he said, a fairly typical ratio in China.   But Zhang also told Reuters that his hospital refused some parents seeking to take nature in their own hands and schedule caesareans for August 8.Women interviewed by CBC News at Jishuitan hospital who expected to give birth on Friday claimed they did not specifically choose that date, but felt it would be fortunate if they had their babies that day.""We're having our baby in August. We feel very happy, because China is [staging] the Olympic Games,"" said pregnant mother Zhang Li.A surge in newborns might be the talk of the hospitals, but some of the 08-08-08 buzz in mobile-mad China has been around cellphone numbers.Unlike in Canada, where most cellphone numbers are assigned with the phone, many people in China prefer to pay extra for a custom phone number. Cellphones can be bought for as little as $10 in Beijing, but a lucky phone number can ring you up more than $3,000. (The average income for urban workers in Beijing is around $5,500.)A local man, Zhang Jianyun, reportedly paid $2,788 earlier this year for the cellphone number 2008-0808. And a cellphone with six consecutive eights reportedly sold for $6,750 last year in eastern China.along ""Cellphone Street,"" a strip of Beijing stores offering the latest Samsungs and Nokias, buying a mobile has become much more complicated these days, said cellphone clerk Jin Ying.""The last four numbers of a cellphone are the most important,"" Jin said.You have to negotiate the price of the luckiest numbers with the store, which has hundreds of phone numbers for sale, all catalogued in books. Numbers ending in 6888 and 1888 would set you back more than $3,000.You can also take your chances at getting a lucky number from an automated machine at the state-run China Mobile chain.But try for 2008 and you're out of luck. It's been sold out for months."

And it's the first such visit by a Chinese leader to Ottawa in more than six years. On the agenda for their meetings are trade and growing economic ties.There's also been a lot of talk about an extradition treaty between the two countries.But for the family of Huseyin Celil — a dual Canadian-Chinese citizen imprisoned in China since 2006 — seeing the two leaders together has stirred up deep and difficult emotions. Their hopes, that Celil's case might also be on the table, are thin.Chris MacLeod is the lawyer for Celil's family. He tells As It Happens host Carol Off that they are feeling very frustrated.CAROL OFF: Mr. MacLeod, does Canada's new diplomatic dance with China change anything for your client, Huseyin Celil?CHRIS MACLEOD: Well, we certainly hope so. He's been in jail now in China without communication with his family and without the Canadian government having access to see him directly. So we hope the channel has changed. The jury's out. I remain optimistic that Prime Minister Trudeau, [Foreign Affairs Minister Stephane] Dion and Consular Services have done a huddle and are working hard on the Celil case.CO: And what is Mr. Celil's wife Kamila saying about this? Does she see hope now that these connections are being made with China?CM: I think Kamila and the children are exasperated. They're extremely frustrated. They've done a remarkable job remaining hopeful. But no clear progress has been made.CO: He has been in prison in China for 10 years. Can you tell us why he has been incarcerated there?CM: That's a million dollar question. China says it's for terrorist-related allegations. I personally believe that when he was in Canada he was very active with the Uighur community. He spoke for the Uighur people. He went to neighbouring Uzbekistan with his wife to visit Kamila's family. [Celil] went to renew his visa. There was an alert and he was detained and transferred to China.CO: We just saw Kevin Garratt released from China. He was there for two years. Why do you think that Kevin Garratt was released, but it still seems so difficult for Mr. Celil to be released?CM: Garratt's a Canadian citizen who does not have any ties to China like Celil did. So [the cases are] entirely different. Celil's been tortured. We don't know if he's had a significant trial; we weren't allowed in the room. If that's how they're going to treat a Canadian, what's going to happen with an extradition where they're now asking for the return of Chinese nationals who've come to Canada? I want to watch this situation very carefully."
PM Justin Trudeau will travel to China for an official visit | CBC News,Prime Minister Justin Trudeau will travel to China for an official visit from Aug. 30 – Sept. 6 where he will also take part in the G20 leaders' summit in Hangzhou on Sept. 4.,2016-08-18T15:42:43.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/pm-justin-trudeau-china-visit-g20-1.3726320,"Justin Trudeau heads to China this month on a visit that's expected to lay the groundwork for his approach to Canada's sometimes-bumpy relationship with the world's second-biggest economy.The prime minister's week-long tour, from Aug. 30 to Sept. 6, will stop in Beijing, Shanghai, Hong Kong and Hangzhou for the G20 leaders' summit.Trudeau has signalled his intention to deepen business ties with China, as his government looks to make inroads into the rapidly expanding Asian markets. The push could one day lead to a free-trade deal, something China has said it would like to pursue.But Trudeau will also have to carefully balance any pursuit of business ambitions in China with concerns over human rights in the country.He has already been forced to deal with one high-profile irritant between the two countries.In June, he expressed his ""dissatisfaction"" with China after its foreign minister publicly berated a Canadian journalist. In doing so, Trudeau also said he would take a stand with China on human rights.During a news conference in Ottawa, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi criticized a journalist who asked about his country's human rights record. Visibly upset, Wang said the question reflected ""arrogance,"" and was ""full of prejudice"" and ""irresponsible.""In response, Trudeau said he would continue to bring up human rights concerns ""every chance we get,"" even as his Liberal government worked to expand its economic relationship with China.""The fact is the way Canada has always engaged best in the world is to be active and vocal about the things that we are concerned about and disagree on, while at the same time looking for common ground that will be of mutual benefit for all of our citizens,"" Trudeau said.He also said he raised the case of a Canadian, Kevin Garratt, who has been jailed in China on espionage charges. Trudeau said Garratt was ""in prison for espionage without any evidence to support the allegations and accusations.""More recently, Canada weighed in last month on the ongoing South China Sea dispute with a thinly veiled call to China to abide by an international ruling that has angered Beijing.China, however, appears to still have high expectations of the Trudeau government.Trudeau had a positive exchange last year with Chinese President Xi Jinping during his first foreign trip after the Canadian election. When they met in Turkey at the G20, the Chinese leader praised Trudeau's father, Pierre, for establishing diplomatic relations with the People's Republic in 1970.During his Ottawa visit, Wang praised past Liberal governments of Jean Chretien and Paul Martin for advancing relations with China. He did not mention the previous decade under Stephen Harper's Conservative government.Harper got off to a frigid start with China in 2006 when he said he would not back away from criticizing their human rights record. He also said he would not sell out Canada's values for the sake of the ""almighty dollar.""But later in his prime ministership, Harper worked to forge stronger business ties with China.During a visit to China in late 2014, Harper announced the opening of new trade offices in some of China's fastest-growing areas. He also said a half-million Canadian jobs depended upon Canadian-Chinese trade.Trudeau said in a statement Thursday that the upcoming trip will create new opportunities for Canadian businesses and the economy, which has been stuck in a slow-growth rut.""I will strive for a closer, more balanced relationship between Canada and China, one that unlocks the untapped potential in our two countries' commercial ties, and advances important issues like good governance, the rule of law and the environment,"" said Trudeau, who was invited by Chinese Premier Li Keqiang.China and its exploding middle class, offer considerable business potential for Canadian firms.The statement also said G20 leaders will consider measures on how to lift global economic growth and investment, and reinforce the global financial system."
North Korea nuclear tests present dilemma for ally China | CBC News,"China's support for the North Korean regime goes back to the 1950s and the Korean War, but a Chinese economic and political analyst says North Korea should not count on that continuing indefinitely, in light of Pyongyang's latest nuclear test.",2016-09-10T14:27:59.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/north-korea-nuclear-china-1.3756624,"As UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon spoke, you could hear the disappointment in his voice. ""I do not simply understand why they are continuing like this.""Hours earlier, North Korea's nuclear weapons test had shocked the world. But his disappointment is personal. As the United Nations' top diplomat, he has spent a decade trying to convince Pyongyang to abandon its nuclear program. As a South Korean, he knows the nervousness that program triggers.""It's a deeply disappointing concern for this act of provocation, continuing against such an honest appeal and urging by the international community,"" he said.Appeals, inducements or threats… nothing seems to have worked.Not even some of the toughest sanctions the UN Security Council has applied against any country, implemented in March. Those were meant to severely limit trade with North Korea, and choke off the money and supplies Pyongyang needs to continue its nuclear program.Instead, North Korea's technology seems to be improving. So much so that U.S. nuclear weapons experts say stopping it is no longer a realistic option.The only possibility is to freeze it, says Siegfried Hecker, the former director of the U.S. Los Alamos National Laboratory, the heart of the American nuclear weapons program.""My best estimate at this time is that they may have enough bomb fuel for 18 bombs, with a capacity to make six to seven more annually. That, combined with the increased sophistication they surely achieved with this test, paints a troublesome picture,"" Hecker told a Stanford University publication after North Korea's previous test in January.Friday's test was the fifth in a decade, and the most powerful for the team of scientists assembled by North Korea's reclusive dictator, Kim Jong-un.North Korea says its aim is to become a nuclear power, one with the means to threaten the United States with weapons powerful enough to wreak havoc, small enough to shoot overseas on the tip of a missile.With each test, North Korea sends a message to its people that it is strong, and a message to the world that it is defiant, says Xiaohe Cheng, the deputy director of Renmin University's Centre for China's International Strategic studies in Beijing.""It's saying it will defy, ignore, challenge the Security Council's authority,"" he says.And, it continues to threaten the United States and South Korea.The North Korean people are ""always ready to retaliate against the enemies,"" it said on state TV after Friday's blast. ""It is part of practical countermeasures to the racket of threat and sanctions against [North Korea] kicked up by the U.S.-led hostile forces who have gone desperate.""Maybe not desperate, but many countries are certainly frustrated with Pyongyang, including North Korea's most powerful traditional ally, China.Beijing says it is ""firmly opposed"" to its continued tests. ""We strongly urge the DPRK [North Korea] to honour its commitment of de-nuclearization,"" it said in a statement shortly after Friday's detonation.But China's role in this dilemma has been complicated.On one hand, China doesn't want North Korea (which it refers to as Democratic People's Republic of Korea or DPRK) to become a nuclear power, says Renmin University's Cheng.""This would encourage other countries in northeast Asia to follow its steps to pursue their own nuclear weapons,"" he says — such as South Korea and Japan.The standoff has already increased tension between Beijing and Washington, over the Amercians' recent commitment to station a sophisticated system of radars and defensive missiles in South Korea. The U.S. says it's meant to protect the American ally from North Korean aggression. China says it will interfere with its own defences.On the other hand, China's support for the North Korean regime goes back to the 1950s and the Korean War. The Chinese Communist Party has strong practical and ideological ties with the ruling Workers' Party of Korea.The last thing China wants is to see a messy regime change, especially on its borders. Its concern is that since North Koreans have sacrificed so much for this nuclear program, Pyongyang must not seem to be ""forced"" to abandon it. Otherwise, Kim Jong-un could be so weakened that his government could fall.NewsFor the same reason, China has tried to soften the blow of UN sanctions by continuing to buy and sell goods that are allowed or that fall into a grey zone. In fact, 90 per cent of North Korea's trade is with China.Some even accuse China of turning a blind eye to an elaborate system set up over the past few years by Pyongyang to evade sanctions and to continue to purchase fuel and other technical supplies for its nuclear program.Research by John Park at Harvard University found that North Korean state enterprises ""operate inside of China … Most are attracting more sophisticated Chinese business partners who act as middlemen in transactions designed to evade sanctions.""Cheng says China is cracking down now, but it could be doing more to influence the leaders of North Korea. ""China has more leverage on DPRK and China certainly could do more to punish DPRK, if DPRK is continuing its provocation,"" he says. It would likely take even tougher UN resolutions to push China in that direction, the kind that are now being debated by the Security Council, he adds.And throughout, North Korea has been confident it can count on China's support. Sometimes, like this week, it has even sent messengers to brief Chinese officials about developments. Sources have told CBC that two senior government officials travelled to Beijing to give China a heads-up the night before this latest nuclear test.Cheng says Kim Jong-un shouldn't continue to assume that.""I think the decision makers in Pyongyang have to think hard before they make further nuclear and missile provocations. China's tolerance of DPRK's bad behaviours is limited,"" he says.""Don't push China too hard."""
Canola dispute with China could hammer prices and stall exports of other crops | CBC News,"New standards on Canadian canola exports being demanded by China has producers worried, something the prime minister said is a priority as he heads to Beijing.",2016-08-29T23:36:22.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/canola-dispute-china-alberta-1.3740468,"New standards on Canadian canola exports being demanded by China has producers worried, something the prime minister said is a priority as he heads to Beijing.China, which takes about 40 per cent of Canada's canola seed exports, is insisting the amount of dockage — foreign material like stems and pods — be cut down from 2.5 per cent to one per cent, effective this Thursday.""Somebody has to pay for that and at the end of the day it's coming out of the farmer's pocket,"" said Kevin Serfas, who owns a canola farm near Lethbridge, Alta. It's not just the costs of cleaning that has him worried. ""It'll be a ripple effect that's going to happen. Once we have to start cleaning this stuff down to one per cent, it just plugs the whole system up and it's going to cause backlogs in canola shipments, wheat shipments, barley shipments — any sort of grains that we export,"" he said. China is insisting on this lower dockage rate to reduce the possible spread of a fungal disease called blackleg. But Lynn Jacobson, the president of the Alberta Federation of Agriculture, said Canada has blackleg under control.""Their stated reason that, you know, it's to control blackleg is I guess somewhat of a false argument,"" he said. Jacobson is worried the backlog will affect prices, with desperate farmers eager to offload their crop. One group that could benefit from those lower prices are domestic crushers, who turn the seeds into oil. ""If there's less seed in China for processors, and there may be somewhat less, it opens up an opportunity for those of us who are exporting canola oil itself,"" said Steven Bank, the CEO of Sunora Oil, whose second largest market after the U.S. is China.Prime Minister Justin Trudeau will be in China from Aug. 30 to Sept. 6, culminating in a G20 leaders summit. The canola trade with China is worth around $2 billion."

"Meet the Canadians behind hockey night in Hangzhou, China | CBC News","Poets have celebrated the beautiful Chinese city of Hangzhou for millennia, praising the temples, pavilions and pagodas that ring its tranquil West Lake. But when Canadian eyes see a lake, they think of one thing: hockey.",2017-05-21T10:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/hockey-night-hangzhou-china-nova-scotia-ottawa-west-lake-rink-1.4121783,"Poets have celebrated the beautiful Chinese city of Hangzhou for millennia, praising the temples, pavilions and pagodas that ring its tranquil West Lake.But when Canadians see a lake, some think of only one thing: hockey. Recently, three Canadian English teachers living in the ancient Eastern city started hockey night in Hangzhou with the city's very first amateur hockey league. It's called the Zhejiang Hockey League, named for the province of which Hangzhou is capital.Kyle MacNeil, a 34-year-old from Sydney, N.S., says the league comprises three four-on-four teams: Lords of the Rink, Maple Buds and Red Stars. Collectively, they're the Westlakers.""There are about 15 Chinese players who participate in the league and we have players from all over the world — Canada, U.S.A., China, New Zealand, Russia, France, Finland and Korea,"" he tells CBC.Frank Ienzi, a 30-year-old from Ottawa, says some of the players come from northeast China, where hockey has established a foothold.""Some are brand new to hockey and want to get better,"" he adds.The third Canadian is Will Lefebvre, a 28-year-old man born in Middleton, N.S., and raised in Ottawa (all three spoke to CBC via email).Two years ago, he and Ienzi found a family skating rink in a shopping mall and arranged to rent it after-hours.""They wanted to bring a part of Canada to China,"" says MacNeil.Hangzhou is building three new ice rinks and they do have resurfacing machines, but the ice quality isn't always NHL-ready. MacNeil compares it to skating on a roller-coaster.""Sometimes the ice is great, other times it's a swimming pool, or the corners have big ruts, so there are times when safe play is paramount,"" he says.The hockey players must wait for the mall to close before they're allowed to lace up.""There aren't any change rooms, showers or player benches, and the ice surface is about two-thirds the size of typical rink back home. And on top of that, the rink charges about double,"" Lefebvre says.  But they're drawing fascinated fans. Parents and kids especially enjoy the fast-paced game.""They enjoy watching us and taking photos. Many of them inquire about playing and getting involved. They always say how cool it is and it is awesome to have this sport getting more popular in Hangzhou,"" Ienzi says.""There are a handful of people who have no idea what it is, but when we tell them to come watch they always have positive feedback.""Hockey gear is hard to come by in China, so they started with just gloves, helmets and sticks.""We had no goalies — we just flipped the nets down,"" MacNeil says. They looked at Taobao, a giant Chinese company that sells hockey gear, but found it twice the price it would be in Canada.Ienzi says by chance they befriended a local man who runs a factory called IBX and makes his own hockey equipment. He is now their main supplier, offering league players a good discount and occasional donations.Chinese people interested in winter sports usually pick figure skating or curling, and many play and follow non-winter sports like badminton, table tennis, basketball and soccer.But Beijing is hosting the 2022 Winter Olympics and the country is investing in winter sports. In 2015, Andong Song became the first Chinese-born hockey player drafted into the NHL.""I saw him get drafted and was very excited for him and the potential he has,"" says Ienzi. ""I know many locals have high hopes for him so I hope he improves and puts himself on the map worldwide.""Song got his hockey start as a six-year-old boy dazzled by the first game he saw — in a Beijing shopping mall. So perhaps the next Song has already laced up with the three Canadians.""There is some interest from the public towards playing hockey. People watch us play and they enjoy it, and there are now hockey lessons at our rink for children — but I don't feel hockey in general will become a nationwide phenomenon any time soon,"" MacNeil says.Ienzi notes that the NHL makes its China debut this fall, when the Vancouver Canucks and L.A. Kings will play the first NHL games in the country in Shanghai and Beijing.""You can bet the Hangzhou Westlakers will be at that game, decked out in all our team apparel,"" he says."
China probes cadmium levels in kids' trinkets | CBC News,China's product safety agency will look into findings that dangerously high cadmium levels were found in children's jewelry exported to the U.S. and possibly Canada.,2010-01-12T17:34:48.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/china-probes-cadmium-levels-in-kids-trinkets-1.886852,"China's product safety agency will look into findings that dangerously high cadmium levels were found in children's jewelry exported to the U.S. and possibly Canada, an official said Tuesday.The official, attending a toy safety conference in Hong Kong, said his agency just learned of the results of an Associated Press report published Sunday.""We just heard about this, and we will investigate,"" said Wang Xin, a director general for the General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine.Though Wang does not have the authority to order a full-bore inquiry, his comments were the government's first on the matter and show China's nervousness about potential troubles in the U.S., the biggest Chinese export market.In AP's investigation, it had a lab test 103 pieces of low-priced children's jewelry purchased in several states. They found 12 items with extremely high levels of cadmium, which can hinder brain development in young children, according to recent research, and is known to cause cancer.Twelve items had cadmium levels of at least 10 per cent by weight. One piece had a startling 91 per cent and others contained more than 80 per cent. The U.S. government regulates cadmium in painted toys but has no restrictions on cadmium in jewelry.On Monday, retail giant Wal-Mart pulled products cited in the AP report from its stores in the U.S. The attorney general of Connecticut promised to investigate suspect costume jewelry.The worst trinkets with the highest cadmium content came from Wal-Mart and retailer Claire's, both of which have numerous outlets in Canada.High cadmium levels were also found in cheap jewelry purchased from local dollar stores in the U.S.A New York state legislator called for a ban on the sale of children's jewelry with cadmium. And the top U.S. consumer safety regulator warned Asian manufacturers that cadmium and other toxic material must be kept out of children's charm bracelets, pendants and other baubles.Health Canada has promised to conduct an investigation that includes sampling and testing children's jewelry for cadmium. Health Canada, which has no power to order a recall of toxic toys, has said it will take appropriate action once the investigation is completed.The agency also said it's the responsibility of companies to ensure that consumer products they import, sell or advertise meet all requirements of the Hazardous Products Act.The findings of cadmium contamination come on the heels of a string of product quality scandals in 2007 that caused the U.S. Congress in 2008 to ban toys and other kids products that contain lead — another dangerous and once commonly used material. Cadmium is even more harmful.A soft, whitish metal that occurs naturally in soil, cadmium is perhaps best known as a component of rechargeable nickel-cadmium batteries, but is also used in pigments, electroplating and plastic. Low-cost jewelry makers find cadmium attractive because it is cheap and easy to work with.The new lead restrictions has sent factories rushing for substitutes right at the same time that cadmium prices dropped, in part because nickel-cadmium batteries are swiftly being replaced with newer products."

"Canada, China agree to extension in canola dispute, says Trudeau | CBC News","Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says existing ""dockage"" rules with China on canola exports have been extended beyond a Sept. 1 deadline as the two countries continue to negotiate a long-term solution.",2016-08-31T05:00:09.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/trudeau-canola-export-regime-china-1.3742341,"Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says existing rules with China on canola exports have been extended beyond a Sept. 1 deadline as the two countries continue to negotiate a long-term solution.​The two countries disagree on the level of ""dockage"" — foreign material such as weeds, other crops and detritus — that should be considered acceptable in Canada's canola exports to China.The Chinese government had given Canada until Thursday to cut the level of foreign material in its deliveries by more than half.Trudeau made the announcement about the extension in Beijing, where the canola dispute was expected to dominate the trade agenda during his high-level meetings and the G20, which gets underway later this week.""We're happy to reassure Canadian farmers that (at) the Sept. 1 deadline we will be able to continue with the current regime of canola and we (will) work together very closely towards a long-term solution in the coming days and weeks ahead,"" Trudeau said.Government negotiators in China said Tuesday they were working hard to resolve the dispute involving billions of dollars worth of canola shipments.International Trade Minister Chrystia Freeland previously said the issue was of ""absolute importance"" to the Canada-Chinese trade relationship.""As everyone knows, this was something that was a very difficult issue for our canola growers, for our canola exporters and we were very, very pleased to be able to achieve today, and hear directly from the Chinese premier, that Canadian canola shipments can continue tomorrow, Sept. 1 and onwards, under current terms,"" Freeland said Wednesday after the extension was announced.She said the two sides have also agreed to work towards a long-term agreement on rules for Canadian canola shipments. Freeland added that Canada hopes to achieve this in the coming days and weeks.China's ambassador to Canada, Luo Zhaohui, has stated that Canada has been inflexible and unfair in its approach to talks that began about seven years ago over Chinese concerns about rules for the make-up of canola shipments.Luo said China buys 87 per cent of its canola from Canada because of its good quality and production. But he warned China can always look elsewhere for the product, if necessary.Canada will also apply to join the China-backed Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), the bank's president Jin Liqun said on Wednesday, making it the latest ally of the United States to join the new international development bank.The $100-billion US multilateral institution, seen as a rival to the Western-dominated World Bank and Asian Development Bank, was initially opposed by the United States but attracted many U.S. allies including Britain, Germany, Australia and South Korea as founding members.""This is really for us, as a new government, the earliest possibility at which we could indicate our interest,"" Canadian finance minister Bill Morneau said in response to a question asking why Canada was only applying to join the bank now.Politics""We believe the bank is clearly showing that it's going to be a highly effective multilateral institution,"" he added.Morneau, who is travelling with Trudeau in China, did not specify how much money Canada would put into the new bank.""The Canadians' decision to join this bank will greatly strengthen the management of this institution,"" Jin told reporters. ""We can see that the U.S.'s attitude towards AIIB is showing signs of changing, as it's encouraging the World Bank to cooperate more with the AIIB,"" Jin added.Canada's application must be in by the end of September 2016. The government then has until the end of the year to ratify a deal and hammer out how much it will invest.The bank's governors could decide on new members early in 2017, according to Canadian government documents, which also indicated that the size of Canada's share would be decided at that time.Japan and the United States are the most prominent nations not represented in the bank. The United States said in April it is not presently considering an investment in the AIIB.After meeting with Trudeau, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang told reporters through a translator that Canada and China will launch a feasibility study on an eventual free-trade deal.A senior Canadian official later said the two counties have ongoing technical discussions on free trade, but stressed that there are no negotiations under way at this point.""This year marks 45 years of diplomatic relations between Canada and China,"" Trudeau said as he stood beside Li in Beijing's Great Hall of the People, which overlooks Tiananmen Square.""My father, Pierre Elliott Trudeau, played an important role in establishing a partnership between our two countries when he was prime minister. So, I'm very happy to be extending that effort now.""The countries also agreed to hold annual meetings between the Chinese premier and the Canadian prime minister on a range of issues, including national security and the rule of law.Trudeau also said the two sides will take steps to improve trade and investment, boost tourism, expand cultural exchanges and addressing climate change.Li said on Wednesday that a Canadian citizen detained in China for two years on suspicion of spying would be treated humanely, and his case would be handled in accordance with the law.In January, China indicted Canadian citizen Kevin Garratt on charges of spying and stealing state secrets. He was detained in August 2014 near China's sensitive border with North Korea.Li did not mention Garrett by name but it is rare for a top Chinese leader to comment publicly on such a highly sensitive subject.Asked about the Garratt case, Li told a joint news conference with Trudeau that China and Canada would continue to communicate on the matter.Trudeau said the foundation of a good relationship is the ability to be frank and open about issues that can be worked on together. He said he has ""highlighted a number of consular cases"" every time he's had the opportunity to sit down with Chinese leaders.Among those cases, he noted that he always raises the case of Garratt.Trudeau himself has indicated in the past that there's no evidence to support the accusations against Garratt. The prime minister did not say what China has told him about Garratt's case.Garratt's family said on Wednesday they were ""extremely frustrated and disappointed"" with the lack on progress in freeing him.""Kevin should be released to allow the two countries to move forward to develop stronger ties and cooperation on many levels,"" the family said in a statement released by their Beijing-based lawyers."
China's provocative art scene emerges from the shadows | CBC News,Raymond Saint-Pierre on China's new and provocative art scene,2008-08-13T16:36:58.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/china-s-provocative-art-scene-emerges-from-the-shadows-1.761784,"Raymond Saint-Pierre is one of Radio-Canada's best known and most travelled foreign correspondents, having been based for extensive periods in Washington, London, Paris and Beijing (from 1996-2001). His current assignment is with Une Heure sur Terre, an international news documentary show.The moment we landed, I was in shock. During my five years in Beijing, I'd become accustomed to the old airport of the Chinese capital: overcrowded, too small, lagging about a century behind its modern equivalents in Hong Kong and Singapore.The new one is ultra-modern, vast and stunning, not unlike many of the other developments in this country, including its provocative contemporary art scene. When CBC/Radio-Canada suggested we former correspondents return to China (joining Michel Cormier, the incumbent), I thought it was an excellent idea.I was particularly interested in two subjects: The explosion of contemporary art in China and the incredible development of Macau, which was just a tiny Portuguese enclave when I first arrived in the country in 1996.I had heard about works by contemporary Chinese painters that were being auctioned for millions of dollars, and I was keen to see what Xin Dong Chen, whom I'd met in the 1990s, would have to say about it.I'd made the acquaintance of this unique individual when his spouse, Caroline Puel, a correspondent for the magazine Le Point in China, had invited us to their house for dinner. And what a house! All the rooms were filled with paintings by young Chinese artists.Every wall was covered in works depicting the Maoist era and the new consumption craze, with plenty of irony, even cynicism. The colours were bright, sometimes fluorescent: Mao wearing lipstick, Communist symbols adorning fake Coke or Marlboro ads.Xin Dong Chen wanted to publicize the works of the highly talented young artists, but there were very few private art galleries in Beijing and the Propaganda Department (which still exists) would not allow him to display such daring pieces.Even in the late 1990s, the average Chinese person had few opportunities to discover this modern art. So Xin Dong Chen sold paintings to savvy foreign collectors. On trips to Europe, he would sometimes roll up the canvases and put them in his luggage, selling them cheap to foreign buyers.When I caught up with him on this trip, I discovered that things have certainly changed.He now owns three art galleries and has become well known, so much so that when French President Nicolas Sarkozy went to Beijing a few months back, it was Xin Dong Chen who showed him around Dashanzi, an immense complex that, until recently, served as a military factory and is now occupied by dozens of art galleries.I attended an auction of Chinese paintings with Xin Dong Chen. The Chinese are now the ones buying up modern art pieces, and it is not rare to see one going for millions of dollars.But Xin Dong Chen remains an idealist. In his galleries, he still shows works that test the limits of what the Propaganda Department deems acceptable. He still promotes Chinese contemporary art. And he's organized exhibitions of the works of some 40 Chinese painters, in Moscow and Athens.What also surprised me upon arrival back in Beijing was to see busloads of average Chinese visiting the art galleries in Dashanzi, snapping pictures of the most audacious sculptures and paintings.They obviously liked to see artists testing the level of tolerance of the authorities. (I was wondering whether they felt they had to go and grab as many pictures as possible, for fear the Propaganda Department might close the place down.)But contemporary art also appears to be seen by many here as in investment, or a kind of lottery: They are betting that some new, unknown artist will become big and make everyone rich. Many patrons, in fact, visit the National Arts Academy and try to buy all the works of some students.I realized Chinese people were really getting interested in contemporary art when I visited the Beijing Silk Market. You can buy anything there, from designer jeans to a North Face winter coat. The only certainty is that everything is fake — and cheap.Just for fun, I asked a few shop owners whether I could buy paintings from some of the better known contemporary artists, the ones that sell for hundreds of thousands of dollars at auctions.Sure enough, in about a dozen shops, I was offered hand-painted ""authentic copies"" of works by Zhang Xiaogang (who shows at London's Saatchi Gallery), Zeng Fanzhi and Yue Minjun, known for his paintings of grotesquely smiling people.If forgers bother to reproduce these works, it means there is real consumer demand for this kind of art.As for Macau, I became very attached to this former Portuguese colony in southern China. I travelled there in 1991 as a tourist, and was seduced by the mix of cultures: Chinese and Portuguese living together; Chinese fare with a European flair.I'd covered the handover of Macau in December 1999. At the time, the Portuguese population was concerned their culture would disappear. That hasn't happened. A far greater upheaval in the lives of Macau's residents has been the proliferation of casinos.Macau is a vast construction site, home to some of the world's biggest buildings, where gambling revenues have outstripped those of Vegas.Contemporary art, high-stakes gambling Vegas-style — this is not the China the world often sees.Before leaving, I took a stroll around the neighbourhood in Beijing where I lived from 1996 to 2001. In the late 1990s, I witnessed the opening of new Japanese, Korean, German and even French shopping malls where one could buy real jeans and real Western products, not cheap, low-quality knock-offs.Chinese shoppers also discovered paraphernalia associated with Christmas and other exotic celebrations like Halloween. Now, just a few years later, these malls are dwarfed by the new towers that are overshadowing everything. They already look outdated, ready to be torn down to make way for taller, bigger, more modern buildings.When I was a correspondent in China, I felt, every day, like a student who never stops learning, discovering and marvelling. That hasn't changed: China never ceases to amaze."
"China starts 2017 engulfed in smog, issues pollution alerts | CBC News","Heavy smog that blanketed parts of China over the weekend cleared somewhat on Monday, with flights in Beijing back to normal, but it was likely only to be a brief respite with more choking smog expected to return to the wintry north within 24 hours.",2017-01-02T16:41:10.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/china-new-year-smog-1.3918388,"Heavy smog that blanketed parts of China over the weekend cleared somewhat on Monday, with flights in Beijing back to normal, but it was likely only to be a brief respite with more choking smog expected to return to the wintry north within 24 hours.Weather forecasts on Monday showed the smog would return to Beijing and nearby Tianjin city on Tuesday. It was expected to persist until Thursday in Hebei, the heavily industrialized province that surrounds the capital, and Henan and Shandong provinces, as the region battles freezing temperatures.Severe pollution is forecast to persist in the region for three to seven days, the official Xinhua news agency reported.Authorities have been issuing smog alerts across the north since mid-December, prompting orders for hundreds of factories to scale back production or close outright and for restrictions on motorists to cut emissions.Pollution alerts are common in northern China, especially during winter when energy demand, much of it met by coal, soars.Electrical generating plants burn coal and much of the heavy industry, including steel-making, is concentrated in northern provinces.A pollution index that measures the average concentration of small breathable particles, known as PM2.5, dropped to just over 100 micrograms per cubic metre in Beijing early on Monday from more than 500 on Sunday night. The safe recommended level of PM2.5 is 10 micrograms per cubic metre, according to the World Health Organization.A customer service staff member at the Beijing Capital International Airport said flights were returning to normal on Monday after smog on Sunday caused hundreds of flights to be cancelled. On Monday, the Beijing government maintained its orange alert for heavy pollution and a ban on heavy-duty construction trucks from using the roads.An orange alert is the second-highest level in a four-tier pollution warning system adopted by Beijing when China, worried that its heavy industrial past was tarnishing its global reputation and holding back development, declared a ""war on pollution"" in 2014.Despite that declaration, public anger is mounting about pollution and what many Chinese see as government talk, but little action, to end it. That anger has occasionally spilled over into protests.China's educated middle-class is increasingly intolerant of the bad air, which some blame on lack of enforcement by government. There is also pressure on China to move generation away from coal to meet its climate change commitmentsLate on Sunday, the Ministry of Environmental Protection said 62 northern cities had issued yellow, orange or red alerts.Some highways to Beijing and Tianjin were re-opened as motorists headed home at the end of the long weekend, state television reported later on Monday. But 20 highways remained closed in Shandon province, as heavy smog persisted.State television also reported that some factories in Hebei province's heavy industry hub of Tangshan, including a coal-fired power plant of Datang Power International, and several steel mills, were found to be violating the curb on operations.The latest bout of air pollution began on Friday. China has struggled to tackle the problem effectively after decades of breakneck economic growth, much of it based on heavy industry and the coal-fired power sector."
China's billionaires club of entrepreneurs embarks on cross-Canada tour | CBC News,"A group of powerful Chinese business leaders set off on an eight-day Canadian tour Sunday that will connect them with Canada's corporate and political elite, including Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.",2016-10-16T21:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/china-billionaires-club-canada-tour-1.3807693,"A group of powerful Chinese business leaders set off on an eight-day Canadian tour Sunday that will connect them with Canada's corporate and political elite, including Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.This will be the first visit to Canada by the exclusive China Entrepreneur Club — often referred to as the billionaires club. It's made up of 50 top Chinese firms that earn a combined $585 billion of annual gross income.The group's swing across Canada comes as the bilateral relationship steams ahead at an increasing rate, with help from a Trudeau government that has shown more openness to the Asian superpower.The tour will take place only a few weeks after an exchange of high-level official visits — Trudeau's recent trip to China which was followed by Chinese Premier Li Keqiang's stay in Canada.During those meetings, Trudeau promoted his government's goal of broadening Canada's economic links with the Asian superpower. He made commitments that included the launch of exploratory talks on free trade with the world's second-biggest economy.At the same time, Trudeau brought up Canada's concerns with Chinese leaders about their government's approach to human rights, rule of law, governance and corruption.The China Entrepreneur Club is now hoping to deepen ties with Canada even further. Canada's relationship with its second-largest trading partner was considered inconsistent under the previous Conservative government.Maggie Cheng, the club's secretary-general, said the visit comes at a time of growing opportunities for both countries.""We have a large population and we are in a very long process of urbanization. And the consumer market is growing as well, and it will grow for a very long time,"" Cheng said in a phone interview through an interpreter.""I think the private companies in China have now grown into a (size) that can use a larger resource partner to further improve the Chinese market.""China is increasingly interested in Canada's agriculture, energy and fisheries industries, she said.Cheng also believes the recent visit by the youthful Trudeau caught the attention of China's younger generation, which she says is a large market with considerable buying power.Canada's business community is set to roll out a red carpet for the visiting club members, according to a program of the visit prepared by the group.During stops in Montreal, Ottawa, Toronto and Vancouver, the delegation will have audiences with a who's who of Canadian leaders, in addition to Trudeau.The list includes chief executives of some of Canada's biggest banks as well as former prime minister Jean Chretien, Ontario Premier Kathleen Wynne, Quebec Premier Philippe Couillard, Andre Desmarais of Power Corp., Alain Bellemare of Bombardier, Cirque du Soleil's Daniel Lamarre, Mark Machin of the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and Bank of Canada governor Stephen Poloz.In September, Trudeau kicked off his first official trip to China by appearing at a Beijing event hosted by the club. Jack Ma, founder of e-commerce giant Alibaba and the club's chair, led a question-and-answer session with Trudeau.Ma will not join the Chinese delegation on its cross-Canada trip. But the tour will include a dozen club members, including president Ma Weihua, Tsinghua Holdings Co. chair Xu Jinghong, Far East Holding Group Co. chair Jiang Xipei and Central China Real Estate Ltd. chair Frank Wu.Delegations from the club have already visited the United States, the United Kingdom, Belgium, France, Singapore, Australia, Germany and Italy.Sarah Kutulakos, executive director of the Canada China Business Council, hopes the visit will show Canadians who may have suspicions about Chinese companies that these entrepreneurs are similar to others around the world.She said in an interview that there were strict criteria to join the club and firms had to meet a certain standard in several areas, including corporate social responsibility and philanthropy.The visit will not only widen channels for business opportunities; it's also expected to provide learning experiences for both sides, Kutulakos said.""They're really the vanguard of where the Chinese economy is going,"" said Kutulakos.But one expert in Canada's ties to China said there are likely deep links between many of these entrepreneurs and the Chinese leadership.""In China, it's really very difficult to achieve great wealth unless you have a strongly collaborative, mutually beneficial relationship with the Chinese Communist Party's decision makers,"" said Charles Burton, a former diplomat who is now a political scientist at Brock University.Burton said the club may try to create a subtle lobby within Canada that encourages Canadian business leaders to press their government to make economics the priority in the relationship, rather than concerns over sensitive issues like human rights and cyber security."
Toronto becomes 1st hub to trade China's 'people's money' in North America | CBC News,"After stock markets closed on Monday, Toronto became the first trading hub in North America for China's currency, known as the renminbi or yuan.",2015-03-23T17:29:46.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/toronto-becomes-first-renminbi-trading-hub-in-north-america-1.3005726,"After stock markets closed on Monday, Toronto became the first trading hub in North America for China's currency, known as the renminbi or yuan.Chinese government dignitaries, Federal Finance Minister Joe Oliver and his Ontario compatriot Charles Sousa attended a ceremony in Toronto Monday evening to formally announce the first conversion from yuan to Canadian dollars.The announcement makes Toronto the first such trading hub in the Americas that has permission to be a clearinghouse for Chinese renminbi (which means ""people's money"" in Chinese). There are currently only a handful of such hubs outside China, including Paris, London, Moscow, Singapore, Tokyo, Seoul and Sydney, Australia.In practical terms, such hubs make it easier to do business with China because without one, Chinese money has to first be converted into a currency like the U.S. dollar before being again converted into loonies to make investments here, or even pay for supplies.""What the hub does is it provides the potential to get a good price,"" says David Watt, the chief economist of HSBC. ""It sets up a way for Canadian businesses to call their local banker and say ""we've got a deal to import Chinese material and we'd like to pay for it in RMB not U.S. dollars.""The hub eventually will allow people on both sides to take out that middle man and convert renminbi directly into Canadian dollars and vice versa.""It should give Canadian businesses the confidence to increase trade.""Watt says China is moving faster on full convertibility of the renminbi and could loosen rules further by the end of the year.The Canadian hub is likely to attract business from Central and South America, as well as the U.S. and Canada, he said in an interview with CBC’s The Exchange with Amanda Lang.""It does create opportunities for Latin American companies to do some of their trading in renminbi through Toronto as well because it’s the same time zone, active pricing, so you no longer have to worry about market dead zones in trading [with] other countries,"" Watt said.It's a huge market that Canadian businesses are eager to be more active in. And the hub could give them a leg up on the billions of dollars that are already flowing between the U.S. and China.""Bilateral trade between China and the U.S. alone is worth more than $550 billion US per year,"" director Michael Burt with the Conference Board of Canada said recently. ""If even a small share of these transactions pass through Canada, they could generate considerable transaction fees for Canadian financial institutions.""""Canadian financial institutions may benefit by providing associated services, such as yuan-denominated accounts, and the issuing of yuan-denominated securities.""​Australia signed a similar deal to become a yuan trading hub in 2013. The two countries have since signed a free trade deal.Next to the U.S., China is Canada's second-largest trading partner, but Canada is only China's 21st-largest, with $77 billion in bilateral trade between the two countries last year. Ottawa says trade between Canada and China supports more than 470,000 jobs in Canada a year, which was about 2.67 per cent of total Canadian jobs.The renminbi has become a major world currency relatively quickly. Roughly a decade ago, it was not widely held outside of China due to strict regulations Beijing imposed on where it could be used. From there, it has grown to be one of the most-traded currencies in the world along with the U.S. dollar, the euro, the yen, the British pound, the Canadian dollar and the Swiss franc."
Miss World Canada denied entry to China for pageant | CBC News,"Miss World Canada was barred from entering China on Thursday to take part in this year's pageant in the southern island province of Hainan, a friend of the outspoken Chinese-Canadian contestant said.",2015-11-26T12:25:30.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/anastasia-lin-miss-world-canada-china-1.3337822,"Canada's outspoken Miss World contestant said she was barred Thursday from entering China to take part in this year's pageant in the southern island province of Hainan.Chinese-born Anastasia Lin said she was unable to board her connecting flight from Hong Kong after a Chinese official told her by telephone that she would not be granted a visa on arrival.Lin, an actress and resident of Toronto, is an outspoken critic of Chinese religious policy and a follower of the Falun Gong meditation practice, which was outlawed by China's ruling Communist Party in 1999.""If they start to censor beauty pageants — how pathetic is that?"" Lin told The Associated Press in Hong Kong.I'm in Hong Kong, but the Chinese government has barred me from getting the next flight to Sanya for Miss World. <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/AfraidOfABeautyQueen?src=hash"">#AfraidOfABeautyQueen</a>In a pre-departure statement, Lin said denying her entry would mean China was trying to prevent her from speaking out about human rights issues.Dressed in black leggings and a belted tan trench coat, Lin was approached by several fellow travellers in the Hong Kong airport arrival hall who wanted to take her photo.Lin, who moved to Canada from China when she was 13, told a U.S. congressional hearing in July that tens of thousands of Falun Gong practitioners have been killed so their organs could be harvested and sold for transplants. The 25-year-old also plays an imprisoned Falun Gong practitioner in an upcoming Canadian movie, The Bleeding Edge.Lin said that after she won the Canadian title, Chinese security agents visited her father who still lives in China in an apparent attempt to intimidate her into silence. Although she hadn't received an invitation letter from organizers, and therefore was unable to obtain a Chinese visa, she said she decided to travel to China anyway in hopes of obtaining a visa on arrival.""The Chinese government has barred me from the competition for political reasons. They are trying to punish me for my beliefs and prevent me from speaking out about human rights issues,"" Lin said in her prepared statement.After landing in Hong Kong early Thursday on a flight from Toronto, Lin was told by airline staff at check-in that she needed to speak to an official in Hainan's provincial capital of Sanya. She said the official, who identified himself only by his surname, Chen, seemed to be attempting to verify her identify. After telling her she wasn't eligible for a visa, the man refused to give a reason then abruptly hung up the phone, she said.""To prevent me from even stepping into Chinese territory, I think this is what they're trying to do. I really don't see where this insecurity comes from,"" Lin told The Associated Press. ""I think that's the real harm when people watch this and learn a negative lesson. I hope people see courage and hope in the story, not simply just being denied."""

Scientific evidence of mythical great flood found in China | CBC News,"Legend says that China's first dynasty, the Xia, began after the sage King Yu tamed the waters of a massive flood that swept away villages and overran mountains. Now, for the first time, scientists have found archeological evidence that the flood may actually have happened.",2016-08-05T14:40:15.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/china-ancient-flood-1.3708724,"A great flood at the dawn of Chinese civilization was said to have swept away settlements, the water rising so high that it overran hills, mountains and even heaven itself. It was the sage King Yu who tamed the waters by building ditches, the legend went, thus earning a mandate to rule and laying the foundation for China's first dynasty, the Xia.But until now, scientists could not pin down evidence that the flood, or Yu, or even the Xia Dynasty ever existed outside of the origin myths passed down through millennia.Now a team of researchers led by Wu Qianlong, a former Peking University seismologist, say in a study published this week in the journal Science that they've indeed found evidence that a flood submerged a vast swath of the country almost 4,000 years ago, possibly lending weight to a longstanding — though controversial — theory that the Xia Dynasty did exist as China's first unified state.""No scientific evidence has been discovered before"" for the legendary flood, Wu told a telephone news conference.Using radiocarbon dating of bones and soil samples along the Yellow River, Wu's team established that an earthquake triggered a huge landslide, damming the waterway in 1920 B.C.The researchers pinpointed the date chemically from the skeletons of children in a group of 14 victims found crushed downstream, apparently when their home collapsed in the earthquake.The researchers deduced that for six to nine months about 15 trillion litres (4 trillion gallons) of water built up behind a wall of rock and dirt — about half the size of Lake Mead behind Hoover Dam — near Jishi Gorge in today's Qinghai Province. When the dam broke, it tore through the gorge at 500 times the Yellow River's average discharge and submerged the North China Plain that is considered the cradle of Chinese civilization.The flood on Asia's third-longest river would have been among the worst anywhere in the world in the last 10,000 years and matches tales of a ""Great Flood"" that marks the start of Chinese civilisation with the Xia dynasty.The flood would have predated by several centuries the first written records kept on oracle bones. Historical texts from about 1,000 B.C. first mentioned a legendary Xia ruler, Yu, who had devised a system of dredges to control a great flood that spanned generations. He was said to have been based around Jishi Gorge, according to various texts, and his ability to combat natural disasters and earn a heavenly mandate to rule established him as a model for generations of subsequent Chinese rulers.His legend was later immortalized in some of the best-known historical texts of Chinese antiquity, including the Bamboo Annals of 300 B.C., and the Records of the Grand Historian by the Han Dynasty court official Sima Qian in 94 B.C. But the legend has been hotly debated in modern times.Over the past century, China scholars have doubted whether the Xia truly existed, or whether it was truly an expansive, unified state rather than simply many smaller states that were mish-mashed together by ancient Chinese political thinkers to justify a tradition of centralized power.The evidence of a massive flood in line with the legend ""provides us with a tantalizing hint that the Xia dynasty might really have existed,"" said David Cohen of National Taiwan University, one of the authors.In the 1980s, archaeologists discovered buildings and bronze remains at Erlitou village in Henan Province that were carbon dated to about 1900 B.C. Many scholars believe the settlement, which may have had a population of 30,000, was likely the ancient Xia capital."

The United States has said it is willing to negotiate with the North if the country commits to get rid of its nuclear weapons, which Pyongyang has refused to do.The U.S. Department of Justice is preparing as early as this week to announce legal action against Chinese firms suspected of providing financial assistance to Pyongyang, the Journal reported, citing officials familiar with the matter.The report said DoJ prosecutors visited Beijing twice last month to make their Chinese counterparts aware of alleged criminal activities being committed by Hongxiang Industrial. It said police in Liaoning, the northeastern border province of China, had started a probe into the firm's alleged long-term involvement in ""serious economic crimes.""Certain assets related to the company, its founder and top executive Ma Xiaohong, and some of her relatives and associates, have been frozen by the Chinese authorities in recent weeks, according to the government and corporate filings cited in the report.Representatives of the U.S. Department of Justice, Chinese Government and Hongxiang Industrial were unavailable for immediate comment. The White House said Obama and Li also discussed in New York the U.S.-China economic relationship and its importance to the global economy.""The President encouraged China to accelerate its continuing efforts to address industrial excess capacity, foster an environment conducive to innovation, and advance an orderly transition to a market-determined exchange rate,"" the statement said.It said Obama also urged Beijing to establish a level playing field for all firms to compete fairly in China and that he and Li discussed the importance of achieving progress in negotiation of a U.S.-China Bilateral Investment Treaty and of a World Trade Organization Environmental Goods Agreement.The statement added that the two leaders discussed climate issues and pledged to continue working toward bringing the Paris agreement into force as early as possible and to reach a market-based measure to reduce international aviation emissions."

China not expected to budge on high-tech exports in trade talks with U.S. | CBC News,U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross arrived in Beijing on Saturday for talks on China's promise to buy more American goods after Washington revived tensions by renewing its threat of tariff hikes on Chinese high-tech exports.,2018-06-02T14:39:45.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/china-us-trade-talks-beijing-commerce-secretary-wilbur-ross-1.4689202,"U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross arrived in Beijing on Saturday for talks on China's promise to buy more American goods after Washington revived tensions by renewing its threat of tariff hikes on Chinese high-tech exports.The talks focus on adding details to China's May 19 promise to narrow its politically volatile surplus in trade in goods with the United States, which reached a record $375.2 billion US last year.U.S. President Donald Trump threw the status of the talks into doubt this week by renewing a threat to hike tariffs on $50 billion of Chinese goods over complaints Beijing steals or pressures foreign companies to hand over technology.Private sector analysts say that while Beijing is willing to compromise on its trade surplus, it will resist changes that might threaten plans to transform China into a global technology competitor.The two governments released no schedule for the talks, but China said earlier that Ross was due to be in Beijing through Monday.Reporters saw Ross outside his hotel at midday Saturday but he didn't respond to their questions before he got in a car and was driven away. Ross was to have a dinner meeting Saturday evening with Vice Premier Liu He at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse in Beijing.Ross was scheduled to meet with Liu again on Sunday.China has promised to ""significantly increase"" purchases of farm goods, energy and other products and services. Still, Beijing resisted pressure to commit to a specific target of narrowing its annual surplus with the United States by $200 billion US.Following Beijing's announcement, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the dispute was ""on hold."" But the truce appeared to end with this week's announcement Washington was going ahead with tariff hikes on technology goods and also would impose curbs on Chinese investment and purchases of U.S. high-tech exports.The move reflects growing American concern about China's status as a potential tech competitor and complaints Beijing improperly subsidizes its fledgling industries and shields them from competition.Foreign governments and businesses cite strategic plans such as ""Made in China 2025,"" which calls for state-led efforts to create Chinese industry leaders in areas from robots to electric cars to computer chips.""The U.S. focus on so-called industrially significant technologies heightens the risk of escalation between the two countries,"" BMI Research said in a report. ""Indeed, while China has shown itself willing to compromise in the area of trade deficit reduction, it will not take any actions which threaten its strategically important 'Made in China 2025' program.""Trump also has threatened to raise tariffs on an additional $100 billion of Chinese goods, but gave no indication this week whether that would go ahead.Earlier, China responded with a threat to retaliate with higher duties on a $50 billion list of American goods including soybeans, small aircraft, whiskey, electric vehicles and orange juice. It criticized Trump's move this week and said it reserved the right to retaliate but avoided repeating its earlier threat.Trade analysts warned Ross's hand might be weakened by the Trump administration's decision Thursday to go ahead with tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from Canada, Europe and Mexico.That might alienate allies who share complaints about Chinese technology policy and a flood of low-priced steel, aluminum and other exports they say are the result of improper subsidies and hurt foreign competitors."

He repeated his argument Tuesday that Ottawa's connection to China was ""hot and cold"" when the Conservatives were in power.With Canada struggling through an extended period of weak growth, the government sees expanding the relationship with China — the world's second-largest economy — as a key to helping the economy.But getting tighter with China poses challenges at home. Trudeau has had to address widespread concerns about the Chinese regime's handling of human rights.On Tuesday, his interviewer asked him how he balances the two.She noted, for example, that public opinion polls have suggested Canadians are cool to the idea of pursuing free trade with the Asian superpower.""I don't know if I like the word balance because balance does make it sound like you're making a trade-off,"" Trudeau replied.""I don't think you have to choose, I think you have to be very up front and frank about doing that in a very thoughtful, respectful way, but in a constructive way.""Politics NewsHis appearance Tuesday in Hong Kong followed a landmark election result in the southern Chinese city over the weekend that saw a group of young pro-democracy activists win seats in the local legislature.The activists, who helped lead huge pro-democracy street protests two years ago, intend to change the rules on how the city is governed by China's leaders. It could set off a fresh showdown with Beijing.Asked how Canada might engage with China on behalf of Hong Kong, Trudeau was cautious.""I'm going to use a line that I've been able to use a few times regarding our neighbours to the south: Canada will work with whoever gets elected and forms government in foreign jurisdictions,"" he said.Trudeau says Canada will work with whoever is elected in foreign government (crowd laughs as he makes Trump joke).Andrew Work, editor-in-chief of Hong Kong's Harbour Times, said it is ""hugely important"" that Trudeau was in the city shortly after the election to see its vibrant democracy first hand.""Canada is an influential nation with 300,000 Canadians living in Hong Kong,"" said Work, a Canadian who has lived in the Chinese city for 20 years.When it comes to working with China, this week Trudeau left the door open to allowing more investment from the country's state-owned enterprises.On Monday, he said he would listen if China raises its long-held concerns with him over Canada's restrictions on investment by foreign, state-owned enterprises. He elaborated on the topic Tuesday.""We need to draw in global investment as a way of being able to properly develop our resources in ways that are going to create a lot of jobs in Canada,"" Trudeau said during the on-stage exchange with Bloomberg TV anchor Angie Lau.""Yes, we have to think about it in terms of what are the benefits, what are the labour standards, what are the environmental impacts?. But I don't think that anyone can imagine that we would do better by closing ourselves off from the world.""Earlier Tuesday, Trudeau visited the mountainside Sai Wan War Cemetery to pay homage to Canadian soldiers who died after fighting to defend Hong Kong from a Japanese invasion during the Second World War.There are 283 Canadians buried at the cemetery, 107 of whom were never identified.Trudeau also met with billionaire businessman Li Ka-shing, chairman of CK Hutchison Holdings, to discuss investment opportunities at his cavernous office on the 70th floor of a Hong Kong tower.The prime minister also held a meeting with Leung Chun-ying, chief executive of Hong Kong, at his residence.Politics News"

And in 2007, they moved to Dandong, a city near the North Korean border where they ran a popular coffee shop. ""We would get people from embassies who were in North Korea. [They] would stop by because we were so close,"" Kevin Garrett tells The Current's Anna Maria Tremonti, whose visitors included Canadian foreign minister John Baird.That all changed on Aug. 14, 2014.Julia and Garrett were invited through a friend to meet a couple who wanted to talk about their daughter coming to the University of Toronto to study. What they didn't know at the time was that the dinner was a set up.""We got to the restaurant, the couple met us and the daughter wasn't there.

Canadian denied entry to China to visit jailed father fears she'll never see him again | CBC Radio,"It took Montreal's Ti-Anna Wang 10 years to secure a visa to China to visit her ailing father in jail, Chinese dissident Wang Bingzhang.",2019-01-09T22:18:24.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/radio/asithappens/as-it-happens-the-wednesday-edition-1.4971399/canadian-denied-entry-to-china-to-visit-jailed-father-fears-she-ll-never-see-him-again-1.4971426,"Read story transcriptA Canadian woman hoping to see her father for the first time in a decade was turned away at the Chinese border Wednesday amid heightened diplomatic tensions between the two countries. It took Montreal's Ti-Anna Wang 10 years to secure a visa to China to visit her ailing father in prison, but when she arrived at the Hangzhou airport on Wednesday, she was immediately detained and put on a flight to South Korea. ""They didn't give us any reason at all. They just told us they were following orders from the minister of state security,"" Wang told As It Happens host Carol Off.""This is more agonizing than not giving me the visa at all. It just feels extremely insulting and almost purposeful.""Wang's father is Wang Bingzhang, a pro-democracy activist who got his doctorate at McGill University in the 1980s.He was abducted by Chinese agents during a trip to Vietnam in 2002 and sentenced to life in prison on espionage and terrorism charges.She last saw him in 2008. When she tried to visit him the following year on a visa, she was denied entry to the country, and has been fighting to get back to him ever since. Then last year, she finally broke through the red tape, securing a visa on compassionate grounds.But that was before the arrest of a Chinese telecommunications executive in Vancouver on Dec. 1 sent Canadian-Chinese relations spiralling.Meng Wanzhou, the CFO of Huawei, was arrested last month at the request of the United States, which wants her extradited to face fraud charges.China has since detained two Canadians, Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, accusing them of endangering China's national security, in a move widely seen as retribution for Meng.""It must be a factor in the decision making,"" Wang said of the diplomatic tensions. ""But at the same time, this exact situation happened to me in 2009.""Global Affairs Canada says it is providing consular assistance to Wang, but noted in an emailed statement that ""every country or territory decides who can enter or exit through its borders.""""Our former parliamentary secretary has met with Wang Bingzhang's family to discuss his case, and we remain in contact with the family,"" spokesperson Guillaume Berube said. Wang said she spent the past few months arranging the trip, hoping to introduce her father to his 11-month-old granddaughter.""This was supposed to be the first time that I see my father after 10 years,"" she said.""I had imagined a very profound moment where I could be in a room with my father and my brother and my daughter.""And he was expecting her, she said.Wang wrote him a letter about her plans, she said, and her half sister told him about the visa during a visit in December. ""The whole point was to lift his spirits, and I feel like this will just crush him,"" Wang said.""Another part of me just feels really terrible about all this because my father doesn't get visits very often. He only sees family members once or twice a year, and I can only assume that he was looking forward to this as much as I was.""Wang said she worries this was her last chance to see her father.The 71-year-old has served most of his sentence in solitary confinement, where she says he has suffered several strokes, asthma attacks and declining mental health.""The first thought that I had when they told me that I wasn't going to be able to go was I just wondered if I would ever see my father again,"" she said.""I have to believe that I will.""Written by Sheena Goodyear.

"Global trade reform must include China, U.S., Jim Carr says after hosting WTO meeting | CBC News","Trade Diversification Minister Jim Carr said today that any efforts to reform the global rules-based trading order must include the world's two largest economies, China and the United States.",2018-10-25T08:00:18.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/thursday-wto-reform-talks-1.4876539,"Trade Diversification Minister Jim Carr said today that any efforts to reform the global rules-based trading order must include the world's two largest economies, China and the United States.Carr made the comments after a day of meetings in Ottawa with representatives from 13 World Trade Organization members who came to Ottawa to start work on fixing the increasingly troubled global trading system.""We are setting the framework for a more constructive momentum around real measures for reform,"" Carr said at the closing press conference. ""Starting small has allowed us to address problems head-on and quickly develop proposals.""That said, we recognize that we are in the process of setting the table for a larger effort, broadening to all members, and that effort must include the United States and China.""Carr also said the work would have to expand eventually to include all 164 members who currently subscribe to WTO rules.Only 12 other WTO members joined Canada for this first gathering: Australia, Brazil, Chile, the European Union, Japan, Kenya, Mexico, New Zealand, Norway, Singapore, South Korea and Switzerland.The group was intentionally diverse, with representatives from different geographic regions and from states at different stages of economic development and integration.Nevertheless, they all ""share the value and belief that the rules-based international order is worth preserving, and the best way to preserve it is to reform it,"" Carr said earlier in the day.Roberto Azevêdo, director-general of the WTO, said that the idea behind the meeting was to start small and find common ground that could be sold to the wider membership.""I think what this group wanted to do was have a conversation among what you could describe a little bit as 'like minded people,'"" he told CBC News Network's Power & Politics. ""So, an open-minded conversation about where to go, what steps to take.""Power and PoliticsAfter the meeting, a joint communiqué was issued outlining three areas that require ""urgent consideration.""Azevêdo said his number one priority was to resolve issues around the dispute settlement system.""This is a critical element of the system because, at the end of the day, we all negotiate rules and we need some degree of enforcement,"" he told host Vassy Kapelos. ""If there are doubts about interpretation of the rules, there needs to be a third party that will look at it and say and say, 'This is how you should interpret.'""If we don't have that element, it is going to hurt that system significantly and we are stuck at this point in time on this one.""CBC NewsCarr hosted the group for a private dinner Wednesday and joked Thursday morning that some participants might have gone short on sleep. In the morning session, Carr said he was ""very impressed with the candour and the sense of the importance of the discussion.""Delegates shared their feelings on the status quo and the impetus for reform with a lot of passion, he said, while declining to describe any of the specific views shared in the closed session. While beefs about the WTO have been around almost since its formation in 1995, the global disruption caused by an escalating tariff war between the U.S. and China has focused minds on the inadequacy of current rules for present-day threats to fair trading.The U.S. worked hard to build the WTO, but it's no longer clear it wants to maintain it. When U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to pull out altogether, it became obvious the status quo could not stand.Carr was careful in his opening remarks not to pin too much blame on the Americans, whose blessing will be needed for any reform process to succeed.""The problems facing the multilateral trading system were not created by any one WTO member. They are not new and they cannot be solved by any one member,"" he said.Organizers of the Ottawa talks thought it could be more constructive to hash out early reform proposals through a fellowship of ""like-minded"" trading partners who weren't currently in active economic combat.Senior American officials are skeptical of the value of the multilateral rules-based trading system and are pursuing ""America first"" policies that allow the U.S. to use its economic clout as leverage in negotiations. The WTO, by contrast, was designed to address the concerns of smaller economies and less-developed countries.In particular, the U.S. objects to China's status in the WTO. It argues that it shouldn't be treated like a market economy, since the state effectively controls its industries. American officials want any WTO reform process to focus on clamping down on China's unfair trade practices — but it's not clear that was the main focus of the Ottawa talks.Business associations from Canada, Europe, Japan, Brazil, Australia, New Zealand and Mexico issued a joint statement Wednesday saying the WTO is ""badly in need of an update to reflect the realities of a changing global economy,"" and urging members ""to work together to enhance its functionality, transparency and fairness.""""The WTO plays an essential role in helping to adjudicate and resolve trade disputes. Unfortunately, the dispute settlement system has become overburdened and must be fixed if the WTO is to live up to its potential,"" it said.Several initiatives are underway to change the WTO. The Americans have engaged the EU and Japan in one process that appears to be focused on rewriting rules that allow China to hold an unfair advantage. Anything hashed out by this group must complement the work others are doing, Carr said.""The fact that there are a number of parallel initiatives illustrates the importance trading nations place on the rules-based system,"" he said in his opening speech.""If you had a meeting of 163 of your closest friends could you agree on much? And how long would it take?"" Carr told reporters. ""It's not easy.""This group plans to meet again in January 2019 to review their progress.Watch the Power Panel debate the effectiveness of the WTO and what reform would look like belowPower and Politics"
China's Gobi Desert source of rare dinosaur find | CBC News,"Left on their own by adults, a group of young dinosaurs sank into the mud beside a lake and died 90 million years ago in what would become the Gobi Desert, scientists said Monday.",2009-03-16T12:43:52.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/china-s-gobi-desert-source-of-rare-dinosaur-find-1.818867,"Left on their own by adults, a group of young dinosaurs sank into the mud beside a lake and died 90 million years ago in what would become the Gobi Desert, scientists said Monday.The well-preserved fossils, excavated by a team of Chinese and American scientists, offer a rare bounty of clues about how this herd of ostrich-like sinornithomimus lived — and died.Two life-sized models of the sinornithomimus were put on public display for the first time Monday in Hohhot, capital of north China's Inner Mongolia region.""This is a very exciting discovery, because 99.9 per cent of the time, we find a group of skeletons that died at different periods due to unknown causes,"" said Paul Sereno, a University of Chicago professor on the excavation team. ""The other 0.1 per cent of the time, scientists consider themselves lucky to find small herds that have been well-preserved after floods or volcanic eruptions, similar to that of Pompeii.""Italy's famous city of Pompeii was buried — its way of life frozen in time — in the volcanic eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD.Sereno, a paleontologist, helped lead the 2001 expedition that uncovered the fossilized remains of the 25 young sinornithomimus near Suhongtu, a tiny, remote village in the Gobi Desert about 600 kilometres west of Hohhot.The position of the dinosaur bones suggests they were looking for water on the edge of a lake, got stuck and died as the mud engulfed them, Sereno said in a telephone interview. Their hip bones were found at odd angles, indicating scavengers tugged at their carcasses. Crablike organisms were also found surrounding the skeletons, a clue that tells scientists they were covered in water shortly after death, which helped preserve them.Tan Xinwei, a paleontologist from the Inner Mongolia Department of Land and Resources who also worked on the expedition, said the findings tell researchers that ""the youngsters were left to fend for themselves while the adults were preoccupied"" with hatching eggs or building nests.The two-legged, feathered dinosaurs reached about 1.2 metres tall as adults and scavenged for small plants by jutting out their long necks in an ostrich-like fashion, Sereno said.Xu Xing, a professor at the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology in Beijing, called the findings ""an important discovery"" that could only have happened under a unique set of circumstances.""Without the correct environmental conditions, these fossils would not have been found in nearly pristine condition — uncrushed or worn down,"" said Xu, who was not involved with the project.The bones were spotted in 1978 by a Chinese geologist and first excavated by a Sino-Japanese team some 20 years later. That team named the dinosaurs sinornithomimus, or ""Chinese bird mimic.""It wasn't until 2001 that researchers were able to unearth all 25 skeletons and examine their findings.The sinornithomimus skeletons were brought to the University of Chicago for research and preservation but will return to China by the end of the year.The 10-member expedition and research team included scientists from the University of Chicago, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Montana State University, the University of Michigan and Inner Mongolia's Department of Land and Resources. It was financed by the National Geographic Society."
Talk about long distance learning: MSVU to offer classes in China | CBC News,Mount Saint Vincent University will offer a joint tourism degree with a college in China.,2016-05-04T10:30:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/mount-saint-vincent-university-joint-degree-china-1.3565107,"Mount Saint Vincent University has inked a deal with a Chinese college to offer a joint degree that will see Chinese students traveling to Nova Scotia, and Mount professors teaching in China. The four-year tourism degree program will be run out of Jinshan College in China for three years. Then in the fourth year, students will finish their training at MSVU. ""While we're doing those three years in China, a significant number of courses have to be taught by Canadian faculty,"" said Michael Whalen, a business, tourism, and hospitality management professor at Mount Saint Vincent. Whalen helped setup the joint degree program. ""At full operation we'll actually teach in China each year 17 courses. We're looking at a considerable investment in time, faculty and resources to do this.""     Those courses will be taught online by Mount Saint Vincent professors for eight weeks. Those professors will then be expected to go to China and teach classes in person for a minimum of two weeks. ""Part of their interest in this is having their students in front of a 'real Canadian professor',"" said Whalen. ""Learning how to learn in a Canadian classroom and a western classroom, listening to the language, being able to practice their own English, asking questions — these kinds of things.""    The Mount has permission from the Chinese government to recruit 100 students per year into the program which launches in September. Whalen said the university hopes the new joint degree will strengthen its overall tourism program and attract new students. ""We see this as a way of working in part to replace those Canadian students that aren't going to be there because of the demographic issues in Atlantic Canada and the fewer number of students graduating from our high schools.""     In the long term, the program could also help bolster tourism to the province as Chinese students arrive to study in Nova Scotia, said Whalen.  ""This is going to be a tremendous asset for us. These people will hopefully have been impressed by their stay here, by the quality of the tourism infrastructure that we have in the province and they'll be the ones running programs, running companies in China and think, 'oh yeah, why don't we send a plane load of tourists to Nova Scotia'.""      ""I think there are huge spin offs here,"" said Whalen. "

The Unceasing Storm: Memories of the Chinese Cultural Revolution has now been translated into English, thanks to Luo's stepdaughter, the writer Madeleine Thien. In 2016, Thien won the Governor General's Literary Award for fiction and the Scotiabank Giller Prize for her novel, Do Not Say We Have Nothing.""Katherine is, or was, the partner of my father, who passed away in December 2017. It's been quite emotional working with her through the final process of putting the book into the world. The Cultural Revolution was the culmination of politically strict campaigns that targeted different classes of society in China. In The Unceasing Storm, Katherine describes what happened to her during these years, first as a university student, then as a singer and performer in the Central Academy of Drama and the Red Army Opera Troupe. As the political repression intensified in force, Katherine and many of her colleagues were also sent to re-education camps. She tells the story of China in the 1980s — how what she hoped for her country was dashed during the 1989 Tiananmen demonstrations and the massacre outside of Tiananmen Square.""""Katherine and I spent a long time talking about the beliefs she held as a young woman and the pain of having to reassess everything she had believed in. She recounts what happened when ideology took over this very idealistic generation — a generation of young people who were really committed to sacrificing whatever it took to create a more just society. My feeling is that she wrote The Unceasing Storm because she understood that she was growing older and that this generation was passing. What they had seen and heard, what they had tried to create — was being lost to the rewriting of history that is so present in 20th-century China.""Madeleine Thien's comments have been edited and condensed.  "

Your recycling could become trash: The 'golden age' of recycling is coming to an endIn July, China — the world's biggest importer of recycled materials — notified the World Trade Organization that it would stop accepting shipments of waste plastic, paper and other materials by Jan. 1, 2018 due to environmental concerns.Reached on Saturday, Breen said the change shouldn't have much of an effect on the amount of recycling going to China each year from St. John's. He said that's because the city has never collected materials included in the ban like plastic shopping bags and glass through curbside recycling.And that means that workers at the materials recycling facility at Robin Hood Bay in St. John's won't have to alter their process.""We have less contamination and we have a higher quality of recycling materials, so we don't anticipate this change by China will have an impact,"" he said. After recycling gets sorted at Robin Hood Bay, it gets put on the market, and most of it ends up in China, said Breen. He doesn't anticipate an impact in the near future when it comes to selling this material, but does think there may be more competition once other cities update their recycling facilities to meet China's new standards.""It may be that China's not buying as much materials, and then there'd be more competition on the market to have those materials taken by China.""But for now at least, Breen isn't worried that China will stop collecting recyclables and the city will be forced to find a new home for the materials.""Not at this point, but it's certainly it's something we'll be keeping an eye on,"" he said. "

Officials say they are trying to stave off foreign competitors, especially Japanese cartoon makers.Government authorities have spent the past few years tightening their grip on the film and television industries.State-controlled television stations generally do not pick up Western shows. Last year, the government banned reality shows from prime time and urged broadcasters to show only ""ethically inspiring"" series.Restrictions have been placed on TV talent shows as well as anything that touches upon horror, crime and the supernatural in film.New rules have also been issued against overtly sexual content while material over the internet has been heavily censored."
China-backed infrastructure bank pitched as World Bank alternative | CBC News,"China has launched its Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank with the support of 50 nations, in a bid to increase its international financial clout.",2015-06-29T17:03:56.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/asian-infrastructure-investment-bank-part-of-china-s-bid-for-global-clout-1.3132028,"China has launched its Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank with the support of 50 nations, in a bid to increase its international financial clout.China, India and Russia are the biggest shareholders in bank, which begins life with $50 billion US in capital to invest. It is projected to grow to $100 billion.Japan and the U.S., which wield much of the power in the World Bank and Asian Development Bank, opted not to invest. Canada also demurred.The U.S. government had objected that the bank would undercut existing institutions such as the World Bank and might allow looser lending standards.But much of the West and Southeast Asia ignored U.S. objections and is on board, including Australia, Britain, Germany and South Korea.Representatives of 50 countries took part in a signing ceremony for the AIIB in Beijing on Monday, while an additional seven nations, such as the Philippines and Thailand, attended as they are still negotiating on the issue.China, which believes its weight on the international stage does not match its economic importance, hopes the new bank will grow to the stature of the Asian Development Bank and World Bank.The plan is that money from the AIIB will be loaned to build ports, roads and cities throughout Asia, and that China's engineering firms will bid on the work, expanding their global expertise.Lou Jiwei, China's minister of finance, called the launch of the AIIB a ""win-win for Asia"" at the bank's signing ceremony, saying he thought the bank would start operating toward the end of the year.China has the largest voting share on the bank's board — 20.06 per cent – giving it potential veto power on projects.India will be the second-biggest shareholder with a possible 10-15 per cent stake, while Russia and Germany are the third and fourth biggest member states.The AIIB will be a test of China's ability to run a multilateral organizationUntil now, China has tried to build its sphere of influence by throwing money around, as in Africa, or using threats, as in Southeast Asia.But running  a transparent, socially conscious development bank that promises to meet the shortfall in Asian infrastructure funding will take a more subtle approach.China will have to work with many other institutions and levels of government and create approvals processes that aren't hampered by bureaucracy.Jin Liqun, a former Chinese deputy finance minister, is to lead the bank until a CEO is formally appointed."

"China harvesting Falun Gong organs, report alleges | CBC News","China is harvesting organs from live Falun Gong prisoners without their consent, according to a report released Thursday by a former Liberal MP and a Canadian human rights lawyer.",2006-07-06T17:01:15.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/china-harvesting-falun-gong-organs-report-alleges-1.603530,"China is harvesting organs from live Falun Gong prisoners without consent and destroying their remains, says a report from a former Liberal MP and a Canadian human rights lawyer.The 68-page document, produced by former MP David Kilgour and Winnipeg lawyer David Matas, is based partly on a series of telephone recordings made by the Coalition to Investigate the Persecution of the Falun Gong in China (CIPFG). The non-governmental group has offices in Washington and Ottawa.It also includes interviews with Falun Gong practitioners living in Canada and information taken from Chinese hospital and transplant centre websites.Followers of Falun Gong say it is a spiritual movement to improve physical and mental health, while the Chinese government considers it a cult, banning it in 1999.For years, Falun Gong followers have alleged that the Chinese government harvests and sells the organs of imprisoned Falun Gong members in an increasingly profitable organ trade.That's acharge China denies.Of the 60,000 organ transplants the China Medical Organ Transplant Association recorded between 2000 and 2005, 18,500 of those organs came from identifiable sources, said the report.""That leaves 41,500 transplants from no other explained sources,"" Matas said during a news conference Thursday in Ottawa.Phone recordings, organ price listsMatas and Kilgour said they, along with an independent translator, listened to telephone recordings made by the CIPFG to Chinese hospitals, prisons and transplant centres. In the phone calls, transcripts of which are provided in the report, organs from alleged Falun Gong prisoners are promised to prospective buyers within as little as a week.The report quotes an organ price list on a website for a transplant centre in Shenyang City, which offers corneas for $30,000 US, kidneys for $62,000 US, livers for $130,000 US and lungs for up to $170,000 US.According to figures from Chinese government departments, the number of liver transplant centres in China jumped from 22 in 1999 to 500 in 2006, while the number of liver transplant operations increased from 135 to 4,000 during that same period.Kilgour pointed to an interview with the ex-wife of a Chinese surgeon who allegedly removed the corneas from 2,000 euthanized Falun Gong prisoners over a two-year period. All died and their bodies were burned, said the woman, who was not identified.""There's enough evidence here to take these allegations seriously,"" said Matas. ""It's a crime against humanity. It's very simple.""The report calls on China, which it says has no organized system of organ donation, to record the sources of all organs used in transplants and says Canada should not permit Chinese doctors to do organ transplant training in Canada.China admitted in 2005 thatit harvests and sells the organs of executed prisoners, but says the practice happens with the consent of prisoners or family members.Kilgour said Thursday that China tortures prisoners to get their consent.The issue made headlines in April when a Falun Gong activist disrupted a White House ceremony for visiting Chinese President Hu Jinta.Following her arrest, Wang Wenyi said she was protesting China's alleged organ harvesting from Falun Gong members. Charges against her were later dropped.Earlier this year, the British Transplantation Society issued a news release alleging China used organs from executed prisoners without their consent.The society wrote:""An accumulating body of evidence suggests that the organs of executed prisoners are being removed for transplantation without the prior consent of either the prisoner or their family."""

5 key facts about the family planning law China is repealing | CBC News,"China's ruling Communist Party has announced all couples will be allowed to have two children, ending a decades-old, unpopular policy that risked becoming a demographic burden. Here's five things to know about the rule overhaul.",2015-10-29T16:54:07.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/5-things-to-know-about-china-s-1-child-policy-1.3294335,"China's ruling Communist Party announced Thursday that all couples will be allowed to have two children, ending the country's decades-old, unpopular one-child policy that has risked becoming a demographic burden as the population ages.The one-child policy had been watered down several times since it was introduced in 1979, to the extent that most couples already qualified to have two kids.Thursday's announcement officially removed all remaining restrictions limiting couples to only one child and signalled the country's desire to address the imbalanced sex ratio that has resulted from a traditional preference for boys.Here are five things to know about the world's most ambitious population-control policy:China, which has the world's largest population at 1.4 billion people, introduced the policy in 1979 as a temporary measure to curb a then-surging population and limit the demands for water and other resources. It applied only to couples of the country's ethnic Han majority. Ethnic minorities were allowed more than one child, and five years after the policy was enacted, rural couples were allowed two children if their firstborn was a girl.China's government has used a variety of incentives, coercions and punishments to enforce the policy. Even before the one-child regulations were introduced, the country tried to force couples to delay getting married until at least age 25 for women and 27 or 28 for men in cities, and 23 for women and 25 for men in the countryside.Then, those who had only one child would receive ""one-child certificates"" entitling them to better child care, better housing, longer maternity leave and other benefits. Punitive measures were introduced for urban couples who flouted the policy. Their salaries were reduced by 15 per cent until the child reached age seven. In rural areas, couples who had too many children but couldn't afford to pay the fines reported that corrupt government officials would seize their furniture, motorcycles or other property.China also hired more than one million part-time and full-time workers to ensure women used birth control and to encourage and harass them — some research suggests even force them — to get abortions, or to get sterilized, if they became pregnant with a subsequent child. Another technique was to deny anesthetic to women giving birth, to increase their aversion to getting pregnant again.Woman must choose between 2nd child, husband's jobOver the years, the one-child policy has been eased. The major revisions came in 1984, when rural couples were allowed to have a second child, and in 2013, when any couple was allowed to have two kids if at least one of the parents was themself an only child.In 1979, when the one-child policy was introduced, China's population was just under one billion. The following year, the government projected the population would reach 1.2 billion by 2000, at which point the country would achieve its target of zero population growth. In actuality, China hit that number of people seven years too early, and its population now stands at a little shy of 1.4 billion and growing. However, the government estimates the one-child policy has prevented 400 million births and has helped lift countless families out of poverty by easing the strain on the country's limited resources. Many demographers counter that the birthrate would have fallen anyway as China's economy developed and education levels rose.Because of a traditional preference for baby boys over girls, the one-child policy is often cited as the cause of China's skewed sex ratio; the country has between 32 million and 36 million more men than would be expected naturally. Even the government acknowledges the problem and has expressed concern about the tens of millions of young men who won't be able to find brides and may turn to kidnapping women, sex trafficking, other forms of crime or social unrest.  Multiple research studies have also found that sex-selective abortion — where a woman undergoes an ultrasound to determine the sex of her baby, and then aborts it if it's a girl — was widespread for years, particularly for second or subsequent children. Millions of female fetuses have been aborted since the 1970s. China outlawed sex selective abortions in 2005, but the law is tough to enforce because of the difficulty of proving why a couple decided to have an abortion.The abandonment, and killing, of baby girls has also been reported, though recent research studies say it has become rare, in part due to strict criminal prohibitions.  A communiqué from the Communist Party's Central Committee carried on China's official Xinhua News Agency said that the decision to allow all couples to have two children was ""to improve the balanced development of population"" — an apparent reference to the country's female-to-male sex ratio — and to deal with an aging population. United Nations projections forecast that, based on its citizens living longer and having fewer children, China will lose 67 million working-age people by 2030, while simultaneously doubling the number of elderly. That could put immense pressure on the economy and government resources.  Repealing the one-child policy may not spur a huge baby boom, however, in part because fertility rates are believed to be declining even without the policy's enforcement. Previous easings of the one-child policy have spurred fewer births than expected, and many people among China's younger generations see smaller family sizes as ideal.1953: Chinese leaders suggest that the population should be controlled and approve a law on contraception and abortion, but the plan is stranded by political upheaval and the 1959-1961 famine. 1970: Chinese population exceeds 800 million. The State Council, China's cabinet, mandates sharp reductions in population growth rates throughout the 1970s.  1975: China adopts the slogan ""Later, Longer and Fewer"" and urges urban couples to have no more than two children and rural couples no more than three. 1979: The Communist Party introduces the one-child policy limiting couples of the Han ethnic majority to one child as a temporary measure to curb a surging population.   1984: An adjustment of the policy allows a second child for many families in rural areas. 2001: China decrees new laws to better administer the policy, including allowing local governments to impose fines for additional children. 2006: Some provinces begin easing restrictions to allow couples who are both only children to have two children. 2013: An exemption allows two children in families in which only one parent is an only child. 2015: China's Communist Party says all couples will be allowed to have two children, but doesn't give a timeframe."

Lou faces ban in China over 'Summer Palace' | CBC News,The director of the only Chinese film in competition at the Cannes Film Festival could be barred from film-making in China for showing the work.,2006-05-21T16:58:40.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/lou-faces-ban-in-china-over-summer-palace-1.585541,"The director of the only Chinese film in competition at the Cannes Film Festival could be barred from film-making in China for showing the work.Lou Ye violated the country's distribution rules by submitting his film Summer Palace for screening before it had been cleared by state censors, Chinese authorities say.The State Administration of Radio, Film and Television rejected Summer Palace last Tuesday, long after the film had been officially entered in competition and a screening scheduled at Cannes.The reason given by the bureau was that the print had lighting and sound flaws, according to one of the producers of the film.But it's far more likely the subject matter that has Chinese censors worried.The film contains graphic sex scenes and takes place against the background of student protests in 1989 that culminated in the massacre at Tiananmen Square.Lou says he had an obligation to the film's backers and cast to bring the film to international notice, although Beijing had not yet approved it.Chinese director Wong Kar-wai is chairman of the Cannes jury this year, but Summer Palace is the only Asian film among the 20 in competition for the Palme D'Or.The film is primarily a love story, not a political statement, Lou told Reuters, claiminghe set the film in 1989 ""only because I was a student at university then and I was in love.""The film is a personal epic that covers a period from 1987 to 2001, with the Tiananmen protests falling at the most intense time inthe heroine's personal struggle. Chinese actress Hao Lei stars as a tempestuous young women who seeks love again and again but never finds fulfillment for long.China has warned its 50-member press contingent at the 2006 Cannes festival not to cover sensitive subjects, especially Summer Palace, according a report from Screen magazine.After the screening of Summer Palace last Thursday, Lou said he is willing to change the film to get approval to show it in China.""I would agree to removing any scene they want,"" he said. Shanghai-born Lou is keen to have mainland Chinese see the film because it explores the many changes in personal morality and social norms that mark the last 30 years in Chinese history.""During shooting, I always forget about what's banned and what's allowed. Now it has become an issue and I will have to find a way of improving my way of working,"" he said.Lou said that a synopsis of the film had been submitted to the censors' office in 2004, and that ""normally on that basis, a film can be approved.""Lou was previously barred from making films for two years for his 2000thriller Suzhou River, which was produced without official approval. Chinese censors can bar filmmakers for even longer periods.Other contenders for this year's top award at Cannes are Sophia Coppola's Marie Antoinette; Volver by Spanish director Pedro Almodovar and U.K. master Ken Loach's The Wind that Shakes the Barley."

It cited messages on social media that Guo was last seen with police at an airport in Shanghai.China is in the midst of a three-year-old anti-graft crackdown led by President Xi Jinping that has snared dozens of executives at state-owned companies in oil and other industries. A court cited Guo in August as being linked to a supermarket chain chairman who was jailed for corruption.A series of figures in China's securities industry have disappeared or been detained since August after authorities launched an investigation following a plunge in Chinese share prices in June.Fosun, China's biggest privately owned conglomerate, and its pharmaceutical unit suspended trading of their shares Friday in Hong Kong. They cited the pending release of an announcement with ""inside information.""Phone calls to Fosun's media and investor relations departments weren't answered.If Guo is under investigation, that suggests authorities are extending scrutiny beyond state-owned enterprises, increasing uncertainty for investors, said Ronald Wan, CEO of investment banking at Partners Capital International in Hong Kong.""A lot of companies will be on the investigation list and it will alert all the investors,"" he said.Wan said the government should clarify Guo's status.""If he is really getting caught in some sort of serious trouble, at least the group can have some sort of contingency plan and work out a solution to how the company can be run,"" said Wan.Guo, 48, is one of China's biggest investors abroad. Fosun, which he co-founded in the 1990s, has businesses in real estate, steel, mining and retailing.The Financial Times dubbed him ""China's Warren Buffett"" for following the legendary American investor's approach of using the cash flow from insurance operations to buy other businesses.Fosun won a bidding war this year to take over Club Mediterranee, the French resort operator. Last year, it paid 1 billion euros for Portugal's biggest insurance company, Caixa Seguros. In the United States, it owns Meadowbrook Insurance Group Inc., 20 per cent of insurer Ironshore Inc. and the 60-story office tower at 1 Chase Manhattan Plaza in New York City.Guo has a net worth of $7.8 billion, according to the Hurun Report, which follows China's wealthy.He denied earlier he was the target of a graft investigation.A court in Shanghai said in August he had ""inappropriate connections"" with the chairman of a state-owned supermarket chain, Wang Zongnan, who was sentenced to 18 years, according to Caixin. The court ruled he misused 195 million yuan ($31 million) of Shanghai Lianhua Supermarket Holdings Co.'s money to help two other companies invest in real estate.The court said Wang misused his position ""to seek benefits for Fosun Group,"" according to Caixin. In exchange, the court said, Guo sold two villas to Wang's parents at low prices.Fosun denied any impropriety and said the villas were sold at market prices.In China's state-dominated economy, many entrepreneurs make deals with officials or state industry managers to gain government licenses, contracts or financing, said Zhang Tianyu, a specialist in corporate governance at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.""This is how some entrepreneurs get into trouble once they have an anti-corruption campaign,"" said Zhang.Zhang said that in a series of deals in Shanghai, Fosun has bought stakes of less than 50 per cent in state-owned companies but gained management control. He said that unusually favourable arrangement reduced the amount of capital Fosun had to tie up in the company while making it a partner of state managers.""What we guess is that someone should be helping him to make these transactions,"" said Zhang. ""Without more evidence, we don't know who this is. A politician, or maybe a group of people."""

The new rules ""prohibit the slaughter, cooking and selling of wild animals like civet cat"" and are meant to promote and ""advocate civilized dietary habits,"" said the Beijing Daily. The civets, which are related to the mongoose, are considered a delicacy and are often on the menu in many wild-game restaurants in parts of China. Following the initial discovery of SARS in Guangdong in 2002, Chinese officials barred restaurants from serving the small carnivorous mammal, which has a cat-like body and weasel-like face. Earlier this year, China drowned and electrocuted thousands of the animals over fears the virus it carries may jump to humans. The slaughter followed China's first confirmed case of SARS since the disease was contained in July, 2003. SARS has killed 774 people around the world, including 44 people in Canada. "

Lee said Peter Garratt requested privacy so he can spend a few quiet days with his mother.The detention of the Garratts came amid a crackdown on Christian groups aiding North Korean refugees along the border.Hong said both have been charged with stealing secrets and spying and Kevin Garratt has been moved from residential surveillance to the more serious status of criminal detention.""Kevin Garratt and Julia Garratt are under suspicion of undermining China's state security,"" Hong said.

Simeon Garratt said his parents made no secret of their faith but did not flaunt it in China, where proselytizing is against the law.The accusations against the couple last August came about a week after Canada accused a China-sponsored hacker of infiltrating Canada's National Research Council, the country's top research and development organization.China's Foreign Ministry expressed strong displeasure over that allegation."
Italian foilists outduel China in fencing final | CBC Sports,Italy wins gold in men's team foil competition.,2004-08-21T18:16:38.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/sports/2.720/italian-foilists-outduel-china-in-fencing-final-1.502973,"All is right with the Italian fencing world after the men's foil team won gold over China 45-42 on Saturday. The Italian team of Andrea Cassara, Simone Vanni and Salvatore Sanzo â ranked one-two-three in men's individual foil â was still smarting after allowing France's Brice Guyart to win the individual gold on Monday. Sanzo ended up winning silver and Cassara won bronze. But losing the gold to a fencer from their nation's main rival was a blow. Even with Sanzo nursing an injury, though, the Italians were able to out-duel China's team of Ye Chang, Dong Zhaozhi and Wu Hanxiong. Vanni led the Italians with 20 of his team's points. ""Italy is the best team in the world. We proved it one more time,"" said Cassara. ""It was impossible to loose this match. I am very happy and satisfied."" In the bronze medal match, the Russian team of Youri Moltchan, Renal Ganeev and Viatcheslav Pozdniakov defeated the United States 45-38. The United States team of Dan Kellner, Jonathan Tiomkin and Jedediah Dupree was a surprise semifinalist after upsetting Germany in the quarter-finals. "
Harper on religious freedom in China: 'Canadians would be concerned' | CBC News,"Prime Minister Stephen Harper talked trade throughout his one-day visit to Hangzhou in eastern China, but behind closed doors, he raised a more sensitive topic with the Communist Party secretary for the Zhejiang province — religious freedom.",2014-11-07T22:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/stephen-harper-raises-religious-freedom-concerns-with-china-1.2827647,"Prime Minister Stephen Harper has wrapped up a one-day visit to Hangzhou, in eastern China, where he talked trade everywhere he went.But behind closed doors Friday, he raised a more sensitive topic with the Communist Party secretary for the Zhejiang province — religious freedom.Xia Balong leads a province where a decree has led to many crosses being removed from churches.Religious activists say this is happening because party officials don’t like the obvious symbol of Christianity in plain sight. The party leaders, however, say the crosses are violating building codes.That prompted Canada’s ambassador for religious freedom to issue this statement.""Churches are important centres for outreach to the broader community, in which they can play an important social function. As such, they should be respected by local authorities and not desecrated in such a grievous manner,"" Andrew Bennett wrote.On Friday, Harper’s spokesperson told the media that the prime minister told Xia ""Canadians would be concerned to know that religious freedoms were being restricted.""The rest of the meeting, including Xia's response, are considered private.It’s these kinds of issues that have led to some members of Harper’s cabinet to be wary of closer trade ties with China.Several polls conducted this year show the majority of Canadians are skeptical too.Industry Minister James Moore, who is on the trip with Harper, says the relationship with China is all about balance.""Of course, there are always opportunities that we seek to not only expand free trade but certainly assert the principles of freedom, and democracy and respect for human rights and diversities,"" Moore said.""I would say recognize China for the country that it wants to become, what it is already. And not try to impose our values excessively on this country. It’s a unique country,"" Nelson said.Canada's former ambassador to China, David Mulroney, agrees finding the right balance with China is difficult.""Engaging with China doesn’t mean agreeing with China. It really means taking more responsibility for managing an increasingly important international relationship for Canada,"" Mulroney said.Harper spent much of his day publicly talking to Canadian and Chinese business leaders about the need for closer business ties.He stopped by the headquarters for Alibaba, the largest online company in the world. In China, 64 per cent of all commercial transactions are done through e-commerce sites like Alibaba.The prime minister said that as the affluent Chinese middle class expands to more than a billion people by 2030, there are opportunities for Canadian companies, big and small.""We know that over the long haul, in the decades to come, there’s not going to be the kind of growth opportunities in the United States and some of our traditional markets than there’s going to be in China and other parts of the world,"" Harper told a crowd at Alibaba.Mulroney said Hangzhou in particular is a good place for the prime minister to stop.""The benefit of waving the Canadian flag in Hangzhou is you get a much warmer welcome,"" Mulroney told CBC. ""Lots of people go through Beijing and Shanghai all the time, and the waiting list is long in the waiting rooms of all of the important people. But Hangzhou is hungry for business, and hungry for investment from places like Canada."""
"Occupy Hong Kong, China's coming pro-democracy showdown: Patrick Brown | CBC News","China's attempt to reinterpret the rules governing Hong Kong has sent tens of thousands into the streets in a protest with echoes of Tiananmen and an anthem — 'Do you hear the people sing? — straight out of Les Misérables, Patrick Brown writes.",2014-07-10T09:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/occupy-hong-kong-china-s-coming-pro-democracy-showdown-1.2701630,"We have seen this before — Chinese students calling their rulers to account, capturing the imagination of ordinary people with their infectious idealism and drawing huge crowds out onto the streets to challenge the all-powerful Communist Party.In 1989, students in Beijing took their demands to Tiananmen Square, the political heart of China. In 2014, the students of Hong Kong have focused on Central, the business district that is the territory's economic engine.In two huge demonstrations over the past month, Hong Kong students have called on Beijing to keep its promise to extend democracy by allowing the election of Hong Kong's head of government through universal suffrage — instead of by what's essentially a stacked deck.The first of these was an elaborate mock referendum in which almost 800,000 people, one-fifth of Hong Kong's electorate, took part.The result was heavily in favour of a general election to choose the next chief executive in 2017. Under the present rules, the only votes are cast by a committee of 1,200 people selected largely on the basis of their unqualified support for Beijing.The current chief executive, Leung Chun-Ying, is known contemptuously as ""689"" — for the number of people on the committee who voted for him in 2012.The second demonstration was a march to the Central financial district on July 1, and was one of the biggest street demonstrations since China took control of Hong Kong on that date in 1997.Broadcasting from Hong Kong then, as British sovereignty ended and Chinese rule began, I reported over the din of the fireworks that many were greeting their transition from British colonial subjects to citizens of the Peoples' Republic with confidence and enthusiasm, while others had misgivings.Beijing had promised to maintain Hong Kong's institutions, rights and freedoms unchanged for 50 years. I was among those who had doubts that the Communist Party politburo would keep its word.As the years passed, and the Chinese government seemed, by and large, to stick to its promise of ""one country, two systems,"" it was a pleasure to have some of those doubts removed. Now they're back.One of the world's most amazing cities, with a magical combination of orderly administration and commercial genius, Hong Kong also has a strong contrarian streak.In Hong Kong, the right to protest is vigorously exercised, and numerous demonstrations, big and small, on an astonishing variety of issues are a part of city life, and a litmus test of Beijing's tolerance.But China's reaction to the planned student referendum was to issue a lengthy position paper, laying out Beijing's interpretation of the Basic Law that is the equivalent of a constitution for Hong Kong. It was necessary, China said, to correct ""a lopsided and confused understanding"" of what is meant by one country, two systems.As China now says, the promise of ""a high degree of autonomy"" meant only such autonomy as the central government is willing to allow, and that will not include an open election for chief executive.Beijing is willing to allow more people to vote, it has said. But it will retain control of which candidates are allowed to run.In other words, elections are fine so long as the result is predetermined.What's more, candidates must be ""patriotic,"" which in the Communist Party's lexicon excludes anyone who does not support the party.One of the most interesting windows into the opaque world of what China's leaders are thinking is a website called Weiboscope run by the Journalism and Media Studies Centre at Hong Kong University.It tracks which posts on the microblogging services known as Weibo, mainland China's versions of Twitter, are being deleted by the censors.Since Weiboscope measures what people on the Chinese mainland are forbidden to read and discuss, it is a strong indication of which issues the Communist Party feels are most threatening to its rule.As hundreds of thousands of people followed student leaders out on to the rainy streets of Hong Kong on July 1, Weiboscope's censorship index broke the record set by the previous most-censored event — the 25th anniversary of the Tiananmen massacre on June 4th.The censors were particularly concerned to stop circulation of the demonstrators' anthem, ""Do you hear the people sing,"" a jaunty revolutionary tune from the musical Les Misérables, with Cantonese lyrics.The most prominent of the student leaders is Joshua Wong, a 17 year old with a gift for deft smackdowns of the sycophants invited to debate him.He was born in the year of the handover, and while previous protests here were led by cautious lawyers, journalists or trade unionists who grew up as British colonial subjects, these demonstrations are something new.They are being led by young people who grew up as citizens of the People's Republic of China, standing up to claim their rights with all the fearless certainty of their predecessors at Tiananmen Square.They are also warning that they will bring the global economic powerhouse that is Hong Kong to a standstill if they are to be denied.With the Hong Kong government preparing to reveal details of its plans for the 2017 election, the stage is now set for a much more dangerous confrontation.Last week's protests ended peacefully on schedule just before Central opened for business.The organizers say that was a dress rehearsal for a full-scale Occupy Central movement if the election rules are to be rigged.In response, Beijing has begun warning that the protests are inspired by foreign, ""anti-China"" forces, an indication that it is not inclined to make concessions.No wonder the censors are working overtime."
China closes schools to curb spread of SARS | CBC News,Health officials in China have ordered public schools in Beijing closed for two weeks as a precaution meant to slow the spread of SARS,2003-04-23T22:37:10.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/china-closes-schools-to-curb-spread-of-sars-1.373068,"Health officials in China have ordered public schools in Beijing closed for two weeks as a precaution to slow the spread of SARS.  The move will keep 1.7 million students home from school. The school day in Beijing had already started when the school board announced the closure, which starts Thursday. China reported 147 new cases of SARS Wednesday, most of them in Beijing. Nine more deaths were recorded, seven of them in the capital. China now has more than 2,300 people fighting the viral infection. Universities in Beijing have cancelled classes but told students not to leave campus. Students are being ordered to report to authorities daily to have their temperatures recorded. Worried migrant workers and university students are crowding train and bus stations, trying to get out of Beijing. Hong Kong authorities reported 24 new cases of SARS on Wednesday, and six more deaths related to the disease. "
Strain over security zone evident during Biden visit to China | CBC News,"In a sharp rebuff to the United States, China accuses Washington of taking Japan's side in a tense clash over disputed islands in the East China Sea, underscoring rising regional friction as visiting U.S. Vice-President Joe Biden met with Beijing's leaders.",2013-12-04T11:13:27.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/biden-in-china-u-s-accused-of-siding-with-japan-in-island-dispute-1.2450243,"In a sharp rebuff to the United States, China accused Washington on Wednesday of taking Japan's side in a tense clash over disputed islands in the East China Sea, underscoring rising regional friction as visiting U.S. Vice-President Joe Biden met with Beijing's leaders.Emerging from a private meeting with President Xi Jinping that went considerably longer than scheduled, Biden appeared sombre and subdued. In a brief appearance before reporters in which he took no questions, Biden did not go into details on differences over China's newly declared restricted flying zone. Instead, Biden spoke more generally of a ""new model of major country cooperation,"" saying U.S.-China relations must hinge on trust and a positive notion of each other's motives.The awkward kickoff for a series of official meetings in Beijing followed Biden's speech earlier Wednesday urging young Chinese citizens to challenge orthodoxy and the status quo. The vice-president drew an implicit contrast between the authoritarian rule of China's government and the liberal, permissive intellectual culture he described in the United States.Neither Biden nor Xi made public mention of the clash over disputed territory that has pitted China against the United States and its Asian allies.An editorial in the state media China Daily charged, however, that Washington ""is turning a blind eye to Tokyo's provocations,"" calling that the ""root cause of the tensions."" It said that ""the United States is wrongly pointing an accusing finger at China for 'unilaterally' changing the 'status quo' in the East China Sea.""Biden told reporters after his initial talks with Xi that the relationship between the two major powers will significantly affect the course of the 21st century. If the U.S. and China can get that relationship right, the possibilities are limitless, he said to reporters who were allowed in briefly after the vice president met with Xi.Biden said he came to Beijing because complex relationships require sustained engagement at high levels. He said Xi's candor and constructive approach had left an impression on him.""Candor generates trust,"" Biden said. ""Trust is the basis on which real change — constructive change — is made.""Absent from Biden's public comments was any discussion of U.S. concerns over China's new air defence zone. Only a day earlier, Biden pledged to raise those concerns ""with great specificity"" with Xi and other Chinese leaders, adding that China's move was deeply concerning.""This action has raised regional tensions and increased the risk of accidents and miscalculation,"" Biden said in Tokyo Tuesday after meeting with Japanese President Shinzo Abe.Japan has been on edge for the past two weeks since China unilaterally declared any planes flying through the zone must file flight plans with Beijing. The airspace sits above tiny islands that are at the centre of a long-running territorial dispute between China and Japan.The U.S. refuses to recognize the zone, but Biden has avoided calling publicly for Beijing to retract it, wary of making demands that China is likely to snub. Rather, the vice-president hoped to persuade China not to enforce the zone or establish similar zones over other disputed territories.After meeting with Biden, Xi said the U.S.-China relationship had gotten off to a good start this year ""and has generally maintained a momentum of positive development."" But he said the global situation is changing, with more pronounced challenges and regional hotspots that keep cropping up.""The world as a whole is not tranquil,"" Xi said through a translator, adding that the U.S. and China shoulder important responsibilities for upholding peace. ""To strengthen dialogue and cooperation is the only right choice facing both of our countries.""Added Biden, ""The way I was raised was to believe that change presents opportunity.""In his speech earlier to young Chinese citizens waiting at the U.S. embassy to get visitor visas processed, the vice-president said: ""I hope you learn that innovation can only occur where you can breathe free, challenge the government, challenge religious leaders."" Biden told young Chinese citizens waiting at the U.S. embassy to get visitor visas processed.""Children in America are rewarded — not punished — for challenging the status quo,"" he said.Biden's comments were not immediately reported by Chinese state media and were not likely to be widely known in China. A one-minute excerpt of his speech posted by the Sina news website included Biden's comment about challenging the ""status quo,"" but left out the one about challenging the government.When Biden arrived later at the Great Hall of the People, a ceremonial edifice steps away from Tiananmen Square, any tensions between the U.S. and China were papered over as Chinese Vice President Li Yuanchao welcomed him with an elaborate honour guard. A military band played the two countries' national anthems as Biden and Xi stood amid the massive hall's marble floors and crisscrossing red carpets."
"Journalists slam article claiming Russia, China cracked Snowden files | CBC News",Two journalists at the centre of the Edward Snowden mass-surveillance revelations say British claims that spies have been pulled from operations because Russia and China have cracked Snowden's files are full of contradictions and likely false.,2015-06-14T14:29:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/journalists-slam-article-claiming-russia-china-cracked-edward-snowden-files-1.3112907,"Two journalists at the centre of the Edward Snowden mass-surveillance revelations say British claims that spies have been pulled from operations because Russia and China have cracked Snowden's files are full of contradictions and likely false. Citing anonymous and unverified government sources, Britain's Sunday Times newspaper said in a report this weekend that Britain has pulled out agents from operations in ""hostile countries"" after Russia and China cracked secrets in the documents leaked by former U.S. National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden.Security service MI6, which operates overseas and is tasked with defending British interests, has removed agents from certain countries, the Sunday Times asserted, citing unnamed officials at the office of British Prime Minister David Cameron, the Home Office (interior ministry) and security services.But journalists Glenn Greenwald and Ryan Gallagher, who have worked with the Snowden files and reported on them, including for CBC News, said the Sunday Times article is full of contradictions and likely falsehoods.The newspaper provided no evidence aside from the anonymous sources to bear out the claims.Snowden downloaded tens of thousands of secret files from security agencies in the United States and Britain in 2013, and leaked details about mass surveillance of phone and internet communications. Some of the spy programs disclosed by his leaks have since been ruled illegal in both the U.S. and Britain.The United States wants Snowden to stand trial after he leaked classified documents, fled the country and was eventually granted asylum in Moscow in 2013.He ended up in Russia after leaving Hong Kong for Latin America, and although he said in 2013 that the encrypted files remained secure, Britain believes both Russia and China have cracked documents which contain details that could allow British and American spies to be identified, the Times report said, citing officials.British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond alleged Snowden had done a huge amount of damage to the West's ability to protect its citizens.""As to the specific allegations this morning, we never comment on operational intelligence matters so I'm not going to talk about what we have or haven't done in order to mitigate the effect of the Snowden revelations, but nobody should be in any doubt that Edward Snowden has caused immense damage,"" he told Sky News.But Greenwald, one of the journalists who first broke news of the files and was part of the team that won a Pulitzer Prize for reporting on Snowden's NSA revelations, said the Times article was ""filled with falsehoods.""Greenwald wrote on the The Intercept, the news website he co-founded, that the article ""gives voice to banal but inflammatory accusations that are made about every whistleblower from Daniel Ellsberg to Chelsea Manning.""""It offers zero evidence or confirmation for any of its claims,"" he writes. ""The 'journalists' who wrote it neither questioned any of the official assertions nor even quoted anyone who denies them. It's pure stenography of the worst kind.""Greenwald pointed to a U.S. Defence Department document, obtained by Vice News under access to information, that showed U.S. government officials have been keen to leak information to the media to try to discredit Snowden.An official at Cameron's office was also quoted in the Times piece saying there was ""no evidence of anyone being harmed"" — seeming to directly contradict another anonymous official in the same report who said Snowden had ""blood on his hands."" A spokeswoman at Cameron's office declined to comment when contacted by Reuters.A Home Office source told the newspaper that Russian President Vladimir Putin did not grant Snowden asylum for nothing.""His documents were encrypted but they weren't completely secure and we have now seen our agents and assets being targeted,"" the source said.Another journalist who worked extensively on the Snowden leaks, Ryan Gallagher, said that claim is unlikely to be true.""I've reviewed the Snowden documents and I've never seen anything in there naming active MI6 agents,"" Gallagher wrote on Sunday. He said the Times piece ""contains some pretty dubious claims, contradictions and inaccuracies.""  Greenwald also noted that Snowden has said ""unequivocally"" that he didn't take any classified files with him when he left Hong Kong, making it difficult to claim Russia would have gotten its hands on the cache of documents. Both Greenwald and Gallagher have co-written multiple articles about the Snowden files in collaboration with CBC journalists for CBC's website.British security agencies declined to comment to Reuters about the claims in the Sunday Times piece.The Russian and Chinese governments were not immediately available for comment.The revelations about the impact of Snowden on intelligence operations comes days after Britain's terrorism law watchdog said the rules governing the security services' abilities to spy on the public needed to be overhauled.Conservative legislator and former minister Andrew Mitchell said the timing of the report was ""no accident.""""There is a big debate going on,"" he told BBC radio. ""We are going to have legislation brought back to Parliament (...) about the way in which individual liberty and privacy is invaded in the interest of collective national security.""That's a debate we certainly need to have.""Cameron has promised a swath of new security measures, including more powers to monitor Britons' communications and online activity in what critics have dubbed a ""snoopers' charter"".Britain's terrorism laws reviewer David Anderson said on Thursday the current system was ""undemocratic, unnecessary and — in the long run — intolerable"".He called for new safeguards, including judges not ministers approving warrants for intrusive surveillance, and said there needed to be a compelling case for any extensions of powers."
Vietnam PM urges defiance but not violence amid anti-China riots | CBC News,"Vietnam's prime minister sent a text message to millions of citizens urging them to act in defence of the country's sovereignty following China's deployment of an oil rig in disputed waters, but said that ""bad elements"" shouldn't be allowed to engage in violence.",2014-05-16T16:26:55.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/vietnam-pm-nguyen-tan-dung-urges-citizens-to-defend-sovereignty-against-china-1.2645334,"Vietnam's Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung sent a text message to millions of citizens urging them to act in defence of the country's sovereignty following China's deployment of an oil rig in disputed waters but said that ""bad elements"" shouldn't be allowed to engage in violence.The message, sent late Thursday and Friday to subscribers via major state-owned cellphone operators, didn't directly condemn the riots that have broken out this week following China's decision to deploy the rig off the coast of central Vietnam on May 1. Vietnamese patrol ships sent to disrupt the rig are currently locked in a tense standoff with Chinese ships guarding it.Anti-China protests that started peacefully have ended in violence and vandalism, with 400 factories suspected of having links with China destroyed or damaged by mobs. One Chinese worker was killed and scores more injured at a huge Taiwanese steel mill that was overrun by a 1,000-strong crowd.""The prime minister requests and calls on every Vietnamese to boost their patriotism to defend the fatherland's sacred sovereignty with actions in line with the law,"" the text message said. ""Bad elements should not be allowed to instigate extremist actions that harm the interests and image of the country.""There were no reports of any new violence or protests on Friday.Vietnam's authoritarian leaders typically clamp down on public protests of any sort, but have allowed them this time. Preventing people from demonstrating would have given fuel to domestic critics of the government who already accuse it of being soft on Beijing.The government is also able to use the nationalist sentiment of its people to amplify its protests to Beijing. But violence that harms foreign investment and risks spinning out of control is unlikely to fit into this strategy, and the government will attempt to ensure that it doesn't break out again, most analysts say.London's Financial Times reported on Friday that Apple supplier Foxconn, a Taiwanese company that manufactures iPads and iPhones, was shutting down for three days because of safety concernsReporters and television stations have been permitted to cover the peaceful protests, something highly unusual and a clear sign of state sanction. But the violence and vandalism have been subject to a media blackout.Neither China nor Vietnam has shown any sign of compromise.Vietnam believes it has international opinion on its side, and took a boatload of foreign journalists this week to waters close to the rig to ensure maximum media coverage. Beijing, which insists it has done nothing wrong and says it won't withdraw the rig, reacted angrily.""It is clear that the aim of the Vietnamese side is to escalate the situation and create tension, or in other words, to generate a media hype and 'put up a show' in front of the international audience,"" the director general of the Foreign Ministry's Department of Ocean and Boundary Affairs, Ouyang Yujing, said in Beijing.China and Vietnam have tussled for years over competing territorial claims, as have the Philippines and China. But Beijing's desire for oil and gas, and its growing economic and military might, have seen it take an increasingly assertive stance to its claims in the sea, triggering increased tensions and incidents between it and claimant states.The anti-China violence on the streets is only inflaming the relationship further.China said its foreign minister, Wang Yi, called Vietnamese Foreign Minister Pham Binh Minh on Thursday and expressed Beijing's ""strong condemnation and stern protest"" over the violence against Chinese and other foreign nationals and businesses.""Vietnam has an inescapable responsibility for the actions of the lawless elements who attacked Chinese businesses and individuals,"" Wang said.The U.S. doesn't take a side in the disputes, but shares many of the concerns of Vietnam and the Philippines about China. It is seeking closer economic and military ties with both nations. It has described China's deployment of the rig as ""provocative.""In Washington, U.S. Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Martin Dempsey said after a meeting Thursday with his Chinese counterpart that in a world where information moves so fast, ""issues afloat quickly become issues ashore as we've seen today in Vietnam.""The chief of the General Staff of China's People's Liberation Army, Gen. Fang Fenghui, blamed Vietnam for the off-shore standoff, asserting that China was operating in its own territorial waters. He vowed that China would continue its oil drilling and would not allow Vietnam to disrupt it."

Chinese spacecraft has fresh moon rock samples to return to Earth | CBC News,"China said Thursday its latest lunar probe has finished taking samples of the moon's surface and sealed them within the spacecraft for return to Earth, the first time such a mission has been attempted by any country in more than 40 years.",2020-12-03T13:48:11.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/moon-samples-1.5826500,"China said Thursday its latest lunar probe has finished taking samples of the moon's surface and sealed them within the spacecraft for return to Earth, the first time such a mission has been attempted by any country in more than 40 years.The Chang'e 5, the third Chinese probe to land on the moon, is the latest in a series of increasingly ambitious missions for Beijing's space program, which also has a probe en route to Mars carrying a robot rover.The Chang'e 5 touched down Tuesday on the Sea of Storms on the moon's near side, on a mission to return lunar rocks to Earth for the first time since 1976.The probe ""has completed sampling on the moon, and the samples have been sealed within the spacecraft,"" the China National Space Administration said in a statement.Plans call for the upper stage of the probe known as the ascender to be launched back into lunar orbit to transfer the samples to a capsule for return to Earth. The timing of its return was not immediately clear and the lander can last up to one moon day, or 14 Earth days, before falling temperatures would make it inoperable.Chang'e is equipped to both scoop samples from the surface and drill two metres to retrieve materials that could provide clues into the history of the moon, Earth other planets and space features.WATCH | An animation shows how Chang'e 5 was to land on the moon and collect samples:WorldWhile retrieving samples is its main task, the lander is also equipped to extensively photograph the area surrounding its landing site, map conditions below the surface with ground-penetrating radar and analyze the lunar soil for minerals and water content.Chang'e 5's return module is supposed to touch down around the middle of December on the grasslands of Inner Mongolia, where China's crewed Shenzhou spacecraft have made their returns since China first put a person in space in 2003, becoming only the third country do so after Russia and the United States.Chang'e 5 has revived talk of China one day sending a crewed mission to the moon and possibly building a scientific base there, although no timeline has been proposed for such projects.China also launched Its first temporary orbiting laboratory in 2011 and a second in 2016. Plans call for a permanent space station after 2022, possibly to be serviced by a reusable space plane.While China is boosting co-operation with the European Space Agency and others, interactions with NASA are severely limited by concerns over the secretive nature and close military links of the Chinese program."
Tiny relative of Triceratops found in China | CBC News,"Fossils of dog-sized dinosaur, an early, distant cousin of the Triceratops, have been found in China, researchers say",2002-03-21T01:04:05.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/tiny-relative-of-triceratops-found-in-china-1.336063,"Fossils of a dog-sized dinosaur, an early, distant cousin of the Triceratops, have been found in China, researchers say. Paleontologists said the two newly discovered fossils will help them better understand the evolution of this family of dinosaurs. The dinosaur, Liaoceratops yanzigouensis, weighed only about three kilograms and was less than a metre long. The name refers to the site where the scientists found the fossils, in the village of Yanzigou in Liaoning province. The fossils' discovery is published in Thursday's issue of Nature. The plant-eating dinosaur had small horns and a ridge at the top of the skull, mere hints of the massive horns and frill that would adorn its descendant, Triceratops. ""This small, primitive dinosaur is actually more interesting to science in many ways than its larger, more famous relatives because it teaches us more about evolution,"" study co-author Peter Makovicky said in a statement. Makovicky, assistant curator of dinosaurs at The Field Museum in Chicago, worked with scientists at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing, led by Xing Xu. Makovicky said the fossil helps establish that the ceratopsians separated from another group of dinosaurs, the parrot-beaked dinosaurs or psittacosaurids, about 150 million years ago, in the early Cretaceous Period. The new dinosaur also shows that larger and more spectacular dinosaurs can evolve from smaller ancestors. ""We see this common pattern in many different groups of dinosaurs,"" said Makovicky. Makovicky said the dinosaur's horns and small frill may have been display features for attracting mates or discouraging predators. The frill may also have served as an attachment point for its large jaw muscles, Makovicky said. "

There have been single-day losses in the triple digits this year.Much of the blame for the slump is being laid at the feet of U.S. President Donald Trump, who loved to take credit for hot markets on the way up. Investors don't like uncertainty — and the world's two largest economies making it harder and harder for them to do business with each other certainly qualifies. ""To paraphrase singer-songwriter Jimmy Buffett,"" as strategist Mark Grant with investment bank B. Riley FBR put it, ""there's been a change in latitude, so investors must change their attitudes.""For investors who had perhaps gotten used to double-digit returns, the prospect of a global trade war is serving as a good reminder that markets can sometimes go down, too.All this sabre-rattling is definitely pumping the brakes on expectations of higher interest rates. Prior to the last Bank of Canada interest rate decision (when the bank opted to stand pat) traders were betting there was about a 40 per cent chance of a rate hike this month. Today the likelihood is barely half that, at 22 per cent. Trade fears aren't the only factor, but they are clearly playing a role.And it's not just Canada. ""The [U.S.] Federal Reserve is going to change its tune,"" Grant said. ""It will not just be investors who have to do an about-face."" Against the backdrop of a trade war, it's reasonable to expect tough times ahead for the loonie. Trade analyst Raoul Leering with Dutch bank ING notes that smaller countries such as Canada and Mexico depend far more on American demand for their products than the other way around. ""Canada has much more to lose in a trade war … than the Americans,"" he said in a note to clients Wednesday.The loonie saw a brief surge this week on reports that NAFTA talks have turned optimistic. But the threat of a trade war has pushed it back down, along with the peso, as investors realize there are still risks on the horizon, says Scotiabank economist Derek Holt.""Which currency gains from trade wars? The currency of the country that started it,"" Holt says. And that isn't Canada.It's entirely possible that Canadians who export products on each country's verboten list might see some new markets emerge as the two countries build a tariff moat between themselves. After all, it's not as if the U.S. is suddenly going to need less steel, or China lose its voracious appetite for soybeans — which could benefit people like Dresden, Ont.-based soybean farmer Philip Shaw. He thinks there may be future opportunities for farmers to sell to China.Glen Lucas, general manager of the B.C. Fruit Growers' Association, said the Chinese tariffs will be disruptive but he, too, is optimistic that there may be some tiny gains to be had for Canadian growers.""I think it'll just cause market confusion and a lot of hassle for the producers to figure out where the products are flowing,"" he said. ""But I would expect that there would be a shift to markets that don't have tariffs,"" such as Canada, he said.Despite some gains on the margins, the general view is that trade wars are pretty much bad for everybody. ""It's not a good thing, period,"" is the blunt assessment from professor Walid Hejazi at the Rotman School of Management in Toronto. And he thinks Canada could suffer more than most because of how dependent we are on the U.S. economy. From softwood lumber to aerospace to supply management, every time Canada has a gripe on trade with the U.S. ""we find ourselves hostage to our one big trading partner,"" he says. So a trade war ""would be terrible for Canada, and terrible for the global economy.""Farmer and economist Shaw isn't quite so bleak, but he too would prefer ""that everybody could get along,"" as he put it. Despite any potential new markets opening, ""anything bad for the U.S. is bad for us,"" he says. Still, there is a chance — albeit a small one — that escalating trade tensions might turn out to be a good thing in the long term. ING's Leering notes that China has not set a date for implementing the $50 billion in tariffs it slapped on more than 100 U.S. goods. To him, that suggests it may be an empty threat and a negotiating tactic. CBC News""This means they still see room for extending the current negotiations, [and] it is likely that China will, in the end, cut its losses and be willing to give Trump something,"" he said.""The American president is playing a dangerous game but a potentially rewarding one.""Analyst Dan Flynn with the PRICE Futures Group in Chicago says the reforms the U.S. is pushing for will end up being good for both sides. ""You can expect China to not be a Barney Fife and shoot themselves in the foot,"" he said.U.S. demands that China modernize its intellectual-property and foreign-takeover rules are long overdue, Flynn says, and are ""big pluses long term.""""But the media could never admit that, of course, and the majority almost seem as if they want the U.S economy not to succeed … just to be spiteful,"" Flynn said in a quip sure to be a favourite of the U.S. president.While he's skeptical of an upside, Grant, too, acknowledges that the skirmishes in this trade war might not be all that bad.""I doubt the Trump administration will allow this trade battle to reach such a fevered pitch,"" he said, ""but I am concerned just how far President Donald Trump and his Art of the Deal might push things."""

Provincial Heritage Fair.Students representing 28 schools across the Island packed the halls at the Confederation Centre of the Arts in Charlottetown to display their 149 historical projects.Students from Grades 5 through 9 worked on projects in their own schools and were chosen to represent at the provincial fair.""Kids just come alive and it's a lot of fun and you can see the excitement when they come in,"" said Charlotte Stewart, coordinator of the Provincial Heritage Fair. ""The whole [Confederation] Centre is kind of buzzing with excitement here and it is great to see a lot of the community support.""Stewart has been coordinating the fair for the past 14 years and said that history is not the only thing the students are learning.""It's a great way to connect with your community with your family and learn about different resources that are out there for information,"" she said. ""Not just doing a Google search but using all sorts of different source materials and then getting that information together and being able to present it to other people."" It was a class effort at Tignish Elementary School. Students were assigned to find out more about historical moments and locations in their community. They would then model clay and paint the scene in a frame.""A lot of stuff we didn't know before about each landmark, so it was really cool,"" said Grade 6 student Stacy Handrahan.Anna Paquet, a Grade 9 student at Grace Christian School, decided to research the Spanish Influenza of 1918. ""This is what our ancestors went through, and it is important to understand what they have gone through in the past.""​Grade 5 student Kierra MacDougall, from Athena Consolidated focused on her own culture by researching her Métis heritage. ""I did that because I'm Métis, and I wanted to learn about my culture and also share it,"" said MacDougall. Grade 9 student Ben Zhou, from East Wiltshire Intermediate School, decided to research the popularity of Anne of Green Gables in China. He was inspired to look into the topic after reading a few of the Anne books. ​""After doing some research, I found it is so famous in China, and so many different versions have been translated,"" said Zhou. ""I was surprised, I was very surprised."" The heritage fair was personal for one student who presented a Second World War P.E.I. spy  —  his own great-grandfather.​""It was really interesting,"" said Grade 6 student Oscar Cormier from West Kent Elementary School. ""I knew some of it from family stories but I never knew that he parachuted for instance, I found that probably the coolest thing I discovered.""During his research Cormier also found that many of the records from his great-grandfather's spy days might have been destroyed.""I think that if we don't learn about the history, we'll make the same mistakes we made last time,"" Cormier said. ""But also, Camp X burned all their records. So we learn from our history but I don't think they wanted us to know too much.""There were a large number of judges walking around and assessing the student projects.Fifteen students will be selected to work on a video submission to compete nationally for a chance to go to Canada's History for Youth Forum in Ottawa."
Vancouver couple accused of spying in China held in near isolation | CBC News,"A Canadian couple accused of spying near China's sensitive border with North Korea has been kept in near isolation for more than 80 days, their son said, and they have repeatedly been denied access to legal counsel.",2014-10-24T09:49:07.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/kevin-and-julia-dawn-garratt-accused-of-spying-in-china-held-in-near-isolation-son-says-1.2811337,"A Canadian couple accused of spying near China's sensitive border with North Korea has been kept in near isolation for more than 80 days, their son said, and they have repeatedly been denied access to legal counsel.Treatment of the couple, who are being held without charge at a remote facility in the border city of Dandong, has seriously strained China's ties with Canada ahead of a planned visit by Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper for a multilateral summit next month in Beijing.Kevin and Julia Garratt were allowed to meet briefly for breakfast last week - the first contact they had with each other during their detention.""It's not their physical health I'm concerned about, it's more their mental health,"" said their son Simeon Garratt. ""You put anybody in a situation like that for 80 days, where you can't talk to anybody else and with no outside contact, and you don't know what could happen. It's not about food or water.""The Vancouver couple had opened a cafe called Peter's Coffee House in Dandong in 2008. State media has reported they are suspected of stealing national security secrets, but no formal charges have been made and it is unclear what exactly they are accused of.Kevin Garratt told a congregation in Canada last year that he ran a prayer and training facility frequented by North Koreans, many of whom became Christians before returning to the isolated country.Hundreds of Christian aid workers near the North Korean border have been detained or forced to leave in a crackdown this year.Both Kevin and Julia are under 24-hour surveillance by two guards. Canadian consular officials visit with them every two weeks, Simeon Garratt said. They are frequently interrogated, he said, though the subject of the questions is unknown.""Their daily routine is to wake up, have breakfast and wait to find out whether they'll be interrogated that day or not,"" he said.The Garratts' children communicate with their parents through written letters sent through Canadian consular officials. But not all of them get through. A coffee-maker and other supplies sent by the Garratt's younger son was also never delivered.Authorities have repeatedly denied the family's requests for access to legal counsel since the Garratts were detained August 4, according to a source with direct knowledge of the matter.The source added that authorities had said re-applying would almost certainly be fruitless.""They remain detained and isolated from their family and legal counsel, and in conditions that are nothing short of demeaning and withdrawn from meaningful human contact,"" the person said. ""Under such circumstances, any human being under the pressure of isolation could easily incriminate themselves.""The Canadian Embassy in Beijing could not be immediately reached for comment.It is unusual for foreigners to be charged with violating China's state secrets law - a serious crime that is punishable by life in prison or death in the most severe cases.In September, Canada ratified a foreign investment protection agreement with China after a two-year delay in a move that could help ease tensions with China."

Today, he was taken in for questioning, and warned against talking to the media. Mr. Garratt decided to speak to us to defend his parents against charges that he says are ""ridiculous."" Some suggest that their arrest has less to do with state secrets, and more with the couple's openly Christian faith. He told As It Happens guest host Laura Lynch that they did keep a Bible in the cafe, But, his parents didn't go out of their way to spread the faith. He says, ""My parents are Christians, yes, and they don't hide that. But they're not doing anything against the Chinese government or trying to proselytise or anything like that.""Mr. Garratt says he was told his parents are being held at an undisclosed location in Dandong. On Wednesday, he will be allowed to speak to his parents by phone, but forbidden from talking about the investigation. "

But it ran into problems as it was shutting down in preparation for the lunar night, which lasts two weeks.The problems were a rare setback for China's burgeoning space program, which in recent years has conducted space walks and placed a space station in orbit.Pei said the rover had ""come back to life"" despite space experts' earlier concerns that it might not survive the extremely low temperatures of the lunar night, when the temperature drops to -180 C.""The rover stands a chance of being saved now that it is still alive,"" Pei was quoted as saying. He said it was still unclear what caused the problem.The mission has been a popular success for China's military-backed space program. Updates on the moon rover's progress have been posted on an unofficial Chinese microblog account written with the Jade Rabbit's voice, attracting tens of thousands of comments by Chinese internet users."

"China in the oil patch, should we 'fear the dragon'? | CBC News","Two years ago, when it blocked the proposed takeover of Potash Corp., Ottawa promised clearer rules on what foreign companies could buy, Patrick Brown writes. With China's oil giant set to take over Calgary's Nexen, those rules are needed now.",2012-07-26T09:12:58.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/china-in-the-oil-patch-should-we-fear-the-dragon-1.1229528,"During his visit to China in February, Prime Minister Stephen Harper had two things on his mind: pandas and oil.For Canada, the trip was a success. Harper had his picture taken with two of China's cutest inhabitants, and told China's leaders often and loudly that Canada's oil and gas companies are open for business and for investment.His hosts indicated they are almost as keen to buy Canadian oil and gas as he is to sell it, and that Chinese companies will be delighted to take up his invitation to invest in Canadian natural resources.Fast forward to this week and China put its money where its mouth is with a$15-billion offer by the China National Offshore Oil Company to buy Calgary-based oil producer Nexen Inc.It's one of the biggest foreign takeovers China has ever attempted and one of the biggest in this country as well.So now Canada has to decide whether it really means what Harper said when he was in Beijing.The Investment Canada Act requires the minister of industry, in this case Christian Paradis, to determine whether any foreign takeover worth more than $330 million provides a ""net benefit"" for Canada.Luckily for Paradis, the provisions of the act are sufficiently vague that it allows him to decide pretty much whatever the prime minister tells him to.Having laid out such a large and inviting welcome mat back in February, it seems highly unlikely that Harper will want to slam the door in China's face, unless he wants to give back the pandas and have relations return to the deep freeze.In making its decision, Ottawa will be helped by the fact that CNOOC, which was rebuffed by the U.S. when it tried to take over Unocal for $18-billion in 2005, has done its homework this time.   As the first Chinese company to make important minority acquisitions in Canadian oil firms, CNOOC has seven years experience here already and is often said to have good connections in Ottawa, courtesy perhaps of Hill and Knowlton, the giant international PR firm that was hired to advise on the bid.What's more, by offering at least 61 per cent more for Nexen's shares than the previous day's closing price, CNOOC's bid is extremely generous and includes several promises that are clearly designed to satisfy the ""net benefit"" requirement.It will keep Calgary as the headquarters of operations for North and Central America; Nexen's current management will stay in place; CNOOC will list on the Toronto Stock Exchange; and CNOOC will invest heavily in existing assets.It will also be hard for opponents to portray the deal as a sell-off of Canada's birthright since only one third of the oil Nexen produces is from here.The rest is in the North Sea, the Gulf of Mexico, Yemen and off the coast of Nigeria, not places usually seen as part of Canada's heritage.On the face of it, this seems like the kind of deal that would normally sail through the review process. That is, if only CNOOC did not have the word China in its name, and was not owned and operated by the Chinese Communist Party.In a prescient research study, Fear the Dragon?, issued just last month, the Conference Board of Canada called for changes in the Investment Canada Act to make the review process more effective and transparent.The study also contains a section titled ""Dear China, we have trust issues,"" in which the authors cite a Harris-Decima poll taken in February around the time of Harper's China trip.""Just one in 10 respondents thought Chinese companies taking a majority controlling interest and/or taking over an existing Canadian operation is a good thing,"" the poll found.Clearly, it would seem that Canadians have greater concerns about China's economic ambitions than their federal government does, perhaps based on the way Beijing has tended to disregard workers' rights and environmental standards at home.Or perhaps it is based on the fear that large state-owned Chinese companies will use their muscle in the interests of China to the detriment of Canada; or that, when push comes to shove, the Chinese government will throw its weight about in support of their companies, demanding concessions from Canada on their behalf.In a column in her local newspaper, Island Tides, last week, the energetic Green Party leader Elizabeth May, recalled the old argument that stronger trade ties would promote political reform in China.""In the last few years, direct ownership of the Alberta oil sands by Chinese state-owned oil companies has gone from nearly nothing to over $12-billion,"" she wrote.""So back to that wonderful transmission of values through trade. It seems to be working,"" she added, in a slap at the Harper government. ""Canada is absorbing Chinese values respecting human rights, labour laws and environmental protection.""The counter-argument, made by the Conference Board, is that Chinese companies respect the rule of law in host countries, and deserve a clearer law here that will ""make them aware of Canadian sensitivities and requirements"" and ""balance Canada's desire for Chinese investment with the Canadian national interest.""So where is that law?Two years ago, Christian Paradis' predecessor as industry minister, Tony Clement, blocked the Australian mining company BHP Billiton from taking over Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan (for almost $40-billion).At the time he, and the prime minister, promised to draw up new guidelines so that foreign investors know exactly what they need to do to comply with Canada's ""net benefit"" rule.But that promise has not been kept, and the system remains almost as arbitrary and opaque as the one Canadian companies have to deal with when investing in China.Right now, China is seeking to turn its mountain of cash into greater ownership of resources, seeing these as a better investment for its economic future than U.S. treasury bonds and their almost zero return.In this regard, Canada is a natural place to look and China's leaders are sure to see this bid as a test case for more to come.Indeed, so will the many Canadians who have suspicions about the wisdom of the deal.Both sides would benefit from greater transparency and a wider airing of the issues involved.And before Canada makes a decision about whether to approve the deal, it would be nice to know just who made $30 million with what Reuters reports was ""a number of well-timed bullish bets"" on Nexen options last week, just days before the CNOOC deal was announced.The news agency quotes one stock analyst as saying, ""This is probably the most compelling and suspicious order flow I've seen in a takeover in several years."""
Typhoon Utor lands in China as Hong Kong shuts down | CBC News,Tens of thousands of people were evacuated as a powerful typhoon thundered into southern China on Wednesday after shutting down the bustling Asian financial centre of Hong Kong and sinking a cargo ship.,2013-08-14T05:16:16.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/typhoon-utor-lands-in-china-as-hong-kong-shuts-down-1.1414493,"Tens of thousands of people were evacuated as a powerful typhoon thundered into southern China on Wednesday after shutting down the bustling Asian financial centre of Hong Kong and sinking a cargo ship.Packing high winds and torrential rain, Typhoon Utor forced the closure of schools, offices, shopping centres and construction sites in cities along its path northwest across Guangdong province.More than 60,000 people were evacuated in the city of Maoming alone, while another 98,000 were moved to safety to the south on the island province of Hainan, where 26,000 fishing boats were also ordered to shelter in harbours. Flights and ferry services were suspended on the island, stranding thousands of travellers.There were no immediate reports of damage or injuries on the mainland due to the storm, which was packing sustained gale force winds of 145 kilometres per hour.In Hong Kong, offices, schools and courts were shut and the stock market halted trading, bringing an eerie calm to the normally busy southern Chinese commercial hub. More than 350 flights were cancelled or delayed, and bus and commuter ferry services were curtailed.Helicopter search and rescue teams from Hong Kong and Guangdong province rescued 21 crew members from the Trans Summer, a bulk carrier, after it started listing in waters southwest of Hong Kong, local broadcaster RTHK said.Six people in Hong Kong were reported injured. Strong winds blew down 21 trees, but otherwise the city emerged largely unscathed.[IMAGEGALLERY galleryid=4853 size=small]Utor was the world's strongest typhoon of the year before it crossed the Philippines earlier this week, leaving at least seven people dead and four missing. One woman in northeastern Isabela province was seen on camera being swept away by a raging river. Her body was found later.Dozens of fishermen were missing after the storm, but most have since returned home, officials said.Rescuers were still struggling to reach at least three isolated towns in the hardest-hit Aurora province, where the typhoon slammed ashore.""As of now, we don't have communication (with the three towns) and the roads are not passable, even to motorcycles, due to landslides, rockslides and uprooted trees,"" said Rey Balido, spokesman for the national disaster agency. He said authorities were taking alternate routes and that the Philippine air force would deliver relief goods."
"Fishing for tourists, and the changing face of rural China | CBC News","While China undergoes one seismic change after another, the country's rural areas are trying hard to hold on their traditions.",2013-09-01T00:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/fishing-for-tourists-and-the-changing-face-of-rural-china-1.1312905,"It is no exaggeration to say that China is experiencing seismic shifts. You can see this most clearly in the divide between the cities and rural areas. Urbanization rates have skyrocketed, with the urban population in China jumping from 17.9 per cent in 1978 to 51.3 per cent in 2011.With this trend comes the diminishing of traditional, resource-based living that used to be the lifeblood of small communities. So how are those rural communities that remain sustained? It's a question that obviously resonates here in Newfoundland and Labrador, too. As China speeds towards urbanization with its own brand of communism and capitalism, tourism has become big business, in part as a way to maintain some semblance of traditional rural lifestyles.But who are the tourists? China is far and expensive for many Westerners. What we discovered is that Chinese tourism benefits largely from the money - the yuan - of many of the 1.4 billion Chinese nationals who love to travel within their home country. This was on full display on a hot summer morning in the southern Chinese village of Xiatang in Yangshuo County.As we pull our bikes to the riverbank, we are swarmed with people shouting offers at us. ""Hello, bamboo rafting?""[IMAGEGALLERY galleryid=4949 size=small]We shake our heads, trying to figure out how we will find the stranger who is our contact at the Yulong River. He finds us first, walks up to us, and wordlessly hands us a cellphone. On the other end, we hear the voice of Amy, our hotel's manager. ""Leave your bicycles with him. They will be waiting for you at the other end.""We do as she asks, follow the man, and board our bamboo raft, traditionally used both by fishermen and farmers as a means of transporting their goods in this fertile river valley.We glide past the breathtaking scenery: rice paddies, blue skies, towering limestone karst peaks that dominate every viewpoint. There are moments when we are the only ones in sight.But during our two-hour trip, we are occasionally overwhelmed with the abundance of raft after raft after raft. Floating markets drift by, selling everything from beer and water to full meals. Armed with camera, computer and printer, nearby tents offer instant photo opportunities to dress up in traditional clothing and pose with cormorants, birds used to catch fish in the region.Later that same evening, we make our way to the larger Li River, into which the Yulong empties, to actually watch a fishermen use these cormorants to fish.This tradition is more than 1,000 years old and was once a staple of sustenance living.  Local fishermen harness a half-dozen trained cormorants to their rafts just after dusk. They use an archaic-looking lantern to draw fish near the surface of the river. The birds, whose snared throats prevent them from swallowing large fish, will dive on command, catch and hold onto the fish. In one hour, our fisherman catches 20 large fish. We watch in awe at his expertise and ingenuity. Mixed with the awe, however, is a little sadness as this man goes about his business now more so for spectacle than for any kind of sustenance.We are repeatedly struck by how tradition and modernity have become necessary bedfellows, and wonder if what was once rural China has been bastardized for the tourist dollar (or yuan). This is a question we have often asked ourselves, both home and abroad.We pose this same question to Jack Zhuo, a local guide who took us hiking into the Longji rice terraces in what are termed the ""minority villages"" a few hours away in Longsheng County.As a government-certified tour guide, he sees the changes in rural China as he takes Chinese nationals and foreigners alike through the countryside.They visit the terraced rice paddies, shop local markets, or view a ""long haired"" show that features the women of the Yao tribe and their elaborate hairstyles, fashioned from tradition that forbids women to cut their hair except once on their 18th birthday.As we gazed at the hilly rice fields that must be tended largely by hand, Jack told us that government subsidies help encourage people to stay in the countryside and continue traditional modes of living, which are a huge tourist attraction.He says this is to counteract the fact that most younger Chinese, by virtue of external influences such as the internet, would rather flee to the cities and live what they think will be an easier lifestyle than that of a farmer.Many tourists are looking for ""authentic experiences"" as a way to mark their journeys, us included.The more we travel, the less money we tend to spend on trinkets and souvenirs, putting our dollars towards more intangible experiences.And while we are well aware that our Canadian privilege means we will never truly live like a local, we feel that experiencing traditional and rural culture often brings us that little bit closer to an understanding of a country and its people.And if that glimpse of insight comes on a sunny morning drifting along a river in a bamboo raft, it can remain a powerful and evocative image of a country's past, present and future, and the complicated connections between them."
5 things to know about the Canada-China investment treaty | CBC News,The federal government has come under heavy scrutiny after signing an investment treaty with China without public consultation or debate. Here are 5 things to know about the deal before it comes into effect which could happen as early as next week.,2012-10-28T00:47:36.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/5-things-to-know-about-the-canada-china-investment-treaty-1.1183343,"The federal government has come under heavy scrutiny from opposition parties and critics alike after Prime Minister Stephen Harper signed an investment treaty with China, formally known as a Foreign Investment Promotion and Protection Agreement (FIPA), while at the APEC Summit in Vladivostok, Russia, on Sept.9, 2012.While details of the agreement were kept secret until the deal was tabled in Parliament on Sept. 26., now that the details have been revealed, the deal itself does not have to be debated in Parliament.That's because treaty making is a royal prerogative and can become law through a cabinet order in council after sitting in Parliament for no less than 21 days after being tabled.Currently, Canada has 24 FIPAs in force with countries like Russia, Argentina and the Czech Republic. FIPA negotiations have been concluded with eight countries, including China, while ongoing negotiations continue with another 12 countries.A FIPA is not a free trade agreement but rather a bilateral agreement intended to ""protect and promote"" foreign investment through legally-binding rights and obligations.Here are five things to know about Canada's investment treaty with China which is expected to be ratified next week:This FIPA is different from other FIPAs due to the sheer amount of investment China already has in Canada, said Gus Van Harten, an international investment law expert and associate professor at the Osgoode Hall Law School at York University, in an interview with CBC Radio's The House.Van Harten explained, the FIPAs Canada has in force are typically with countries who don't own major assets in Canada.However, under this treaty, Van Harten said Canadian taxpayers will assume ""more of the risks and more of the constraints"" than their Chinese counterparts to the degree that Chinese investments in Canada outpace Canadian investments the other way.According to Van Harten, the deal doesn't deliver on market access and investor protection.""We come out on the losing side on both,"" said Van Harten. ""We should insist on reciprocity. The treaty does not allow for market access except under the exisiting legal framework of each country.""The problem with that, Van Harten said, is Canada's legal framework is ""more open and less opaque"" than China's existing legal framework which will benefit China more than it will benefit Canada.Under this treaty, the investor-state mechanism is such that China could sue for decisions made by any level of government in Canada, if Chinese companies thought they were not being treated the same as Canadian ones.In other words, this deal could undermine the provinces ""bargaining power,"" said Van Harten because ""this very powerful arbitration process operates outside of the Canadian legal system and Canadian courts.""Arbitration would happen behind closed doors, said Van Harten and if the arbitrators found Canada at fault, Canadian taxpayers could be left footing the bill. Several countries have already faced stiff punishment under such treaties.This, according to Van Harten, also calls into question whether the treaty is unconstitutional or not.The Opposition New Democrats, Liberals and Greens are all calling on the federal government to study and debate the agreement instead of ratifying it and locking it in for the next 31 years without public consultation – as they can do.In an interview with CBC Radio's The House on Saturday, NDP MP Don Davies, who serves as the international trade critic, told host Evan Solomon that if the federal government ratifies the agreement as it is now, it will have ""frozen in time a very lopsided deal.""Davies said they have ""received 60,000 emails in the last two weeks from Canadians who are concerned about this deal.""The federal government insists ""this agreement includes reciprocal obligations"" and is good for Canada, said the Conservative MP who tabled the FIPA with China.Also in an interview airing on CBC Radio's The House, Deepak Obhrai, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Foreign Affairs, said this FIPA with China ""levels the playing field"" between the two countries. Obhrai told Solomon, this agreement ""give assurances to Canadian businesses that their investment in China is protected and they can do business in China because this is a deal that is open and treats our companies in each other's country on equal terms.""The question we should all be asking ourselves Van Harten said, is ""has Canada conceded something now that we were not prepared to concede under previous governments?""And according to Van Harten, the answer is ""it's quite possible."""
Why allowing 2 children in China may not give Beijing the baby boom it wants: Saša Petricic | CBC News,"China has lifted its ban on second children, but the end of the strict one-child policy may not give Beijing the population boost it wants to keep its economy growing or help those whose lives were ruined by the old system, the CBC's Saša Petricic writes.",2016-05-15T09:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/china-child-policy-1.3575682,"At one day old, the baby boy being bathed in the hospital sink doesn't have a name yet or any idea that he may be a trendsetter.And perhaps he will be among the first in what Beijing city officials hope to be a mini baby boom after China lifted its ban on second children late last year.His parents, the Wangs, are happy just to be allowed to have a little brother for their two year-old daughter, who hovers over him curiously. Neither of the parents had brothers or sisters.Not so long ago, China's strict one-child policy would have made his birth illegal. His parents would have been fined. He could have been shunned.""A second child is exactly what we always wanted,"" says father Wang Jue. ""We didn't want our daughter to grow up alone. I'm sure many other couples are considering it, but it's not an easy decision to have a second. Raising children is so expensive here.""That's why Beijing may see only an increase of 50,000 births this year, hitting a predicted total of 300,000 new babies for 2016.It's hardly the surge of many millions experts say the country needs to keep its economy growing. Since 2013, when the rules for having two-child families started loosening, the number of second children born has totalled 17.7 million.At that rate, China could have a labour shortage of between 126 million and 220 million workers as early as 2030, according to World Bank studies.The population is getting older quickly and the number of working-age Chinese can't keep up.That's a global trend that's been accelerated here by the one-child policy, says Yang Yao, the director of the China Center for Economic Research at Peking University.""China has compressed this 100-year or 150-year process into a matter of 30 or 40 years.… Boom!"" he says. ""Even if people have two children, I don't think that we can stop aging. No way.""When the one-child policy was introduced in the early 1980s, it was meant to prevent a population explosion. At the time, many Chinese families had five or six children.But experts now say it was an over-reaction that didn't anticipate the country's rapid urbanization and the trend toward smaller families.More and more, demographers and economists call the one-child policy a mistake.""Has that done good things for China in the long run? Probably the answer would be no,"" says Yang Yao.It's already reducing China's low-cost workforce advantage. A shortage of workers in some areas has led to higher wage demands and an annual 10 per cent increase in salaries overall, according to official Chinese numbers.But the one-child policy also came with a huge human cost. For years, men and women were subjected to forced sterilizations and abortions. And it created a generation of children who officially don't even exist.Living in the warren of back lanes that make up Beijing's older neighbourhoods, known as hutongs, Li Xue is one of these ""nobodies.""Twenty-two years ago, she was born as a second child. Officials told her parents they would have to pay a fine equivalent to about four years of their salaries.They could never afford it, so she was never registered as a Chinese citizen. She never received an ID card or ""hukou.""To this day, her birth certificate has a blank instead of her name.Li Xue points to that, as well as a pile of other rejection letters from Chinese officials.""Without a hukou,"" she says, ""I can't have a normal life. I could never go to school, never see a doctor, I can't work and I can't get married. It makes me very sad.""Sitting in their small, one-room apartment, Li Xue and her mother detail a lifetime spent challenging the system.They have confronted officials and taken them to court. They have researched the one-child law, looking for any opportunity to file complaints. They describe being harassed, followed and subjected to house arrest for their activism. Once, Li Xue's parents were even beaten by police.""They threw me to the ground,"" her mother says. ""They kicked us in the head and on our backs.""My family has suffered so much,"" she adds through tears.But none of this gave Li Xue her identity card. She is still illegal, officially a nobody.Recently, top Chinese officials promised that second children born under the old law would no longer be denied a hukou. But local officials in many parts of China still refuse to issue them or insist that the old fines need to be paid first.China may be eager for couples to take advantage of the new laws. It may be banking on bigger families to help the country's economy stay ahead.But experts say the change in policy has come too late to solve the problem. And those whose lives were ruined by the old system say nothing at all has changed for them."
Boy who had eyes gouged out in China goes home with prosthetics | CBC News,A six-year-old Chinese boy whose eyes were gouged out in an attack more than three months ago is discharged from a hospital in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen where he was successfully fitted with prosthetic eyes.,2013-12-12T14:05:42.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/guo-bin-boy-who-lost-eyes-in-attack-gets-prosthetics-1.2461100,"A six-year-old Chinese boy whose eyes were gouged out in an attack more than three months ago was discharged Thursday from a hospital in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen where he was successfully fitted with prosthetic eyes.Guo Bin — nicknamed Binbin — danced to music at a send-off ceremony at the C-MER Dennis Lam Eye Hospital, where he expressed gratitude and happiness.The prosthetic eyes look and move much like normal eyes, but do not restore vision. Doctors plan to fit Binbin with navigation sensors next summer that would allow him to get around on his own in familiar places.Police in the boy's hometown in northern China's Shanxi province say they suspect his aunt was the culprit in the attack, although they have not identified a motive. The woman has since committed suicide.On Thursday, the boy's mother said Binbin can put on his clothes, brush his teeth and climb stairs by himself, according to reports in Hong Kong media.""He has adapted well and is smart,"" mother Wang Wenli said before thanking the medical staff.The attack on the boy horrified the Chinese public and added to outrage over violence against children."

First Nation has asked the Federal Court to stop Canada from ratifying an investment treaty with China until it and other bands have been consulted.In documents filed with the court in Vancouver, the Hupacasath First Nation said the Canada-China Foreign Investment Promotion and Protection Act, or FIPPA, would gut its aboriginal right to resources subject to foreign investment.Councillor Brenda Sayers said Monday the band is seeking the injunction because Chinese investors would ultimately control major assets such as coal on its 232,000-hectare territory.She said extraction of resources by foreign firms would strip negotiating powers for First Nations such as hers, which are involved in the treaty process.""Some modern treaties negotiated with British Columbia and Canada address Canada's obligation to consult prior to entering into international agreements which may affect treaty rights,"" the notice of application says.""The government proceeded without any input from First Nations, or Canadians for that matter, so this isn't just a First Nations fight. It just so happens that First Nations are one of the parties that can stop the FIPPA,"" Sayers said.""The other party is the premiers of each province who have not stepped up to the plate.""The Conservative government has said FIPPA will benefit Canada by increasing trade and investment with China as its economy booms to the point of becoming the largest in the world.Sayers said the deal is troubling because there's been no formal debate in the House of Commons and Conservative MPs voted down a motion that would have allowed scrutiny by expert witnesses.The Union of B.C. Indian Chiefs, the Chiefs of Ontario and the Serpentine River First Nation in Ontario are also supporting the injunction.The Canada-China deal would last for 31 years and was set to be ratified late last year, but public pressure has been building against it from people concerned about the environment and potential job losses.The Canadian Labour Congress has also called for a public debate on the agreement Canada negotiated with China last September, saying it would have a huge impact on labour markets and labour rights.Gus Van Harten, an international trade law expert from Osgoode Hall Law School, has filed an affidavit in the case, saying the treaty may be unconstitutional because state-owned Chinese companies would be allowed to dispute laws and regulations passed by provinces."
Former Hong Kong legislator says accounts frozen after he sought exile | CBC News,Former Hong Kong legislator Ted Hui says his local bank accounts appear to have been frozen after he said he would seek exile in Britain to continue his pro-democratic activities.,2020-12-06T00:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/hong-kong-ted-hui-exile-bank-accounts-frozen-1.5830356,"Former Hong Kong legislator Ted Hui said on Sunday his local bank accounts appeared to have been frozen after he said he would seek exile in Britain to continue his pro-democratic activities.Hui told Reuters via the social media Whatsapp that the bank accounts belonging to him, his wife and his parents in Bank of China Hong Kong, HSBC and Hang Seng Bank were frozen. He gave no further details.Democracy activists say conditions have worsened in the former British colony after China imposed security legislation on the financial hub in June, making anything Beijing regards as subversion, secession, terrorism or colluding with foreign forces punishable by up to life in prison.China, which promises Hong Kong a high degree of autonomy, denies curbing rights and freedoms, but authorities in Hong Kong and Beijing have moved swiftly to quash dissent after anti-government protests erupted last year and engulfed the city.Local media reported that at least five accounts worth hundreds of thousands of U.S. dollars belonging to Hui and his family, all of whom are now in Britain, had been inaccessible since Saturday.Hui contacted the banks and was told there were ""remarks"" placed on his accounts, but the staff refused to provide further information, Hong Kong's South China Morning Post reported.""We do not comment on the details of individual accounts,"" a Hang Seng Bank spokesperson told Reuters by email. HSBC and BOC did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Hui said on Thursday he had fled after facing criminal charges and would seek exile in Britain.One of the pro-democracy activists arrested last month and charged with disturbing legislature proceedings, Hui arrived in Copenhagen last week on an official invitation from Danish legislators.Hong Kong's Security Bureau issued a statement on Friday that, while not naming Hui, said ""running away by jumping bail and using various excuses such as so-called 'exile' to avoid one's responsibility is a shameful, hypocritical and cowardly act of recoil.""Hui was one of several opposition legislators who quit Hong Kong's Legislative Council last month in protest at the dismissal of four colleagues in what they called another push by Beijing to suppress democracy in the city."
China's Hu leaves G8 summit over Xinjiang violence: report | CBC News,"Chinese President Hu Jintao has left the G8 summit in Italy to return to Beijing amid an outbreak of violence in the northwestern Xinjiang province, China's state-run Xinhua news agency reported early Wednesday.",2009-07-07T04:54:23.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/china-s-hu-leaves-g8-summit-over-xinjiang-violence-report-1.824376,"The move comes as officials in Xinjiang imposed a curfew overnight as part of a crackdown on protesters after Han Chinese clashed with Uighurs in the provincial capital on Tuesday.After bringing in riot police to break up multiple protests, the Xinjiang regional government announced that a curfew was to be imposed from 9 p.m. Tuesday to 8 a.m. Wednesday local time.The curfew is needed to ""avoid further chaos,"" said Xinjiang Communist Party secretary Wang Lequan.Riot police using loudspeakers appealed to about 300 marchers to stop their destructive behaviour as they threw rocks, smashed shop windows and knocked down food stalls run by ethnic Uighurs in Urumqi on Tuesday.Many of the protesters waved wooden sticks, pipes and shovels while chanting ""Unite"" and ""Modern society,"" according to eyewitness accounts.""They attacked us. Now it's our turn to attack them,"" a man in the crowd told Reuters.As the demonstrators entered a predominantly Muslim area and approached a mosque, police used tear gas to break up the crowd.The Han march followed an earlier protest by about 200 people from the Uighur minority that resulted in a standoff with security forces and blocked a main road.At least 156 have died in ethnic violence in the northwestern province of Xinjiang since Sunday.UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay said an extraordinarily high number of people had been killed and injured in the rioting, and she called for a full inquiry.""I urge Uighur and Han civic leaders, and the Chinese authorities at all levels, to exercise great restraint so as not to spark further violence and loss of life,"" she said. ""This is a major tragedy.""The European Union on Tuesday called for ""restraint on all sides,"" adding it ""deplores the loss of life and expresses its sympathy with the families of the victims.""Uighur expatriates also protested outside the Chinese embassies in Turkey and Norway on Tuesday.Protesters briefly scuffled with police in Ankara, and the Turkish Foreign Ministry summoned a top Chinese diplomat over the violence in China.In Oslo, at least two people were injured when roughly 100 Uighurs gathered outside the Chinese embassy. One received injuries while trying to scale the embassy fence.Protesters waved the Uighur national flag and shouted slogans such as ""Stop killing our brothers — stop killing our sisters.""The Uighurs — an ethnically Turkic, predominantly Muslim group — make up the majority in Xinjiang, a region in northwest China bordering Central Asia and Mongolia.Their relations have often been tense with the ethnic Han Chinese who predominate in the country. Many Uighurs feel they're discriminated against by the government in Beijing and a Uighur separatist movement has existed for decades.The protests started in the provincial capital of Urumqi on Sunday, when demonstrators gathered to demand justice for two Uighurs killed in June during a fight with their Han co-workers at a factory in southern China.The protests turned into the deadliest ethnic unrest in the region in decades.Speaking at a rally in Washington on Tuesday, exiled Uighur leader Rebiya Kadeer blamed the Chinese government for the violence. About 100 people chanted ""Shame on China"" as they marched to the Chinese Embassy.Chinese officials have blamed Kadeer, who heads the Uighur American Association (UAA), for inciting violence. Kadeer, who has lived in Fairfax, Va., since she was exiled from China four years ago, denies the charges."
"Decades until sex ratio falls in China, India: study | CBC News","Large parts of China and India will have an excess of young men by up to 20 per cent because of sex selection, say researchers who call on policy makers to address the causes.",2011-03-14T19:29:52.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/decades-until-sex-ratio-falls-in-china-india-study-1.1022567,"Large parts of China and India will have an excess of young men by up to 20 per cent because of sex selection, say researchers who call on policy makers to address the causes.A preference for sons in China, India and South Korea, combined with easy access to sex-selective abortions, has led to a significant imbalance between the number of males and females born in these countries, researchers say.In 2005 in China, ""it was estimated that 1.1 million excess males were born across the country and that the number of males under the age of 20 years exceeded the number of females by around 32 million,"" wrote Prof. Therese Hesketh of the UCL Centre for International Health and Development in London and her co-authors.The outlook for a generation of males entering their reproductive years in the next 20 years is ""grim,"" the team concluded in urging China to relax its one-child policy, especially in rural areas.It's also important to change the underlying problem of how girls are valued, the team argued. Historically, the sex ratio at birth or number of boys born to every 100 girls is about 105 boys for every 100 females.But after ultrasounds were introduced and sex selection became available in the mid-1980s, the gender ratio at birth in some cities in South Korea climbed to 125 by 1992, and was more than 130 in several Chinese provinces in 2005, researchers report in Monday's issue of the Canadian Medical Association Journal.Similarly in India, the gender imbalance is as high as 125 in Punjab, Delhi and Gujarat in the north but is within normal levels in the southern and eastern states of Kerala and Andhra Pradesh, the team said.A common pattern driving the change in China, India, and South Korea is that if the first- or second-born are girls then couples will often ensure the second or third child is a boy.The authors described potential consequences of high sex ratios, such as men who are unable to marry in societies where starting a family often drives social status and acceptance. They also assume that lack of opportunity to marry and have children will result in low self-esteem that could make men psychologically vulnerable.The researchers noted their ongoing work has found no evidence men are prone to aggression or violence, but their findings suggest most of these men do have low self-esteem and are inclined to depression.""This may be because there is not yet a large enough critical mass of unmated men to have an impact, or because the assumptions about male aggression do not apply in this context,"" they said.The team also pointed to potential pluses of sex selection, such as an increase in the proportion of wanted births, and placing a higher value on women as their numbers in society fall."
Slain Toronto spa owner had planned move to China | CBC News,A single mother from Toronto had plans to move overseas before she vanished and parts of her body were discovered in two separate cities.,2012-08-23T00:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/slain-toronto-spa-owner-had-planned-move-to-china-1.1157940,"A single mother from Toronto had plans to move overseas before she vanished and parts of her body were discovered in two separate cities.Investigators are working to piece together the final movements of Hua Guang Liu from security videos and interviews.Liu, 41, was reported missing on Aug. 11. On Tuesday, Peel Regional Police confirmed her remains were the ones recovered from a river in Mississauga and a creek in Toronto in the days following her disappearance.Liu, a Canadian citizen of Chinese descent, was a mother of three. She had been operating a spa in a Scarborough mall. The spa is no longer in business.Former Toronto homicide detective Michael Davis said it is likely that police will probe Liu’s finances, her family and the relationship she had with her clients as they continue their investigation.Peel Insp. George Koekkoek said two of Liu's children are young and live with their father.Records show that Liu purchased a 2011 Toyota Yaris in September 2011 and was the sole buyer of a townhouse located on Huntingwood Drive in east-end Toronto in October of 2008.Koekkoek said investigators have searched Liu's home, as well as a motel in Scarborough that may be linked to her death. ""We are working on suspect information,"" he said.Police said that although what happened to Liu is horrific, it is ""an isolated case."" ""We have no reason to believe that this is anything other than an isolated case and that's the focus of our investigation thus far,"" Koekkoek said. ""We're satisfied to this stage that there's no threat or danger to the public safety. If we have information to the contrary, we'll be the first to advise.""The spa that Liu operated was known as Forget Me Not.Toronto Coun. Michael Thompson said city inspectors checked out the spa after receiving a handful of resident complaints about the business.When inspectors arrived at the business in mid-July the spa didn't appear to be operating,"" he said. Zoning and bylaw officials found nothing improper, but noted they had trouble finding Liu at the spa.""When our officers were able to speak to her she did inform them that she was in the process of selling her business,"" he said.Helen Savo-Sardaro, the building manager for the complex where the spa was located on Eglinton Avenue, told CBC News that police told her Liu left the spa at 5:30 p.m. ET on Aug. 10 — the day she disappeared.Savo-Sardaro said she knew the identity of the victim was when police revealed details about what they had found.""As soon as I heard it was yellow toenails, I knew it was her,"" she said.Savo-Sardaro was also a client at the spa. She said Liu ran a legitimate business and was very professional.Imran Bachcha, a pharmacist who works next door to the former spa, said police have requested access to the video recorded by on-site security cameras.Bachcha told CBC News that police were interested in whether the cameras covered the exterior of the pharmacy.They told him they were ""doing some major investigations regarding that missing woman,"" but Bachcha said they hadn't been back yet to get the tapes.Jong Soon Suh, the owner of a dry cleaning business located in the same complex for 18 years, said the former spa owner told her Liu was planning to leave Canada just months after opening the spa because her former husband had decided to relocate to China for work.Suh also said that she had become aware of Liu taking over the property in mid-May and was concerned with the spa because she never saw any customers enter and the front window was covered with a curtain.""The store never opened. There was no opening sign and nobody was in there,"" she said. ""When I passed by, the curtain was a little bit different shape than the other day. So I [kept] an eye on it and the next day it was a little bit different also … so that means someone gets in and gets out.""Suh said she had spoken with other business owners who also said they had never seen the spa open, while the previous owners had signs in front of the business to attract customers.Friends said that the evening Liu went missing she was scheduled to meet a prospective buyer.Shan Shanmugavadivel, a dentist at Rainbow Village Dental Office in the same complex, said he would see the previous owner in the parking lot, but never saw Liu in the area.""I saw a sign that said 'new management' but other than that I never met her and I never saw her,"" he said.Shanmugavadivel said that he rarely saw customers or employees of the spa entering or exiting the building."

Casino magnate promises to return looted sculpture to China | CBC News,Casino magnate Stanley Ho has paid $8.9 million Cdn for a bronze horse head from China's imperial palace and says he will return it to China.,2007-09-21T19:29:41.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/casino-magnate-promises-to-return-looted-sculpture-to-china-1.632814,"Casino magnate Stanley Ho has paid $8.9 million Cdn for a bronze horse head from China's imperial palace and says he will return it to China.""With this move, I hope to encourage more people to take part in preserving Chinese artifacts and to promote patriotism and nationalism,"" Ho said in the statement from auction house Sotheby's.Sotheby's released the statement Friday, saying it has cancelled a controversial auction of the bronze head scheduled for Oct. 9.In the past, there have been protests outside Hong Kong auctions featuring items from the palace, with protesters saying they were looted.The horse head is one of 12 animal heads that formed part of an elaborate water clock fountain designed by Jesuit missionaries for the summer palace in Beijing. Each animal is taken from the Chinese zodiac.In the second Opium War of 1860, British and French troops set the palace ablaze and plundered its treasures.In 2003, Ho, the man who built a gambling empire in Macau, bought a boar head from the same clock and donated it to Beijing's Poly Museum, an arm of the People's Liberation Army.After the palace was looted, the horse head was taken back to France and went into private collection, only resurfacing in 1989 in London.An unidentified Taiwanese collector paid $400,000 for the bronze relic in the 1989 London auction.Ho negotiated a private deal with the Taiwanese owner, paying the highest price ever given for a Qing Dynasty sculpture.Sotheby's said Ho planned to display the horse head in Hong Kong at a preview for other items in its sale of Chinese artifacts.It will then be displayed in his Grand Lisboa casino in Macau. Ho has not yet decided what Chinese museum will receive the artifact.The Chinese government welcomed Ho's announcement.Earlier this month, Xu Yongxiang, a buyer forthe Shanghai Museum, said the horse head was ""stolen property"" and should be returned to the Chinese government.Of the 12 animal heads from the fountain, only seven have been located.The Chinese government spent more than $4 million to buy back the tiger, ox and monkey heads at auctions. They are in the Poly Museum with the boar head.The rabbit and rat are part of a private European collection.During the Cultural Revolution, the Chinese smashed most of the cultural artifacts from their rich history."

The change is seen as a first step in eventually letting the yuan float freely. The United States and other trading partners have urged China to let its currency rise, arguing that keeping the value too low gives the Chinese an unfair competitive edge to their products in world markets. Canadian Finance Minister Ralph Goodale said the members of the G7 have been saying that increased flexibility in the Chinese exchange rate would benefit the Chinese economy and would contribute to greater stability in the global economy. ""It remains to be seen exactly how the new system will work and how much flexibility it will provide,"" Goodale said in a release. ""But this is an encouraging first step."" The U.S. administration also welcomed China's change of position. ""As we have said, reform of China's currency regime is important for China and the international financial system,"" said Treasury Secretary John Snow. The yuan will be revalued to 8.11 per U.S. dollar. Previously, the yuan had been pegged at 8.28 per U.S. dollar where it had been almost unchanged since the Asian financial crisis of 1997/98. ""It may be baby steps, but it is a long awaited adjustment that is needed in the global financial marketplace to help reverse the tremendous imbalances on trade and savings..."" said Aron Gampel, deputy chief economist at Scotiabank.

"Report says U.S. diplomats likely targeted in energy attack, unsure about Canadians | CBC News","A new report commissioned by the U.S. government suggests ""directed"" radio energy likely caused brain injuries to American diplomats posted in Cuba and China.",2020-12-06T21:45:51.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/us-diplomats-likely-targeted-in-energy-attack-1.5830651,"A new report commissioned by the U.S. government suggests ""directed"" radio energy likely caused brain injuries to American diplomats posted in Cuba and China.Yet the report by the National Academy of Sciences in Washington stops short of saying the same about Canadian diplomats and their families in Havana and instead leaves open the possibility of other causes.The report represents the latest attempt to explain the mysterious illness known as Havana syndrome that started causing headaches, dizziness and cognitive problems in American and Canadian diplomats in Cuba in 2016.Five Canadian diplomats and their families are now suing Ottawa for more than $28 million, saying the federal government failed to protect them, hid crucial information and downplayed the illness.Global Affairs Canada has previously acknowledged that nine adults and five children from diplomatic families developed unusual illnesses in Havana, with symptoms including nausea, dizziness, headaches and trouble concentrating.While the Canadian government has said it is trying to pinpoint the cause, speculation has largely focused on some kind of acoustic or microwave assault, an unknown contaminant such as a pesticide and even chirping crickets.The National Academy of Sciences report says the symptoms and features of what U.S. diplomats were experiencing were unlike any known disorder, ""including those with known infectious, inflammatory or toxic mechanism.""Rather, the report says, the diplomats' complaints of experiencing sudden pain, intense pressure in the face, a loud piercing sound in one ear and sudden dizziness and nausea were ""more consistent with a directed radio frequency energy attack.""WATCH | The Fifth Estate investigates what made the diplomats sick:The Fifth Estate""Studies published in the open literature more than a half century ago and over the subsequent decades by Western and Soviet sources provide circumstantial support for this possible mechanism,"" it later adds.Yet the report makes no such assertions on what happened to the Canadians. It instead leaves open the possibility that their illnesses were caused by a viral infection, exposure to a toxic chemical or some other factor.Paul Miller, the lawyer representing the Canadian diplomats suing the government, said that is because there are several errors in the report — including an assertion that the Canadians did not experience the same sudden pain and loud noise as their U.S. counterparts.""To suggest in any way that our clients did not have the perception of loud sounds or a sensation of intense pressure or vibration is just incorrect,"" Miller told The Canadian Press on Sunday. ""They all heard things to different degrees. One family heard it quite loudly and suffered pretty immediate injuries. Others heard it and felt unwell within a day or two.""If that information is corrected, you might see a different conclusion by the U.S. folks.""Miller noted that the U.S. researchers did not interview the Canadian diplomats. The report instead says it relied on a study by Halifax's Dalhousie University and available descriptions of the Canadians' symptoms and complaints.The Dalhousie study pointed to neurotoxins, such as pesticides used to kill mosquitos during the Zika epidemic, as the most likely reason. Miller's clients have disputed that finding, saying more people would have suffered the same symptoms if it were true.The U.S. report comes as the lawsuit between the Canadian diplomats and the federal government remains unresolved, with Miller hoping for a motion brought by the government to have the diplomats excluded heard by the court next year.Global Affairs Canada did not respond to requests for comment on Sunday."

That's the allegation. Retired Edmonton MP David Kilgour says that's what China is after when it executes prisoners of conscience and harvests their organs.Mr. Kilgour, along with Winnipeg human rights lawyer, David Matas, published a report on the alleged harvest in 2006. There was some outcry; there was skepticism. And not much action.Now, another researcher backs up the 2006 report with new research of his own. Ethan Gutmann believes members of Falun Gong, Uyghurs, Tibetans and Christians face the surgeon's fatal knife. And he says it's time countries like Canada take action.Ethan Gutmann documents his findings in his book, The Slaughter: Mass Killings, Organ Harvesting, and China's Secret Solution to Its Dissident Problem.

Kim Jong-un the statesman? What his China visit reveals about how he's preparing to meet Donald Trump | CBC News,"Travelling on his mysterious green armoured train, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un's diplomatic route to his planned nuclear summit with the U.S. president wound its way first through Beijing. And with good strategic reason, experts say.",2018-03-28T23:44:10.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/north-korea-china-meeting-xi-kim-donald-trump-summit-1.4597945,"Travelling on his mysterious green armoured train, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un's diplomatic route to his planned nuclear summit with the U.S. president wound its way first through Beijing. And with good strategic reason, experts say.Kim's recent days-long visit to China, his first foray outside North Korea since taking power, was a surprise — one that's more than a mere diplomatic whistle stop. The journey is seen to have strengthened his hand ahead of crucial talks by reinforcing strong ties with the economic superpower. To the probable chagrin of American diplomats, experts say, Kim was able to assure that the Middle Kingdom will have a formidable seat at the negotiating table. It also presents challenges to U.S. President Donald Trump as it shows that isolation of North Korea has not succeeded, said Adam Mount, a North Korea and nuclear specialist at the Federation of American Scientists.""Frankly, I think that Kim Jong-un outflanked the Trump administration in making it to Beijing first,"" he said. ""It impresses upon the United States that Kim has other options to gain leverage. It raises the stakes for this meeting.""A date for the Trump-Kim summit is not yet set, though it's expected to happen before May. Kim has also secured a meeting with South Korean President Moon Jae-in for late April.""I'm sure they wanted to discuss and compare notes on how to talk to Donald Trump,"" Mount said of Kim's meeting with Xi.Beijing has over the years backed United Nations sanctions against Pyongyang over its nuclear and missile tests. But Kim's handshake with Chinese President Xi Jinping, shown on the front pages of Chinese newspapers, allowed Kim to play the role of legitimate statesman, while signalling the mending of frayed relations between North Korea and its only true ally.NewsAccording to a Chinese readout of the meeting, Xi told Kim, ""We speak highly of this visit."" The readout goes on to say that Kim personally informed Xi about upcoming Korean Peninsula talks ""out of comradeship and moral responsibility."" That statement was ""stunning"" to Mount as a remarkable display of support. One possible practical result of this?""If Donald Trump walks away from the meeting with Kim first, it's more likely China would lift sanctions,"" Mount said.Former U.S. State Department official Mintaro Oba, who worked on North Korea policy in the Obama administration, believes the advancements in North Korea's nuclear program and the number of high-level talks it suddenly has on the table have girded Kim's negotiating position with China as well.""Kim Jong-un is ticking a box before doing those summit meetings. He's tightening up unity so he has as many options going into other summits as possible,"" Oba said.Oba can make out the outlines of a diplomatic roadmap in Kim's political manoeuvring. What worries him, he said, is how little preparation he sees coming from Washington, where it seems to him that an integrated plan to take full advantage of a unique tactical opportunity is being taken less seriously. ""My best guess is that the United States doesn't have any real strategy for going into this,"" Oba said. ""A harsh assessment, but I think it's the right one ... It's just not clear they've figured out how to make the most use of this summit that kind of came out of nowhere.""Key staffing positions remain unfilled in the State Department. No new secretary of state has been confirmed yet by the Senate to replace Rex Tillerson.A broad framework with reasonable deliverables might start with setting up a communication hotline, the release of Americans detained in North Korea, and offers of humanitarian aid. Scoring small wins helps take control of the public narrative.""The U.S. needs to be raising this at lower levels with the North Koreans before the summit,"" he said. The White House has often claimed its apparent lack of planning is actually about playing its cards close to the vest. ""But there's a difference between giving away your negotiating position and managing public expectations before a summit,"" Oba said.The White House has framed Kim's surprise China trip as positively as possible, taking credit for the Kim-Xi meeting as ""a good indication"" that the U.S.'s ""maximum pressure"" policy against North Korea is working. The White House says it is ""cautiously optimistic"" about the development, and that the U.S.-North Korea summit is still on.Although Kim and Xi don't have a close friendship, mutual self-interest brings them together. North Korea and China both have reason to be concerned that the Trump administration could declare war. For China, that would risk driving millions of starving North Koreans to stream over its border.That the North Korean-U.S. diplomacy is beginning, not ending, with a high-level summit between the leaders is worrisome for some experts.""It's starting off at the highest levels you can get to, a meeting between two leaders of the countries,"" said Lisa Collins, a fellow with the Korea Chair at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""Normally, it's the reverse. You would build, step by step, a consensus or agreement, then it's signed off on by the two leaders.""One positive development for the Trump administration has been recent trade concessions from South Korea, which has agreed to set limits on exports of steel and open its auto market to U.S. imports in exchange for being exempt from steel tariffs. It's a timely win, said Harry Kazianis, Director of Defense Studies at the Center for the National Interest — particularly as the U.S. and South Korea need to smooth co-ordination and co-operation ahead of the few critical months in advance of talks with North Korea.The National""There was no way the U.S. was going to push some major trade action against South Korea, considering they've got this massive geopolitical crisis,"" Kazianis said. ""And there's no way there can be any daylight between Seoul and Washington right now, to risk any major ruptures with Seoul right now.""Kazianis expects a tough bargain, with the North likely proposing an end to the U.S.-South Korean alliance, withdrawal of U.S. troops from the Korean Peninsula, full recognition of North Korea as a legitimate state, billions of dollars in economic aid, and the ending of sanctions.""If this summit goes badly, we could be back at the brink of war again,"" Kazianis said. ""The challenge to putting all our eggs in the summit basket is, if this has problems, there is no diplomatic road to go down again."""
Chinese media ignore Pope's funeral,China imposes media blackout on coverage of Pope John Paul II's funeral.,2005-04-09T00:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/chinese-media-ignore-pope-s-funeral-1.532985,"The funeral of Pope John Paul II made news around the world, but not in China. The state-controlled media blacked out all news of Friday's proceedings, with no reports or pictures. The only mention of the event concerned comments from the Chinese foreign ministry condemning Taiwan's president for going to Rome. The Vatican had tried to secure a Hong Kong visit for John Paul II in 1999, only to be rejected by Beijing. Some four million people in mainland China are members of the official church. But the Vatican says about eight million belong to the underground Catholic Church and remain loyal to the Pope. China broke diplomatic ties with the Vatican in 1951. Beijing says it won't move to establish ties until the Vatican cuts ties with Taiwan and vows not to use religion to interfere in China's internal affairs. "
"Bo Xilai, ousted Chinese politician, goes on trial","Disgraced Chinese politician Bo Xilai went on trial Thursday on charges of bribery, embezzlement and abuse of power, marking the ruling Communist Party's attempts to draw a line under one of its most lurid political scandals in decades.",2013-08-22T00:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/bo-xilai-ousted-chinese-politician-goes-on-trial-1.1347278,"Ousted populist Chinese politician Bo Xilai went on trial Thursday on charges of bribery, embezzlement and abuse of power, marking the ruling Communist Party's attempts to draw a line under one of its most lurid political scandals in decades.Bo entered the courthouse under police escort in the eastern city of Jinan, the court said, in closely choreographed proceedings held under extremely tight security, with police sealing off nearby roads with red and yellow traffic barriers and bundling some of the onlookers into a minivan.Though kept far away from the media, some of Bo's supporters gathered outside the perimeter, intermittently yelling out, ""He served the people!"" and ""He was a good cadre!""Once the powerful party boss in the megacity of Chongqing, the charismatic Bo became the most senior leader to fall from power in years after revelations emerged early last year that his wife had killed a British businessman.Bo's removal marked China's biggest upheaval in the leadership since the violent suppression of the Tiananmen Square pro-democracy protests in 1989. Bo's revival of the symbolism of Mao Zedong's radical era had unnerved China's previous leadership, although current leader Xi Jinping, installed last fall, has appeared keen to adopt his own brand of Mao-like tactics.Five of Bo's relatives attended the trial, the Jinan Intermediate People's Court said in a stream of posts on its Sina Weibo microblog, though the relatives were not identified. The postings were a rare display of openness for a high-profile political trial in China. Journalists from foreign media outlets were kept from the courtroom, but the court said 19 reporters were among the 110 people attending the trial.""All the seats are filled and all is in good order,"" the court said.The scandal was triggered last year when Bo's police chief, a top aide, fled to a U.S. consulate in a neighboring city, an event that embarrassed the party's leadership ahead of a key political transition. It would later emerge that the police chief had evidence of the Briton's murder, making the Bo family an international diplomatic liability for the leadership.Chinese authorities have released few details of the charges Bo faces, but analysts say they appear carefully calibrated to lay blame on Bo's individual actions and provide enough culpability to end his political career, while avoiding allegations that could expose the impunity with which top Chinese officials are believed to operate before they fall from favor.A person with direct knowledge of the case has said Bo is accused of accepting bribes amounting to more than 20 million yuan ($3.3 million) and embezzling 5 million yuan ($820,000) while he was posted to the eastern city of Dalian. The abuse of power allegation is related to his alleged attempts in Chongqing to block an investigation into the murder by his wife in late 2011 and his sacking of his police chief, reports say. A verdict of guilt is all but assured, because the outcome of such trials involving high-profile politicians in China are usually decided by backroom negotiations by politicians and handed down by the court. Bo's downfall also has been widely perceived as the result of his defeat in party infighting ahead of China's once-a-decade leadership transition last fall.""Bo Xilai's faction fell out of grace during the power struggle among top leaders,"" said Pu Zhiqiang, a prominent human rights lawyer based in Beijing. ""In reality, it does not matter what he is charged with ... because this is it is a political trial, which does not represent the spirit of law.""Bo's wife, Gu Kailai, confessed to killing Neil Heywood and was handed a suspended death sentence last year that will likely be commuted to life imprisonment. Bo's aide, Wang Lijun, was sentenced to 15 years' imprisonment for making his thwarted defection bid and helping Gu cover up the murder.Outside the court, one man held up a poster of Mao and said ""What I support is not Bo Xilai the individual, but his ideas on sharing wealth,"" before police pushed him away in attempts to prevent reporters from communicating with onlookers.That Bo enjoys residual popularity among some of the Chinese public underscores how effective the media-savvy politician was in portraying himself as a man of the people. He spoke often of tackling the burgeoning income inequality gap, and introduced housing and other social policies in Chongqing that made him beloved by the poor.Bo mobilized people in Chongqing to sing communist anthems, campaigns that resonated with people who've felt increasingly alienated from a party and government seen as corrupt and morally bankrupt.""Bo tapped into these ideas with the `red songs,' and invoked a certain kind of camaraderie and unity that has been missing,"" said Dali Yang, head of the University of Chicago Center in Beijing. ""He created in some way a moral universe that made people feel much more confident and hopeful in some ways, certainly in Chongqing.""Bo's Communist revival efforts had alarmed the consensus-minded elite in China's previous administration who were wary of the violent excesses of the Mao era and of any one politician gaining prominence. Nevertheless, the administration of current leader Xi has adopted hardline, Mao-like tactics including tight clampdowns on dissidents and the media and an ideological campaign urging cadres to purify themselves of corruption.Analysts have noted that none of the charges against Bo appear to involve the widespread human rights abuses alleged to have been carried out during his unfettered rule as Chongqing party chief, including during his much-publicized crackdown on the city's mafia gangs.Jinan resident Yu Ming, 46, questioned whether the trial would bring greater openness in China.""The real question are, did he not trample the law? Did he not violate human rights? We shouldn't just look at corruption alone,"" Yu said. ""What we are more concerned about is, after the Bo Xilai case is over, what direction will China go in? Will we have human rights? Will we have the right to vote?"""

The ministry is scrambling to distribute vaccines to counter the spinal disease, which has killed at least 16 people and infected more than 200 others in the past month alone. Cases of meningitis have been reported across China, with the exception of Fujian province in the southeast, Hainan in the south and Tibet. The worst hit provinces are Anhui, Henan, Hebei, Jiangsu and Sichuan. The ministry says 258 cases were reported in January alone and 546 cases since November last year. Hospitals and clinics have been ordered to step up disease prevention, surveillance and control operations in an effort to curb the spread of the outbreak. A vaccine is also to be distributed nationwide. Meningitis attacks the brain and the central nervous system. The disease is characterized by sudden onset of fever, intense headache, nausea and vomiting, stiff neck and shock, and sometimes death. "

The 14-year-old Karmapa Lama arrived in India earlier this week after a gruelling eight-day trek across the Himalayas. He left the Dalai Lama's headquarters early Sunday morning. Now he's moving to a new hiding place to escape growing media attention. The Karmapa Lama's escape from Tibet is an embarrassment for the Chinese government. It's been trying to groom the young religious leader to be loyal to China. The Karmapa Lama is the third-highest person within Tibetan Buddhism. His escape is seen as the most significant since the Dalai Lama and tens of thousands of Tibetans fled in 1959.

Chinese astronauts blast off on historic mission,"China has launched its historic space docking mission, carrying the country's first female astronaut into space.",2012-06-16T00:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/chinese-astronauts-blast-off-on-historic-mission-1.1202532,"China launched its most ambitious space mission yet on Saturday, carrying its first female astronaut and two male colleagues in an attempt to dock with an orbiting module and work on board for more than a week.The Shenzhou 9 capsule lifted off as scheduled at 6:37 p.m. local time (1237 GMT) evening from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center on the edge of the Gobi Desert. All systems functioned normally and, just over 10 minutes later, it opened its solar panels and entered orbit.Female astronaut Liu Yang, 33, and two male crew members — veteran astronaut Jing Haipeng and newcomer Liu Wang — are to dock the spacecraft with a prototype space lab launched last year in a key step toward building a permanent space station.Two of the astronauts will live and work inside the module to test its life-support systems while the third will remain in the capsule to deal with any unexpected emergencies.China is hoping to join the United States and Russia as the only countries to send independently maintained space stations into orbit. It is already one of just three nations to have launched manned spacecraft on their own.Another manned mission to the module is planned for later this year, while possible future missions could include sending a man to the moon.[IMAGEGALLERY galleryid=2572 size=small]The program is a source of enormous national pride for China, reflecting its rapid economic and technological progress and ambition to rank among the world's leading nations.At a sending off ceremony for the astronauts, the ruling Communist Party's No. 2 official, Wu Bangguo, told the crew, ""The country and people await your victorious return.""The module, called Tiangong 1, is only a prototype, and the plan is to replace it with a larger permanent space station due for completion around 2020.That station is to weigh about 60 tons, slightly smaller than NASA's Skylab of the 1970s and about one-sixth the size of the 16-nation International Space Station.China has only limited co-operation in space with other nations and its exclusion from the ISS, largely on objections from the United States, was one of the key spurs for it to pursue an independent space program 20 years ago.China first launched a man into space in 2003 followed by a two-man mission in 2005 and a three-man trip in 2008 that featured the country's first space walk.In November 2011, the unmanned Shenzhou 8 successfully docked twice with Tiangong 1 by remote control.The selection of the first female astronaut is giving the space program an additional publicity boost.""Arranging for women astronauts to fly is not only a must for the development of human spaceflight, but also the expectation of the public,"" space program spokeswoman Wu Ping said. ""This is a landmark event.""Speaking Friday, Liu Yang said: ""We won't let you down. We will work together and successfully complete this mission."""

The rim and handle of the teacup are gold rimmed. The saucer is as well. Aynsley China was a producer of English bone china in London. ""At the 1920 mark they were miles ahead of most of the companies that came after them,"" Steeves said. ""The quality was there, the patterns and just that extra detail."" Steeves said they were surprised at the bidding for the teacup, which was auctioned on its own in a single lot. ""The internet brought the world a lot closer. The winning bidder is from New York."" Steeves said the buyer spotted it online during the week and followed it to the end. While his company has sold thousands of teacups in the 15 years he's been in business, Steeves said this sale was a record for Key Auctions in the cup and saucer category.After putting a post on the company's Facebook page asking for Aynsley, Royal Albert and Paragon cups and saucers with paintings inside the cup, many have posted pictures to see if what they have in their cupboards or china cabinets are of any value. ""We've been busy,"" said Steeves of comments and pictures he's looked at over several days. ""I think we have had some success."" Steeves said it takes a lot of work and a lot of calls to find the 'diamond in the rough', but he says they may have another one. ""When you get a painted saucer and a painted interior of a cup, that puts you in the ten per cent above the rest already.""  From there he said check for the maker such as Aynsley and Royal Albert. ""You've got some cups, feel free to send some pictures along."" Steeves said everything is worth something and some are worth more than others.  Those exceptions can be found in every category. ""Once in awhile you do find it."" "

Gold is winning out.""On Tuesday, Moody's cited concerns that Portugal will not be able to meet targets to reduce its deficit  due to the ""formidable challenge"" it is facing in cutting spending.It said the country will likely follow Greece in needing a second rescue package.Portugal took a $110 billion bailout from its European partners and the International Monetary Fund earlier this year after nervous investors began charging it unsustainably steep returns on loans.The downgrade led debt markets to push Portugal's borrowing rates higher and stocks lower on Wednesday.The yield in Portugal's auction of three-month Treasury bills was 4.926 per cent — up from 4.863 per cent on the same bills in mid-June and not far from the record 4.967 per cent on June 1.The yield on Portuguese 10-year bonds surged to 13 per cent, while the Lisbon stock exchange fell three per cent with banks recording the steepest drops.Spain and Italy were dragged into the downturn, adding new momentum to Europe's sovereign debt crisis.Madrid's main stock index fell 1.2 per cent and its bond yields rose. Spain, a much bigger country, until now has managed to dodge major fallout from the continent's fiscal woes.In Italy, stocks lost 2.4 per cent on concerns that spending cuts might not be enough to bring down its high debt.The idea that the crisis might grow to engulf larger economies is a looming threat for markets. Rescuing Spain and Italy would be many times more expensive than all the bailouts the EU has paid for so far.""The increasing risk is Italy gets caught up further in the contagion, and the bond market vigilantes dictate a more abrupt pace for its adjustment,"" said Alan Ruskin, an analyst at Deutsche Bank.At the same time, China raised a key interest rate for a third time this year as it tries to cool surging inflation. The benchmark rate for one-year loans will be raised 0.25 percentage points to 6.56 per cent after inflation hit a 34-month high of 5.5 per cent in May.The Chinese cabinet's planning agency said June inflation, due to be reported next week, is likely to exceed May's level due to a jump in food costs blamed on summer floods that damaged crops."

Sadly, as you all know, Canadian efforts in this area have so far been unsuccessful."" The committee has been examining Canada's relations with China, which have plummeted to an all-time low since December 2018.Earlier Tuesday, Conservative MP Michael Chong urged Foreign Affairs Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne to adopt a more consistent approach to getting tough with China. The Conservative foreign affairs critic told Champagne during a House of Commons committee meeting Tuesday that the government needs to show Canadians how it will deal with growing Chinese intimidation of Canadians within Canada. Chong said it is inconsistent for the government to be talking tougher on China, while Canada's current ambassador, Dominic Barton, is making speeches about the need to broaden trade with the People's Republic. ""I think it needs to be a lot clearer, a lot more consistent if Canada is going to have a clear, consistent voice with respect to China on the world stage,"" said Chong. Chong sponsored a motion that won approval in the Commons last week that calls on the government to decide within 30 days whether to allow China's Huawei Technologies to supply equipment for its next generation 5G internet network. Meng is a chief executive of Huawei. Champagne replied that Canada has taken a smart and firm approach with China lately that includes speaking out against its ill treatment of pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong and of ethnic Muslim Uighurs. ""Whether it comes to the Uighurs or whether it comes to Hong Kong, I've outlined places where we're going to challenge China, places where we're going to, for example, coexist with China,"" Champagne said."

Currency war of words continues,The war of words over global exchange rates continued Wednesday as the rand dropped after South African Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan said his government was ready to weaken its currency.,2010-10-27T00:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/currency-war-of-words-continues-1.938932,"The war of words over global exchange rates continued Wednesday as the rand dropped after South African Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan said his government was ready to weaken its currency.Gordhan said South Africa will build up foreign reserves from higher-than-expected revenue to build foreign reserves.Reserves can be used to buy other currencies to temporarily weaken a country's exchange rate.The rand slid as much as 1.9 per cent to 7.0851 against the U.S. dollar.The decline came on a day when the greenback rose against most currencies amid speculation that moves by the U.S. Federal Reserve to increase the American money supply might not be on as large a scale as previously thought.Earlier, Bank of Korea Governor Kim Choong Soo described closer controls over the flow of money in and out of his country as potentially ""useful.""Afterward, South Korea's won declined one per cent to 1,128.24 to the U.S. dollar. And in Shanghai, Chinese Trade Minister Chen Deming said out-of-control printing of the U.S. dollar is forcing inflation on China, pushing up prices for commodities and labor.The U.S. has been pressuring Beijing to end its practice of pegging the yuan to the greenback in order to ease the American trade deficit with China.The rhetoric came just three days after G20 finance ministers ended their meeting in Seoul with an agreement not to engage in competitive devaluations of their currencies as a move to stimulate their economies."
Adrian Dix says PHSA must 'do better' after whistleblowers allege misspending | CBC News,"A review of spending at the Public Health Services Authority of B.C. has made several recommendations, including that an independent advisor look into a “problematic purchase” of personal protective equipment among other concerns.",2020-12-04T23:16:01.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/phsa-spending-review-1.5829414,"Health Minister Adrian Dix said he expects the Provincial Health Services Authority and its president and CEO ""to do better"" following allegations of misspending.""We're not happy,"" Dix said in a phone interview. ""It's [president and CEO Benoit Morin's] job and PHSA's job to do better and to follow the recommendations. And I expect that they will.""A review of spending at the PHSA has made several recommendations, including an independent adviser to look into a ""problematic purchase"" of personal protective equipment.Dix ordered an immediate review of alleged misspending by the authority after CBC News brought forward concerns raised by multiple sources.The whistleblowers accused the authority of squandering $7 million on the purchase of unusable face masks from China, hundreds of thousands of dollars on unnecessary renovations to executive offices and tens of thousands of dollars on high-end catered meals for executives and their staff.""We needed ... to clear these issues up so the PHSA can make improvements and then move on from this,"" Dix said.""It's critical that an agency this important have public credibility.""Dix said in the statement he had accepted recommendations from the deputy minister of health, including:Dix also said a third-party adviser would be hired to probe concerns about how the authority handled the ""problematic purchase"" of personal protective equipment ""to help restore public confidence in the PHSA and its leadership.""""We're in a legal process now to seek legal remedies for that purchase,"" Dix said Friday. ""We'll see how that goes.""Friday's recommendations also called on the authority to clarify by January Morin's role in all aspects of the transaction involving Luminaire, a health-care product distributor.Dix said PHSA staff, current and former, are ""absolutely"" assured they can speak freely to Ernst and Young advisor John Bethel, who is overseeing the review, without fear of retaliation. He added this applies even if they believe their severance agreement precludes them from doing so.The PHSA, in a statement, said little in reaction to Friday's announcement.""We have been and continue to be fully supportive of the review and we now welcome the recommendations as an opportunity to ensure public confidence in PHSA and its leadershipThe authority also said it welcomed the review into the mask purchase but cannot comment further at this time.""PHSA is home to extraordinary people, doing remarkable life-changing and life-saving work. We will continue to support them in serving the citizens of British Columbia,"" the statement continued.The whistleblowers said the problems began with the hiring of new president and CEO Morin in February.In addition to the misspending allegations, they told CBC several key senior executives who oversaw spending at the authority are no longer employed there. Dix, on Friday, confirmed the direction to the authority not to change senior executive leadership was motivated by the departure of these financial watchdogs.He said it was implied they were let go for raising concerns about what was happening at the authority and there was a need to ""clear the air.""In addition, Dix ordered the authority to eliminate the position of chief of staff. He said the position is inconsistent with what other health authorities are doing.The chief of staff, he added, is already serving as vice-president of human resources and will continue to hold that position.As for the renovations of executive offices, Dix said they were ""clearly poorly timed at the very least.""CBC Vancouver's Impact Team investigates and reports on stories that impact people in their local community and strives to hold individuals, institutions and organizations to account. If you have a story for us, email impact@cbc.ca. "
COVID-19 exacerbated violence against women.

What we want to see going into 2021 is core funding for frontline organizations that are doing the work ... to not have to worry about piecing together project funding or having to do fundraising events and bake sales.""A CBC investigation launched just days before the pandemic upended Canadian life found that women and children who were victims of domestic violence were turned away from shelters in Canada almost 19,000 times a month. And a national survey found that during the height of the COVID-19 lockdown in Canada gender-based violence was more severe and more frequent, with abusers' tactics become more violent, and frequently deadly.MacDougall said the pandemic has robbed women of many resources that allowed them to exercise independence and power — income, childcare, and a public identity — all while increasing domestic burdens like elder care and housework.""We've been turning back the dial on gender equity. Women were already doing the bulk of the child rearing and the house care, and it's complicated by the work from home context,"" said MacDougall.""For anybody who is experiencing violence in a relationship, that has intensified that.""MacDougall said what has been remarkable for the past months, is that women have still found ways to remove themselves and their children from violent relationships.""That has been extraordinary, in what has been a time of a lot of precarity and fear ... women are leaving,"" she said.She said early in the pandemic she spoke with advocates in China, who said it was critical to ensure resources were available, and could be accessed even in lockdown.Canada's minister for women and gender equality Maryam Monsef said early in the pandemic that the COVID-19 crisis had empowered perpetrators of domestic violence, citing a 20 to 30 per cent increase in rates of gender-based violence in some parts of Canada.In March the federal government pledged $50 million to assist women's shelters, sexual assault centres and similar facilities in Indigenous communities throughout the crisis.But a recent report from Women's Shelters Canada has called for more funding — saying many organizations have had to raise their own funds to cover shelter staff salaries, which aren't high enough to retain staff to begin with.MacDougall said that organizations have been nimble in the face of the crisis, but the need to maintain physical distancing has forced them to pare back already limited services, like those offered to women in Vancouver's downtown eastside.A recently-circulated video, which appears to show a man having sex with a woman on a sidewalk near the busy intersection of Main and Hastings streets in broad daylight as people pass by, has reignited debates around women's safety in the area.And news that RCMP are now charging the common-law spouse of the man responsible for killing 22 people in April's mass shooting in Nova Scotia — who also had a long record of domestic violence — has triggered conversations around the role played by police and the criminal justice system in cases involving intimate partner violence.""This is a difficult conversation to have because we always want to believe that police are a part of a woman's safety plan,"" said MacDougall.""As we move through Dec. 6 and into 2021, this is a really good time for us to have in a very important [discussion] about the role of policing in gender-based violence and the extent to which police are a remedy or are a safety mechanism for victims."""

He last updated his microblog on Feb. 19.Mao has also become a potent symbol for leftists within the Communist Party who feel that three decades of market-based reform have gone too far, creating social inequalities like a yawning rich-poor gap and pervasive corruption.However, the decision to investigate Bi has generated much anger on the internet, with many people saying he should not be rebuked. On one Weibo poll, 80 per cent of respondents said Bi should not apologize.""Criticizing Mao in private is something that can still be hyped up? It's been done in public not only overseas but also in China,"" wrote prominent liberal economist Mao Yushi on his microblog.The Global Times, a tabloid published by the Communist Party's official People's Daily, said Bi, 56, was known for hosting a CCTV talent show. He has also hosted CCTV's Chinese New Year's special since 2011.The network is viewed by the government as an enormously influential and useful propaganda tool abroad, and at home where authorities keep a tight rein on domestic media.However, CCTV has faced allegations of corruption, and its staid format and repetitive programming means it has struggled to win over a younger audience which can easily access online racier content from Hong Kong, Taiwan, South Korea and the United States."

It kept language that member countries ""will continue to explore policy options,"" adding that they would be ""tailored to country circumstances.""The G20 nations also maintained their previous pledges to consult closely on exchange rates.""We reaffirm our previous exchange rate commitments, including that we will refrain from competitive devaluation and we will not target our exchange rates for competitive purposes. We will resist all forms of protectionism,"" they said.The G20 gathering, the highlight of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank spring meetings in Washington, came amid growing pressure on richer nations to boost infrastructure spending, deregulate industries and spur employment.Earlier this week the IMF cut its 2016 growth forecast for the world economy, the fourth such move in less than a year.The meetings this week also coincided with weakness in a number of key commodity-based economies, particularly Brazil, which is enduring its worst recession in decades.After release of the so-called ""Panama Papers"" earlier this month stirred up controversy over global elites' widespread use of off-shore tax havens to shield their wealth, the G20 officials strengthened their pledge to implement measures to combat exploitation of tax law mismatches and improve tax information sharing.They said ""defensive measures will be considered by G20 members against non-cooperative jurisdictions"" if progress towards these goals is not made."

It was designed to kill the American economy.""""To protect American workers, I withdrew the United States from the unfair and one-sided Paris climate accord, a very unfair act for the United States,"" Trump said in a video statement from the White House to the Group of 20 virtual summit hosted by Saudi Arabia. His comments came during a discussion among the world's largest economies on safeguarding the Earth.Trump, who has worked to undo most of Barack Obama's efforts to fight climate change when he was U.S. president, said that since withdrawing from the climate agreement, the U.S. has reduced carbon emissions more than any nation.That is true, but not that remarkable. With its giant economy, the U.S. has far more raw emissions of climate-damaging carbon dioxide to cut than any other country except China.A more telling measure of progress in various countries is to look at what percentage of emissions a country has cut. Since 2005, the U.S. hasn't been even in the top 10 in percentage of greenhouse gas emission reductions.More than 180 nations have ratified the accord, which aims to keep the increase in average temperatures worldwide ""well below"" 2 C and ideally no more than 1.5 C, compared with pre-industrial levels. Scientists say that any rise beyond 2 C could have a devastating impact on large parts of the world, raising sea levels, stoking tropical storms and worsening droughts and floods.The U.S. formally exited the Paris pact on Nov. 4. On Saturday, it formally left the Open Skies Treaty, which permits 30-plus nations to conduct unarmed observation flights over each other's territory. Those overflights were set up decades ago to promote trust and avert conflict.The administration said it wanted out of the treaty because Russia was violating the pact, and imagery collected during the flights can be obtained quickly at less cost from U.S. or commercial satellites.During the discussions at the climate session, President Xi Jinping of China, the world's largest emitter, said the G20 should continue to take the lead in tackling climate change and push for the full implementation of the Paris accord.""Not long ago, I announced China's initiative to scale up its nationally determined contributions and strive to peak carbon dioxide emissions by 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2060,"" he said. ""China will honour its commitment and see the implementation through.""India's prime minister, Narendra Modi, said that ""climate change must be fought not in silos, but in an integrated, comprehensive and holistic way."""

That could help stimulate demand for metals, a key export from Canada to China.There seemed little to account for the continued rise in oil prices but last week's news about the slowdown in oil production.However, a report from Bloomberg said that money has continued to pour into oil stocks and oil plays despite the drop in prices that took WTI from over $100 US to less than $50 last month.Investors have few alternatives as stock prices are back near their peaks. Many hedge funds and private equity investors are snapping up energy stocks because they've been beaten down by the market. Oil firms attempting to recapitalize to get through the downturn are having less trouble than expected finding investors.The TSX was up 52 points at 15412.The Dow rose 208 points or 1.2 per cent to 18034 and the S&P 500 was up 19 points at 2100.There have been dire reports in the past two weeks about a dismal earnings season for U.S. companies, with profits set to decline in a dismal first quarter.But some results that came in today defied those expectations. Financial institution Morgan Stanley saw its net income rise by 60 per cents to $2.3 billion US.However, Halliburton, the oilfield services company, saw a net loss of $643 million, or 76 cents a share as drilling declined. "

He set another world record in 2005, and won at the world championships in 2007.The Shanghai native hasn't competed since withdrawing at the London Olympics in 2012 after rupturing his Achilles tendon.He pulled out of the 2008 Beijing Games with a similar injury, and years of treatment have apparently failed to fix the problem.Given his experiences at the Beijing and London Games, Chinese sports officials said Liu would not return to competition before making a full recovery. However, Achilles injuries are difficult to heal, and many sprinters never return to their previous best.In his statement, Liu said he hoped to recover after London, but ""my foot told me no again and again, and there was no way it was going to be able to handle intense training and competition.""I hate my foot, I love my track and my hurdle so much, and if I hadn't injured my foot ... but then there are no 'ifs' in this world, I injured myself, and can only accept it silently.""Over his career, he became one of China's highest-earning sports stars, joining the elite ranks of former NBA star Yao Ming and tennis champion Li Na.Liu's plans to retire had been long expected, and were reported by a Shanghai newspaper last week.Regarding his future, Liu, who began hurdling at age 13, said he planned to ""begin a new journey"" by completing his education, and hoped to contribute to Chinese sports development, and increase China's international influence in the athletics world.Liu had already announced he did not expect to compete at the world championships in Beijing in August, although he said he hoped to ""take part in the event in another role."" Last month, he appeared at a promotional event for the competition but left without speaking to the media."

Those were an effort to make their mark on the lunar surface after their manned moon program failed.When Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin made their historic landing on the moon in July 1969, a secret Russian robotic probe called Luna 15 was there at the same time. It was an attempt to grab a sample of lunar soil and return it to Earth before the American astronauts got back. The Russians had lost the race to put humans on the moon, but were trying to grab a 'first' and master the moon robotically.Unfortunately, Luna 15 crashed during it's landing attempt and the opportunity for a propaganda coup was lost. However, their Luna 16 mission did successfully return about 100 grams of lunar soil a year later and two other sample return missions succeeded in following years, with the last one, Luna 24, in 1976 — two years after the Apollo program had ended. While these robotic sample return missions did not deliver as much lunar material as the Apollo astronauts, they were considerably cheaper and part of a long history of both Russian and American robotic lunar exploration involving dozens of impactors, orbiters, landers and rovers. In a way, we're in another moon race right now that echoes the race of fifty years ago — except this time it seems the robots might be in the lead. China is using robotic landers to explore the moon, and, if all goes well, Chang'e 5 will bring back several kilograms of moon rocks. In the meantime, the U.S. is struggling to develop a far more expensive effort, relying on huge (and much delayed) rockets that will carry humans to the moon with their Artemis program. It once again brings up the question of whether humans or robots are best suited to space exploration. We debated this on a special edition of Quirks & Quarks last year.Human missions are much more expensive, and historically they are much more politically driven than robotic exploration. The decision by the Kennedy administration in 1961 to send humans to the moon was part of the Cold War competition between the U.S. and Soviet Union to prove technical superiority over one another. The current Artemis program has also been politically influenced. Originally the plan was to first build a space station called Gateway in orbit around the moon. Once it was completed, astronauts would be sent down to the surface some time later this decade. When the Trump administration came to power, the landing was pushed forward to 2024, which would have been the last year of President Trump's second term in office. The Biden administration has not said whether it will keep to that tight schedule.NASA's giant new moon rocket, the Space Launch System (SLS) is slated to make its first flight next year. In the meantime three private companies — SpaceX, Blue Origin and Dynetics — have been contracted to develop lunar landers that would ride on their own rockets. But the pace of development in these programs makes NASA's current 2024 moon landing deadline pretty ambitious.Meanwhile, China is continuing its robotic program beyond the moon with the Tianwen 1 mission currently on its way to Mars. The spacecraft includes an orbiter and a lander, which will make China the third country to make a soft landing on Mars after Russia and the U.S. This is not a sample return mission, but it is not unreasonable to think that China could apply similar technology it is using on the moon to return samples from Mars in the future.Robots have always boldly gone where no one has gone before, exploring every planet in the solar system, as well as dwarf planets, moons, asteroids and comets. They conduct the initial reconnaissance of other worlds, survey the lay of the land and choose the best landing sites for humans who follow.  A whole fleet of robots are currently flying around the solar system. Two others are on their way to Mars with the United Arab Emirates' Hope mission and NASA's Perseverance lander scheduled to arrive in February.Beyond Mars, the Japanese Hayabusa2 and American, OSIRIS-REx spacecraft are bringing home samples they collected from asteroids. NASA is planning future missions to visit Europa, a moon of Jupiter and Titan, a mysterious moon of Saturn, the only moon with a thick atmosphere and liquid methane lakes on its surface.There is no doubt it will be a dramatic moment when the next human feet step out onto lunar soil again. Human exploration of space captures the imagination of the public, provides role models for young people and tests the limits of technical, physical and psychological endurance. But humans have not gone very far. The last mission to the moon was in 1972. It will still stretch the limits of our technology to get back there almost half a century later, Meanwhile, the true explorers of space, our silent mechanical servants, will continue their more far-reaching journeys to literally reach out and touch other worlds."

"Oil at $56, loonie at 82 cents as U.S. oil output slows",The Canadian dollar soared above 82 cents US and oil resumed its climb after an OPEC report predicted the boom in U.S. oil production will end later this year.,2015-04-16T00:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/canadian-dollar-at-82-cents-us-as-oil-surges-for-a-2nd-day-1.3036201,"The Canadian dollar soared above 82 cents US and oil resumed its climb after an OPEC report predicted the boom in U.S. oil production will end later this year.The loonie closed at 82.04 US cents, up by two thirds a cent on Thursday, after a jump of nearly two cents on Wednesday.The dollar rose on strengthening oil prices. West Texas Intermediate crude, traded in New York, rose to $56.51 US a barrel, up six per cent on the year. It jumped above $57 earlier in the day.Brent crude, the most common international crude contract, was also at its highest point of the year, at $63.83 US a barrel, up 53 cents today.Oil has been rising for the past two days as data comes in showing a slowdown in production in U.S. oil fields.This morning the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries issued its predictions for global crude production, saying U.S. oil supplies would grow to about 13.65 million barrels a day in the second quarter of 2015 and then decline in the second half of the year.OPEC said the fall in oil prices from over $100 last year to less than $50 last month has begun to curb U.S. output, pointing to the decline in the number of oil rigs in production.Several key energy forecasters have pointed to weakening U.S. output, including the Energy Information Administration which forecast a drop total crude-oil production from seven key U.S. production regions in May.On Wednesday, the International Energy Agency, also forecast a slowdown later in the year.Currency trader Rahim Madhavji of Knightsbridge FX said oil's rise and a more optimistic outlook from the Bank of Canada helped push the Canadian dollar higher.""The flight of the Canadian dollar rests on [Bank of Canada governor Stephen] Poloz's more optimistic view and is fueled by rising oil prices.  A Canadian dollar rally could start if we get more of the same verbage from Poloz and stronger Canadian economic data,"" he wrote in a note to investors.OPEC said demand for its own crude would rise slightly to about 29.3 million barrels a day in 2015, forecasting an increase in demand from China and the EU.But it's currently pumping about 30.2 million barrels in what critics see as an effort to retain its own market share in the face of U.S. production that has doubled since 2008. The report confirmed its output surged by 810,000 barrels a day in March, even as oil prices tanked.In more news that could lead to less output, a tribal group made up of former Al Qaeda militants took control of a major southern oil terminal in Yemen on Thursday.The terminal is one of the major hubs for the Hadramout region which exports 120,000 to 140,000 barrels per day of crude."

"Strong typhoon leaves 42 dead, 20 missing in Philippines | CBC News","Thick mud and debris coated many villages around Manila on Friday after a typhoon killed at least 42 people and caused extensive flooding that sent people fleeing to their roofs, officials said.",2020-11-13T21:54:47.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/philippines-typhoon-1.5801705,"Thick mud and debris coated many villages around Manila on Friday after a typhoon killed at least 42 people and caused extensive flooding that sent people fleeing to their roofs, officials said.Troops, police, coast guard and disaster-response teams rescued tens of thousands of people, including many who flooded radio and TV networks and social media with desperate pleas for help.Floodwaters receded and the weather cleared in many areas after Typhoon Vamco blew out into the South China Sea on Friday, but the military said it was still rescuing people trapped in some flooded communities.Amphibious assault vehicles usually used in counter-insurgency operations were deployed for the rescue work, military chief of staff Gen. Gilbert Gapay said in a meeting with disaster-response officials.""We'll continue to look for the missing, help in damage assessment,"" Gapay said.The national police reported that the death toll had risen to at least 42 with 20 missing. The government's main disaster-response agency, which waits for provincial reports and follows a laborious process of verifying casualties, reported a much lower death count, causing confusion.Among the dead were at least 12 villagers who were dug out from mud and rockslides in the northern provinces of Cagayan and Nueva Vizcaya, police said.After slamming into northeastern Quezon province, Vamco gained strength with sustained winds of 155 km/h and gusts of up to 255 km/h. It blew north of metropolitan Manila overnight Wednesday, toppling trees and power poles, swelling rivers, flooding residential communities and setting off landslides and storm surges.In hard-hit Marikina city in the capital region and the towns of Rodriguez and Cainta in nearby Rizal province, several villages were inundated by water that reached the second and third floors of many houses, prompting hundreds of residents to flee to their roofs and call TV and radio networks or post desperate messages on social media. The panic was exacerbated by widespread power outages and loss of internet access.Videos of Marikina showed a thick coat of muddy water covering roads and staining houses and cars. Residents carried appliances and furniture from their homes and used pails and shovels to remove the mud after the water receded.In a televised meeting of Cabinet and disaster-response officials Friday, a reporter asked where President Rodrigo Duterte was, prompting an annoyed response from his spokesperson.""The president's whereabouts should not be asked. That's foolishness coming from the opposition. The president is not missing. He is always with us,"" Harry Roque said, without offering any further details.<a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/RedCross?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#RedCross</a> Laguna Chapter helping residents of flooded areas in Sta.

Government offices were closed and most classes were suspended Friday.Vamco hit the Philippines on the heels of Typhoon Goni, one of the strongest typhoons in the world this year, which left more than 30 people dead or missing and damaged or destroyed 270,000 houses. Tens of thousands of people were still displaced when Vamco hit.The Philippines is hit by about 20 typhoons and tropical storms each year and also has active seismic faults and volcanoes, making it one of the world's most disaster-prone countries."
"Growth investing needed as pandemic wanes, says former BoC governor David Dodge | CBC News",Former Bank of Canada governor David Dodge says Canada must shift its attention to investing for economic growth as the world recovers from the COVID-19 pandemic downturn over the next few years.,2020-11-27T21:25:54.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/bank-of-canada-david-dodge-covid-19-lake-louise-1.5819647,"Former Bank of Canada governor David Dodge says Canada must shift its attention to investing for economic growth as the world recovers from the COVID-19 pandemic downturn over the next few years.In an online presentation at the virtual Bennett Jones Lake Louise World Cup Business Forum, the former central bank chief said Canadian governments and businesses will have to continue to borrow money in 2021 and 2022.But he added borrowing of $400 billion to date this year for the federal government and $100 billion for the provinces — about 20 per cent of Canadian GDP — should be reduced going forward and directed to growth areas rather than ""consumption,"" as has been the case to date.The business forum is normally held in Lake Louise, Alta., in conjunction with World Cup alpine ski races, but both the races and the in-person conference were called off this year because of the pandemic.Dodge says he's expecting about 3.9 per cent economic growth in Canada in 2021, assuming vaccines are widely available after the second quarter, and 1.9 per cent in 2022.He says the pace of growth should return to 2019 levels by the spring of 2022, but national output will still be three per cent lower than it would have been without COVID-19.Dodge said a key challenge for Canada going forward is to continue to develop its technology expertise to compete with the growing influence of China.""COVID has accelerated the transformation to a truly digital world and to Asia as it's epicentre,"" he said.""Canada can thrive in this world as long as Canadian businesses, workers and governments work together and focus on investing in the future, not in preserving the past."""
Fed signals interest rate hike firmly on the table for June,"The U.S. Federal Reserve will likely raise interest rates in June if economic data points to stronger second-quarter growth as well as firming inflation and employment, according to minutes from the U.S. central bank's April policy meeting released on Wednesday.",2016-05-18T00:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/federal-reserve-june-interest-rate-1.3587906,"The U.S.  Federal Reserve will likely raise interest rates in June if economic data points to stronger second-quarter growth as well as firming inflation and employment, according to minutes from the U.S. central bank's April policy meeting released on Wednesday.That view, expressed by most Fed policymakers at the last policy meeting, suggests the central bank is much closer to lifting rates again than Wall Street expects.In the wake of the news, the Canadian dollar sold off sharply against the U.S greenback. The loonie dropped 0.71 of a U.S. cent to close at 76.79 cents US. Prices for futures contracts on the Fed's benchmark overnight lending rate on Wednesday implied that investors only saw a 19 per cent chance of a rate increase next month.But members of the Fed's policy-setting committee said recent economic data made them more confident inflation was rising toward their two per cent target and that they were less concerned about a global economic slowdown, according to the minutes from the April 26-27 meeting.""Most participants judged that if incoming data were consistent with economic growth picking up in the second quarter, labor markets continued to strengthen, and inflation making progress toward the committee's two per cent objective, then it likely would be appropriate for the committee to increase the target range for the federal funds rate in June,"" according to the minutes.Some policymakers were wary about a slowdown in U.S. economic growth during the first quarter, when gross domestic product expanded at a two-year low of 0.5 per cent. But others argued that ongoing robust job growth suggested the economy was still on track and the growth data could be flawed.""Most pointed to the steady improvement in the labor market as an indicator that the underlying pace of economic activity had likely not deteriorated,"" according to the minutes.Some policymakers said they were concerned financial markets could be roiled by a possible British exit from the European Union in a vote next month or by China's exchange rate policies.At its April meeting, the Fed kept its target overnight interest rate in a range of 0.25 per cent to 0.50 per cent. The Fed hiked rates in December for the first time in nearly a decade.A global equities sell-off and the tightening of financial markets earlier this year largely due to concerns of a slowdown in China prompted the Fed in March to dial back rate hike expectations for the year.Even so, the Fed signaled at that time that it would likely increase rates twice this year. Investors have been betting on just one hike.""June is definitely a 'live' meeting for the next rate hike, but a super-cautious [Fed chair Janet] Yellen might well wait for more convincing evidence of a sustained pickup in the economy and a resolution of Brexit risks before pulling the trigger in July,"" said BMO Capital Markets senior economist Sal Guatieri. ""We still lean toward the latter."""

But human rights and pro-democracy advocates say Beijing's new national security law is undermining freedom in what is known as the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.""So if the Canadian side really cares about the stability and the prosperity in Hong Kong, and really cares about the good health and safety of those 300,000 Canadian passport holders in Hong Kong, and the large number of Canadian companies operating in Hong Kong SAR, you should support those efforts to fight violent crimes,"" Cong said.Cong also flatly rejected Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's assertion that China is engaging in coercive diplomacy by imprisoning two Canadian men in retaliation for the arrest of a Chinese high-tech executive on an American extradition warrant. Meng Wanzhou is living under house arrest in Vancouver while her case wends through a British Columbia court.In December 2018, China imprisoned Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor and charged them with undermining the country's national security. Cong said they are still undergoing a legal process in China but did not provide further details.He repeated his government's demand that Canada release Meng immediately but insisted her case and his government's prosecution of Kovrig and Spavor are not linked.""We will remain absolutely committed to working with our allies to ensure that China's approach of coercive diplomacy, its arbitrary detention of two Canadian citizens, alongside other citizens of other countries around the world, is not viewed as a successful tactic by them,"" Trudeau said earlier this week as the two countries marked 50 years of relations at one of the lowest points in Canada-China bilateral relations.Cong said Canada's efforts to get other countries to join its fight for Kovrig and Spavor is ""doomed to fail.""The European Union raised concerns about the two Canadians by name in the communique summarizing its recent summit with China.""We oppose any remarks that interfere in our internal affairs. And I would like to point out, there is no coercive diplomacy on the Chinese side,"" Cong said."

""People are taking some profits off of the larger run-up from the low.""A major catalyst for the gloom was weak trade data out of China, that showed exports plunged an alarming 25 per cent in February compared to the same time last year.

Metal prices fell throughout 2015 as commodity markets were hammered by fears that China's growth would slow.  In other sectors there was much better news:The value of the Canadian dollar played a big role in some of the gains. The low loonie makes Canadian products cheaper.The depreciation of the Canadian dollar contributed to higher motor vehicle sales in 2015, as vehicles bound for the U.S. were priced in US dollars. A shift in the Ontario auto industry to making higher-priced vehicles also contributed to the increase.The figures show manufacturing growth is shifting to provinces such as Ontario and Quebec, while Alberta sales fell.For December, overall manufacturing sales were up 1.2 per cent to $51.6 billion."
Hong Kong journalists knew press freedom was on the wane. Jimmy Lai's arrest confirmed it | CBC News,"For those like me who grew up in Hong Kong and worked in journalism, press freedom was always something we knew would be a luxury once the former British colony reverted to Chinese rule in 1997, but the arrest of media tycoon Jimmy Lai this week laid any doubts to rest.",2020-08-14T08:00:16.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/opinion/point-of-view-hong-kong-1.5685504,"Last Sunday night, just before 9 p.m. ET, my phone exploded with breaking news alerts and private messages on every possible app in both Chinese and English. The predominant headline: media tycoon Jimmy Lai, the publisher of Apple Daily, a Hong Kong tabloid that supports the pro-democracy movement, was arrested by police for ""colluding with foreign forces.""It was the highest-profile arrest since the implementation of Hong Kong's new national security law, which democracy advocates feared would be used to suppress criticism of China.My heart sank as I watched a live feed of police officers marching into the Apple Daily headquarters. My first reaction was to get in touch with one of my closest friends, a senior editor at the newspaper to check if she was OK. She responded instantly, saying she had been stopped and searched at the entrance of the building but was allowed to leave.""It's sooner than I expected,"" she said of the police action she and her colleagues had been anticipating. For those like me who grew up in the former British colony and studied journalism, press freedom was always something we knew would be a luxury once Britain handed sovereignty over Hong Kong back to China in 1997.Three years later, I was a junior editor for a Chinese-language online publication, and one of the first things I learned was how careful we needed to be in reporting any stories that related to Taiwan, which under Beijing's One China policy was not considered a sovereign state. Any missteps, including using images of the Taiwanese flag in news stories, would get an earful from the bosses.That was just one of the ways in which self-censorship manifested in Hong Kong media in the early years of Chinese rule. For the most part, life went along as usual for a while as long as you did not step into the red zone.Some local journalists would test the limits of what their employers, most of whom were pro-Beijing, would tolerate by intentionally breaking the rules.The presence of ex-patriate journalists. who were used to greater editorial independence, also gave local reporters some wiggle room. That was one of the reasons I chose English-language reporting as my major while studying at the Chinese University of Hong Kong — to give myself some more options, just in case. I went as far as formally becoming a ""foreigner"" in my hometown and making a declaration to the Immigration Department of Hong Kong to proclaim my Canadian nationality as China does not recognize dual nationality.In 2002, I decided to come back to Canada, where my parents had immigrated in the 1990s, partly because of my underlying worry of the uncertainty ahead in the news industry as I watched more of my colleagues leave and partly because I got a job offer from a Chinese cable TV station in Toronto.Over the years, many of my friends and former colleagues have left the media because of the increasing self-censorship. Roughly less than 10 per cent of my journalism class are working journalists today. And those who stay in the industry know that their days could be numbered.The relationship between Hong Kong police and the media has been worsening since the pro-democracy movement against China's increasing encroachment on Hong Kong affairs gained steam last summer.In one of the daily press briefings by police last September, journalists put on gas masks and protective gear to protest the earlier use of pepper spray on them, although the police said they had been just trying to disperse the protesters behind the reporters. Despite the growing tensions, some have been holding on to a slim hope that press freedom will still be respected given that Hong Kong is known to be the Asian hub for international press. Yet that fragile belief has been put to the test and constantly challenged in the past 14 months. Journalists have been injured or obstructed by police while covering the prolonged political unrest in the city.Foreign or ex-pat journalists have not been immune. During the anti-government protests last year, tense moments between the media and the police were not uncommon. Sky News correspondent Alex Crawford got an angry reaction at a protest last September when she confronted a riot police officer who was questioning another member of the press nearby.Freelance photographer May James for Hong Kong Free Press, an English-language online publication, was arrested in October and released without charges later. And there are emerging signs of increasing challenges in getting work visas. Last month, the New York Times announced it would move a third of its staff from Hong Kong to Seoul. The move came after the paper's veteran China correspondent, Chris Buckley, was denied a work permit by Hong Kong authorities.There have also been rising concerns over visa delays. The Foreign Correspondents' Club in Hong Kong issued an open letter this week to the director of immigration, Au Ka-wang, questioning if ""a new procedure may have been established for processing visas for foreign media in Hong Kong.""The same organization also characterized Lai's arrest and the raiding of his paper's offices as ""a direct assault on Hong Kong's press freedom""' that signals ""a dark new phase.""WATCH | CBC Adrienne Arsenault interviewed Lai earlier this month:The NationalFor journalists who have been living through the erosion of press freedoms in recent years, the images of police officers raiding a newsroom with a pro-democracy stance were simply the final nail in the coffin. Lai's arrest and the raid at Apple Daily have highlighted the chilling impact of the national security law that could affect the 300,000 Canadians living in the city as well as those of us who are watching closely from afar as the law contains provisions that apply not only to  Hong Kong permanent residents and organizations and companies set up in Hong Kong, but also to  ""a person who is not a permanent resident of the Region"" and apply even when an offence is committed outside the city.Meanwhile, I am just hoping my Canadian passport can provide enough of a safeguard for me to continue reporting news related to my hometown — no matter where I am. "
Taiwan scrambles fighters as Chinese jets again fly near island | CBC News,"Taiwan's air force scrambled jets for a second consecutive day on Saturday as multiple Chinese aircraft approached the island and crossed the sensitive midline of the Taiwan Strait, with the island's government urging Beijing to ""pull back from the edge.""",2020-09-19T09:08:01.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/china-taiwan-fighter-jets-1.5731034,"Taiwan's air force scrambled jets for a second consecutive day on Saturday as multiple Chinese aircraft approached the island and crossed the sensitive midline of the Taiwan Strait, with the island's government urging Beijing to ""pull back from the edge.""Taiwan's defence ministry said 19 Chinese aircraft were involved, one more than in the previous day, with some crossing the Taiwan Strait midline and others flying into Taiwan's air defence identification zone off its southwest coast.It said China, which claims democratic Taiwan as its own territory, sent 12 J-16 fighters, two J-10 fighters, two J-11 fighters, two H-6 bombers and one Y-8 anti-submarine aircraft. According to a map the ministry provided, none got close to mainland Taiwan itself or flew over it.""ROCAF scrambled fighters, and deployed air defence missile system to monitor the activities,"" the ministry said in a tweet, referring to the Republic of China Air Force, the formal name of Taiwan's air force.Taiwan has complained of repeated incidents of Chinese aircraft near the island this year, and has regularly had to scramble its F-16s and other jets to intercept them.China had on Friday announced at a news conference in Beijing about China's UN peacekeeping efforts combat drills near the Taiwan Strait, and denounced what it called collusion between the island and the United States.U.S. Undersecretary for Economic Affairs Keith Krach arrived in Taipei on Thursday for a three-day visit, the most senior State Department official to come to Taiwan in four decades, angering China. He left Saturday afternoon, according to Taiwan's foreign ministry.Taiwan's defence ministry, in a separate statement, said China was carrying out provocative activities, seriously damaging peace and stability.""The defence ministry sternly condemns this, and calls on the mainland authorities to control themselves and pull back from the edge.""China's widely read state-backed tabloid the Global Times, published by the ruling Communist Party's official People's Daily, said in a Saturday editorial that Friday's drills were a rehearsal to take over Taiwan.""The U.S. and Taiwan must not misjudge the situation, or believe the exercise is a bluff. Should they continue to make provocations, a war will inevitably break out,"" it said.Both sides need to resume dialogue to reduce the risk of war, Johnny Chiang, leader of Taiwan's main opposition party the Kuomintang, wrote on his Facebook page.""People who are willing to play a communication role are stigmatized and people who clamour for war are regarded as heroes. Such an atmosphere is definitely not conducive to the peaceful and stable development of the Taiwan Strait,"" said Chiang, whose party traditionally favours close ties with China.Life has continued as normal in Taiwan with no sign of panic. The island has long been accustomed to living with Chinese threats.Taiwan's people have shown no interest in being ruled by autocratic China, re-electing President Tsai Ing-wen in a landslide last year on what was largely a platform of standing up to Beijing.The latest Chinese flights came the same day Taiwan held a memorial service for former president Lee Teng-hui, dubbed ""Mr. Democracy"" for ending autocratic rule in favour of free elections and championing Taiwan's separate identity from China.Lee, who died in July, became Taiwan's first democratically elected president in March 1996 after eight months of intimidating war games and missile tests by China in waters around the island.Those events brought China and Taiwan to the verge of conflict, prompting the United States to send an aircraft carrier task force to the area in a warning to Beijing's government."
Government quietly made 'back door' agreement with U.S. that could undermine treaty on plastic waste | CBC News,The Trudeau government quietly signed a protocol with the U.S. on October 26 that will allow Canada to continue to ship plastic waste to American waste brokers — opening a 'back door' that will allow it to evade the plastic waste shipping restrictions the federal government committed to under the Basel Treaty plastic ban.,2020-12-03T22:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canada-us-plastic-waste-basel-1.5827340,"Environmental groups are accusing the Trudeau government of acting in bad faith after it quietly signed a bilateral agreement with the U.S. that could allow it to evade some of its obligations to stop shipping plastic waste to poor countries around the world.The agreement — which was never publicly announced or gazetted — was signed on Oct. 26, 2020, the U.S. State Department told CBC News. Environment Canada declined CBC's requests to see the text. But experts on plastic waste say it runs counter to the spirit of the Basel Convention on plastic waste and appears to be designed to allow Canada to evade its obligations.""This is, in effect, a backdoor for Canada to offload its waste problems to the U.S., who will offload to the very countries potentially that the Basel Convention amendment is meant to stop,"" said Myra Hird of Queens University, a fellow of the Royal Society of Canada who represented Canada at the G7's microplastics summit last year.""It was not the spirit of the amendment and what we were proclaiming to sign on to.""The plastic waste amendments to the Basel Convention, which take effect on January 1, 2021, effectively limit nations to shipping plastic recyclables only to other signatory countries that are bound by the same rules.They also require prior informed consent from the receiving country.Canada accepted those amendments after a flood of negative publicity about Canadian plastic waste — much of it mislabelled as recyclable — being dumped in developing countries such as the Philippines and Cambodia.A dispute with the Philippines over the issue led to Manila recalling its ambassador to Ottawa, and only ended in May when the Canadian government paid to ship 69 containers of garbage back to Vancouver.Canada informed the UN on March 9 of this year that it ""supports and fully intends to comply"" with the ban.But the Trudeau government also sought to ensure it could use a loophole that allows countries to ship plastic waste to non-signatory nations if they do so under an existing bilateral agreement. The United States is one of only two countries never to ratify the Basel Convention; Haiti is the other. As such, the U.S. is not bound by the new rules on plastic waste. By signing the deal with the U.S. prior to ratifying the Basel plastic amendments, Canada keeps open the option of sending its waste to brokers south of the border.Once Canadian plastic waste enters the States, it can change hands several times. There is no reliable mechanism to track it and no way to ensure it is not re-exported to developing countries, where it often ends up in landfills or in the ocean.Environment and Climate Change Canada discussed the proposed agreement in a webinar with two environmental groups in September — the Canadian Environmental Law Association and Health and Environment Justice Support (HEJ Support) — thereby technically meeting its duty to consult. But most environmental groups that have consulted with the government on plastics say they were blindsided when they learned of the agreement at a U.S. State Department briefing three weeks after it was signed.""This was signed about five weeks ago now and it still is secret and no one has seen it, apart from those who signed it,"" said Kathleen Ruff, former head of the B.C. Human Rights Commission. She now heads Right On Canada, a group that campaigns against plastic pollution.Moira Kelly of Environment Canada confirmed the existence of the agreement to CBC News. ""In accordance with its obligations under the Basel Convention, Canada concluded an arrangement with the United States affirming that the waste subject to the arrangement and circulating between Canada and the U.S. is managed in an environmentally sound manner,"" she said.""This arrangement balances the need to manage the traded plastic waste in an environmentally sound manner in both Canada and the U.S. while reducing barriers to recycling, developing secondary markets and meeting domestic goals, such as recycled content. Maintaining circulation of these materials between Canada and the U.S. can also disincentivize exports overseas.""The Basel treaty amendments require any such bilateral agreement to meet standards as high as, or higher than, those in the treaty, which is legally binding.Kelly said the U.S.-Canada deal ""affirms"" that ""waste moving between Canada and the U.S. is managed in an environmentally sound manner."" When pressed on the meaning of the word ""affirms,"" however, Environment Canada conceded that the agreement with the U.S. is not legally binding.Hird said that makes all the difference.""If this bilateral agreement allows us to get around that in any way, then we're taking a step backwards, we're not taking a step forward,"" she said.""It's more of a pretence of complying, a gesture of complying,"" said Ruff. ""According to the legal experts we've talked to who are experts on the convention, it's a violation of the convention.""Although the Trudeau government has portrayed itself as a global leader in the struggle to control plastic waste, Canada is one of just three countries among the 188 Basel signatory nations that have yet to ratify the plastic ban amendments. The other two are China and Turkey.The government tabled the amendments in Parliament on Oct. 28. Kelly said ""the Government of Canada is working to complete the ratification process as soon as possible and we continue to aim for ratification on or before January 1.""People who work in the field question why Canada is the only developed country in the Basel Treaty not to ratify the plastic accords.""It's difficult to see that in any kind of good faith,"" said Hird. ""It's difficult to see this ratification, this delay in ratification as being justified at all, in terms of bureaucratic necessity. So I think, really, this will be seen by Canadians as stalling.""Ruff said the situation is an example of the yawning gap between government words and actions when it comes to protecting the environment.""I think one of the huge issues in the world is that environmental laws have not been taken seriously,"" she told CBC News. ""Everyone pays lip service to them, but when the rubber hits the road, too often we see governments not complying.""And this is exactly what seems to be happening right here, right now, with this arrangement with the United States.""WATCH: Plastic waste and supermarket shopping — a Marketplace reportMarketplace"

"Canada's Hong Kong immigration plan benefits asylum seekers too, minister says | CBC Radio","Nobody will be denied asylum in Canada for facing charges under China's controversial national security law, promises Immigration Minister Marco Mendicino — but he could not say the same of for pro-democracy activists convicted under other laws.",2020-11-12T23:17:14.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/radio/asithappens/as-it-happens-thursday-edition-1.5799473/canada-s-hong-kong-immigration-plan-benefits-asylum-seekers-too-minister-says-1.5799475,"Read Story TranscriptNobody will be denied asylum in Canada for being charged under China's controversial national security law, promises Immigration Minister Marco Mendicino — but he could not say the same for pro-democracy activists convicted under other laws. Canada's new Hong Kong immigration initiative, announced Thursday, is aimed largely at attracting skilled immigrants rather than asylum seekers. Any Hong Kong resident who has graduated from university in the past three years can apply to work for up to three years in Canada, and will be offered a way to transition more easily to permanent residency.But the announcement also includes some measures for Hong Kongers fleeing persecution by China, Mendicino said.For Hong Kongers, Canada will waive the one-year period that failed asylum seekers usually have to wait in order to have their claims re-assessed. What's more, no asylum claims will be rejected on the basis of conviction under Beijing's national security law, which criminalizes ""secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces,"" and which pro-democracy activists view as a tool to quell political dissent. Here is part of Mendicino's conversation with As It Happens host Carol Off. Minister Mendicino, what message should China take from your announcement today?I was very proud to make an announcement that is aimed at recruiting and retaining young Hong Kong graduates who I hope will see an opportunity in this policy, in this initiative. I hope that they see something that speaks to their aspiration in finding work, continuing their studies and building a better life in Canada.The question, though, is what should China see in this? Our announcement is focused on strengthening the ties between Canada and the people of Hong Kong, and it builds on the immigration plan, which I announced a little less than two weeks ago. Our focus is on creating jobs, on ensuring that we accelerate our economic recovery. And we think that young graduates and the young people of Hong Kong have something to contribute, not only in the long term, but today.Take the health-care sector where our workers are, you know, [working] tirelessly around the clock. We need reinforcements. Hong Kong is also well known as a tech and innovation hub. We think that the experience that young Hong Kongers have will benefit our economy today and also address some of the long-term demographic challenges, which I've been speaking of for some time.Your program, your arrangement, is aimed to attract people with high education who would be economically useful to Canada. But it's not an offer of help to those who may need to flee because of political persecution. How is this supposed to help those people?Well, I dispute that for a number of reasons. One, Canada has a robust asylum system, and those claims, which are adjudicated by our independent tribunal, not a political process, has the capacity to accept claims for those who are fleeing persecution.In addition to that, I highlighted a number of measures, which we've aligned based on our own ongoing monitoring of the situation in Hong Kong, including waving the one-year period that usually applies to failed asylum claimants. And in this particular case, failed asylum claimants from Hong Kong will not have to wait that one year. They can apply for an assessment, and that may mean, in practical terms, that they get to stay in Canada.The other thing that I underlined today is that … no Hong Kong foreign national will be disqualified for applying for asylum by virtue of the sole reason that they've been charged under the Chinese national security law. And more than that, no one will be disqualified from Hong Kong or anywhere else by sole virtue of the fact that they've been charged under the national security law.A few things about that. First of all, very few people have been charged under the national security law. Very many of those pro-democracy activists who've been out in the streets have been charged under previous laws that may be laws that are recognized under Canadian law. So it's not really helpful to them, is it? Why not expand it so that those pro-democracy activists have a better chance at making an asylum claim in Canada, if that's your intention?Well, I hear you, but I want to be absolutely clear about this. No person will be disqualified from claiming asylum who is fleeing persecution, or any other immigration route, if they have not committed a crime that would be applicable under Canadian law.OK, just to stop you there, sir, because what I'm saying is that some of the charges [that] have been levelled at pro-democracy activists might be regarded under Canadian law, even though they were used against people exercising their free speech or their democratic rights. The laws themselves would be consistent with Canadian law. So it's quite possible that many people will be disqualified because they have faced charges in Hong Kong.In those circumstances, if somebody has been deemed inadmissible because they were deemed to have committed, potentially, an offence under Canadian law, then I think the vast majority of Canadians, if not all Canadians, would understand that. Those admissibility requirements are there to ensure that we have an asylum system that is fair, that is transparent, and that does protect those of us who are here.But at the same time, the policies that I announced today do ensure that the national security law, which is one of the developments that we are concerned about, is not a barrier to claiming asylum. And that is an important measure and one that is responsive to some of the concerns in the community.So if someone has been charged previously, a pro-democracy activist, as having been a threat to national security — and we know those laws were used rather liberally before this new law came into place — then you would anticipate that those people would not be qualified?Carol, I understand why you're probing on the issue. I think it's very important to remind your listeners that these are claims that are adjudicated by the Immigration and Refugee Board. We don't want politicians making these determinations. We have expert appointees who look at the merits of each of these claims. We ensure that people who are claiming asylum meet all of our admissibility requirements. And the point of situating the policies that I announced today in the broader context of our asylum system is to say that the national security law will not be a barrier.We spoke with Dennis Kwok yesterday. He is one of the pro-democracy members of the Hong Kong legislature who were expelled, one of the four. He was born in Canada. He said that he doesn't want to have to leave. He wants to see the international community do more to make it so that he doesn't have to. And that's long been Canada's response to these situations, where the effort is put into doing everything possible so that people don't have to flee their homes, they don't have to leave. Is this, in fact, a kind of an admission that you can't change things, that the only course for these people is to leave?Well, I can't speak for his comments, but I certainly appreciate where he's coming from. And that's why, you know, today I emphasize that this is about expanding opportunities, that it is about providing additional routes and pathways for young Hong Kongers who may be seeking opportunities elsewhere, including in Canada.I know, sir. My question is, though, do you believe that Canada has done everything possible to make it so that people don't have to leave … Hong Kong, which is where they would like to be? … Do you think that is an admission that there's nothing more you can do?I don't think it's an admission, but I do think that Canada continues to be a very constructive partner on the world stage. And I think that our immigration policies, including the initiative I announced today, is consistent with our tradition and our values of being an open and inclusive country that believes that we benefit from the talent and the skills, the experience and the diversity of welcoming people from all around the world.And notwithstanding the fact that we are in the midst of a pandemic, we have found ways to proceed with safe and orderly immigration, and we will continue to chart a course that builds on those traditions. Written by Sheena Goodyear with files from The Canadian Press.

Taiwanese in B.C. see hopeful signs that attitudes are softening toward island's push for sovereignty | CBC News,"Taiwan's top envoy in Vancouver says attitudes toward the island are shifting, and that many Canadian officials already treat him as if he represented an independent country — even though Ottawa doesn't formally acknowledge him as such.",2020-09-28T20:28:25.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/twitter-bio-change-taiwan-envoys-1.5740084,"Andy Chen is consul general for Taiwan in everything but name, he says.Taiwan's top envoy in Vancouver has the official title of director-general of the Taiwan Economic and Cultural Office because the island, a disputed territory claimed by the People's Republic of China, does not have a designated embassy or consulate in Canada.But Chen says attitudes toward Taiwan are shifting, and that many Canadian officials already treat him as if he represented an independent country — even though Ottawa doesn't formally acknowledge him as such.""Our [Canadian politician] friends call me 'director general,' and sometimes some other friends call me 'consul general,'"" said Chen, a career diplomat whose office provides consular services for the Western provinces, Yukon and Northwest Territories, such as processing visa applications for Canadians and legalizing official documents for Taiwanese. ""Even some of the consuls general in Vancouver from other countries [call me 'consul general']. They know my job description.""  MarketplaceBased on the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, an international treaty Canada ratified in 1966, ""consul general"" is reserved for top envoys from countries with full diplomatic ties with Canada stationed in cities other than Ottawa. Top envoys assigned to Ottawa bear the title ""ambassador.""Taiwan lost its diplomatic recognition with many countries along with its seat at the United Nations when the People's Republic of China joined the UN in 1971.For decades, Taiwanese across the globe — including around 40,000 in B.C. — have been pushing for the island to be recognized as a sovereign state and to once again be represented in the UN. Many hope the country's impressive management of the COVID-19 pandemic will help its bid for recognition.The island has kept the number of infections at around 500 out of its 24 million population, while China, where COVID-19 originated, has had more than 90,000 positive tests so far.Along with Chen's comments on how he's viewed by consuls general, Taiwan's search for recognition was given another surprising boost last week when Hsiao Bi-khim, the island's top envoy to Washington, D.C., changed her Twitter bio to ""Taiwan Ambassador to the US."" Sorry to disappoint so many supporters, but Taiwan Ambassador is what many call me and also my job description. My title remains Representative, Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office, when engaging with the US government.Taiwan's identity has always been a sensitive topic in China's foreign relations. Although Hsiao later tweeted that her official title is the Representative of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office, her new online ID triggered a fresh round of debates between Beijing and Taipei. In a statement to CBC News, the People's Republic of China's consulate in Vancouver says Taiwan is an ""inalienable part"" of China that is solely represented by its central government in Beijing. This doesn't reverberate with Taiwanese Canadians like Carol Pan, who lives in Vancouver and volunteers with Overseas Community Affairs Council, an organization affiliated with the Taiwanese government to arrange social activities for its citizens living in other countries. ""Taiwan has always been an independent country,"" Pan said. ""After the Second World War, the People's Republic of China never set foot on Taiwan.""Pan said Hsiao's self-identification as ambassador is ""wonderful"" and gives thumbs-up to Chen's being called ""consul general.""""We are hoping eventually some democratic countries can support Taiwan going to be recognized at first and then going to the United Nations,"" she said.In a statement to CBC, Global Affairs said Canada will continue to build people-to-people ties based on shared democratic values and respect for human rights."

Russia looks to revive ailing space industry,"Russia's once-pioneering space program is struggling to live up to its legacy, end an embarrassing series of botched launches, modernize decaying infrastructure and bring in new blood and new ideas.",2013-12-26T00:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/russia-looks-to-revive-ailing-space-industry-1.2476449,"From rocket-shaped playground equipment to faded murals of cosmonauts, mementos of the heyday of Soviet space exploration are scattered around this sandswept town that launched Yuri Gagarin into orbit in 1961.When President Vladimir Putin described the space port on the remote Kazakh steppe as ""physically aged"" in April, he could have been speaking about Russia's space industry itself.In Baikonur as elsewhere, the once-pioneering sector is struggling to live up to its legacy, end an embarrassing series of botched launches, modernize decaying infrastructure and bring in new blood and new ideas.Putin hopes a sweeping reform he signed off on this month will not come too late to turn the industry around — part of a push to make Russia a high-technology superpower by salvaging leading Cold War-era industries and research centres.Built far from prying eyes in a desert-like flatland in central Asia, the once-secret launch site of Sputnik and the first man in space lives on in a strange limbo, marooned in western Kazakhstan by the break-up of the Soviet Union in 1991.Today it is the only gateway for manned flights to the International Space Station, hosting astronauts from the World, and the site of about one-third of all satellite launches.But Baikonur has no movie theatre — let alone many of the trappings of the 21st century. Camels graze the barren steppes near rocket launch sites, and what little seems to have changed since Soviet times often looks the worse for it.""Visitors expect a city of steel and glass like in science fiction films, but for a long time no one even knew this place existed,"" said Evelina Shchur, director of the space museum in a city she describes as ""provincial.”  Despite bigger budgets and Putin's pledge to revive the sector, Russia's space industry has been in crisis for years.""The whole industry needs to be overhauled because the old doesn't work and the new hasn't been built,"" said Igor Marinin, editor of the spaceflight journal Novosti Kosmonavtiki.By separating space agency Roskosmos from its contractors, the Kremlin hopes the reform will boost quality control and end a calamitous series of blunders like July's crash of a Proton rocket carrying a $200-million payload.""We have big plans,"" the new Roskosmos chief, Oleg Ostapenko, told Reuters last month. ""We will do everything possible to get rid of the black marks on our reputation.""The reform also aims to streamline production by uniting  suppliers into a new state-run firm.Roskosmos will be left in charge only of policy, research and ground infrastructure such as the Baikonur cosmodrome.""It will be very difficult, but the Kremlin realizes it can't keep living the old way,"" said Sergey Pekhterev, head of Russian sat-com firm SetTelecom.Critics of the plan say it will eliminate competition and that the shakeup may bring more confusion to the industry, but many insiders say reform is long overdue.While Russia is the world leader in space launches and Russian-built engines equip U.S. rockets, it holds less than 10 per cent of the multi-billion dollar global space market.  Gone are the days of crimped budgets. Russia has more than doubled spending on space in the last three years to over $5 billion in 2013 — though still a fraction of NASA's budget.Despite the cash, the industry is so inefficient it cannot deliver on orders, and funds are misused or even stolen. ""The money is received but there is nothing to show for it,"" Marinin said.A scathing report by the Russian Audit Chamber said the industry spends four times more than the global norm on satellites that are poor in quality and prone to accidents.""Satellites are decades in the making with no hope of market returns,"" the state agency, which supervises the use of government finances, said in a July report.Russia's lead in a global satellite launch industry estimated to be worth around $55 billion over the next decade is now also on the line.  Since 2010, botched launches have rendered useless or slashed the lifespan of 12 Russian satellites.""Today the state of our orbital grouping is catastrophic,"" Yuri Koptev, a former space agency chief, told parliament on Dec. 19. ""We lag behind not only the United States and Europe but also China and India.""The Russian-made orbiters lofted in the late 1980s and 1990s had such poor electronics that some lasted no more than a year compared to 10 years for U.S. craft.Russia meanwhile has lost a generation of experts who would be in management positions today but left the industry or the country after the Soviet collapse. Of 240,000 people employed by the sector, almost 90 percent are either older than 60 or younger than 30.""There's trouble at all the factories — a whole layer of engineers is lost,"" Soviet cosmonaut Valery Ryumin, 73, said.In Baikonur, the future is clouded. Russia has agreed to lease the legendary space port from Kazakhstan until 2050, but it plans to move the majority of space launches to a new cosmodrome it is building in the Far East.Russians have been leaving since the heyday of Soviet spending on space in the 1980s. Only 30 per cent of the 70,000 residents are now Russian. On the edge of town, Kazakh migrants squat in apartment blocks vacated by space technicians.""You'll be preparing to launch into space, running along this historic river, and there is a camel herder,"" said NASA astronaut Mike Fossum, recalling his preparations for launch aboard the Soyuz craft in 2011.  ""We joke that it's not the end of the world but you can see it from here."" "

"U.S. feud with TikTok emblematic of rise of techno-nationalism, expert says | CBC Radio","U.S. President Donald Trump's feud with the popular TikTok video-sharing social-networking app likely has less to do with overall concerns for national security and more to do with the rise of techno-nationalism, according to one Canadian cybersecurity expert.",2020-09-11T22:37:27.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/radio/spark/u-s-feud-with-tiktok-emblematic-of-rise-of-techno-nationalism-expert-says-1.5720840,"U.S. President Donald Trump's feud with the popular TikTok video-sharing social-networking app likely has less to do with overall concerns for national security and more to do with the rise of techno-nationalism, according to one Canadian cybersecurity expert.""It's about Trump's particular orientation towards China and Trump's attempt to use the sort of nationalist front to create a conflict in order to seem strong,"" said David Murakami Wood, a researcher at the Surveillance Studies Centre and an associate professor of sociology at Queen's University, in an interview with Spark host Nora Young. ""Basically he's trying to seem strong.""In late July, Trump threatened to ban TikTok on national security grounds, later saying that the app wouldn't be allowed to operate in the U.S., unless Chinese parent company ByteDance sells the app to an American buyer.TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, has responded to the looming ban by suing the U.S government. Additionally, global computing giant Microsoft, multinational retail chain Walmart and software company Oracle are currently among the U.S. companies currently trying to acquire ByteDance's TikTok operations in the U.S., Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. But for Murakami Wood, the question of national security is a complicated one, especially as claims about the level of private user data gathered by TikTok ""[are] really no different than any other major social media company.""Murakami Wood added that concerns about ByteDance's and other Chinese companies' connections to the country's ruling Communist Party are comparable to the fact that ""most American social media companies are required to turn over data to the state [and]... in fact have a backdoor... for the National Security Agency and others.""""Again, the question is whether you think it's so much worse in China and whether that warrants this kind of action.""And while Trump's claimed concern about national security is one potential reason for the U.S. president's action on ByteDance and TikTok, Murakami Wood said the larger explanation has to do with competition between the U.S. and China. ""We're seeing a kind of portrayal of the future in which China is seen as the main competition of the U.S. in a number of technological fields, whether it be AI…, whether it be autonomous vehicles and drones or whether it be surveillance technologies of smart cities,"" Murakami Wood said, adding that the competition between the two nations has lead to accusations of industrial espionage.""This is now being portrayed and put together to form a picture of this kind of new emerging techno-political world in which China and the U.S. are competing to lead the world in these areas.""Still, the U.S. isn't the only country feuding with China over technology. Murakami Wood pointed out that India is also a major player in the global tech sector, adding that the country is currently led by ""an incredibly nationalist government"" intent on finding ""a good excuse here for trying to stop the infiltration of Chinese platforms and Chinese software into the Indian technological space.""India itself banned 59 mostly Chinese apps — including TikTok — in June, arguing that the software threatened the country's ""sovereignty and integrity."" ""It's about platforms,"" said Murakami Wood. ""It's about technologies.""According to Murakami Wood, it's not just countries using their own goals to interfere with the global tech sector, major tech players — including Google's parent company, Alphabet — are finding ways to collaborate with governments to advance corporate interests.""Google is already the kind of default search engine of choice for everybody, but that's just the beginning,"" he said. ""We're seeing them going into undersea cabling, into creating ideal communities as we saw with Sidewalk Labs … they're building housing in the Valley in California too, which is based on Google principles.""Facebook co-founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg has also suggested in the past that the social networking giant ""can do things better than government,"" Murakami Wood said.He added that the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has also shown that as life moves steadily more online, ""the more we are forced to interact with these companies, whether we know it or not.""""We'll find sooner or later that everything in our lives is being run by these corporations,"" he said.As for Chinese tech giants like Huawei, Baidu and TenCent, that have been accused of having close ties to the Chinese Communist Party, Murakami Wood said he believes the ""alignment is much more sympathetic.""""Not necessarily because the Chinese government controls those companies,"" he said. ""I think because there is a genuine agreement in terms of what strategic aims are between the leaders of those companies and the Chinese state.""""So long as the Chinese state continues to be successful using technology in order to advance its particular interests, I think all of those companies will be totally on board with them.""Murakami Wood also addressed the recently announced Chinese ""Global Initiative on Data Security"" — a move that saw the Asian superpower calling on all nations to better handle data security by setting consistent, global standards. ""It's really sort of taken the wind out of those U.S. accusations, because they're putting this forward not just as a kind of bilateral deal between the U.S. and China, what they're proposing is a whole new global order,"" said Murakami Wood. ""They're actually proposing new global rules for how data management and data collection should work, which, if you're in the kind of academic or activist field, they don't look too bad,"" he said. ""Actually, they look better than actually what many people proposed before in this context.""Nonetheless, Murakami Wood said he acknowledged the moral high ground to be gained from such a move, saying that China knows ""Trump is incredibly unpopular in the world, so he's not going to win over countries that are neutral on this.""""China can be seen then as a more honest broker than Trump: Proposing kind of progressive, even human rights-oriented policies, which will absolutely infuriate the U.S.,"" he said. Murakami Wood added that China's arguments for a kind of data sovereignty belie a more nationalist approach to the internet, similar to arguments that some other countries have proposed about building independent ""internets."" ""Even at one point France was talking about this, about having a Francophone internet that would be free from Anglophone spying and so on,"" he said. ""And so China is certainly trying to win over those sorts of people as well… not just the new authoritarians, but the new nationalists out there in general — the people who are talking about a more nationalist technological agenda.""As for Canada's own interests — placed firmly between the soaring American eagle and the ever growing Chinese dragon — Murakami Wood said the country will need to ""play it clever.""""We're in a very weak position at the moment, because of a lack of current innovation,"" he said. ""That's where we need to concentrate: Making sure [we're] building up capacity within Canada in this area, and not worrying so much about where we are in relation to China and the U.S.""""We're always going to be caught in the middle, so we've just got to build up our own.""For his part, Dwayne Winseck, director of the Canadian Media Concentration Research project and a professor at Carleton University's school of journalism and communication, says communications technology is often seen as a political lever.""They're basically seen as a kind of a weapon of politics, a spearhead of national power for projecting the interests and influence and power of major global superpowers into the international sphere,"" he said. ""So it becomes seen as a major resource through which powerful countries exert their influence and their interests on an international plane."""
T. Rex got huge via major teenage growth spurt: study | CBC News,"A close look at the bones of huge meat-eating dinosaurs, including Sue the T. Rex, reveals that some went through a major growth spurt, while others took decades longer to reach their gigantic adult size.",2020-11-26T12:43:26.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/t-rex-growth-spurt-1.5817064,"Large meat-eating dinosaurs attained their great size through very different growth strategies, with some taking a slow and steady path and others experiencing an adolescent growth spurt, according to scientists who analyzed slices of fossilized bones.The researchers examined the annual growth rings — akin to those in tree trunks — in bones from 11 species of theropods, a broad group spanning all the big carnivorous dinosaurs including Tyrannosaurus rex and even birds. The study provides insight into the lives of some of the most fearsome predators ever to walk the Earth.The team looked at samples from museums in the United States, Canada, China and Argentina and even received clearance to cut into bones from one of the world's most famous T. Rex fossils, known as Sue and housed at the Field Museum in Chicago, using a diamond-tipped saw and drill.Sue's leg bones — a huge femur and fibula — helped illustrate that T. Rex and its relatives — known as tyrannosaurs — experienced a period of extreme growth during adolescence and reached full adult size by around age 20. Sue, measuring about 13 metres, lived around 33 years.Sue inhabited South Dakota about a million years before dinosaurs and many other species were wiped out by an asteroid impact 66 million years ago.Other groups of large theropods tended to have more steady rates of growth over a longer period of time. That growth strategy was detected in lineages that arose worldwide earlier in the dinosaur era and later were concentrated in the southern continents.Examples included Allosaurus and Acrocanthosaurus from North America, Cryolophosaurus from Antarctica and a recently discovered as-yet-unnamed species from Argentina that rivaled T. Rex in size. The Argentine dinosaur, from a group called carcharodontosaurs, did not reach its full adult size until its 40s and lived to about age 50.Congrats to lab alum ⁦<a href=""https://twitter.com/cullen_thomas?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">@cullen_thomas</a>⁩ &amp; ⁦<a href=""https://twitter.com/PeteMakovicky?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">@PeteMakovicky</a>⁩ on a cool new histo paper: T. rex had a teenage growth spurt — but not all dinosaurs did - CNN <a href=""https://t.co/n1eXXcTGbK"">https://t.co/n1eXXcTGbK</a>Big theropods share the same general body design, walking on two legs and boasting large skulls, strong jaws and menacing teeth.""Prior to our study, it was known that T. Rex grew very quickly, but it was not clear if all theropod dinosaurs reached gigantic size in the same way, or if there were multiple ways it was done,"" said paleontologist and study lead author Tom Cullen of the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences and North Carolina State University, also affiliated with the Field Museum.The research was published this week in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B.""Theropod dinosaurs represent the largest bipedal animals to have ever lived and were also the dominant predators in terrestrial ecosystems for over 150 million years — more than twice as long as mammals have been dominant,"" said University of Minnesota paleontologist and study co-author Peter Makovicky."

Bell and Telus snub Huawei in move to build 5G network in Canada | CBC News,BCE Inc. and Telus Corp. will both use equipment from Scandinavian component makers Nokia and Ericsson to build out their next-generation 5G networks in Canada.,2020-06-02T13:27:04.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/bce-5g-ericsson-1.5594601,"BCE Inc. and Telus Corp. will both use equipment from Scandinavian component makers Nokia and Ericsson to build out their next-generation 5G networks in Canada.BCE, the parent company of Bell, said Tuesday morning it will partner with Swedish telecommunications equipment maker Ericsson to build out its next generation wireless network, known as 5G.That makes Ericsson just the second company that Bell will allow on its network, along with Finnish supplier Nokia, which Bell announced it would work with in February in its quarterly earnings release.Notably absent from that list of two suppliers is Huawei, the Chinese technology company that has become a lightning rod because of its close relationship with the Chinese government.Huawei has become something of a household name in Canada in recent years after its vice-president Meng Wangzhou was arrested at Vancouver's airport two years ago at the request of U.S. authorities.Many countries around the world say Huawei's close relationship with the Chinese government could expose cellular networks to spying.The United States and Australia have forbidden telecom firms in those countries from using Huawei components in their 5G networks.Canadian authorities are currently mulling whether to allow Huawei to participate in Canadian networks. Canada's Public Safety Minister Bill Blair said in a statement to CBC News that the government is ""taking all security factors into account, including those from our allies and our security agencies. We will ensure that our networks are kept secure and will take the appropriate decisions in due course.""Tuesday's news show the industry isn't waiting around for that decision either way.A few hours after Bell's move, Telus announced that it, too, would use Nokia and Ericsson for its 5G network. That's a departure from what the company said as recently as February, when Telus announced it was moving ahead with plans to roll out 5G using Huawei equipment.Huawei gear is in use on the lower-generation equipment at both telecom companies, but appears to be in the process of getting shut out of their 5G plans.Patrick Horan, a portfolio manager with Agilith Capital, said Bell's decision came as something of a surprise, given Bell's support for Huawei in the past and its current use of Huawei technology.""They were probably the most outspoken of the carriers in Canada"" in expressing their support for Huawei, he said.Horan says Huawei's prickly status with governments outside China was a factor in Bell's decision. ""[Bell] probably looked at their ability to garner any U.S. government telecom contracts with Huawei equipment in their [network]. My guess is that would be a negative for them,"" he said.""My guess is they decided to take that off the table.""Rogers has had a long-standing partnership with Ericsson on its existing wireless networks, and announced in 2018 that it would use Ericsson equipment for its 5G network, which it started to roll out in Toronto, Vancouver, Ottawa and Montreal earlier this year."

The fact that it's still here and still surviving and thriving speaks volumes,"" Labelle said. ""I don't want to jinx it.""There have been hard times, she said, but nothing quite like this.""This is the hardest one we've ever endured. The smoking bylaw would be the closest second to it, for the severity of an overnight change."" To survive Ottawa's smoking crackdown, the venerable watering hole was severed in two, with half becoming a Quiznos franchise so the remaining bar could sustain itself.Unlike other establishments, The Laff hasn't stayed open for takeout or delivery during the pandemic.""The bar is the experience. You can't take that out,"" Labelle observed.Labelle hopes to reopen this summer and is considering applying for a larger patio so customers, when they return, can spread out and enjoy themselves like old times.""We just want to see our regulars again, our friends. These are people we see weekly, if not daily.""Jacques Marchand can trace his family's lighting and electrical business back three generations. ""My father's father's father,"" Marchand noted proudly. He's the fourth.Founded just 14 years after Thomas Edison unveiled the first practical incandescent light bulb, Marchand Electric has seen its share of history. Now, the company is trying to survive COVID-19.""We have experience with slowdowns before, and the trick … is to react quickly. You have to look at your costs and your staff. We had to lay some people off, unfortunately,"" Marchand said.A skeleton staff continues to work at the Algoma Road location. Retail sales have been limited to online purchases, but the store has been deemed an essential service because they supply to hospitals.There are already signs things are picking up: Marchand has recalled three of the six people he laid off. ""So we got the guys back working in the warehouse. They're also working on inventories and painting floors. Make-work projects. You have to retain these employees,"" he said.Marchand is also trying to convince clients to plan —  and order — ahead.""You've got a project coming up? Why don't we talk about it now instead of freaking out at the last minute, two months from now?""Sonia Fisher is a fourth-generation purveyor of quality men's clothing, a retail business established by her great-grandfather, Emerson Ralph Fisher, 115 years ago. It was ER Fisher who got the company through the Depression years. Part of company lore is that ""he did not lay off a single person,"" Sonia Fisher noted. Back then, the company reduced its hours, but stayed open.With COVID-19, things are different. Forced to close the Westboro store, Fisher has had to lay off 12 employees.""I didn't want to get the business in a situation where we were worse off five to six months down the road,"" she said.Most spring merchandise had already been delivered, but ""anything that hadn't arrived, we cancelled,"" Fisher said. They're already trimming back on their fall orders.""It'll take time for people to develop confidence again in the economy,"" Fisher said, ""so we are predicting a drop in sales over the next year.""Unlike other retailers, ER Fisher doesn't sell online. Personalized service has always been its brand. Now, Fisher admits it might be time to update that business model.""It's definitely something that we're going to be ramping up. It's a sore spot for me because I worry that I should have done it a little sooner.""McIntosh and Watts started out as a coffee and tea emporium, with deliveries made by horse and buggy.  ""We could have been Starbucks,"" jokes the company's fourth-generation president, Peter McIntosh, who's been selling china and tableware for 35 years.His grandfather, Grant McIntosh, was stationed in England during the Second World War and made connections at factories that made fine bone china, which he began exporting to Canada, far away from German bombs.""They adapted. They did everything they could to continue to function,"" McIntosh said. ""That's how you have to survive."" Fast-forward to 2020. The store on Industrial Avenue has been closed since mid-March, the company's online and wholesale business now operating out of McIntosh's home. ""We're adapting. We're working hard on the parts of our business we can continue to develop. We've just scaled everything back,"" McIntosh said.""Frisby the Vulcanizer"" was established by Don Frisby's great-uncle, George Frisby, upon his discharge after the First World War. The company survived the Great Depression, but Don Frisby said he never heard the stories about how they managed. ""They were ... men of very few words. All those guys did was work.""Deemed essential, the business has been allowed to stay open, but retail customers have been staying away and business is down 30 per cent. It's been a ""double whammy,"" Frisby said, arriving at what's normally one of his busiest seasons.He's responded by resetting his expectations.""My goal all along has been to keep as many people working as possible and to stay open and forget about being profitable. We just want to be able to keep functioning as a business,"" Frisby said.Of his 100 employees, just one has had a layoff notice. ""Our on-the-road salesperson, whom nobody wants to see. Poor guy,"" Frisby said.So why not let a few more go until this thing blows over?""Right from my great-uncle and my father and through to me, we've always understood ... that our customers and the people who look after our customers are the most important aspect of the business,"" Frisby said."

He said buying local is especially vital right now.""The money that I make here in the farmers market goes back to the farmers market and it goes into my personal bank account that I spend here living in Cape Breton,"" he said. ""It doesn't go to the U.S., it doesn't go to China. It stays right here.""Smith said shopping in person offers the best experience for both independent retailers and the consumer.""I think if people are concerned about crowds, then shopping local is definitely the way to go,"" Smith said. ""The shops are smaller; you can ... get fewer people in the shops.""The Cape Breton Regional Chamber of Commerce is encouraging businesses to extend store hours over the coming weeks based on when consumers prefer shopping. CEO Kathleen Yurchesyn said studies have shown that most shopping in store happens after 6:00 p.m.She said retailers must adapt in other ways.""Businesses recognized that there's many people that can't come home for the holiday season, of course, with the Atlantic bubble,"" Yurchesyn said.For this reason, she expects that people who won't be able to visit home over Christmas and buy goods in store while here will instead do so online. If Nova Scotia retailers don't have an online presence, this will be problematic, said Yurchesyn.McHugh said as much as 20 per cent of shopping now happens online.""People enjoy the convenience of it,"" he said.Unless small retailers already have a solid online presence, he thinks online shopping is more beneficial to industry giants like Walmart and Amazon.Matt Rogers, the president of Bishop's Cellar in Halifax, said his business has already succeeded on that front. The downtown Halifax liquor store has used online sales for the past decade, but ramped up their efforts to send products online due to the pandemic.""This year, it has proven to be the way most intend to shop,"" Rogers said.The business purchased its own delivery truck this year to meet demand from online ordering.Rogers said web chats with workers at the store help people order products from the comfort of their home or office.MORE TOP STORIES"
Elsipogtog collective's art finds new life after half a century | CBC News,Imagine finding out that the art you've been admiring at work every day — tapestries of familiar animals and lands — came from the imagination of a family member more than 50 years ago.,2019-09-22T11:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/elsipogtog-handicraft-collective-art-1.5288045,"Imagine going to work every day and getting the chance to admire the creations of local artists on the walls of your office.Now imagine finding out that the art you admire every day — tapestries of familiar animals and lands — was made by a family member more than 50 years ago.This is what happened to Starlit Simon, who works at the University of New Brunswick's Mi'kmaq-Wolastoqey Centre as a Mi'kmaq language teacher.""As it turns out, the designs came from my great uncle Michael William Francis,"" Simon said.""I did not know this. I've been working here, I think, about three to four years, went to school here, and the whole time these tapestries are here that my great uncle had made the designs for.""Her great uncle Michael Francis was part of the Micmac Indian Craftsmen, a group of artists from Big Cove First Nation, now Elsipogtog, who made prints and sold them all over as souvenirs for tourists.""I didn't realize that they were his artwork because he didn't do tapestries,"" Simon added.The tapestries that hang at UNB were made by renowned textile artist Ivan Crowell from designs by Francis and Stephen John Dedam.After the designs were created, they were silk-screened onto cards, teacups and other souvenir-like items at a workshop in Elsipogtog. ""These were sold by the hundreds of thousands across Canada,"" said John Leroux, manager of collections and exhibitions at the Beaverbrook Art Gallery. ""These were extremely popular."" It was Leroux and Emma Hassencahl-Perley, a curator at the Fredericton gallery, who told Simon her great uncle's art was hanging on the walls of UNB.The two curators were visiting the Mi'kmaq-Wolastoqey Centre as part of their research into the Micmac Indian Craftsmen for an exhibit coming to the gallery. Francis died in 1995 at the age of 72.Dedam, 80, who still lives in Elsipogtog, about 90 kilometres north of Moncton, said he didn't have an easy life growing up, and doing art was cathartic for him.Painting was a way for him to create and ""remain on a gentle stream,"" he said.""When you sit down and dream about something else, you know, you turn around and you make your own world. And you find that very peaceful.""Thinking back on the importance of the Micmac Indian Craftsmen, who produced art from 1962 to 1966, Dedam said he hopes their work influences young Indigenous artists who may be struggling as he did.""Art is very important because art doesn't get old, and it remains young as long as time,"" he said.The Micmac Indian Craftsmen workshop in Elsipogtog burned down in the late-1960s.Leroux and Hassencahl-Perley believe the fire and federal funding cuts were among the reasons for the demise of the collective, though the artists continued to create individually.Leroux and Hassencahl-Perley have been looking into the Micmac Indian Craftsmen for months in preparation for the Beaverbrook exhibit about the collective and the book that will accompany it. ""One of the things that Emma and I are really trying to focus on is that this appears to be really the initial stages of modern Indigenous art in Eastern Canada … and it's an incredible story that again seems to have been forgotten by a lot of people, except the ones who are involved with it.""And when they talk about it, there seems to be a lot of warmth.""Leroux recently acquired some of the Elsipogtog collective's china tea sets and hasty cards, small cards for birthday wishes and other brief messages, from eBay. He remembers seeing one particular card design at home when he was a child.The hasty cards featured art from Dedam and Francis on the front, accompanied by Mi'kmaq creation stories of Kluskap on the back. ""This is beyond just an Indigenous arts story,"" Leroux said. ""This is some of the most sophisticated and creative graphics being done in New Brunswick in the 1960s.""When you look at this, it's incredibly skilled. And to say that these were people that were dedicated to their craft and their culture, and could produce things that were being done as good as anyone. It was just in them, it was inherent and it's absolutely remarkable.""The Micmac Indian Craftsmen were also featured on the cover of the 1965 edition of an annual publication listing and describing artists in New Brunswick. ""All of the different craftspeople around New Brunswick, whether it's metalwork, woodwork, ceramics, they're all in here."" Leroux said. ""And on the very first page they actually have Micmac Indian Craftsmen.""In the book, the Elsipogtog artists are called the ""most progressive group of craftsmen.""""They say, 'They're doing the most modern of crafts based upon designs from legends that are centuries old,'"" Leroux said.Hassencahl-Perley didn't even know about the artists until she started this project.""Seeing it all come to light now, it's been really encouraging for me,"" she said. ""I think just in terms of looking at design and, you know, artists that were here before me and have kind of paved this path for me, to exist in this realm.""Leroux expects the Micmac Indian Craftsman exhibit and book will be ready for the fall of 2020."

Graff said there could be implications for innovation and new technologies, if there was such a global split in the networks that support them. WATCH | Pressure on Canada as Britain bans Huawei from its 5G network:The NationalOn Tuesday, the U.K. government ordered all Huawei equipment to be purged from its 5G network by the year 2027. The announcement changes direction from a January decision to allow the company a limited role in building the network.A spokesperson for Huawei called the decision ""disappointing"" and urged the British government to reconsider.Graff said the U.K.'s reversal stems from the Trump administration's campaign to limit Huawei's involvement in 5G infrastructure globally, over concerns the company would act as an agent for the Chinese government. The company has denied it spies for China.""You have seen this tidal wave of criminal charges, legal cases, trade restrictions and outright technology bans emanating from the United States, all geared towards opposing the growth and expansion of Huawei's 5G technology into Western networks,"" Graff said.Canada has not yet decided on Huawei's role in its own 5G network but faces pressure from the U.S. to join countries excluding it. Last month, the State Department said it was prepared to reassess intelligence sharing with Canada if Huawei was involved in 5G. WATCH | What is 5G and how can it change your life?The National""This really is a fight between two superpowers about who is going to control the critical technologies of the next generation,"" Graff said.He said the conflict is also part of ""a generational rethinking of how the West interacts with China,"" after decades of hope that economic ties would bridge political differences.Graff said that rethink is being prompted in part by human rights abuses and China's role in Hong Kong. ""Co-operative engagement over the last two decades has actually not seen China embrace democracy or Western norms in the way that many foreign policy experts had hoped."" Written by Padraig Moran.

Kim Ng ready to bear the torch as baseball's 1st female GM | CBC Sports,"During Monday's hour-long introductory virtual news conference, Kim Ng of the Miami Marlins confessed she had doubted whether a major league team would hire her as GM.

""That's what this is. It's like what we tell the players — you can mope and sulk for a few days, but that's it. You've got to come back, and that's what I've been able to do. I've been defeated and deflated numerous times, but you keep hoping.""Ng (pronounced Ang) has earned a win for women everywhere, and she's also being saluted as a pioneering Asian American, even overseas.""Apparently I have a small little fan club in China,"" she said.ICYMI: Miami Marlins general manager Kim Ng shared her message of perseverance with The Today Show this morning.<br><br>Last week, Ng became the first female and first Asian American general manager of any professional men's sports team in North America.<br><br>(📹 via <a href=""https://twitter.com/TODAYshow?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">@todayshow</a> <a href=""https://twitter.com/Marlins?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">@Marlins</a>) <a href=""https://t.co/WSKzATObzD"">pic.twitter.com/WSKzATObzD</a>Ng celebrated her achievement with her four sisters and her mother, who was born in China and came to the United States at age 5. Other ceiling-busting women offered congratulations, from Michelle Obama to Billie Jean King.Ng said at least 500 people have told her they're now Marlins fans. She's especially heartened to set an example for young girls who might aspire to a career in sports management.""There's an adage: You can't be it if you can't see it. Now you can see it,"" she said.Ng, who turns 52 on Tuesday, started her baseball career as a Chicago White Sox intern in 1990, and for the past nine years was a senior vice-president for Major League Baseball.She spent four years with the New York Yankees when their star shortstop was Derek Jeter, now the Marlins' CEO. By reaching out to her regarding the Miami job, she said, Jeter showed fearlessness.""Derek embodies that word,"" Ng said. ""I was privileged to watch Derek for four years every day on the field, and that was his approach to the game. He left it all out there every single day. Fearlessness on the field, and now with this, we see it off the field.""Ng joins a long-suffering franchise on the upswing. The Marlins reached the playoffs this year for the first time since 2003 and have built one of baseball's best farm systems since Jeter's group bought the team three years ago.How it started, how it's going, etc. <a href=""https://t.co/Fg2M9WFK2Y"">pic.twitter.com/Fg2M9WFK2Y</a>Ng replaces president of baseball operations Michael Hill, who had been with the Marlins since 2002 but wasn't retained after the season.""When I first reached out to Kim, I think through our first couple of conversations it became evident to both of us that this was a perfect fit,"" Jeter said. ""We couldn't be more excited to have her experience and leadership to help lead us down our path to sustained success.""Ng's father introduced her to baseball, and she learned the game by playing stickball while in elementary school in Queens.""First base would be the red car on the right,"" she said.""Second base was the manhole. Third base was the green car on the left, and another manhole for home. Those are great memories.""She attended her first game at Yankee Stadium in the late 1970s, and her favourite player was catcher Thurman Munson. She played shortstop for the University of Chicago's softball team, and then began to climb the major league ranks.There was occasional resistance. In 2003, a New York Mets scout was fired for making racially insensitive remarks to Ng at baseball's GM meetings, when she was with the Los Angeles Dodgers. Some teams that gave her job interviews didn't really seem interested in hiring her, she said.Even now, as she reaches the pinnacle in her profession, Ng said she feels as though a 10,000-pound weight has been transferred from one shoulder to the other.""You're bearing the torch for so many,"" Ng said. ""That's a big responsibility, but I take it on.""As baseball's first female general manager, she embraces the chance to be judged on wins and losses."

How Zantac went from world's best-selling drug to being pulled from store shelves | CBC News,"Health authorities worldwide are investigating the safety of Zantac heartburn medicine, also sold generically as ranitidine, after finding a probable cancer-causing impurity in the drug. Here is a timeline on Zantac.",2019-10-22T18:08:28.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/zantac-heartburn-timeline-1.5330575,"The U.S. Food and Drug Administration and international health authorities are investigating the safety of Zantac heartburn medicine, also sold generically as ranitidine, after finding a probable cancer-causing impurity in the drug.   Ranitidine is the newest drug in which presence of cancer causing impurities have been found. Regulators have been recalling some blood pressure and heart failure medicines since last year.Glaxo Holdings Ltd, now a part of GlaxoSmithKline PLC , receives its first U.S. FDA approval for Zantac as a short-term treatment of a common form of ulcers. The drug was already approved in 31 different countries.            1988   Zantac becomes the world's best selling drug and one of the first-ever drugs to top $1 billion US in annual sales.            1997   Glaxo's U.S. patent for ranitidine expires and competitors launch generic alternatives to the drug.           2004-2017   Pfizer receives FDA approval for an over-the-counter version of Zantac in the U.S. The brand later moved in various transactions to Johnson & Johnson, Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals and Sanofi SA, which currently sells Zantac in the U.S. Other companies also launch generic over-the-counter competitors.            July 2018   European and American regulators recall blood pressure drug valsartan made by China's Zhejiang Huahai Pharmaceuticals after finding the cancer causing impurity N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) in samples of drugs containing ranitidine. The regulators have since found the impurities in a wide number of the drugs in the same class, called angiotensin II receptor blockers.         The European Medicines Agency said NDMA is considered a probable human carcinogen (a substance that could cause cancer) based on animal studies. NDMA is also an environmental contaminant found in water and food including meat, dairy products and vegetables, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).   Sept. 13, 2019   U.S. and European regulators say they are reviewing the safety of ranitidine.           Sept. 18, 2019   Novartis AG's Sandoz Unit, which makes generic drugs, says it is halting the distribution of its versions of Zantac in all markets, while Canada requests drugmakers selling ranitidine to stop distribution.           Sept. 28, 2019   Drugstore chain CVS Health Corp says it will stop selling Zantac and its own generic ranitidine products. Walmart Inc, Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc and Rite Aid Corp have also moved to remove the drugs off their shelves.         Oct 2, 2019   FDA says it has found ""unacceptable levels"" of N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) in samples of drugs containing ranitidine in its testing.         A proposed Canada-wide class action launches against Sanofi, GlaxoSmithKline, Sandoz, Pharmascience, Apotex, Pro Doc, Sanis Health, and Sivem Pharmaceuticals for not disclosing the risk of cancer associated with ranitidine. None of the allegations have been proven in court.   Oct 8, 2019   GlaxoSmithKline, the original maker of the drug, recalls prescription-only Zantac medicines in all its markets as a precaution.           Oct 18, 2019   Sanofi recalls over-the-counter Zantac in the United States and Canada, a day after the UK unit of Teva Pharmaceutical, the world's largest generic drug maker, recalled some batches of ranitidine. Health Canada says additional prescription and over-the-counter ranitidine drugs are being recalled by Sivem Pharmaceuticals ULC and Teva Canada Limited because they may contain the NDMA above acceptable levels."

Malaysia deported a North Korean suspect in the case on Friday.Earlier this week, Malaysia said it would cancel visa-free entry for North Koreans entering the country from March 6.    Anifah said in the statement that this move was ""an indication of the government's concern that Malaysia may have been used for illegal activities.""Malaysia on Saturday rejected any suggestion it may have violated sanctions imposed by the United Nations on North Korea, after a Reuters report said North Korea-linked firms were running an arms network in the country.Reuters reported on Monday that North Korean intelligence agents used front companies to run an arms sales operation out of Malaysia under a brand called Glocom. "

Critics contend it erodes personal freedoms, makes political opponents vulnerable to retribution and even exposes the country's citizens to snooping by the Chinese government.The cameras, equipped with facial recognition technology, are being rolled out across hundreds of cities around the world, particularly in poorer countries with weak track records on human rights where Beijing has increased its influence through big business deals.With the United States claiming that Chinese state authorities can get backdoor access to Huawei data, the aggressive rollout is raising concerns about the privacy of millions of people in countries with little power to stand up to China.""The system can be used to trail political opponents, monitor regime critics at any moment, which is completely against the law,"" said Serbia's former commissioner for personal data protection, Rodoljub Sabic.Groups opposed to Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic say police are leaking video of protests to pro-government media, which publish the images, along with the identities of participants. Vucic himself has boasted the police have the capability to count ""each head"" at anti-government gatherings.During a recent rally, protesters climbed up a pole and covered a camera lens with duct tape scrawled with the word ""censored.""Serbian police deny any such abuse of the Huawei system, which will eventually encompass 1,000 cameras in 800 locations throughout Belgrade. Huawei said in a statement that it ""complies with all applicable laws and regulations"" in Serbia and anywhere else it does business.While facial recognition technology is being adopted in many countries, spurring debate over the balance between privacy and safety, the Huawei system has gained extra attention due to accusations that Chinese laws requiring companies to assist in national intelligence work give authorities access to its data.As a result, some countries are reconsidering using Huawei technology, particularly the superfast 5G networks that are being rolled out later this year.Still, Huawei, which denies accusations of any Chinese government control, has had no trouble finding customers eager to install its so-called Safe Cities technology, particularly among countries that China has brought closer into its diplomatic and economic orbit.Besides Serbia, that list includes Turkey, Russia, Ukraine, Azerbaijan, Angola, Laos, Kazakhstan, Kenya and Uganda, as well as a few liberal democracies like Germany, France and Italy. The system is used in some 230 cities, exposing tens of millions of people to its screening.In a promotional brochure, Huawei says its video surveillance technology can scan over long distances to detect ""abnormal behaviour"" such as loitering, track the movement of cars and people, calculate crowd size and send alerts to a command centre if it detects something suspicious. Local authorities can then act upon the information they receive.In one case advertised on its website, the company says a suspect in a hit-and-run accident in Belgrade was later discovered in China with the help of face recognition data shared by the Serbian police with their Chinese counterparts.In view of the cybersecurity accusations levelled by the U.S. and international rights groups against Huawei, the relationship between China and countries that use the company's technology is coming under renewed scrutiny.China's influence in Serbia, a European Union candidate that Beijing views as a gateway to the continent, has significantly expanded in recent years through Beijing's global Belt and Road investment programs.The populist Serbian regime has been keen to develop closer ties and the country's fragile democracy allows China's economic interests to grow relatively unchecked, without raising too many questions about human rights, environmental standards or transparency.China's state investment bank has granted billions of dollars in easy-term loans to build coal-powered plants, roads, railroads and bridges. Chinese police officers even help patrol the streets of Belgrade, a security presence officially billed as assisting the growing number of Chinese tourists who visit the city.It's a similar story in Uganda, where China has invested heavily in infrastructure like highways and a hydropower dam on the Nile.When longtime President Yoweri Museveni launched a $167 million Cdn project to install Huawei facial recognition systems a year ago, he said the cameras were ""eyes, ears and a nose"" to fight rampant street crime in the sprawling capital, Kampala. Opposition activists say the real goal is to deter street protesters against an increasingly unpopular government.""The cameras are politically motivated,"" said Joel Ssenyonyi, a spokesman for the musician and activist known as Bobi Wine who has emerged as a powerful challenger to Museveni. ""They are not doing this for security. The focus for them is hunting down political opponents.""In neighbouring Kenya, the government has also renewed its focus on public safety after a spate of extremist attacks. It has been pushing to register people digitally, including by recording DNA, iris and facial data. To do so, it turned to China, which helped finance the installation of surveillance cameras in Kenya as far back as 2012.The Kenyan government wants to pool into one database all the information from public and private CCTV cameras, including those with facial recognition technology, a move that activists warn would vastly expand its surveillance powers in a country that does not have comprehensive data protection laws.A growing number of countries are following China's lead in deploying artificial intelligence to track citizens, according to the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.The group says at least 75 countries are actively using AI tools such as facial recognition for surveillance — and Huawei has sold its systems in 50 of those countries, giving it a far wider reach than competitors such as Japan-based NEC and U.S.-based IBM.""It's very unclear what safeguards are being put in place,"" said Steven Feldstein, a Carnegie Endowment fellow who authored a report on the issue.""Where are images being stored? How long are they being stored for? What kind of accountability procedures will there be? What type of operations will be linked to these surveillance cameras?""Huawei said in an emailed statement that it ""complies with all applicable laws and regulations in our countries of business. This is the most fundamental principle of our business operations. We are dedicated to bringing people better connectivity, eliminating digital gaps, and promoting the sustainable development of our societies and economies.""In Belgrade's bustling downtown Republic Square, high-tech video cameras are pointed in all directions from an office building as pedestrians hurry about their everyday business.With public authorities disclosing little about how the cameras work, a rights group has set up a tent to ask pedestrians whether they know they are being watched.""We don't want to be in some kind of Big Brother society,"" said rights activist Ivana Markulic. ""We are asking: Where are the cameras, where are they hidden, how much did we pay for them and what's going to happen with information collected after this surveillance?"""

Coronavirus: What's happening around the world on June 15 | CBC News,"China's capital is bracing for a resurgence of the coronavirus, with more than 100 new cases reported over recent days in a city that hadn't seen a case of local transmission in more than a month. Here's a look at what's happening around the world.",2020-06-15T09:39:23.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/china-coronavirus-resurgence-1.5612124,"The latest:Just days after declaring the country was COVID-19 free, New Zealand's Health Ministry confirmed Tuesday it had two new cases, both ""related to the border as a result of recent travel from the U.K.,"" according to a statement.The ministry said the cases were related and that it would release more information at a news conference later in the day.On June 8, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern told reporters she was ""confident we have eliminated transmission of the virus in New Zealand for now,"" but she warned there could be more cases there again. The head of the World Health Organization says more than 100,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 caused by the novel coronavirus have been reported worldwide each day over the past two weeks — mostly in the Americas and South Asia — and countries that have curbed transmissions ""must stay alert to the possibility of resurgence.""Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus noted a new cluster of cases in Beijing, which went more than 50 days without a new case of COVID-19, and said the origin of that outbreak is under investigation.The origins of the Beijing cluster are not certain. WHO officials said Monday that the claim they might have been caused by imports or packaging of salmon related to a local market are a ""hypothesis.""WATCH | WHO addresses new cases in China:WorldIn Europe, meanwhile, some nations eased border controls on Monday as coronavirus cases declined after three months of lockdown, with shoppers lining up in London for non-essential goods and French bargain hunters streaming into Belgium to buy cheap cigarettes.The total number of confirmed COVID-19 cases globally is closing in on eight million, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. More than two million of those cases are in the United States. There have been nearly 435,000 deaths from COVID-19 around the world, with about 116,000 of them in the U.S.In Europe, Greek airports allowed more international flights as the country sought to salvage its summer season, German tourists flocking to neighbouring Denmark caused an eight-kilometre queue, and Italians popped into France to buy lottery scratch cards.But the continued closure of most of Spain, a patchwork of quarantine rules and remote-working by many who once commuted across borders, means it will not be a return to unfettered travel for 420 million Europeans.Spain is initially allowing in 10,000 holidaymakers from Germany as the Madrid government works out how to handle mass tourism before opening up more fully in the coming weeks.Hundreds of German sun-seekers, the first tourists to visit Spain since borders were closed in March, arrived in Mallorca on Monday on a flight from Düsseldorf.""Holidaymakers can be happy that the beaches in Palma have never been so empty,"" said Aage Duenhaupt, a spokesperson for travel company TUI. ""But there won't be parties in the same way this year.""In Greece, passengers arriving from airports deemed high-risk will be tested and quarantined for up to 14 days, depending on the result. Restrictions remain for passengers from Britain and Turkey. Arrivals from other airports will be randomly tested.WATCH | What it looks like boarding a plane during COVID-19:Spain will allow no foreign tourists until June 21, with exceptions for some islands.Elsewhere, the right to travel will depend on where you live and where you are going. The Czech Republic has a traffic-light system, barring tourists from ""orange"" or ""red"" countries, such as Portugal and Sweden.Denmark will accept tourists from Iceland, Germany and Norway, but not Sweden, if they book at least six nights' accommodation.Britain's two-week quarantine for visitors means Britons will face the same confinement in France.Before the crisis, about 3.5 million people crossed an internal EU border every day, according to a 2019 European Parliament report, some 1.7 million of them commuters.Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced Monday that the federal government will extend the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB), with details to follow in the days ahead.The CERB is due to run out soon for people who have been on the benefit since it was first launched in April, at the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic.People can only claim the benefit for 16 weeks — four eligibility periods — and the end of the program's fourth eligibility period is early July.""We're working on a solution to extend the benefit for people who can't return to work yet,"" Trudeau said. ""We'll have more details this week, but for today, I want you to know that we'll continue to be there for you and your family.""WATCH | Epidemiologist says COVID-19 toll may be higher than official totals:CanadaAs of 3:45 p.m. ET on Monday, there were 99,091 confirmed and presumptive coronavirus cases in Canada, with 61,000 cases considered recovered or resolved. A CBC News tally of deaths based on provincial data, regional health information and CBC's reporting stood at 8,220.India's Health Ministry reported a jump of more than 11,000 new infections nationwide for a third consecutive day on Monday. The country's home minister offered 500 train carriages for use as makeshift coronavirus hospital wards as New Delhi struggles to contain a spike in cases.The Indian capital has about 9,000 beds dedicated to COVID-19 patients in public and private hospitals, but a state government panel of experts has said it will need at least 15,000 beds by the end of June.Long lines stretched along streets across England as shops selling items considered non-essential during the pandemic, such as sneakers and toys, welcomed customers on Monday for the first time since the United Kingdom was put into lockdown in late March.Starved of the retail experience for the better part of three months, shoppers generally appeared to abide by the physical distancing requirement to stay two metres apart as they awaited their turn to enter the stores.Monday's reopening of shops, from department stores to booksellers and electronics retailers, only applies to England. Scotland and Wales are taking a more tentative approach to the easing of the coronavirus restrictions. Northern Ireland's stores reopened last week. England also saw zoos, safari parks and drive-in cinemas reopen on Monday.Russian President Vladimir Putin blamed America's lack of centralized authority for its inability to stem the spread of the virus, while saying Russia was ""working quite steadily and getting out of this situation … with minimal losses.""In the U.S., ""this is not happening,"" Putin said, noting the central and regional governments work more closely in Russia.Russia, nevertheless, has recorded more than half a million infections and nearly 7,000 virus deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins count.Egypt's Health Ministry has confirmed 1,691 new cases of the coronavirus, including 97 deaths, the country's highest toll for one day.There have officially been 46,289 COVID-19 cases and 1,672 deaths recorded since the virus first emerged in Egypt in February. Egypt has the highest death rate in the Arab world and the third highest in the Middle East after Iran and Turkey. The government has resisted a full lockdown in an effort to keep the economy functioning. Even as caseloads multiply in the Arab world's most populous country, authorities have shortened the nightly curfew and plan to reopen airports for tourism to less hard-hit destinations next month.South Korea is also among the countries seeking to prevent a resurgence of the outbreak, reporting 37 new cases of COVID-19 on Monday. The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said 25 of the cases came from the Seoul area, where health authorities are scrambling to trace infections linked to entertainment and leisure activities, church gatherings, warehouse workers and door-to-door sellers.In France, restaurants in the Paris region will be allowed to join those in the rest of the country in opening indoor seating starting Monday. From June 22, all nursery schools, primary schools and junior high schools will be open and mandatory for all students. Authorities in Pakistan said they will reimpose strict lockdowns in selected areas of several cities from Monday night, a day after the federal government said COVID-19 cases could multiply eightfold by the end of July and hit 1.2 million.""A total of 20 cities across Pakistan have been identified as having likely increase in ratio/speed of infection, which needs restrictive measures for containment,"" said a statement Monday by the body that co-ordinates the national response to the virus.Pakistan has reported 144,477 cases of the respiratory illness and 2,729 deaths so far.In Africa, where the virus continues to spread, Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta's office says four people who work at the presidential residence have tested positive for COVID-19, though the president and his family do not appear to be affected.Ghana's Health Minister Kwaku Agyemang-Manu has contracted COVID-19 and is undergoing treatment at a hospital."

U.S. begins to pare back Hong Kong's special status amid scrutiny over security law | CBC News,"The U.S. began eliminating Hong Kong's special status under U.S. law on Monday, halting defence exports and restricting the territory's access to high technology products as China prepares new Hong Kong security legislation.",2020-06-29T23:42:07.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/hong-kong-us-security-law-special-status-1.5632161,"The U.S. began eliminating Hong Kong's special status under U.S. law on Monday, halting defence exports and restricting the territory's access to high technology products as China prepares new Hong Kong security legislation.The U.S. move comes as the top decision-making body of China's parliament deliberates a draft national security law for Hong Kong that pro-democracy activists in the city fear will be used to eliminate dissent and tighten Beijing's control.""The Chinese Communist Party's decision to eviscerate Hong Kong's freedoms has forced the Trump administration to re-evaluate its policies toward the territory,"" U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said.The Chinese embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Last month, U.S. President Donald Trump responded to China's plans for the security law by saying he was initiating a process to eliminate special economic treatment that has allowed Hong Kong to remain a global financial centre since its handover by Britain in 1997.Trump stopped short of calling for an immediate end to privileges but said the moves would affect the full range of U.S. agreements with Hong Kong, from an extradition treaty to export controls on dual-use technologies and more — ""with few exceptions.""The U.S. Commerce Department said it was suspending ""preferential treatment to Hong Kong over China, including the availability of export-license exceptions.""Further actions to eliminate Hong Kong's status were being evaluated, the departmemt said.In 2018, $432.7 million US of goods were shipped to Hong Kong under a Commerce Department exception, mostly relating to encryption, software and technology.Pompeo said the United States, effective Monday, was ending exports of defence equipment to Hong Kong and will also take steps to end the export of dual-use technologies, which have both commercial and military uses.Last year, the Department of State approved approximately $2.4 million US worth of controlled defence articles and services to Hong Kong government authorities, of which approximately $1.4 million US worth was shipped, according State Department records.""The United States is forced to take this action to protect U.S. national security,"" Pompeo said. ""We can no longer distinguish between the export of controlled items to Hong Kong or to mainland China.""The announcements come at a time of intensified U.S. rhetoric against Beijing as Trump campaigns for re-election in November. Opinion polls have shown voters increasingly embittered toward China, especially over the coronavirus, which began there."
'Window of opportunity' remains to tackle climate crisis as U.S. exits Paris deal: expert | CBC Radio,"As Americans await the results of Tuesday’s federal election, experts say the U.S. needs a president that will not only bring the country back into the Paris climate agreement, but step up the country’s commitments to address climate change.",2020-11-05T18:50:46.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/radio/thecurrent/the-current-for-nov-5-2020-1.5790706/window-of-opportunity-remains-to-tackle-climate-crisis-as-u-s-exits-paris-deal-expert-1.5790770,"Read Story TranscriptAs Americans await the results of Tuesday's federal election, experts say the U.S. needs a president that will not only bring the country back into the Paris climate agreement, but step up the country's commitments to address climate change.""Everything is at stake here,"" said Michael Mann, a climate scientist and distinguished professor of atmospheric science at Pennsylvania State University.""But there's still a window of opportunity. There's still time to do what's necessary to reduce carbon emissions so that we don't cross that threshold into catastrophic climate change.""On Wednesday, the United States officially withdrew from the Paris Agreement, a pact between 197 countries to fight climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to global warming. Countries are aiming to keep global temperature increases below 1.5 C this century.U.S. President Donald Trump announced plans to withdraw from the pact back in 2017, arguing it would undermine the country's economy, but he was unable to do so until now because of requirements under the agreement.Mann told The Current's Matt Galloway that the United States and other countries will have to go ""well beyond"" the Paris deal to achieve the emissions reductions the world needs.And Jessica Green agrees.""The Paris Agreement is not going to save us,"" said the University of Toronto political science professor, who specializes in international climate policy.However, if Democratic candidate Joe Biden wins the presidency, she believes some of his climate plans could be a step in the right direction.If elected, Biden has promised to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, and on Wednesday he tweeted that he would rejoin the Paris Agreement within 77 days.Today, the Trump Administration officially left the Paris Climate Agreement. And in exactly 77 days, a Biden Administration will rejoin it. <a href=""https://t.co/L8UJimS6v2"">https://t.co/L8UJimS6v2</a>""It is in some ways important for the U.S. to send that signal, and especially to repair so much of the damage that the Trump administration has done,"" said Green. ""But at the same time, the design of the Paris Agreement is such that success doesn't necessarily depend on the U.S. ""Every country gets to decide what it is going to do.""Unfortunately, said Mann, the U.S.'s withdrawal has in part, given some countries the green light to backstep on their own commitments under the Paris deal.""China, for example, which had been actually decommissioning coal-fired power plants and was going well beyond its Paris commitments, sort of started to ease off,"" he said. ""That's why leadership here in the United States is so important.""Elan Strait, director of U.S. climate campaigns with the World Wildlife Fund, said that by withdrawing from the Paris Agreement, the U.S. also signalled that it doesn't care about holding other countries like China accountable for their environmental regulations""Also, there's a multi-trillion-dollar market that is being created right now for clean energy, and the U.S. is in danger of being completely left behind,"" Strait added.Strait said the U.S. needs to make climate change a ""complete prioritization"" throughout its foreign policy portfolio if it wants to make inroads.While he doesn't think there is currently the political will to take an aggressive approach on the issue, that could change if the U.S. were to re-enter the Paris Agreement, he said.That aggressive approach is exactly what Green said is needed.Every year, the UN releases a report that highlights the gap between current global temperature increases and the Paris Agreement pledge to keep global warming to less than 1.5 degrees.""And every year that gap gets larger,"" said Green.""This is an existential crisis, and an existential crisis requires existential politics.""Written by Kirsten Fenn, with files from CBC News.

But many in Hong Kong feel their independence is eroding.The recent unrest in Hong Kong began as a series of protests against a now-suspended bill that would have allowed Hong Kong authorities to extradite suspected criminals to mainland China. The demonstrations have since expanded into a larger series of actions against what the protesters see as Hong Kong's pro-Beijing government.Domestically, China initially censored any online discussions about the protest movement, Fang said. But Beijing later seized upon instances of violence as an opportunity to cast the protesters as ""thugs,"" or more recently, ""terrorists.""Protesters ""are posing a severe challenge to law and order in Hong Kong,"" Liu Xiaoming, China's ambassador to London, warned on Thursday.<a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/ICYMI?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#ICYMI</a> Chinese ambassador: Beijing not to ""sit by and watch"" if <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/HongKong?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#HongKong</a> protests turn into unrest <a href=""https://t.co/68dVdy2txK"">https://t.co/68dVdy2txK</a> <a href=""https://t.co/sYlHk26YaD"">pic.twitter.com/sYlHk26YaD</a>Much of the pro-government messaging comes through state-controlled media channels such as the Global Times or CGTN television network and their respective social media accounts.The state media's attitude toward calls for direct democracy in Hong Kong ""range from unsympathetic to hostile,"" said Christopher Rea, associate head of the University of British Columbia's department of Asian studies.But there are other pro-government voices online that can't be linked back to Beijing so easily.A search on Thursday found 230 tweets posted during a 24-hour period containing the pro-government phrase ""Hong Kong is a part of China forever."" Many of the tweets came from new accounts with few, or no, followers — often a tell-tale sign of a bot account.Hong Kong is a part of China, forever🇨🇳<br>早日平安❤️<br>⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️Some suspect accounts appear to be deployed specifically to sow debate over who's responsible for some particularly violent episodes.One such incident occurred at the Hong Kong airport on Sunday when protesters accused police of shooting a woman in the eye with a beanbag round at close range.Tweets blaming security forces for the woman's injury were often flooded with replies that questioned whether the police were involved at all.""Actually it wasn't by police but one of the protesters,"" read a reply from an account with no followers.""I don't think it had enough power to breakdown goggles,"" claimed another account.Neither of those two accounts appear to have previously tweeted before this month.Sanjay Ruparelia, Ryerson University's Jarislowsky Democracy Chair, said it's not surprising that Beijing is trying to misrepresent what is happening in Hong Kong, but it could backfire.The ""campaign of disinformation,"" he said, ""is likely to make Hong Kongers even more passionate about protecting their civil liberties and distrustful of Beijing."""

"TikTok sues Trump administration over U.S. ban, calling it an election ploy | CBC News","TikTok said on Monday that ""we simply have no choice"" but to sue the Trump administration over U.S. President Donald Trump’s executive order banning U.S. transactions with the popular short-form video-sharing app.",2020-08-24T16:02:24.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/tik-tok-lawsuit-1.5697649,"TikTok on Monday sued U.S. President Donald Trump's administration over his executive order banning transactions in the United States with the popular short-form video-sharing app, calling it a pretext to fuel anti-China rhetoric as he seeks reelection.In a blog post, TikTok said it strongly disagreed with the White House's position that the company was a national security threat, saying it had ""taken extraordinary measures to protect the privacy and security of TikTok's U.S. user data.""Both the app and parent company ByteDance Ltd also described Trump's call in his Aug. 6 executive order for a TikTok ban as a means to further his alleged ""broader campaign of anti-China rhetoric.""They further claim this is ahead of the Nov. 3 U.S. presidential election, where Trump is seeking a second term.It also said the administration has ignored its ""extensive efforts"" to address its concerns, and accused Trump of politicizing the dispute.""We do not take suing the government lightly,"" TikTok said. ""But with the Executive Order threatening to bring a ban on our U.S. operations ... we simply have no choice.""The White House referred a request for comment to the U.S. Department of Justice, which declined to comment.Amid growing distrust between Washington and Beijing, Trump has for weeks complained that TikTok, owned by Chinese company ByteDance Ltd, was a national security threat and might share information about users with the Chinese government.His Aug. 6 executive order called for banning transactions with the app after 45 days.Trump issued a separate executive order on Aug. 14 giving ByteDance 90 days to divest TikTok's U.S. operations and any data.Reuters reported mid-August that TikTok was preparing to mount a legal challenge as early as Monday to Trump's Aug. 6 order.ByteDance had acquired Shanghai-based video app Musical.ly in a $1 billion transaction in 2017, and relaunched it as TikTok the following year.In its blog post, TikTok said the Trump administration violated its constitutional right to due process by banning the company without notice.It accused Trump of misusing the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which lets the president regulate international commerce during a national emergency.Trump had in May 2019 invoked that law to stop alleged efforts by foreign telecommunications companies to conduct economic and industrial espionage against the United States.The lawsuit filed in Los Angeles federal court names Trump, the U.S. Department of Commerce and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross as defendants.But TikTok said the Aug. 6 executive order was not supported by the emergency Trump declared a year earlier, and that the company did not provide the types of technology and services contemplated at that time.It also said the executive order was not rooted in genuine national security concerns, adding: ""We believe the Administration's decisions were heavily politicized, and industry experts have said the same.""ByteDance has been in talks to sell TikTok's North American, Australian and New Zealand operations to companies including Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Oracle Corp (ORCL.N).Those assets could be worth $25 billion to $30 billion, people familiar with the matter have said.Before buying TikTok, ByteDance had not sought advance approval from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which reviews acquisitions for potential national security risks.CFIUS later opened an investigation and on July 30 found national security risks associated with the purchase.But it ""repeatedly refused"" to engage with ByteDance's proposals to address concerns, including a nonbinding letter of intent to sell to Microsoft presented earlier July 30, according to the lawsuit."

From centralized online schools to on-demand classes — remote learning won't be one-size fits all | CBC News,"Myriad Canadians got a rough introduction to learning online when the pandemic closed schools this spring. As districts grapple with a return to class this fall, questions also remain about what school online will look like. We try to answer some of them.",2020-08-24T08:00:37.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/e-learning-fall-update-1.5695047,"Myriad Canadians got a rough introduction to online education when the pandemic closed classrooms this spring and forced educators into rapid implementation of ""emergency learning at home."" Now, as Canadian school districts grapple with a physical return to class in September, many are making plans for remote instruction, too.Thousands of families across Canada have opted to continue with distance schooling, but questions remain about what that will entail. We tried to find answers to some of them:In different regions, districts are centralizing their virtual offerings. The Calgary Catholic School District, for example, created a whole new virtual elementary school named Saint Isidore, after the seventh-century scholar and bishop whom the late Pope John Paul II dubbed ""the patron saint of the internet.""Days ahead of an Aug. 21 deadline, close to 3,000 of the district's 60,000 students had already registered for the school, said district chief superintendent Bryan Szumlas. In a preliminary survey by the Toronto District School Board, approximately 60,000 of its 250,000 students chose remote learning, said Ryan Bird, TDSB manager of corporate and social media relations. In response, Canada's largest school board is centralizing its virtual operation, which will have a dedicated superintendent, principals, vice-principals and teachers teaching the Ontario curriculum remotely.""There is live online learning throughout the day, every day, trying to, as best we can, to mimic that in-person learning experience,"" Bird said.Though Regina Public Schools hasn't finalized numbers, it is also setting up a centralized virtual school, and in its case, the division will unite dedicated teachers under one roof as well.Working from one location will help ensure ""robust"" internet connectivity on the teachers' side while staff will ""also benefit from working together with their colleagues, so they can share information,"" said Terry Lazarou, supervisor of communications for Regina Public Schools. ""They could share tips and tricks and basically become better at doing this as the year proceeds.""Students won't be allowed to bounce between online and in-class learning. School divisions, districts and boards are generally specifying that families who register for the remote option can change to in-person only at set times, for instance, at the end of a reporting term.Unlike the ad-hoc solutions put in place when the pandemic hit, school boards say they're intentionally creating virtual schools with separate, dedicated staff adhering to the same curriculum as their in-class peers. ""[The last school year] was essentially making do under tremendously difficult circumstances,"" said Bird. ""This is a fully online virtual school.""Lazarou, of Regina Public Schools, echoed that sentiment. ""It's going to involve actual teachers who have a work day. It's going to take place during the school day,"" he said. ""This is going to be real-time during school hours ... [so that] the students participate in the learning.""Looking to the fall, e-learning specialist Marina Milner-Bolotin foresees several challenges, beginning with technological concerns for both students and teachers — everything from familiarity with online tools to reliable internet connections and access to devices.Educators will need to not only learn how to teach students online but also how to engage and assess them online, and evaluate the availability of at-home support.    ""Online education requires parental involvement at a very different level than face-to-face,"" said Milner-Bolotin, a University of British Columbia professor who specializes in STEM education and technology in teaching.Education ministries and school districts should ensure students have the devices and web access they need and lean on the existing e-learning expertise at universities and in other sectors to help K-12 teachers this fall, she said.Also key will be establishing a more direct partnership with caregivers at home.In many provinces, ""the trust between the teachers and the government, the teachers and the parents, is broken,"" Milner-Bolotin said.""Together, we can solve the problem, because it doesn't make sense that we're facing such a huge challenge — how to educate the next generation of students — and each one of us is trying to solve it alone.""Families will have an important role to play in supporting the youngest remote learners or those not used to an online environment, said Terry Lazarou of Regina Public Schools.""We're asking families and parents to ensure that they have good learning spaces in their homes: good, quiet spaces, a good surface to learn on, to work on; that parents or other caregivers in the house can provide support during the day while school is going on,"" he said. Milner-Bolotin agreed, saying that e-learning can be a challenge when adults are not present to support it.The Vancouver-based professor says teachers must also adapt to the medium since ""talking-head mode"" won't translate online.Whether it's online or face-to-face, the younger the student, the shorter the attention span, she said. For students of any age, ""it's very difficult to sit passively in front of a computer and listen to a lecture non-stop,"" she said.""That's the issue with remote teaching: a lot of people believe that they will take teaching practices they had in the classroom, dump it all online — record their lessons — and it will be the same,"" Milner-Bolotin said. ""Good teachers know how much engagement matters. The teachers have to think of how to do it so that the kids can get involved and also produce something.""Inconsistency in direct communication between teachers and students this spring sparked talk about the need for ""live, synchronous delivery."" In general, e-learning can be synchronous or asynchronous: everyone logs in at the same time or lessons are accessed on demand.When teaching a synchronous math class, for instance, the expectation is that all students are there at the same time as the teacher. ""We're all in one virtual classroom,"" said Milner-Bolotin.One benefit is that students can ask teachers questions right away. But there can be challenges, she said. What if someone's internet goes out; or students get pulled away from the computer for whatever reason; or if a large class experiences bandwidth issues because everyone is using video?Asynchronous delivery, on the other hand, allows students to access lessons at a time suited to them. This can be helpful, for instance, in a household juggling devices between siblings or between parents and kids. Milner-Bolotin prefers a blend of the two delivery methods. For instance, a teacher might still record a live lesson and make it available for students to review later if needed.Milner-Bolotin also advocates using discussion boards and other virtual spaces ""where people can meet with the teachers or students can meet amongst themselves, and then they can ask each other questions.""Not all teachers have prior expertise in online learning. During the months of school closures, those teachers who did have e-learning experience supported their colleagues but had to balance that with their own classes, according to Sarah Barrett, an associate professor in the faculty of education at York University in Toronto. Barrett is currently studying the experiences of Ontario teachers during the shift to online instruction early in the pandemic. After surveying more than 760 K-12 educators and interviewing more than four dozen, she's learned teachers aren't as concerned about training on specific platforms, for example. Rather, they want e-learning coaches and facilitators to be available to support them.""They need those teachers that do have the knowledge, that are certified and have knowledge of e-learning, understanding of subject-specific requirements and age-group requirements,"" Barrett said.Teachers would prefer that those experts be dedicated to coaching them and providing assistance specific to their classes and context.The principles behind e-learning aren't drastically different from in-class learning, Barrett said: creating a community, developing relationships and establishing structures and routines so that students can focus on content and collaborating.""That's true in-person or online,"" she said."

He said some teachers have travelled to nearby countries and others are teaching online because the semesters have been delayed. But he expects this is not just a short-term problem.""It certainly just leaves a stain on people's impression of China,"" Henrickson said. ""Because four months from now and six months from now if China comes up, you know they will remember this thing that was splattered on the news.""This perception could also have financial repurcussions.The global economic impact of the coronavirus could be worse than SARS because the world has never been more interdependent than today, said Victor Cui, an associate professor in business strategy at the Asper School of Business at the University of Manitoba.""It's playing a very heavy role in the world's economy and stability — much heavier than 17 years ago when we had SARS virus,"" Cui said. China's economy might take months or even years to recover, which could impact Manitobans too, he said. In order to help stop the spread of the coronavirus, some manufacturing, retail and service companies have shut down or slowed down.""The Lunar New Year is equivalent to our Christmas but it is longer. It's like 15 days of celebration,"" Cui said. ""Last year alone the restaurant industry made about Cdn $200 billion,"" he added.A slow-down in the service industry in China means fewer exports of lobsters and crabs from Canada's coast to China, Cui said. That could also mean Manitoba pork exports to China might slow down, too.""Every company that relies on Chinese [factories] to make their products or depends on Chinese consumers for sales will experience a very costly problem very soon or [has] already experienced that,"" Cui said. Beyond companies, Cui said consumers ""will feel the pain."" ""If China stopped producing stuff, or delayed delivering everything we need [from] Walmart, we are going to see that happening in the next few months or next quarter,"" Cui said."

""I've been here for 50 years. I just can't get it out of my blood.""The decision to close, according to his son Craig McKillop said, has been an emotional one. The outpouring of public sympathy since the closure was announced has been ""overwhelming and much appreciated,"" he said.'My phone hasn't stopped since last night when we posted it [on Facebook]. It's unreal. People have been saying how much they're going to miss it, how kind-hearted everyone has been to them.""The family did not elaborate on the illness, saying it wanted to keep the details private.More than a dozen customers lined up at the door before the shop opened Tuesday morning, the day after the closing-out sale was announced on Facebook.""It's very sad,"" said Tanya McKinney, whose family has shopped at Hayward and Warwick for decades.""I was a little girl when I first came here,"" she said.

"Barring Taiwan from WHO is a serious health concern, Canada and allies say | CBC News","Canada, the United States and six major allies have told the World Health Organization that its ongoing exclusion of Taiwan has created a serious public health concern during the COVID-19 crisis.",2020-05-17T18:11:45.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/barring-taiwan-from-who-is-a-serious-health-concern-canada-u-s-and-allies-say-1.5573865,"Canada, the United States and six major allies have told the World Health Organization (WHO) that its ongoing exclusion of Taiwan has created a serious public health concern during the COVID-19 crisis.That sharp message was delivered in a letter, a draft of which has been viewed by The Canadian Press, that tells WHO director general Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreysus to allow Taiwan to be given observer status at a major meeting of the organization on Monday.Geneva-based diplomats from Canada, Australia, France, Germany, New Zealand, Britain, Japan and the U.S. issued the demand orally in a May 7 meeting with two other senior WHO officials, with the envoys from Washington and Tokyo taking the lead.Canadian health officials also took part Friday in a videoconference that was hosted by Taiwan's Ministry of Health and Welfare, said a senior government official, who was not authorized to speak publicly about the issue due to its sensitivity.Support for Taiwan is controversial because China vigorously opposes granting any such access. It views Taiwan as a breakaway province and wants the world to heed its ""one-China policy.""While Canada does not recognize Taiwan's sovereignty, it does maintain trade and cultural relations, and Foreign Affairs Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne has said the island's presence as a non-state observer at this week's meetings would help the pandemic fight.The draft of the letter delivers a sharp explanation of that point: it says Taiwan's early success at controlling the pandemic qualifies it for a seat at the World Health Assembly meetings, and the letter essentially tells the agency to stop playing politics.""Taiwan's isolation from the global health community not only presents a serious public health concern, but also is an obstacle that hampers ongoing and future efforts,"" letter states.WATCH | Trudeau questioned on China and Taiwan:Politics NewsThe letter also says the international community is ""harmed"" when important health information is not permitted to ""flow freely and easily.""The letter calls Taiwan a capable and responsible player in the world's health community, and says it has scientific and technical expertise ""that could help save lives around the world.""The letter says it was ""regrettable"" that the WHO broke with its guiding principles by excluding Taiwan from the assembly. It defines the WHO's guiding principle as ensuring that ""all people"" have a right to the highest health standards, regardless of political belief, race, religion or economic or social conditions.Prime Minister Justin Trudeau spoke Friday with his British counterpart Boris Johnson and they discussed their work together in ""various international organizations, and committed to continuing to work together on shared priorities such as combating climate change and promoting democratic values,"" according to the Prime Minister's Office.The WHO has faced accusations from U.S. President Donald Trump and Canada's Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer that it is too cozy with China, and that the People's Republic was not forthcoming to the international health agency as the pandemic was breaking out in Wuhan earlier this year.The move is politically sensitive for Canada because it is mired in a dispute with China over what Canada calls the ""arbitrary"" imprisonment of Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor.Despite co-operation on health and trade since the pandemic's outbreak, relations between Canada and China have been severely strained since the RCMP arrested Chinese high-tech scion Meng Wanzhou on an American extradition warrant in December 2018.China arrested Kovrig and Spavor nine days later in what is widely viewed as retaliation and has levelled accusations that the former diplomat and the entrepreneur were engaged in actions undermining China's national security. Canada has marshalled a broad coalition of international support calling for their release and that has angered Chinese leaders.The message in the letter to the WHO is echoed in a new report released this past week by the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, an agency of Congress that advises on the national security implications of trade with China. It says Taiwan's continued exclusion from the WHO is ""jeopardizing global health.""The report noted the WHO ignored Taiwan's early requests for information about the pandemic, which it said created ""critical delays"" in how other countries responded.""The spread of the virus to 185 countries — with more than four million confirmed cases and 286,000 deaths worldwide as of May 12 — demonstrates the deadly ramifications of China's influence over the WHO for the international community's pandemic preparedness,"" says the U.S. report.""Had the WHO allowed Taiwan's health experts to share information and best practices in early January, governments around the world could have had more complete information on which to base their public health policies.""As of Tuesday, Taiwan had 440 confirmed cases of COVID-19, a ""stunningly low"" number in a population of 23.6 million, the report said.Adam Austen, a spokesperson for Champagne, reiterated Canada's support for ""Taiwan's meaningful participation in international multilateral fora where its presence provides important contributions to the public good.""Canada has ""clearly communicated"" to the WHO that Taiwan should be allowed to take part in the upcoming World Health Assembly meetings, said Austin.""We continue to encourage the WHO to engage with experts from Taiwan and to support Taiwan's meaningful inclusion in global discussions on health.""The spokesperson for China's foreign ministry once again registered Beijing's strong objections on Friday to including Taiwan at the WHO, calling it an attempt to ""seek independence under the pretext of the pandemic with the help of some Western countries.""Spokesman Zhao Lijian said the ""few countries"" that are backing Taiwan ""are only aiming to politicize the health issue to seek selfish political gains,"" according to a translation of his remarks on his ministry's website. He said that would only result in ""hijacking"" the organization and ""undermining global anti-pandemic co-operation."""

Kenyan athletes say top track official asked for bribes to cut doping bans,"Two Kenyan athletes banned for doping at the 2015 world championships say the chief executive of Athletics Kenya, the country's governing body for track and field, asked them each for a $24,000 US bribe to reduce their suspensions.",2016-02-10T00:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/sports/olympics/summer/trackandfield/kenyan-athletes-doping-bribery-1.3441862,"Two Kenyan athletes serving four-year bans for doping at the 2015 world championships say the chief executive of Athletics Kenya, the country's governing body for track and field, asked them each for a $24,000 US bribe to reduce their suspensions.Joy Sakari and Francisca Koki Manunga told The Associated Press that CEO Isaac Mwangi asked for the payment in an Oct. 16 meeting, but that they could not raise the money. They were then were informed of their four-year bans in a Nov. 27 email, but never filed a criminal complaint because, they say, they had no proof to back up their bribery accusation and also feared repercussions.Mwangi dismissed the allegation as ""just a joke,"" denied ever meeting privately with the athletes and said Athletics Kenya has no power to shave time off athletes' bans.""We have heard stories, athletes coming and saying, 'Oh, you know, I was asked for money,""' Mwangi said. ""But can you really substantiate that?""Sakari, a 400-meter runner, and Manunga, a hurdler, told AP they would be willing to testify to the ethics commission of the IAAF, the global governing body of athletics.The commission already is investigating allegations that AK officials sought to subvert anti-doping in Kenya, solicited bribes and offered athletes reduced bans. The probe has led to the suspensions of AK's president, Isaiah Kiplagat, a vice president, David Okeyo, and AK's former treasurer, Joseph Kinyua.Sharad Rao, a former director of prosecutions in Kenya who also has adjudicated cases for the Court of Arbitration for Sport, is leading the ethics investigation for the International Association of Athletics Federations. Sakari and Manunga's decision to come forward could be a breakthrough, because Kenyan athletes have been unwilling to act as whistleblowers.""There is obviously the reluctance on the part of the athletes to come forward,"" Rao said. ""They don't want to stand out.""As many as a half-dozen banned athletes have privately indicated to the IAAF commission that AK officials sought to extort them and that they feel their sanctions might have been less if they had paid bribes, Rao said.AP's interview with Sakari and Manunga is the first time Kenyan athletes have detailed such allegations publicly.""That information would, of course, be very, very significant, very important for us,"" Rao said.Rao said he has been talking to at least one other athlete who may have been approached for a bribe, and that his first priority was to get responses from Kiplagat, Okeyo and Kinyua — all three of whom have flatly denied to him that they took or solicited bribes.Sakari and Manunga, both police officers in Kenya, said Mwangi asked them for 2.5 million Kenyan shillings — or $24,000 — each.""I told him I've never seen that much money in my life,"" Manunga told AP. ""Even if I sold everything, I wouldn't be able to get together that amount of money.""The athletes tested positive in August for furosemide, a diuretic banned because it can mask the use of forbidden performance-enhancers, and were sent home from the worlds in Beijing. They told AP the drug was sold to them by a chemist in the Kenyan capital, Nairobi, who said it would alleviate side effects of supplements they were taking. The chemist testified in defense of the athletes to AK, saying he gave them furosemide to combat water-retention caused by the supplement.Compared to doping cases involving other athletes, their four-year bans appear harsh. World Anti-Doping Agency rules classify furosemide as a so-called ""specified substance,"" distinguishing it from hardcore performance-enhancers like steroids or the blood-boosting hormone EPO.For specified substances, IAAF rules allow for lesser bans of no more than two years, or even just a reprimand and no ban, if athletes can prove they weren't at fault or negligent.To impose a four-year ban, the rules require authorities to establish that athletes intentionally cheated. But AK appears to have discounted the chemist's testimony. In the letter it sent to Manunga announcing her ban, AK said there was no ""plausible explanation"" for using furosemide and that the federation ""can only infer"" she took it intentionally as a masking agent."

It has removed the ad and apologized.The original ad starring Boyega, 28, aired last year and was called The London Gent. It features the London-born actor walking around the neighbourhood where he grew up and riding a horse in a park, and it makes reference to his Nigerian heritage in a scene featuring West African attire.""The film celebrated my personal story — showcasing my hometown, including my friends and featuring my family,"" Boyega wrote.Their decision to replace my campaign in China by using my concepts and substituting a local brand ambassador for me, without either my consent or prior notice, was wrong. The film celebrated my personal story– showcasing my hometown, including my friends and featuring my family.""While many brands understandably use a variety of global and local ambassadors, dismissively trading out one's culture this way is not something I can condone.""It's not the first time Boyega has been deleted from a China-based ad. He played a leading role as Finn in 2015's Star Wars: The Force Awakens, but he and other nonwhite characters were removed or diminished from a Chinese poster for the movie.In an interview with GQ magazine, Boyega recently said that Black characters have been ""pushed to the side"" in Disney's Star Wars franchise. In June, the star made an emotional speech on racism when he joined Black Lives Matter protests in London.  "

That comes right in the middle of Liu's visit.Differences over the enforcement mechanism for a trade deal and a timeline for tariff removal have been sticking points.U.S. President Donald Trump said on Wednesday he would be happy to keep tariffs on Chinese imports in place, adding that China is mistaken if it hopes to negotiate trade later with a Democratic presidential administration.The reason for the China pullback &amp; attempted renegotiation of the Trade Deal is the sincere HOPE that they will be able to “negotiate” with Joe Biden or one of the very weak Democrats, and thereby continue to ripoff the United States (($500 Billion a year)) for years to come....""The reason for the China pullback & attempted renegotiation of the Trade Deal is the sincere HOPE that they will be able to 'negotiate' with Joe Biden or one of the very weak Democrats,"" Trump tweeted.""Guess what, that's not going to happen! China has just informed us that they (Vice-Premier) are now coming to the U.S. to make a deal. We'll see, but I am very happy with over $100 Billion a year in Tariffs filling U.S. coffers,"" he added.China's exports fell unexpectedly in April, adding to pressure on Beijing ahead of the negotiations with Washington over Chinese technology ambitions.Earlier this week Trump sent global financial markets plunging with a surprise threat of more penalties on Chinese imports.April exports sank 2.7 per cent from a year ago to $193.5 billion US, a reverse from March's 14.2 per cent growth, customs data showed. That was well below private sector forecasts of growth in low single digits.Imports rose four per cent to $179.6 billion, rebounding from the previous month's 7.6 per cent decline. That added to signs government efforts to reverse an economic downturn might be gaining traction.Imports of American goods fell 26 per cent from a year earlier to $10.3 billion. Exports to the United States, China's biggest foreign market, were down 13 per cent at $31.4 billion.Talks are expected to resume Thursday despite earlier fears Beijing might pull out due to Trump's threat. China said Tuesday its economy czar will participate as scheduled.Weak trade figures might ""add more pressure to leaders from both sides to get a deal done,"" Macquarie Bank said in a report. It said the decision to send Vice Premier Liu He to Washington suggests ""China doesn't want the talks to break.""Washington is pressing Beijing to roll back plans for government-led creation of Chinese global competitors in robotics, electric cars and other technologies. The United States also wants other changes including cuts in subsidies to Chinese industry."

Chinese ambassador to India says soldiers have pulled back after deadly Himalayas clash | CBC News,China's ambassador to India said Friday that Indian and Chinese front-line troops are disengaging in accordance with an agreement reached by military commanders following a clash last month that left at least 20 soldiers dead in the Galwan Valley.,2020-07-10T16:51:14.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/china-india-ladakh-dispute-1.5644956,"China's ambassador to India said Friday that Indian and Chinese front-line troops are disengaging in accordance with an agreement reached by military commanders following a clash last month that left at least 20 soldiers dead in the Galwan Valley.Ambassador Sun Weidong said in video remarks released in New Delhi that the two countries should be partners rather than rivals and handle differences properly to bring their ties back on the right track.""Why should we fight against each other, which will only hurt those close to us and gladden the foes?"" he said.Indian officials say a standoff between the two armies began in early May when large contingents of Chinese soldiers entered deep inside Indian-controlled territory at three places in Ladakh, a disputed region along the Himalayan frontier.The situation turned deadly when the rival troops engaged in hand-to-hand fighting in the Galwan Valley, where India is building a strategic road connecting the region to an airstrip close to China.India says 20 of its soldiers were killed and there were casualties on the Chinese side as well, which Beijing has not disclosed.As part of an understanding reached in a series of meetings between army commanders from the two sides, soldiers have started pulling back at some points in the troubled area.The Chinese envoy said the boundary question remains sensitive and complicated.""We need to find a fair and reasonable solution mutually acceptable through equal consultation and peaceful negotiation. Pending an ultimate settlement, we both agree to work together to maintain peace and tranquility in the border areas,"" he said.The disputed border covers about 3,500 kilometres of frontier that the two countries call the Line of Actual Control and stretches from Ladakh in the north to the Indian state of Sikkim in the northeast.India and China fought a border war in 1962 that also spilled into Ladakh.The two countries have been trying to settle their border dispute since the early 1990s, without success.Senior foreign ministry officials of the two countries through video conferencing on Friday reviewed the progress made in ongoing disengagement process by the two armies at the disputed border that the two countries call the Line Of Actual Control.The sides reaffirmed that they ""will ensure complete disengagement of the troops along the Line of Actual Control and de-escalation from India-China border areas for full restoration of peace and tranquility"" in accordance with bilateral agreements and protocols, said a statement issued by India's External Affairs Ministry.The U.S., engaged in disputes with China on a number of economic and political fronts, has sided with its ally in the dispute.""The Chinese took incredibly aggressive action. The Indians have done their best to respond to that,"" U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in his weekly briefing with reporters on Wednesday.""I'd put this in the context of General Secretary Xi Jinping and his behaviour throughout the region, and indeed, throughout the world.""From the mountain ranges of the Himalayas to the waters of Vietnam's Exclusive Zone, to the Senkaku Islands, and beyond, Beijing has a pattern of instigating territorial disputes. The world shouldn't allow this bullying to take place, nor should it permit it to continue,"" said Pompeo."

Investigators believe the shooting was targeted, but so far see no evidence that it's connected to ongoing gang conflicts in the Lower Mainland.Both Zhu and Jin were key figures in the RCMP's failed E-Pirate investigation into money laundering that was launched in 2015.Documents related to E-Pirate alleged that Zhu ran an underground bank that laundered more than $200 million per year.All charges against Zhu, who denied all wrongdoing, were eventually stayed in November 2018.Federal prosecutors have refused to provide the reason why money-laundering charges against Silver International Ltd. and its two directors — Zhu and Caixuan Qin — were stayed in late 2018.Jin was also the subject of subsequent court filings by the B.C. government that claimed he was a high-end loan shark.Jin, who was banned from casinos by the B.C. Lottery Corp., delivered up to $2 million in cash to clients at coffee shops and other spots in Richmond, according to allegations in BCLC and Gaming Policy Enforcement Branch documents.In a forfeiture case filed in February 2020, the government asked that a $25,000 bank draft found in Jin's Mercedes and made out to a casino be forfeited as a proceed of crime.Zhu's alleged underground bank and the methods of moving money came up at the Cullen Commission, which was established in May 2019 to examine and make recommendations on how to combat money laundering in B.C.An expert panel set up by the B.C. government estimated more than $7 billion in dirty money was laundered in the province in 2018.During hearings at the Cullen Commission, criminologist Stephen Schneider described the ""Vancouver model"" used to launder illegal funds from China and revenue from drug trafficking.  The model, which has since been studied worldwide, involves moving large amounts of funds from China through informal value transfer systems to avoid China's limits on money leaving the country. Once in Canada, those funds are mixed with cash from the drug trade, and the cash is then laundered through B.C. casinos and private mortgages.Schneider said Silver International Ltd. was at the centre of this operation.""You wouldn't have the Vancouver model without Silver International and their directors,"" Schneider said.IHIT is asking anyone with information on the shooting to call its information line at 1-877-551-4448, or email ihitinfo@rcmp-grc.gc.ca. Those who want to remain anonymous can contact Crime Stoppers at 1-800-222-8477.Investigators are also asking any drivers with dashcam video from the area of Garden City Road between Capstan Way and Cambie Road between 6:30 p.m. and 8:30 p.m. PT on Friday to contact them. There have been nine shootings in the Lower Mainland since Monday."

""I don't feel like it's Christmas without this.""David McCready of the Saint John Community Food Basket said the Harbour Lights campaign is more than just a nice initiative put on by CBC and Port Saint John.""This is essential to our operation … if not for Harbour Lights we probably wouldn't be able to operate,"" said McCready.""It's overwhelming in the amount that is raised.""McCready said about 70 per cent of his organization's budget for 2017 came from Harbour Lights.""And that can be said for a number of food banks in the area,"" he said.Greg Doucet of the New Brunswick Food Bank Association said the donations come at a critical time of year.""We're seeing an increase in the working poor, people who work minimum wage, who are trying to make ends meet and need extra help when the heat comes on,"" Doucet said.""In the winter, hydro bills get more expensive and people need help. They come, they don't abuse it. It's a big challenge to humble yourself to come to the food bank and say, 'I need help.' We don't say we need help easily.""The Harbour Lights campaign raises money for food banks from St. Stephen to Saint John and Sussex.Each year, Port Saint John installs a giant, 30-metre tall Christmas tree made of hundreds of twinkling lights near the Saint John Harbour.Each $2 donation lights a bulb. And as December progresses, bulb by bulb the tree is lit.This year, it only took six days to reach the campaign goal of $50,000, and the star has been shining ever since."

""We have to wait three to four hours, at least, to get through.""Wang also expects fears around the virus will continue during peak travel in the summer months.While many Canadians are trying to get out of China, David Klinck is one of those people trying to get into the country.He and his wife Huang Yuan were visiting family in Gatineau, Que. He wants to return home to China where he's lived for 15 years and runs a language training school.Klinck originally booked a flight between Montreal and Guangzhou, China last week, with a connecting flight in Beijing.The connecting flight with Air China was later cancelled, which would have left him and his wife stranded more than 2,000 kilometres from home.They're now hoping to get back home via Hong Kong, a more reasonable 130 km from home.""Hopefully we can fly to Hong Kong and then kind of go in through the back door and try to find a way with a boat or with a bus to get back into [mainland] China. Hopefully that border will be open by the time we get there,"" he said.Their new flight doesn't leave until Thursday but the situation is tense and could change rapidly, he said. Klinck's not certain that flight will still go forward.""Right now we're kind of in limbo."""
Iron ore 'one of the highlights' of N.L. economy amid catastrophic pandemic | CBC News,"While the demand for oil has dropped, the same can't be said for iron ore, which has remained relatively steady during the COVID-19 pandemic.",2020-05-21T09:30:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/nl-ioc-iron-ore-covid-19-china-1.5576800,"While oil rigs were shipping out of the Grand Banks and tankers were better off anchored, one part of the natural resources sector in Newfoundland and Labrador quietly chugged on.The COVID-19 outbreak hasn't affected the price of iron ore in the same way the pandemic has been blamed for the collapse of oil prices worldwide.While provincial revenue from mining pales in comparison with what usually comes from the oil industry, its continued contributions have become more important during a time of turmoil.""It's one of the few sectors that really has not turned down or turned off, actually, during this particular crisis,"" investment advisor Larry Short, a chartered professional accountant with ShortFinancial, told CBC News on Tuesday.""Everything else has essentially either been delayed, deferred or chopped. So yeah, it's been one of the highlights of the economy.""The mining industry as a whole contributed $235 million in tax revenue to the province in the 2018-19 fiscal year, while also accounting for about $1.5 billion of the province's nominal gross domestic product for the 2018 calendar year.There could be opportunities for the province to grow those numbers, as governments across the globe start implementing measures to get back to work.China presents a particularly intriguing potential, as the country's National People's Congress will begin its annual session Friday.The country responded to the global financial crisis of 2008 with a $563-billion stimulus package to stave off recession, but has been quiet so far as countries like the United States pledge trillions to COVID-19 measures.Amid the pandemic, China saw its economy in decline for the first time since it began reporting quarterly data in 1992. It remains unclear whether President Xi Jinping will push the country forward like in 2008, or take a more conservative approach.According to Tony Fang, an economics professor at Memorial University and past president of the Chinese Economists Society, stimulus measures would be north of $1 trillion. ""That's a lot of money on investments, mostly actually on new infrastructure projects to prop up economic growth,"" Fang told CBC recently.""Intercity highways, 5G, new technology sources and so on and so forth, which actually the Newfoundland and Labrador mining industry could potentially benefit [from].""Newfoundland and Labrador has a long history of trade with China, mostly in exporting seafood and iron ore.Fang said a Chinese stimulus plan would require plenty of the rich resource, and the Canadian province could find itself in an advantageous position because it has never been a thorn in China's side.The same cannot be said about the two largest exporters of iron ore to China.""Australia and Brazil both have engaged in quite aggressive criticisms against China's handling of the virus containment policies, especially early on,"" Fang said.Escalating tension could lead to changes in trade, which could put a heavier reliance on iron ore from Labrador.Clayton Walker, CEO of the Iron Ore Company of Canada, will be one of the people paying attention to what the nation does in the coming weeks.""China is one of the markets we sell to, so we definitely keep an eye on what China is or isn't doing,"" he told CBC this month.""China is opening back up and we're encouraged. Hopefully, those dollars they're putting into stimulus will continue coming our way.""IOC has managed to keep production going in Labrador West throughout the pandemic by implementing a number of measures to enhance worker safety.The company has staggered work schedules, promoted physical distancing, and done daily temperature checks on employees in order to keep work flowing.""The iron ore price has been relatively steady throughout this process, so we've been quite lucky in that regard,"" Walker said.As the rest of the western world watched the outbreak in Wuhan, China, and saw it as a foreign problem, Walker was worried about how it would affect IOC's business in Labrador and Quebec.""We saw this start to unfold as it kind of travelled around the world and the impacts it had as it went from one market to the next.

And, a public health official says, such high numbers at this point are likely a hoax. Rumours have been swirling online that the Chinese government is hiding the actual extent of the coronavirus outbreak, which took root there and is now spreading worldwide.QQ is an instant messenger, owned by the Chinese media company Tencent, that includes a news page. It counts around 900 million active users and has an ""epidemic situation tracker"" that reports real-time data of known coronavirus cases and deaths across China from over 170 sources, according to Tencent.On Sunday, a screenshot of the tracker began spreading on Chinese social media. It was said to have captured the accidental release of the ""real death toll"" — 24,589, far above the roughly 300 then recognized by the Chinese government. According to Dr. David Fisman, a professor of epidemiology at the University of Toronto and an infectious disease expert at Toronto Western Hospital, those numbers don't reflect what he and his colleagues are tracking.""We know enough about this that we can basically call B.S. on some scenarios,"" he said.Because people outside of China are also getting sick, Fisman says public health officials can track how the virus spreads, independently of numbers released by China. Fisman and epidemiologist Ashleigh R. Tuite modelled its spread and published their research in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine.""Based on what we think is going on, it would be very hard to get to 200,000 cases, or whatever is in the Tencent screenshot, and 25,000 deaths,"" he said. ""There's really no reason to embellish the seriousness of the situation, unless you have some ulterior motive, which I couldn't begin to speculate what that could be."" He cautions, though, that mathematical models don't necessarily represent the situation on the ground, and that the number of cases will grow in the future, especially as public health agencies get better at detecting and reporting them.The screenshot was first picked up by NTDTV, a U.S.-based, Mandarin-language news organization that's highly critical of the Chinese government. It then made its way onto the Taiwan News website in English — where it was described as the accidental release of the real numbers — before exploding on Western social media. On Thursday morning, British tabloid The Daily Mail ran a story on the screenshot, garnering some 8,000 shares on Facebook in a few hours.Users and media outlets speculated that a bug or coding error might have accidentally showed the ""real figures."" Others said that a whistleblower might have been trying to warn the world. However, it's easy to produce that screenshot using a feature present on most modern web browsers, which lets a user with a bit of know-how change the numbers displayed in the tracker. In a few seconds, CBC News was able to create a near-identical screenshot showing a massive death toll.This screenshot has not been altered in any way. It is a real screenshot of the site, but the numbers have been manipulated using a browser tool. These numbers did not show up on other users' computers, only on the computer used to change the figures. That means anyone could alter the tracker to display much lower numbers, higher numbers, or even text instead.It's important to note that only one copy of the screenshot with 24,589 deaths exists. If QQ had the higher death toll, even for just a few minutes, to its 899 million users, one would expect many different screenshots of the same figures to exist. Screenshots of QQ's website are therefore not definitive proof that those numbers were ever displayed for all to see on the website. And no archived version of the site exists showing the higher numbers, despite the fact that multiple archived versions of the site are available online. In a statement to CBC News, Tencent condemned the screenshots, which it called ""unscrupulous behaviour.""""Unfortunately, several social media sources have circulated doctored images of our 'Epidemic Situation Tracker' featuring false information which we never published,"" the company said. ""Tencent does not condone the dissemination of inaccurate information and fake news especially during this sensitive period."""

P.E.I. newcomers introduced to hotel industry through new tourism program | CBC News,"A new, free six week program is introducing newcomers on P.E.I. to the hotel and hospitality industries, even if COVID-19 has put a damper on their immediate job prospects.",2020-11-12T11:00:22.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-newcomers-hotel-industry-tourism-program-1.5797258,"A new, free six-week program is introducing newcomers on P.E.I. to the hotel and hospitality industries, even if COVID-19 has put a damper on their immediate job prospects.The Destination Employment program was first introduced in 2018, starting in Nova Scotia, with the goal of reducing labour shortages in the hotel sector and providing newcomers with their first Canadian workplace experience.The first 10 participants on P.E.I. are finishing up the program this week in Charlottetown. ""Prior to the pandemic, there was a labour shortage in hotels in Canada so it was really designed to help address that,"" said Alex MacKenzie, HR co-ordinator for the Tourism Industry Association of Prince Edward Island ""Tourism HR Canada figured who better but newcomers to Canada, who want to build a career here in Canada."" MacKenzie said the training focuses on employability skills, such as resume and cover letter writing as well as practice interviews, plus training programs for working in hotels such as the responsible beverage service course, first aid and CPR. ""They're also learning about what tourism's like here in Prince Edward Island and how much value that we put into tourism here on the Island,"" MacKenzie said.""So it's an excellent resource for them and we feel it's very rewarding for the participants."" The group currently in the program includes five newcomers from China, two from Vietnam and one each from Egypt, Turkey and Nigeria ""The response was excellent. We had ten newcomers for this sitting of the program and so that filled our program,"" MacKenzie said.Vivian Wei was a software engineer in China before moving to P.E.I. two years ago. ""Being a newcomer, I want to learn more about P.E.I., more about the culture and the tourism industry and, also, I want to improve my English,"" Wei said.   ""I think through this program I will have more friends and improve my networking skills that will help me to get a job and settle down in P.E.I. for a long time."" Wei said she was looking for a different career in Canada and that attracted her to the program. ""Because I'm a software engineer before I come here, so that's totally new for me if I were to work in the tourism industry,"" Wei said.""Everything is new, but it's exciting. So many new skills and knowledge, new certificates.""Wei said she's interested in working as an administrator, or a cashier or in housekeeping, but said the biggest skill she has learned is confidence.""Before this program, I feel nervous when I speak English with others. But after this six weeks, I feel more comfortable about that,"" Wei said.  ""I know what I can do, and I have confidence to apply for the job, and I have confidence to do the job."" Liling Bai operates a travel company that she started when she moved to P.E.I. in 2018.""I have learned a tremendous lot about the tourism industry in P.E.I. — and not only tourism, a whole lot about the industries and the cultures and histories in P.E.I.,"" Bai said.""Also, I think I my confidence in the English skills have improved a great deal.""MacKenzie said the program is also being offered in the Yukon, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Ontario and the other Atlantic provinces. ""The hope is that the participants would go into the workforce right away, but we know that that may not be the reality of the situation,"" MacKenzie said.  MacKenzie said the timing of the P.E.I. program during the COVID-19 pandemic has not been ideal.   ""The pandemic has obviously dampened the job market in Prince Edward Island, and in Canada as a whole, so we're hoping that they can try to find employment,"" MacKenzie said.""But it's not necessarily something that we're expecting to happen right off the bat, especially being as seasonal as Prince Edward Island is."" MacKenzie said a couple of the students in the program have been invited for job interviews. ""We'd like to see all of our participants employed in the hospitality industry,"" MacKenzie said. ""But other than that, I think it's successful in its own way, that we are providing them with the skills and the knowledge needed to build a future here in Canada.""MacKenzie said the Tourism Industry Association plans to offer the six-week program again in January. "

Meng Wanzhou lawyers claim Trump has 'poisoned' extradition proceedings | CBC News,Lawyers for Meng Wanzhou claim U.S. President Donald Trump has 'poisoned' extradition proceedings against the Huawei executive to the degree where the judge overseeing the hearing has no choice but to throw the case out.,2020-07-24T17:23:27.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/meng-wanzhou-update-july-2020-1.5661627,"Lawyers for Meng Wanzhou claim U.S. President Donald Trump has ""poisoned"" extradition proceedings against the Huawei executive to the degree where the judge overseeing the hearing has no choice but to throw the case out.In court documents filed in advance of a September hearing, Meng's defence team cites Trump's history of intervening in high-profile criminal cases to claim he would have no hesitation to make good on his threat to use their client as a bargaining chip in a global trade war.Lawyers for the Huawei chief financial officer also noted Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's comments about two Canadians detained in China in apparent retaliation for Meng's arrest.The lawyers claim Meng, 48, has been left in the impossible position of fearing that any attempt to defend herself may affect either the Chinese economy or the lives of two men.""These proceedings have been poisoned,"" Meng's lawyers claimed in a 28-page legal brief outlining their arguments.""They can no longer be reasonably regarded as fair, regardless of the undoubted good faith of the court.""Meng was arrested on an extradition warrant on Dec. 1, 2018, after landing in Vancouver on what was supposed to be a layover between Hong Kong and Mexico City.The U.S. wants to extradite Meng to New York to face charges of fraud and conspiracy.She is accused of lying to banks about Huawei's relationship with a company accused of violating U.S. economic sanctions against Iran. Prosecutors claim Meng's alleged lies placed banks at risk of loss and prosecution.The latest legal arguments are grounded in a statement Trump made to a reporter less than two weeks after Meng's arrest in which he was asked if he would intervene in the case. At the time, the United States had recently escalated the trade war with China, which is still in effect.""If I think it's good for what will be certainly the largest trade deal ever made — which is a very important thing — what's good for national security, I would certainly intervene if I thought it was necessary,"" Trump replied.Meng's lawyers say the actions of the president and U.S. Attorney General William Barr in the cases of both Trump's former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn and his political advisor Roger Stone make clear that his words are not just idle talk.Flynn — who Trump called ""a good guy"" — pleaded guilty twice to lying to the Federal Bureau of Investigation about conversations with Russia's ambassador, yet the case against him was dismissed after the U.S. Justice Department intervened.In February, Trump demanded a new trial for Stone, calling himself ""the chief law enforcement officer of the country."" More recently, he acted to commute Stone's three year prison sentence for witness tampering and lying to Congress.""The two examples show that the (U.S.) president not only thinks he can intervene in prosecutions, but that he will do so when it suits his political agenda,"" Meng's lawyers wrote.They also said that Trump has already said that ""there is MUCH more to come"" when it comes to interventions.The court documents also claim Trudeau contributed to the politicization of the case in statements he made to a French language TV show in December 2019 with regard to former diplomat Michael Kovrig and entrepreneur Michael Spavor.The two were detained in China within days of Meng's arrest and have since been accused of spying. Both men have been held in Chinese prisons for more than a year and a half.Trudeau claimed his government told the U.S. it ""should not sign a final and complete agreement with China that does not settle the question of Meng Wanzhou and the two Canadians.""""As a bargaining chip in a global trade war, (Meng faces) intimidation regarding the ramifications her own decisions may have on others,"" her lawyers claim.They say a reasonable person would believe that how Meng ""defends her extradition could alter the consequences faced by the two Canadians held in China.Her defence strategy could also impact Huawei in its future interests as a globally competitive company, as well as Canada's economy.""The legal arguments are all part of a series of attempts that the defence plans to make to have the case against Meng tossed for alleged abuse of process. The same newly filed batch of court documents include an argument that the U.S. failed to disclose material facts in its record of the case that show Meng's statements to banks had no impact on the financial decisions in question.If necessary, the defence team also plans to argue that Canadian and U.S. authorities conspired to violate Meng's Constitutional rights at the time of her arrest.To that end, her lawyers will be in federal court next week to argue for the release of Canadian Security Intelligence Service documents that they claim prove collusion with the FBI.CSIS has already released a number of heavily redacted documents suggesting that it was aware of Meng's arrest and in contact with the FBI and other agencies.Canada's attorney general claims the redacted information should be kept from public view because of national security concerns. Affidavits filed in the case suggest that the details could inflame tensions with China and alienate intelligence sources.But in federal court documents released Friday, Meng's lawyers claim the information could be crucial to her defence.""If there is additional information hidden under the redactions ... national security privilege should not be used to cover up the abuse,"" the lawyers state.""Additionally, national security privilege should not be used to protect government enforcement officials from being embarrassed.""Meng has been living under house arrest since her release on $10 million bail in the week after her initial arrest.She wears a monitoring bracelet as part of her release conditions and lives in one of two multi-million mansions she owns on Vancouver's west side.She has denied the allegations made against her. "

"Fed up with combative Gaétan Barrette, medical specialists want new bargaining partner | CBC News",Quebec's medical specialists are pushing back against Health Minister Gaétan Barrette and what they call his unilateral approach to negotiations after ending extra-billing.,2017-01-20T19:20:07.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/fed-up-with-combative-ga%c3%a9tan-barrette-medical-specialists-want-new-bargaining-partner-1.3944328,"When it comes to the delicate art of negotiating, Quebec Health Minister Gaétan Barrette often resembles a bull in a china shop.Currently in talks with Ottawa for a new health accord, Barrette has accused the federal government of holding Quebecers ""hostage"" and has threatened to walk away from the bargaining table.He regularly calls out his federal counterpart, Jane Philpott, on Twitter. According to <a href=""https://twitter.com/janephilpott"">@janephilpott</a> less funding is ""good news"" and means ""better access""! Houston, we really have a problem! <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/cdnpoli?src=hash"">#cdnpoli</a>Barrette isn't any gentler when dealing with Quebec doctors. He's pressed ahead with a promise to eliminate auxiliary fees charged by some medical specialists, forcing private imaging clinics to offer ultrasounds at no extra cost to patients — and without any formal agreement on how those clinics are to be reimbursed.Beginning next week, medical specialists will be unable to charge many of the fees that have become important sources of revenue for their practices.But now Quebec's federation of medical specialists, the FMSQ, is pushing back.The FMSQ says Barrette unilaterally imposed the new rules, and that in negotiations with the association, he has done little to address concerns about how doctors operating freestanding clinics will be compensated for their lost revenue. Faced with uncertainty over payment, several radiologists are turning away patients. Other specialists have threatened to drop out of the provincial health insurance system.Quebec radiologists threatened with lawsuit for balking at ultrasounds""The information diffused by the Health Ministry is incomplete and raises a lot of questions without providing answers, either for patients or doctors,"" said Diane Francoeur, president of the FMSQ.""What is being allowed is uncertainty, and uncertainty can't be allowed.""The FMSQ wants Barrette gone from the negotiating table. They called on the government to replace him with Treasury Board President Pierre Moreau.Auxiliary fees at the doctor's office will be banned, Quebec health minister says""He seems in a totally different mindset, happy to discuss and evaluate, as every negotiation should be,"" Francoeur said of Moreau, who recently returned to politics following a serious illness.  ""You have to respect both people and find an agreement that fits both,"" Francoeur said.The medical specialists are also hoping to strengthen their bargaining position by hiring former premier Lucien Bouchard to represent them in possible legal actions against the government. Barrette, for his part, appears unfazed by the FMSQ's latest moves. In characteristic fashion, he accused the federation of holding patients ""hostage"" and chalked up their demands for compensation to greediness. ""The issue here is, above all, monetary,"" Barrette told Radio-Canada on Thursday. ""There are groups that always want more. I think the public is listening to us and knows what we're talking about.""Groups take legal action to get Ottawa to enforce Canada Health Act in QuebecHis position is getting some support from a patients' rights group in Quebec that is seeking to launch a class-action lawsuit against radiologists who are cancelling or refusing to take appointments.  ""Medical specialists can't refuse or neglect to offer care to patients for whom they will nevertheless be compensated following a ministerial decision,"" said Paul Brunet, who chairs the Quebec Council for the Protection of Patients, the group behind the lawsuit. Announcing his intention to end auxiliary fees last fall, Barrette said the only extra fee that doctors will be allowed to charge will be for the transport of biological samples from a private clinic or specialist. There is a $15 limit for blood samples, and $5 maximum fee for transporting all other kinds of samples.Ottawa threatens to cut Quebec's health payments over user fees"

More than 350 people paid the tax upon entry into Newfoundland and Labrador. This discriminatory policy was similar to what was happening in the rest of Canada; the Chinese head tax and the Chinese Exclusion Act were put in place to restrict immigration to Canada. More than 82,000 Chinese immigrants paid the tax across Canada.Gordon Jin's father immigrated to Newfoundland in 1931 and paid the tax. On Tuesday, Jin, one of the founders and president of the Newfoundland and Labrador Head Tax Redress Organization, will join Joy Barfoot, education and public programming officer with The Rooms, for a live conversation about the history of the head tax, the hardships and discrimination his family and others experienced, and the fight for redress. Tune in live on the CBC Newfoundland and Labrador Facebook page on Oct. 20 at 7 p.m. NT.Read more from CBC Newfoundland and Labrador"

Yellowknife couple faces coronavirus on both sides of the world | CBC News,"While Steven Shen waits for the panic to subside in China’s Guangdong province, his wife Nancy Lin confronts fear of the COVID-19 in Yellowknife.",2020-03-06T00:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/yellowknife-coronavirus-1.5488661,"It was supposed to be a retirement vacation. Steven Shen travelled to Asia with a Yellowknife couple, first to the couple's home community in the Philippines, then to his in China. Shen grew up in Chaozhou, a city of 2.6 million people in China's Guangdong province.He reached China on Jan. 18, planning to return to Yellowknife on March 3. In early February, he learned from his travel agent that his return flight to Canada, on China Eastern Airlines, was cancelled. Chaozhou is about 800 kilometres south of Wuhan, where the novel coronavirus, COVID-19, first emerged, and far from the areas where authorities have imposed a clampdown on travel. But Wuhan is a busy travel hub, which has affected routes throughout the country. Shen could have rebooked on a later flight, but he hasn't yet done so. ""After consulting with my family and consulting a public health expert, they say, well, you're better to stay in China longer, and I think it is a good idea."" Shen is a former environmental health officer with the N.W.T. government. He moved to Yellowknife 15 years ago to take the job. So while he wants to avoid travelling on any routes where he could be exposed to the illness, or carrying the illness himself, there's also another reason he's choosing to stay put.""I want to set an example for other people.""Shen's wife, Nancy Lin, says she's OK with that decision. She and the couple's daughter have been in Yellowknife the whole time, checking in with Steve by phone. ""He is having a good time,"" Lin said. But Lin has faced her own COVID-19 battles at home. She usually travels to China over the holidays, visiting family for two weeks at a time. This year, she changed that plan in order to prepare for an exam. One afternoon in January, she was in the downtown grocery store when she saw one of her co-workers, who knows her usual pattern. ""He passed by,"" she said, ""and then realized it was me. And then he stepped two steps far away from me, which is kind of about two metres away from me, and then he stopped and turned and said, 'Hey, Nancy! Have you just come back from China?'""Obviously I can feel that two-metres distance."" In China, Shen says he's already seen concern about the COVID-19 virus calm down. He spoke to the CBC from a street side tea shop and said people were smiling and out walking around.""That was not the situation one month ago. People were very worried."" Shen said he's also hoping to get some more information as an international traveller returning to the N.W.T., ""such as guidance on isolation and prevention.""So far, the territorial government has not issued any general warnings or advice on whether or not to travel — inside or outside of the country. The World Health Organization has not yet advised against any international travel.The federal government issued a travel advisory on Jan. 7 advising Canadians ""to consider avoiding non-essential travel to China"" and other countries affected by the COVID-19 virus. That advisory recommends travellers who do go to China avoid spending time in large crowds, avoid sick people and animals, and follow local public health advice. Travellers returning from China are asked to monitor their health for fever, cough and difficulty breathing for 14 days, and ""avoid places where you cannot easily separate from others if you become ill.""People who do develop symptoms are asked to isolate themselves from others as quickly as possible and contact a health-care professional.Those who have travelled to China's Hubei Province (of which Wuhan is the capital) are asked to contact the public health authority in the area where they live within 24 hours of arriving in Canada. "

She said her business is faring poorer now than during the 2003 SARS crisis.The travel industry veteran said she thinks business will continue to suffer after the outbreak because many people in China have not been able to work, as they are living in lockdown or quarantine in order to prevent the virus from spreading.Chan said if business remains dire she may consider approaching her landlord, the City of Vancouver, for rent relief.For now, Chan said her staff does have a lot of work — but that mostly involves cancelling flights and requesting refunds for numerous customers who would prefer to stay put.To hear the complete interview with Glynnis Chan on The Early Edition, tap the audio link below:"
"Still no coronavirus cases reported in Sask., says chief medical health officer in update | CBC News",The Saskatchewan Ministry of Health says there have been no confirmed cases of novel Coronavirus in the province.,2020-02-07T16:47:02.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatoon/coronavirus-sask-saqib-shahab-1.5455630,"The Saskatchewan Ministry of Health says there have been no confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus in the province.The provincial Healthline has received 50 calls from people concerned that they might have the virus, which is spreading outside of China, despite the best efforts of officials.The province has tested 13 people in the province who have travelled to China and showed symptoms. Six tests have come back negative and seven are still pending.Chief Medical Health Officer Dr. Saqib Shahab said people in the province do not need to be concerned about the virus spreading.""If you have not travelled to China, and you are in Saskatchewan, there should not be any concern at this point,"" he said. ""It is not transmitting person to person in Canada or in Saskatchewan.""The Health Ministry has updated its rules around people returning from China.Anyone entering the province who has recently been in Hubei province, the epicentre of the disease, is asked to isolate themselves for two weeks and to call the provincial Healthline.As well, anyone coming into Saskatchewan who has travelled to anywhere in China recently and is showing flu-like symptoms are also asked to isolate themselves for two weeks and to call provincial officials for more instructions.""That includes mild symptoms like a cough, fatigue, fever,"" said Shahab. ""The reason why we want to make these two recommendations is we obviously want to limit the importation of the spread of the novel coronavirus.""So far, there have been five confirmed cases of coronavirus across the country, two in Vancouver and three in Toronto.People without symptoms are less infectious; if a person is very sick they are more infectious. The province had a previous protocol for viruses like this but it has now refocused to make sure that people declare their travel history, Shahab said. "
P.E.I. selects 626 newcomers as PNP kicks back into gear | CBC News,"From June through August, P.E.I. selected 626 immigrants to sponsor for permanent residency through its provincial nominee program, which had been dormant in the early months of the pandemic.",2020-09-18T21:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-covid-pnp-provincial-nominee-1.5729563,"An immigration program which has boosted P.E.I.'s economy and population — but has also been a near-constant source of political controversy — is picking up speed again after languishing during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic.P.E.I.'s Office of Immigration held eight draws through its provincial nominee program from June 10 through Aug. 20, offering to sponsor 626 immigrants in their applications to become permanent residents of Canada.But the province says close to 90 per cent of those immigrants were already working and living on P.E.I. through various employment-related visa programs when their names were drawn.""Since June, our programs have been picking up the draw numbers,"" said Jamie Aiken, executive director of the P.E.I. Office of Immigration.""We're trying to pick up individuals through our labour streams that are already here working,"" Aiken said. ""A lot of these individuals have work permits that they're here working underneath, and now they're transitioning to try and apply for permanent residency.""Aiken said those workers are employed in the service industry, in health care, manufacturing and in trucking. He said they come from many countries, but predominantly India, the Philippines, Vietnam and China. In most cases he said their family members are already living here.Compared to the 626 candidates invited from June through August, the province issued a total of just 48 invitations from March through May, according to figures posted on the province's website.In the six months leading up to March, the province was averaging 141 invitations per month.Among the new immigrants the province is offering to sponsor are 77 potential immigrant investors who would be required to operate a business on P.E.I. Aiken said all of those applicants are currently living overseas, but that it would be months before their applications to enter the country are processed by the federal government.""So we may not actually see an applicant for upwards to 12 months who we would invite in the month of August,"" he said.While Canada has closed its borders to many international travellers, there are exceptions which allow provincial nominees to enter the country if they have a work permit and are able to self-isolate for 14 days.Aiken said since the start of the pandemic, approximately 75 people have arrived on P.E.I. from overseas to become permanent residents through the PNP, mostly essential workers employed in health care or the trucking industry.P.E.I.'s Chief Public Health Officer Dr. Heather Morrison has repeatedly warned the primary risk of introducing COVID-19 to the Island comes from those entering from outside the Atlantic bubble. Government says all 57 cases recorded on the Island so far have been travel-related. As of Tuesday, government reported only one active case of the disease in the province.But Morrison has also often referred to the requirement that those coming to P.E.I. from outside the Atlantic bubble self-isolate for 14 days, crediting that requirement for the lack of community spread of COVID-19 in the province.When asked about the potential risks of resuming immigration programs during the pandemic, Morrison said those decisions ""are almost made at a federal level.… It's really, from my perspective, trying to figure out once those decisions are made, how we can do it safely.""The P.E.I. government administers its own provincial nominee program, under the oversight and within parameters approved by the federal government.""As we ease back and learn to live with COVID and those [immigration] streams begin to open up a little bit more broadly in the future, the big question would be just around making sure that we have that self-isolation in place,"" said Premier Dennis King.""As a province we need immigration. We depend on growing our population through many streams, including immigration,"" King said. ""And even though we're in a worldwide health pandemic, that has to remain a focus for the long term, and it will."""
Beijing bristles as more countries bar travellers over coronavirus fears | CBC News,"Despite imposing drastic travel restrictions at home, China has chafed at those imposed by foreign governments, criticizing Washington's order barring entry to most non-citizens who visited China in the past two weeks.",2020-02-01T10:56:49.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/coronavirus-pneumonia-china-briefing-1.5448784,"China's death toll from a new virus increased to 304 on Sunday amid warnings from the World Health Organization that other countries need to be prepared in the event the disease spreads among their populations.Meanwhile, six officials in the city of Huanggang — neighbouring the epicentre of Wuhan in Hubei province — have been fired over ""poor performance"" in handling the outbreak, the official Xinhua News Agency reported.It cited the mayor as saying the city's ""capabilities to treat the patients remained inadequate and there is a severe shortage in medical supplies such as protective suits and medical masks.""Figures from the National Health Commission showed an increase of 45 in the death toll and 2,590 in the number of cases for a total of 14,380, well above the number of those infected in in the 2002-03 outbreak of SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, which broke out in southern China before spreading worldwide.Despite imposing drastic travel restrictions at home, China has chafed at those imposed by foreign governments, criticizing Washington's order barring entry to most non-citizens who visited China in the past two weeks.Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced similar measures Saturday, following Japan and Singapore.South Korea and India flew hundreds of their citizens out of Wuhan, the city at the centre of an area where some 50 million people are prevented from leaving in a sweeping anti-virus effort. The evacuees went into a two-week quarantine. Indonesia also sent a plane.The virus' rapid spread in two months prompted the World Health Organization on Thursday to declare it a global emergency.That declaration ""flipped the switch"" from a cautious attitude to recommending governments prepare for the possibility the virus might spread, said the WHO representative in Beijing, Gauden Galea. Most cases reported so far have been people who visited China or their family members.The agency acted out of concern for poorer countries that might not be equipped to respond, said Galea. Such a declaration calls for a coordinated international response and can bring more money and resources.WHO said it was especially concerned that some cases abroad involved human-to-human transmission.""Countries need to get ready for possible importation in order to identify cases as early as possible and in order to be ready for a domestic outbreak control, if that happens,"" Galea told The Associated Press.Watch: Construction of two coronavirus hospitals in China nears completionCBC NewsThe United States declared a public health emergency on Friday and President Donald Trump signed an order barring entry to foreign nationals who visited China within the last 14 days, which scientists say is the virus' longest incubation period. The restrictions don't apply to immediate family of American citizens and permanent residents.China criticized the U.S. controls and ""unfriendly comments"" alleging that Beijing was failing to co-operate.""Just as the WHO recommended against travel restrictions, the U.S. rushed to go in the opposite way. Certainly not a gesture of goodwill,"" said foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying.Australia, Germany, Japan, South Korea, the United Arab Emirates, the United States and Vietnam all reported new cases Saturday. Spain confirmed its first case — a German man who had close contact with an infected person in Germany and then traveled to the Canary Islands with friends. Four friends who were hospitalized with him have not shown symptoms.Both the new virus and SARS are from the coronavirus family, which also includes those that cause the common cold.The death rate in China is falling, but the number of confirmed cases will keep growing because thousands of specimens from suspected cases have yet to be tested, WHO's Galea said.""The case fatality ratio is settling out at a much lower level than we were reporting three, now four, weeks ago,"" he said.Although scientists expect to see limited transmission of the virus between people with family or other close contacts, they are concerned about cases of infection spreading to people who might have less exposure.Canada has four confirmed cases of cornavirus. The Public Health Agency of Canada, which is working alongside provinces and territories to monitor the novel coronavirus, says the risk to Canadians is low. Watch: What we actually know about the coronavirusCBC News"

The story was first reported by The Globe and Mail.Champagne said he disclosed the two mortgages to the ethics commissioner when he entered politics in 2015, that they were part of the public record, and that neither of the mortgages ever had any bearing on his job.Before Champagne entered politics, he lived and worked in London and bought two apartments in 2009 and 2013, which he continues to own and rent.

Economic bounce-back depends on quick resolution of epidemic: Don Pittis | CBC News,"A global recession would likely kill more people than the coronavirus, a Canadian expert says.",2020-02-18T09:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/covid-19-coronavirus-china-canada-1.5464012,"For people who have lost loved ones to COVID-19, the disease that has swept parts of China and may have gained a foothold elsewhere, the global economic impact is likely the least of their concerns.But with the world economy already hovering near what the International Monetary Fund considers to be recessionary levels, a significant global slowdown would be about more than money. And one of the biggest considerations is whether the economic impact of the disease will be ephemeral or lasting.Widely described as the biggest current threat to global growth, the coronavirus, and perhaps more important the things governments are doing to prevent it from spreading, could yet push the world below the recession line.That is one of the reasons why experts like Richard Schabas, Ontario's former chief medical officer, worry that draconian measures that stoke fear in the population do more harm than good.""Recessions kill people, in fact will probably kill more people than this virus does,"" he told CBC News host Michael Serapio last week. Here in the wealth and safety of Canada it may be hard to fathom, but in a globally integrated economy a few dollars less a month can mean life or death to people struggling for food and medicine. That's easier to comprehend when you think that the World Health Organization estimates about six million children a year die preventable deaths, usually associated with poverty.WATCH: Ontario's ex-chief medical officer says a recession could kill more people than the coronavirus:World""Our world has become so interconnected,"" says Jia Wang, deputy director of the University of Alberta's China Institute.Wang suggests that the next few weeks will be critical, showing whether the epidemic, with its global economic impact, is moderating or getting worse. Early reports that the spread of the disease was slowing were cast into doubt last week when China reported 5,000 new cases and global deaths leapt past 1,500.Fear and government restrictions mean people in China have been staying home, slashing the business of retailers and restaurants. Some reports say property sales are down by more than 80 per cent, affecting a business that represents about one-quarter of China's gross domestic product.Wang says that while the country's giant companies are big enough to outlast the crisis, especially with government help, a significant and dynamic part of China's economy is based on much smaller businesses that could disappear, leading to lingering economic effects.""If the quarantines and shutdowns of many cities around China continue for a few more months or even just one month, many of the smaller companies may not survive,"" she said.Wang says there are also worries that the coronavirus and its economic effect will spread outside China. Last Friday, Singapore's president, Lee Hsien Loong. warned the disease could push that country into recession.Putting a figure on the global impact is not easy, and estimates of the damage vary widely. Oxford Economics says global growth will fall to 2.3 per cent in 2020, the lowest level in more than 10 years and below the IMF's global recession level.Last week Canada's Parliamentary Budget Office suggested the epidemic would eat into Canada's growth rate in the first three months of the year chopping off 0.3 percentage points.That worries Brian Kingston from the Business Council of Canada, especially when no one knows when the crisis will end.""And remember that China is our second most important export destination,"" Kingston told Piya Chattopadhyay on CBC Radio's Metro Morning.BMO economist Jennifer Lee says the bank has again downgraded the Chinese economy due to fading optimism that the country can get its factories geared up as soon as it had hoped. ""We've shaved Q1 and Q2 growth,"" said Lee, ""given how long the shutdowns are lasting.""Lee says the bank still expects China to rebound from the economic malaise, though BMO now puts Chinese full-year growth for 2020 at 5.3 per cent. That is far below the previous consensus that China would grow this year at between six and 6.5 per cent.But Lee says it is common for economies to rebound even after the sharpest decline. For example, a month of storms may mean Canadians stay home from the shops, but the money they didn't spend in one month they can spend in the next, causing what looks like a boom.That depends on how much damage is done and whether it can heal. And Lee says the duration of any interruption in business makes all the difference. She says that after the SARS outbreak in 2003, the Canadian economy bounced back with very little overall damage.""I don't think anyone has any idea of whether or not this is going to be resolved any time soon,"" said Lee.Just as in the recent trade war, uncertainty may be having a paralyzing effect on businesses that are waiting to see whether the availability of parts and the demand for copper and Canada Goose coats will bounce back before firms are forced to completely change their strategies. For some businesses, even a speedy recuperation of the global economy may not wash away the business impact of COVID-19. The special deals already being offered by cruise lines for summer packages may not be enough to cleanse the lingering image of people being trapped for days on a plague ship in windowless rooms in what for many became floating prisons.Follow Don on Twitter @don_pittis"

"Tesla stock falls 17% after two-day rally flirts with $1,000 a share | CBC News","Shares of Tesla tumbled 17 per cent on Wednesday, hitting the brakes on a dramatic rally after a senior executive warned the coronavirus outbreak in China would delay deliveries of Model 3 cars made at its Shanghai plant.",2020-02-05T19:31:06.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/tesla-shares-wednesday-1.5453084,"Shares of Tesla tumbled 17 per cent on Wednesday, hitting the brakes on a dramatic rally after a senior executive warned the coronavirus outbreak in China would delay deliveries of Model 3 cars made at its Shanghai plant.Tesla shares lost $154 or more than 17 per cent to close at $732 Wednesday, after a two-day rally in the shares that capped a doubling in value of the company since the start of January.With Tesla still up about 27 per cent since the company posted its second consecutive quarterly profit a week ago, Canaccord Genuity cut its rating on Tesla to ""hold"" from ""buy,"" further shrinking the already small number of analysts who recommend buying the stock.Tesla vice-president Tao Lin said on the Weibo social media platform that car deliveries from its new Shanghai plant would be temporarily delayed and that the company planned to restart production on Feb 10. The $2 billion factory is a key part of CEO Elon Musk's plan to make more than half a million automobiles this year. Tesla last week said it expected a delay of up to a week and a half in the ramp-up of Model 3 production at the plant after the government ordered it to shut the factory due to the outbreak. The coronavirus has disrupted business across China, with the government there saying another 65 people had died as of Tuesday, the highest daily total yet.""Given the 3,000 per week China Model 3 production expectations in a country that remains on lockdown, we feel a reset of expectations in Q1 is likely and thus needs to be reflected in the valuation,"" Canaccord analyst Jed Dorsheimer wrote in a report, leaving his price target unchanged at $750 per share. The stock was last down 19 per cnt at $716.39. Tesla's rally of over 300 per cent since early June has been a vindication for Musk, who has transformed a niche car maker with production problems into the global leader in electric vehicles, with U.S. and Chinese factories.Still, many investors remain skeptical that Tesla can consistently deliver profit, cash flow and growth in the face of competition from established rivals including BMW and Volkswagen.Even many Tesla bulls question the stock's valuation following its recent, electrifying surge. Following Canaccord's downgrade, nine analysts recommend buying Tesla's stock, while 11 analysts are neutral and 15 analysts recommend selling, according to Refinitiv. The median price target of analysts is $390 — less than half of where it's currently trading."

But the relationships are building and that's a very positive thing.""""They want it, we think it's important, and I think we would be making a big mistake if we didn't have it,"" Trump said.The two countries, eyeing the first summit between the U.S. and the North after six decades of hostility, have also been holding negotiations in Singapore and the demilitarized zone between the two Koreas.When asked Friday about the upcoming summit, Trump said he thinks it will be a ""getting to know you meeting … plus.""  Kim Yong-chol was greeted at the White House by chief of staff John Kelly and then whisked into the Oval Office. He is the most senior North Korean to visit the White House in 18 years, a highly symbolic sign of easing tensions after fears of war escalated amid North Korean nuclear and missile tests last year.The contents of the letter were not immediately known.Trump said the letter was ""very nice"" but offered little detail, saying at some point people may be able to see the contents.""But really, this was a letter presentation that ended up being a two-hour conversation,"" he said, adding later in the press briefing that he hadn't actually opened it yet.""I didn't open it in front of the director,"" Trump said.He told reporters he thinks North Korea is committed to denuclearization. Friday's meeting didn't touch on human rights questions, the president said, but did talk about the possibility of ending the Korean war.He also talked about the collaboration that's happening with countries like South Korea and Japan, saying that he also sees positive things happening around North Korea, with China.Speaking in Kentucky, Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he expected the North Koreans to make ""every effort they can to get sanctions and other relief and give up as little as possible.""""For these situations to work, you have to not want the deal too much,"" McConnell said. ""You fall in love with the deal and it's too important [to] you to get it, and the details become less significant, you could get snookered.""Kim's arrival in Washington — in a small caravan of SUVs from New York — came a day after Secretary of State Mike Pompeo declared that he was confident negotiations with Pyongyang were ""moving in the right direction.""Pompeo spoke to reporters at a news conference in New York after meeting Thursday with Yong-chol. ""Our two countries face a pivotal moment in our relationship, and it would be nothing short of tragic to let this opportunity go to waste.""Pompeo, the former CIA chief who has travelled to North Korea and met with Kim Jong-un twice in the past two months, said he believed the country's leaders are ""contemplating a path forward where they can make a strategic shift, one that their country has not been prepared to make before.""He tweeted from New York: ""Good progress today during our meetings"" with Kim and his team. Yet he also said at his news conference that difficult work remains including hurdles that may appear to be insurmountable as negotiations progress on the U.S. demand for North Korea's complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearization.""We will push forward to test the proposition that we can achieve that outcome,"" he said.Pompeo spoke after meeting with Kim Yong-chol for a little more than two hours at the residence of the deputy U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. The talks had been expected to be held in two sessions, one in the morning and one in the early afternoon, and had not been expected to conclude until 1:30 p.m. Instead, the two men wrapped up at 11:25 a.m.Pompeo said they finished everything they needed to address in the morning session. Immediately afterward, he tweeted that he had had substantive talks on the priorities for the potential summit. Pompeo was accompanied by Andrew Kim, the head of a CIA unit assigned to work on North Korea, and Mark Lambert, the head of the State Department's Korea desk.Despite the upbeat messaging in the United States, Kim Jong-un, in a meeting with Russia's foreign minister on Thursday, complained about the U.S. trying to spread its influence in the region, a comment that may complicate the summit plans.""As we move to adjust to the political situation in the face of U.S. hegemonism, I am willing to exchange detailed and in-depth opinions with your leadership and hope to do so moving forward,"" Kim told Sergey Lavrov.North Korea's flurry of diplomatic activity following an increase in nuclear weapons and missile tests in 2017 suggests that Kim is eager for sanctions relief to build his economy and for the international legitimacy a summit with Trump would provide. But there are lingering doubts on whether he will ever fully relinquish his nuclear arsenal, which he may see as his only guarantee of survival in a region surrounded by enemies.Trump views a summit as a legacy-defining opportunity to make a nuclear deal, but he has left the world guessing since cancelling the meeting last week in an open letter to Kim that complained of the North's ""tremendous anger and open hostility."" North Korea's conciliatory response to that letter appears to have put the summit back on track.Kim Yong-chol is the most senior North Korean visitor to the United States since Vice Marshal Jo Myong-rok visited Washington in 2000 to meet President Bill Clinton and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. That was the last time the two sides, which are technically at war, attempted to arrange a leadership summit.It was an effort that ultimately failed as Clinton's time in office ran out, and relations turned sour again after George W. Bush took office in early 2001 with a tough policy on the North.Kim Yong-chol, vice chairman of the North Korean ruling party's central committee, was allowed into the United States despite being on a U.S. sanctions list, and North Korean officials are not normally allowed to travel outside the New York area.The North Korean mission at the United Nations did not respond to an email seeking comment Thursday, and phone calls were not answered.Meanwhile, the two Koreas agreed during a high-level meeting on Friday to hold talks later this month on military issues and reunions of families separated by the Korean War, a joint statement said.The military talks will take place on June 14 on the northern side of the border village of Panmunjom in the demilitarized zone separating the two countries.Talks about reunions of families separated by the 1950–53 war — which ended in a truce, not a peace treaty — would be held on June 22 at the Mount Kumgang resort north of the border, the statement said."

What you need to know now about the coronavirus: International investigation begins this weekend | CBC News,A World Health Organization expert stresses the importance of keeping politics out of discussions about the coronavirus outbreak.,2020-02-14T19:26:59.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/need-to-know-coronavirus-international-cooperation-1.5464066,"The latest:Led by the World Health Organization, an international investigation into the spread of novel coronavirus and its severity will begin in China this weekend.WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, speaking from Kinshasa in the Democratic Republic of Congo, told reporters in Geneva Friday that the whole team will have touched down in China over the weekend.""The goal of the joint mission is to rapidly inform the next steps in the COVID-19 response and preparedness activities in China and globally,"" he said, referring to the medical name for the acute respiratory disease caused by the virus.Overall, China's National Health Commission said it had recorded 143 new deaths on Friday, for a total of 1,523 across the mainland. It also reported 2,641 new cases across mainland China, taking the total number of people infected to 66,492.For context, influenza claims between 290,000 to 650,000 lives annually, and three to five million people experience severe cases of the illness.Watch: How the coronavirus happenedThe NationalOn Thursday, Chinese health authorities shared new case and fatality numbers that reflected a change in how the illness is being diagnosed. Cases rose 15,152 in one day after China widened its net to include cases that are clinically confirmed through chest scans, as opposed to diagnosed only through a lab test.But public health experts wrestled with what exactly could be deduced from the numbers, given the shift in approach.""If you change the way you count cases, that obviously confounds our capacity to draw firm conclusions about the effectiveness of the quarantine,"" said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University in the United States. ""We have to interpret the numbers with great caution.""Dr. Mike Ryan, head of the WHO's health emergencies program, stressed the importance of keeping politics out of discussions about the outbreak.Ryan was asked to respond to a comment by Larry Kudlow, the director of U.S. President Donald Trump's Economic Council, who told reporters Thursday, ""We're a little disappointed in the lack of transparency coming from the Chinese.""Ryan said, ""Please, let our scientists get on. Let our public health officials get on. We should try, all of us, to avoid politicizing this situation right now.""From our perspective, we have a government that's co-operating with us, that's inviting in international experts, that's shared sequences with the world, that continues to engage with the outside community,"" he said of China.A fifth presumptive case of the novel coronavirus has been identified in British Columbia, bringing the total number of cases in Canada to eight.Provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry said Friday a woman in her 30s returned from Shanghai in the past week through Vancouver's airport before travelling by car to her home in the Interior.Henry said the woman wore a mask on the plane and contacted health officials when she had symptoms of an illness. She tested positive for COVID-19 on Tuesday.""We are very grateful and thankful that the people who are coming back from Hubei province and all over China are taking the advice seriously to self-monitor and to connect with us and make sure that they can be tested, assessed and cared for safely,"" she said.The woman is in isolation at home, as are her close contacts, Henry said.In all such cases, she said, a further test will be conducted at a national lab in Winnipeg to confirm the results obtained provincially.Officials will be contacting passengers who sat three rows ahead and behind the woman on the flight that arrived from China, but the risk to them is ""very, very low,"" she said.The first person to be tested for the virus in the province is recovering well and has tested negative in the first of two tests needed to determine the patient no longer has the virus and isolation is no longer required, she said.Foreign Affairs Minister François-Philippe Champagne says Canadian health workers are assisting in Japan after 15 Canadians contracted the novel coronavirus while on a cruise ship.Champagne says three members of the Public Health Agency of Canada and two medical personnel from the Canadian Armed Forces have been sent to Yokohama, the Japanese port city where the Diamond Princess has been docked since last week.Some 3,500 passengers on the ship are under quarantine and 218 people have tested positive for the coronavirus.Champagne says the Japanese government will allow some elderly people to complete the rest of their quarantine period at another facility off the ship.Meanwhile, Champagne says consular officials are assisting in Cambodia where another ship with 279 Canadians on-board was recently allowed to dock after being rejected from multiple other countries over fears of the new coronavirus.There have been no reported case of the illness on board the Westerdam, and Champagne says officials will help Canadians with the process of returning home.China's National Health Commission reported Friday that 1,716 health workers had been infected and six had died as of Tuesday, with the number of infected staff rising.""The duties of medical workers at the front are indeed extremely heavy; their working and resting circumstances are limited, the psychological pressures are great and the risk of infection is high,"" Zeng Yixin, vice-minister of the commission, told a news conference.However, the WHO's Ryan said the numbers of infected health workers is sad but not alarming.""Our understanding is that the cases among health workers peaked in the third or fourth week of January and there's been a rapid fall-off in the number of cases that have occurred in health workers in the last two weeks,"" Ryan said.He noted many of these health workers may have contracted the illness before the risks were known.""Although it's a very tragic situation for those health workers and particularly for those who have lost their lives … it is a lower percentage than has occurred in other coronavirus outbreaks,"" said Ryan.Chinese scientists are testing two antiviral drugs and preliminary results are due in weeks, while the head of a Wuhan hospital said plasma infusions from recovered patients had shown some encouraging preliminary results.Finding the right treatment for a new disease is no small task.Doctors and other health-care workers fighting the coronavirus outbreak in China don't have any specific treatments to use against this new virus. When they try to treat severe cases, they're walking a tightrope aiming to find just the right level of immune response to kill the virus without setting off other problems. The virus causes respiratory symptoms, such as cough and fever.Dr. Jerome Leis and his team treated Canada's first case at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre in Toronto last month. The man in his 50s initially had some X-ray findings that clinicians were concerned might worsen.""After they were admitted, they did gradually improve and eventually their symptoms resolved completely,"" said Leis, referring to the man. ""I think this story highlights, although we have seen poor outcomes related to this infection, including fatalities, those are the exception, not the rule.""Egypt's Health Ministry has confirmed the first case of the new virus in the North African country.In a statement Friday, Health Ministry spokesman Khaled Mugahed said the person was a ""foreigner"" who is carrying the virus but not showing any serious symptoms.Officials were able to confirm the case through a follow-up program the government implemented for travellers arriving from countries where the virus has spread. The ministry statement said the person was hospitalized and in isolation.The statement did not specify the person's nationality or what port of entry he or she arrived at in Egypt.Experts and African leaders have expressed concern that should the virus spread there, it might wreak havoc among less developed countries with fewer health resources.Previously the number of countries affected outside China was steady at 24."

He also said the general wording of the order did not make clear which items his clients were required to remove.""Ultimately there's been significant damage to a company that is otherwise above board and without incident,"" said Milczarek. Even before charges were laid, CCA had donated PPE items to a hospital and the Red Cross in China, according to Milczarek, who also said his client contributed to a group that donated 70,000 masks to places like Alpha House and the Mustard Seed in Calgary. The company pleaded guilty to failing to comply with the order, which is different from price gouging. CCA has always maintained its suppliers were charging more, which is why its prices were so high.Provincial court Judge Heather Lamoureux accepted the plea and the joint submission for a $1,500 fine proposed by Milczarek and prosecutor Steven Johnston.A charge against owner Yan Gong was withdrawn."
The latest on the coronavirus outbreak for Oct. 9 | CBC News,The latest on the coronavirus outbreak for Oct. 9.,2020-10-09T20:08:23.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/coronavirus-newsletter-oct-9-1.5757639,"Health officials urge vigilance this Thanksgiving as COVID-19 modelling shows acceleration of casesPublic health officials are urging Canadians to be extra-vigilant this Thanksgiving weekend as new COVID-19 modelling shows the growth of caseloads continuing to accelerate across the country. During a news conference in Ottawa today, Chief Public Health Officer Dr. Theresa Tam said Thursday saw the highest one-day increase in reported cases since the start of the pandemic. She said it's vital that Canadians limit their contacts and deny the virus opportunities to spread. ""The actions of individual Canadians are needed now to reverse this trend,"" she said.Tam released projections showing that the national caseload could climb to 197,830 by Oct. 17, with up to 9,800 deaths. The virus is spreading most rapidly in Quebec, Ontario and Alberta, and on average each new case in Canada is spreading infection to more than one person. Globally, the World Health Organization announced a new daily record of reported COVID-19 cases, with more than 350,000. Infections in Canada remain highest among younger age groups — especially among those aged 20 to 39 years old. But infections are rising among Canadians over the age of 80, a group which is particularly vulnerable.Tam said the number of hospitalizations is much lower than it was during the first wave partly due to the average age of those infected. She warned, however, that hospitalizations are a ""late indicator"" of the severity of the pandemic because they lag one or more weeks behind changes in the caseload. To slow the spread and prevent new outbreaks, officials are asking Canadians to limit gatherings to their own household contacts, to stay close to home and to celebrate Thanksgiving creatively through virtual gatherings and festive outdoor activities.Last month, Tam presented modelling that showed the epidemic was accelerating nationally. At the time, she warned that if Canadians did not step up preventative measures, the virus could spread out of control and trigger a wave of infections bigger than the first one. Her projections suggested cases could climb to more than 5,000 daily by October. That projection remains in today's modelling. If Canadians increase their current rate of contacts by 20 per cent, the epidemic is forecast to re-surge ""faster and stronger,"" according to the projections.Public health officials say that if Canadians maintain their current rate of contacts, the epidemic is still expected to re-surge — but if they reduce their contacts by 25 to 35 per cent, the epidemic is expected to come under control in most locations. ""We are at an important juncture in the pandemic, where we would very much like to see the voluntary actions of Canadians across the country be sufficient to bend the curve downward,"" Tam said. ""This will require sustained and intentional effort to limit contacts and reduce opportunities for transmission. This will not be easy and will require hard choices between what we need to do and what we would like to do.""Click below to watch more from The National The NationalOntario tightens restrictions in 3 major areas amid record-breaking case numbersOntario is imposing stricter measures in Toronto, Ottawa and Peel Region in a bid to curb the spread of COVID-19 as the province's curve climbs ever-steeper. The measures, which go into effect Saturday for a period of 28 days, include prohibiting indoor dining at restaurants and bars, and closing gyms, movie theatres and casinos. After that, the province's health experts will review the measures. The government is also asking people in those areas to leave their homes only for essential purposes. Schools and child-care centres will remain open as part of the plan, and provincial Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. David Williams said a large-scale shut down of schools is ""not merited at this time.""The new restrictions come as Ontario marked a record 939 new cases of COVID-19 on Friday, most of them in Toronto, Ottawa and Peel Region. Those regions have consistently reported the majority of new cases in recent weeks. ""All trends are going in the wrong direction,"" Premier Doug Ford said at a news conference, saying the pandemic has picked up speed at ""an alarming rate."" Ford also announced $300 million to support businesses amid the closures. Ford added that if current trends continue, hospitals could be overwhelmed with intensive-care unit placements tripling in less than 30 days. ""If we don't take action now, the situation could overtake us,"" said Health Minister Christine Elliott. The government said if current trends continue, the province could experience ""worst-case scenarios"" seen in northern Italy and New York City earlier in the pandemic.Ford said the measures were decided on after the province's top doctors provided ""brand new data"" to justify new restrictions — although critics have been calling for a rollback to stricter measures for several weeks. Asked why the province didn't act sooner despite the calls of many doctors and health professionals, Ford said he took his direction from the province's health table, adding the recent surge was a sudden one. That's despite Ontario's own modelling forecasting 1,000 cases by mid-October more than a week ago. ""I made a decisive decision to act immediately,"" he said. ""If I didn't make this decision now, I would be negligent.""Read more about the situation Ottawa announces new rent relief program for businesses hit by COVID-19 closuresThe federal government said targeted aid is coming for some businesses hit by closures as a second wave of COVID-19 hits parts of the country. Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland, flanked by the prime minister and other cabinet colleagues, announced a combination of new and previously announced measures in Ottawa Friday. ""I want to stress that this is not for everyone. Some businesses are able to work at full capacity despite COVID-19 and they are doing well and that's great,"" she said.Freeland said this support will include an overhauled rent relief program, which the government said will now allow businesses to apply directly for relief through the Canada Revenue Agency until June 2021. The old program, which was meant to ease the pressure on businesses hit by the pandemic by covering a portion of their rent, expired last month. It was roundly criticized by businesses because tapping into the program depended on buy-in from landlords, who were under no obligation to participate. According to a news release from Finance Canada, the new rent subsidy will support businesses, charities and non-profits that have suffered revenue drops by subsidizing a percentage of their expenses on a sliding scale, up to a maximum of 65 per cent of eligible expenses, until Dec. 19.Freeland's department said a ""top-up"" emergency rent subsidy of 25 per cent, in addition to the 65 per cent subsidy, will be available to organizations temporarily shut down by a mandatory public health order. The government announced plans in the throne speech to extend the wage subsidy program — which is meant to keep employees on the payroll to ensure a smooth post-pandemic economic transition — until next summer. Freeland said today the subsidy will freeze at the current rate of up to a maximum of 65 per cent of eligible wages until Dec.19, and will not decrease on a sliding scale as previously planned. Her department said the government plans to introduce legislation to implement the new rent subsidy and the wage subsidy extension ""in the near future.""Read more about the rent relief program China joins WHO-backed vaccine distribution program rejected by TrumpChina announced on Friday it has joined COVAX, a global scheme for the distribution of COVID-19 vaccine backed by the World Health Organization (WHO), giving a major boost to an initiative shunned by U.S. President Donald Trump. Beijing's latest bid to join the global fight against the coronavirus follows criticism over its handling of the pandemic, which has contributed to a growing unfavourable view of China in advanced nations, a recent survey showed.""We are taking this concrete step to ensure equitable distribution of vaccines, especially to developing countries, and hope more capable countries will also join and support COVAX,"" foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said in a statement. The statement did not detail the support Beijing will provide to the COVAX program, which aims to deliver at least two billion doses of vaccine by the end of 2021. In May, President Xi Jinping pledged $2 billion US over the next two years to tackle the pandemic, which has killed more than one million people. China, where the virus was first reported late last year, is also in talks with the WHO to have its domestically made vaccines assessed for international use.As many as 171 nations have joined the program to back equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines for rich and poor countries alike. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced an investment of $440 million to COVAX on Sept. 25, but neither the U.S. nor Russia are participating. COVAX is co-led by the GAVI vaccines alliance, the WHO and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations. China has ample capability to make COVID-19 vaccine and will prioritize supplies to developing countries when they are ready, its foreign ministry said. China has at least four experimental vaccines in final stages of clinical trials. The move also means China ""will be procuring vaccines through the facility for a proportion of their own population, just as with other countries,"" a GAVI spokesperson said.Read more about the vaccine program During COVID-19, there's an environmental case for taking the stairsDuring the pandemic, elevators are a big challenge — they're indoor spaces where physical distancing is often impossible. COVID-19 guidelines limiting the number of people in an elevator have led to long lineups and waits in highrises and office towers, causing problems for workers returning to their offices, prohibiting some from coming back at all and even keeping some children from going to school. In this week's edition of the What on Earth? newsletter, CBC's Emily Chung writes that, in theory, there is a better option: the stairs.They're much bigger spaces and less prone to crowding, where people largely stay apart because they're generally going in the same direction (or only briefly passing someone going the other way). As with other kinds of active transportation that have increased in popularity during the pandemic (such as walking and cycling), there's also an environmental benefit. Using the stairs can reduce the costs and energy use from elevators — which can come from fossil fuel sources — and could even eliminate the need for so many elevators, resulting in even bigger energy savings. Plus, the exercise has health benefits, such as the potential to lower the risk of heart disease and stroke.That's why ""active design"" to encourage stair use has garnered interest from architects such as Gayle Nicoll, a professor at the Ontario College of Art and Design in Toronto. In practice, the stairs in many modern buildings are hard to find, don't necessarily provide access to the floors you want to reach, may trigger an emergency alarm if you exit from them — and, frankly, are often unpleasant (e.g. messy and poorly lit). Nicoll said that has to do with stairs having become specialized for emergency use, as elevators became ""more front and centre"" with the rise of very tall buildings, as well as accessibility laws and a realization on the part of landlords that minimizing stairs could leave them with more space to rent out.But she said there are some things building owners can do to make stairs usable and to take some pressure off elevators. This includes making stairs more visible, possibly with a sign near the elevator to show people where they are, and reminding people to let those with mobility challenges use the elevator first. She also suggests that companies in multi-storey buildings allow employees to use the stairs to visit employees on other floors. That may mean equipping doors with card readers for security.Neighbours tackle 'Trashy Tuesdays' during pandemic CBC News TorontoSince March, a group of neighbours in South Etobicoke, Ont., has been tackling the trash left in their parks and public spaces together during the COVID-19 pandemic. The group, which call their meet-ups every second week ""Trashy Tuesdays"", met through a community Facebook group event organized by Kirsten Krowiak.Krowiak came up with the idea when she noticed more garbage on the ground, notably disposable masks. ""We were kind of all bored staying inside for quarantine forever. So, we just decided that we were going to go out and hit the street. It was just an easy way to not only socialize, but also take care of a problem,"" she said.The ""Trashy Tuesdays"" group attracted members who have since become good friends and see each other outside their community clean-ups.

Panda cub birth at Washington zoo sparks intense online interest amid pandemic | CBC News,"A brand new giant panda cub is sparking pandemic-fuelled panda-mania, and officials at the National Zoo said traffic on its livestream spiked 1,200 per cent over the past week.",2020-08-22T17:36:35.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/washington-zoo-panda-birth-1.5696482,"A brand new giant panda cub is sparking pandemic-fuelled panda-mania, and officials at the National Zoo in Washington, D.C., said traffic on its livestream spiked 1,200 per cent over the past week.""I'm pretty sure we broke the internet last night,"" National Zoo director Steve Monfort said Saturday.The zoo's ever-popular Panda Cam traffic has been crashing since venerable matriarch Mei Xiang's pregnancy was announced this past week. When she actually gave birth Friday evening, zoo officials said they had a hard time getting into their own livestream, and they're now working to boost their capabilities.""Everybody is getting bumped off,"" said deputy director Brandie Smith, a former curator of the zoo's giant pandas who has overseen multiple births here. ""When we have a giant panda baby, the whole world celebrates.""On camera, the actual moment of birth at about 6:35 p.m. is obscured, but the results become immediately obvious from the new cub's robust squealing. The massive mother immediately picks up and cradles the infant, which officials say is the size of a stick of butter.❤️🐼 Keepers report that giant panda Mei Xiang and her newborn had a successful first night. Between bouts of good rest, Mei Xiang appeared to nurse her cub and was very attentive to its vocalizations. 👀🎥 TUNE IN: <a href=""https://t.co/99lBTV2w92"">https://t.co/99lBTV2w92</a>. <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/PandaStory?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#PandaStory</a> <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/PandaCubdates?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#PandaCubdates</a> <a href=""https://t.co/QCd2IYv5w4"">pic.twitter.com/QCd2IYv5w4</a>""We can tell the cub is doing well from its vocalizations and the mother's behaviour,"" Smith said. Zoo staff remain ready to intervene if something seems wrong, but Smith said Mei Xiang, who has reared three cubs to adulthood, ""knows exactly what she is doing.""For now, zoo staff are letting the new pair share some private time. Mei Xiang will remain with her baby (gender still unknown) in a small indoor enclosure where she has built a modest nest. For about a week, the new mother will not leave the baby's side even to eat or drink.The cub, who will not be named for its first hundred days in accordance with tradition, will remain in the den for its first few months of life. For now it is pink and hairless; the distinctive black and white fur markings come later.Meanwhile father Tian Tian seems blissfully oblivious, rolling around his outdoor enclosure Saturday morning. Giant pandas are almost entirely solitary, and in the wild it would be normal for Tian Tian to never meet his offspring.""There's no real role for the male to play in the baby's care,"" Monfort said. ""He's probably more interested in what's for breakfast this morning.""Mei Xiang was artificially inseminated in the spring shortly after the entire zoo shut down on March 14 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Normally a combination of frozen sperm and fresh semen extracted from Tian Tian would have been used. But in order to minimize the number of close-quarters medical procedures, zoo officials used only frozen semen.It was the first successful procedure of its kind in the U.S. using only frozen sperm, and Mei Xiang, at 22, is the oldest giant panda to successfully give birth in the country. The oldest in the world gave birth in China at age 23.Mei Xiang has three surviving offspring — Tai Shan, Bao Bao and Bei Bei — which were transported to China at the age of four under an agreement with the Chinese government.With the indoor section of the panda house closed due to COVID-19 restrictions, the panda cam is really the only way to view the newborn. The zoo reopened on a limited basis on July 24 with visitors needing timed passes to keep the crowds down.For now, zoo officials are directing panda-maniacs to the live cam and are expecting unprecedented interest from a global population sheltering under pandemic restrictions and desperate for a bit of good news.""Something like this is kind of a miracle for us,"" Monfort said. ""It lifts the spirits and of my team and the whole world.""Smith said it's also a fresh chance to direct those passions toward fundraising efforts that can help support global conservation initiatives.""Conservation only happens when people care, and people really care about giant pandas"" she said."

The Canadian government can intervene to end Meng's extradition trial. Should it? | CBC News,Seasoned jurists say the Canadian government has every legal right to intervene to free Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou from her extradition trial to the U.S. But some experts say such an action could have significant political ramifications.,2020-06-24T00:25:32.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/meng-extradition-liberal-government-intervene-1.5623991,"While seasoned jurists say the Canadian government has every legal right to intervene to free Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou from her extradition trial to the U.S., some experts warn such an action could have significant political ramifications.""The question isn't whether the [Canadian government] can, the question is whether they should,"" said Toronto-based lawyer Brian Greenspan.In 1999, the Extradition Act was amended to include a specific provision that provides the federal minister of justice the power to intervene in an extradition at any point during the judicial phase.""The minister has the right to withdraw the authority to proceed and to end the extradition proceeding, and it's totally at the discretion of the minister of justice,"" Greenspan said.WATCH | Chinese Foreign Ministry comments on CBC interview with Michael Kovrig's wife  WorldExtradition proceedings continue in the case against Meng, who was arrested in 2018 in Vancouver on behalf of American justice officials. The United States wants to prosecute Meng for fraud, alleging she lied to banks about her company's connections with Iran, which could possibly violate U.S. sanctions.The issue of the Canadian government intervening in the case of Meng, the daughter of the Chinese technology giant's founder, was raised recently by the wife of Michael Kovrig, one of two Canadians being held in China on charges of spying.The Trudeau government has accused China of detaining Kovrig and Michael Spavor in retaliation for the arrest of Meng. Some have suggested Canada could secure their freedom if it put an end to the extradition proceedings against Meng and allowed her to return to China. Trudeau has said his government continues to work behind the scenes to secure the release of the two Canadians but has ruled out a prisoner exchange.The Office of the Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, David Lametti, said in a statement Tuesday they are ""well aware of the laws and processes governing"" the extradition proceedings.""As Ms. Meng's case remains before the courts, and the Minister of Justice has a direct role in the extradition process, it would not be appropriate to comment further on this matter,"" the statement said.WATCH | Canada can stop Meng Wanzhou's extradition, legal experts say. Should it?The NationalFormer Supreme Court of Canada justice John Major said while Lametti can intervene at any time in the extradition process, it would be unusual — especially if after a prolonged court hearing, it concluded in favour of extradition.But Major noted there may be reasons to do it, especially as Kovrig and Spavor languish in Chinese detention. ""I would hope before the attorney general intervenes, [he] would have reasons that convince Canadians he should,"" Major told CBC News.""The attorney general has to be very cautious in overruling a trial judge who has conducted a full hearing … You just want [Lametti] to act judiciously, not politically.""Major said Canada is stuck in a difficult position, because if the attorney general quashes the judge's decision in Meng's case, the U.S. could react. Likewise, if the judge approves extradition, China could retaliate.""It's a delicate situation where you have the U.S. at odds with China and Canada being caught in the middle,"" Major said.Donald Abelson, director of St. Francis Xavier University's Brian Mulroney Institute of Government, said he believes it would be ""a very dangerous game for Canada to play in terms of succumbing to pressure"" to intervene politically in the case.""I don't think that's a game that we want to play,"" said Abelson, who was also a founding director of the Canada-U.S. Institute. ""It puts us in a very, very precarious position because we don't want to be seen by the Americans as succumbing to Chinese political pressure.""Abelson said Canada would be ""tempting fate"" with the U.S, particularly in the current political climate, where the Chinese government has become the focus of Donald Trump's ire in terms of the COVID-19 pandemic and the countries' trade war.Abelson said Canada doesn't want to become a ""punching bag"" for Washington.WATCH | Wife of Michael Kovrig says Canada can choose to end the extradition process:The NationalDavid Carment, a a professor at Carleton University's Norman Paterson School of International Affairs, said he believes Canada's intervention would prompt the Trump administration to use it as a rallying cry to undermine Trudeau's leadership and his pursuit for a majority government when he calls an election.""I think all sort of diplomatic gloves would come off in this case. The United States would come out fighting and work to undermine this current government's mandate,"" he said.Christopher Sands, director of the Centre for Canadian Studies at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, said that the state department officials who brought the case forward against Meng would be unhappy with Canada's decision to intervene.Trump would likely be angry, send off a dismissive tweet or give Trudeau the cold shoulder at the next G7 meeting. But Sands doesn't believe it would result in major policy ramifications against Canada.""Would it be 'Canadians are no longer allowed to cross the border?' No. The relationship between us and Canada is too big and complex for that,"" he said. ""I can't see any lasting damage."""
Digital authoritarianism: How technology designed to empower us was seized by autocrats | CBC Radio,"The initial vision of the internet was that it would empower individuals and expose the wrongdoings of state and corporate interests. But now the same technologies that had been used for public uprisings against oppressive governments are now being used by those governments against political demonstrators, whistleblowers and dissidents.",2020-11-12T19:34:04.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/radio/ideas/digital-authoritarianism-how-technology-designed-to-empower-us-was-seized-by-autocrats-1.5797135,"This is Part 4 of the six-part 2020 Massey Lecture series Reset: Reclaiming the Internet for Civil Society. Find the rest of the series here.The internet was supposed to be our salvation.While historically power has remained in the tight grasp of a select few, the initial vision of the internet was that it would empower individuals and expose the wrongdoings of state and corporate interests.According to Misha Glenny, author of Dark Market: CyberThieves, CyberCops and You, back in the 1990s, ""everyone had this tremendous hope that the internet was going to be this great tool of democratization.""And at first, it was.In 2011, ""we all watched in shock as long-standing dictators succumbed to the 'people power' of the social media age,"" says Ron Deibert, founder of the Citizen Lab, which focuses on the internet and human rights.Though the Arab Spring was only nine years ago, ""in internet years, that's a lifetime,"" he says. And as Deibert explains in his fourth Massey Lecture, a lot has changed in the years following the social media uprising.For that brief, sparkling moment, he says, authoritarian regimes were seen as a thing of the past. Unfortunately, it wasn't just political underdogs and freedom fighters who recognized the immense power of these revolutionary new tools.The great lesson of the Arab Spring, says John Naughton, a professor of the public understanding of technology at the Open University in the U.K., ""is that autocrats actually are better at using this allegedly democratizing technology than democratic regimes.""Naughton, author of From Gutenberg to Zuckerberg: What You Really Need to Know About the Internet, explains that the same technologies that had been used for public uprisings against oppressive governments are now being used by those governments against political demonstrators, whistleblowers and dissidents.""In that sense,"" Naughton says, ""the technology has turned on us. We thought that it was always going to be liberating and democratizing. And sometimes, it's actually enslaving.""Nearly a decade after what had been called ""Twitter revolution,"" we find ourselves in Big Brother territory, says Glenny, remarking at the extraordinary speed with which intelligence agencies and militaries in particular have appropriated these tools. ""Now most countries are using data from their citizens to monitor, to see what they're up to.""While such Orwellian envisioning was long seen as futuristic, ""we're now moving into a technological environment where the complete surveillance of all citizens, of all populace, of all people, and of all things is increasingly possible,"" says Daniel Deudney, a professor of political science and international relations at Johns Hopkins University.So how did it come to be it that the very tools meant to empower individuals were so swiftly seized by the powers that sought to maintain control?It did not take long for authoritarian regimes and security agencies ""to realize just how useful it is to have their adversaries plugged in, networked, and online communicating,"" says Deibert.As he explains, the technologies used to organize grassroots uprisings, such as smartphones and social media platforms — consumer products made by technology companies for whom security is often an afterthought — just served to supercharge ""the dictator's totalizing gaze and iron grip,"" which have now become borderless as well.Government agencies can now easily keep tabs on individuals, no matter where they are. They can ascertain who their friends and family members are, track their movements, and see their plans unfold in real time, ""from the very device they hold in their hands, and that they carry with them as they go about their daily business,"" explains Deibert.Saudi Arabia, for example, ""has aggressively pursued extensive social media manipulation, digital subversion, and cyber-espionage,"" he says. And while some of it has been directed at regional rivals, ""the bulk of it is intended to thwart political opposition and dissent,"" ranging from political opposition, to criticism of the crown prince, to the assertion of women's rights.The troubling irony is that while we may perceive our devices and social media accounts as our windows to the world, says Deibert, ""the flow of communications over the internet works in both directions."" Indeed, those devices and accounts are also a window into our lives for those on the outside looking in.""Far from being the existential threat that many observers of the Arab Spring assumed, social media have turned out to be a dictator's best friend,"" says Deibert.Perhaps more disturbing yet is the fact that these tactics are being used not only to monitor dissidents, but to keep entire societies in check. In China, ""information controls have evolved far beyond mere defensive measures to more proactive uses of social media for large-scale social and economic engineering,"" says Deibert.The so-called ""social credit system"" is an all-encompassing initiative to draw on data from across the internet, as well as information captured by an estimated 200 million cameras across the country, to track and evaluate individuals for their ""trustworthiness"" and root out ""uncivilized behaviour,"" which Deibert notes, includes wearing pyjamas in public or jaywalking.""High-resolution digital surveillance cameras are omnipresent, scattered throughout our cities,"" says Deibert, and ""layered underneath those fixed cameras are the billions of consumer devices that nearly everyone carries with them at all times, the standard features of which include a built-in digital camera. Multiplying the effects is a widespread 'selfie' culture of auto-surveillance, in which digital images of people's faces are frequently snapped and then shared on social media platforms with a mere click.""As the images are digitized, they can be easily converted into a matrix of data points that algorithms and artificial intelligence systems can sift through and sort. Tools that harness this unprecedented collection of biometric data are already available, and have, as journalist Kashmir Hill noted in the New York Times, the power to ""end privacy as we know it."" While China and Saudi Arabia are notable examples of how new technologies are enabling ""digital authoritarianism"" to flourish, Deibert warns, ""it would be a mistake to conclude that the effects of social media are limited to a group of bad actors 'over there.'"" Indeed, some have argued the greatest threat to the recent U.S. election was not Russian interference, but came from within the White House. Other reports have indicated that social media accelerates political polarization, to say nothing of the harmful effects of misinformation.A 2019 report titled Democracy in Retreat, from U.S. NGO Freedom House, which measures indicators of democracy worldwide, recorded ""the 13th consecutive year of decline in global freedom,"" noting that the reversal has spanned a variety of countries in every region, from authoritarian regimes such as China, Russia and Saudia Arabia to long-standing democracies, like the United States. (On a scale from most free to least free, Canada was right at the top — above the U.S., the U.K., Australia, and Germany — with freedom of the press, and no blocking of social media and political content.)We are at a juncture, a turning point, and the fundamental question now, says Daniel Deudney, is: who is going to have access to these massive amounts information and for what purposes?""We have to be very sober about this. This is a technology that may be much better for empowering the adversaries of liberal democracy than for empowering liberal democracy. At a minimum, it's going to be necessary for liberal democracy to step up and come up with a regime for the use of this technology in ways that are compatible with its fundamental principles. And if we can't do that, we have to realistically expect liberal democracy to wither away, to dissolve away.""Deibert concludes that, ""there is no jurisdiction that is immune to corruption and authoritarian practices — only greater or lesser degrees of protection against them.""But there's still hope. While the decks are stacked in favour of autocrats, CEOs, billionaires and the politically powerful, says Astra Taylor, author of The People's Platform: Taking Back Power and Culture in the Digital Age, what's unique about this new technology is that ""it is something that can still be made by people. We can still tinker with it and build new things… this technology has potential to be reclaimed, redesigned and put to different purposes.According to Democracy in Retreat, when it comes to internet freedoms, of the 65 countries assessed, 26 have been on an overall decline since June 2017, but 19 registered net improvements. So while the bad news outweighs the good, there is some positive momentum, and no doubt, to Taylor's point, that progress is largely due to public pushback.The report includes suggestions for civilians wanting to counter the spread of digital authoritarianism. These include: monitoring their country's collaboration with Chinese firms, raising awareness about government surveillance efforts, and working with experts scholars to examine how disinformation spreads, all of which is sound advice not just for those on the ""watch list,"" but for those of us in Canada, too.Ramona Pringle, Technology ColumnistRamona Pringle is an associate professor in Faculty of Communication and Design and director of the Creative Innovation Studio at Ryerson University.

Details of province's secret agreement with Brightenview emerge as dispute about megamall boils over | CBC News,"The province is threatening to evict Brightenview from its GTH office because it has failed to pay its lease for more than a year. Meanwhile, Brightenview’s CEO says the province has “misled” him, broken its contract and abandoned his company.",2020-10-12T12:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/details-of-sask-secret-agreement-with-brightenview-emerge-1.5756542,"On the eve of the previous Saskatchewan election, Brightenview Development International and the Global Transportation Hub (GTH) celebrated their new land deal and partnership. They agreed to work together as a united team to promote Brightenview's immigration business around the world. Four years later, that partnership has imploded.The province is threatening to evict Brightenview from its GTH office because the company has failed to pay its lease for more than a year. Meanwhile, Brightenview's CEO says the province has ""misled"" him, broken its contract and abandoned his company.He delivered a message to the province in an interview with CBC. ""You don't give a s--t about this live business you literally brought into [the GTH],"" said Joe Zhou. ""There's a contract, right? You're not done yet. You have an obligation."" In Feb. 2016, Brightenview agreed to purchase 30 acres of land at the GTH. Initially it purchased 10 acres and built its 80,000 square foot wholesale mall which was completed in the summer of 2018. The company agreed to temporarily lease a second 10-acre parcel, where it constructed its 4,000 square foot corporate office.  The GTH, a government-owned industrial subdivision, says Brightenview is $538,000 in arrears on that lease.""Brightenview refuses to pay the rent it agreed to in the signed lease agreement and will not offer a suitable alternative,"" wrote GTH CEO Matt Schroeder in an email to CBC. ""Therefore it is within our legal rights to seize the building on the leased premises until a suitable resolution can be found.""Zhou said he's facing financial troubles that stem in part from actions by the provincial government which harmed his business. Zhou said that before the last election the GTH promised to be his partner and help promote his company's megamall to would-be immigrants in China. He said the province did that for a time, even sending former Premier Brad Wall to China to help promote the project.Zhou said the government is now acting like his adversary. Late last year, the province changed the rules and banned any new immigration applications tied to Brightenview's megamall. The province said there was a fundamental flaw with Brightenview's business model that put immigrant investors at ""undue risk."" Zhou said that decision ""threatens and cripples our ability to sustain the project."" He said 75 Chinese nationals have set up shop in the wholesale mall and the government has abandoned them too.   ""You're the one literally in the agreement that attracted these investors. You played this major role, Right? You can't deny that."" Four years ago, the two sides were all handshakes and smiles. On Feb. 3, 2016, weeks before the launch of the election, Brightenview and the GTH signed a multimillion dollar land deal and a co-operation agreement.By May 2017, Brightenview had broken ground on the first of three 120-unit wholesale malls it planned for the property. The Minister Responsible for Immigration and the GTH, Jeremy Harrison, was there.""We're really optimistic. I think this is really going to be a very positive project,"" he said.Called the Global Trade and Exhibition Centre (GTEC), the mall is intimately tied to immigration.The company told Chinese nationals that purchasing and running a storefront in GTEC would qualify them to gain permanent residency in Canada through the entrepreneurial category of Saskatchewan's immigration program.The company also told would-be immigrants that the entire project was supported and promoted by the Saskatchewan government.Zhou said it was the province's promise of support and promotion that lured him into the 30-acre deal at a premium price of $7.6 million.He said he didn't even negotiate the price, because for him this wasn't primarily a land purchase. His priority was to gain the government's endorsement of his project through a formal co-operation agreement.For the past four years, Brightenview and the Saskatchewan government worked together to keep the details of their co-operation agreement secret.The province has waged a two year battle in court against the CBC, arguing that releasing details of the agreement would show prospective tenants at the GTH just how much the organization was willing to do to attract them.Zhou said that in light of the government's recent moves to harm his business, he's been forced to publicly talk about the agreement.He said the GTH promised:To work with Brightenview as ""a united team"" to promote the Brightenview project and Brightenview's business interests.To co-ordinate general public relations activity and the promotion of the ""Brightenview model.""To allocate internal resources to help promote, qualify and prospective clients to Brightenview — including two annual international trade missions.To set up a co-operative governance model with Brightenview, including joint directions, plans, resources and ongoing performance management.To arrange regular meetings between Brightenview and selected senior government officials.To provide Brightenview with strategic advice and help in its dealings with federal, provincial and municipal governments.Zhou said the company never would have done the land deal without this agreement.He said having a western government vouch for the credibility and authenticity of his project is crucial when attempting to do business in China, where potential investors are wary of scams. Zhou said he had been in discussions with the GTH for years, but when the deal finally came together it happened quickly and was approved at the highest level.On Dec. 18, 2015, he and his team were summoned to a meeting they had been seeking for a long time. Then-Minister of the Economy Bill Boyd, who was responsible for immigration and the GTH, had agreed to discuss the terms of a co-operation agreement.Zhou said Boyd's presence and support were crucial, because the GTEC project required the full backing of the provincial government. Zhou said he wanted assurances that the Saskatchewan Immigrant Nominee Program (SINP) would be comfortable with the Brightenview model so he could tell prospective investors that ""this program, the model, what it does, is number one, recognized by the [SINP]. In early February 2016, just before the deal was signed, Boyd confirmed in a letter that the ""GTH is the lead agency empowered by government to work with Brightenview on the proposed projects,"" and he instructed the GTH to ""engage the relevant resources within government and any external agencies to assist as necessary.""On Feb. 3, 2016, Zhou was invited to the GTH office to sign the final agreements.That very morning, CBC broke a story about another series of land agreements at the GTH. The story outlined how politically well-connected businessmen made millions on a series of transactions that saw 204 acres of land at the GTH wind up in taxpayers' hands for far more than it was worth.The government had an appraisal that said the property was worth $30,000 an acre, but they paid a politically well-connected businessman $103,000 an acre.With weeks to go before the provincial campaign, the NDP called for a police investigation and the premier called for a provincial auditor review. Boyd defended the deal but others said they thought it stinks.20 unanswered questions about the GTH land dealThe Brightenview land sale ended up forming the foundation of the Saskatchewan Party's campaign response to the story.On Dec. 16, 2015, a month and a half before the Brightenview deal was signed, Boyd gave CBC his one and only interview about the GTH land deal transactions.Two days later, on Dec. 18, Boyd and other senior government officials met with Zhou to hammer out the details of the co-operation agreement.Zhou said he had no idea CBC was working on a story about the GTH at that time, but that he did notice the government has a new sense of urgency toward his proposal.""They were very eager,"" he said. That suited him just fine, because he wanted to get a deal done quickly too. Zhou said because his priority was to get the co-operation agreement, he just agreed to what the GTH said was the set rate: $256,000 an acre. That's the most anyone has paid for land there.Internal documents obtained by CBC show that before the deal was signed, the premier's office thoroughly evaluated Brightenview and its business. The documents also show that the province knew the Brightenview's business model was tied to Immigration.On March 1, 2016, days before the election call, the province sent out a news release.That $256,000/acre price tag was in the opening sentence and was often mentioned by the premier in the election campaign whenever the GTH land deal controversy was raised. When reporters would ask why the government paid so much more than their own appraisal, Wall said land prices were going crazy.""The GTH had their lower appraisal and they agreed at $103,000 and land is now selling at $256,000,"" Wall said, noting that in the end ""taxpayers are making money.""Not long after Wall won that election, he was in China speaking at a GTEC event.  In September 2016, Wall and an entourage flew to China, where the premier spoke at an event organized by Brightenview and attended by 3,500 Chinese investors.  Zhou said images of that event were so widely publicized that his project had instant credibility. A GTEC brochure features photos of this trip. A caption reads, ""Premier Brad Wall strongly supports and promotes the GTH-GTEC project in person.""That message got through.For example, a Feb. 22, 2017 article on a high-profile China-based finance website says ""GTEC is an immigration project managed by the Saskatchewan government… it provides a fast and efficient way to immigrate to Canada.""Zhou said many Chinese people who invested in his project came here because of that Saskatchewan government endorsement.So far, about 75 Chinese-owned businesses have set up shop inside. They sell a wide range of products from electronics to flooring to furniture.GTEC and Brightenview have been shrouded in some controversy.CBC reported that some Chinese nationals have claimed to have been cheated and filed lawsuits against Brightenview. The provincial government has alleged that Brightenview's advertising of the project was misleading, in that it suggested Brightenview had a special relationship with the province's immigration program.Zhou has argued that the company has followed all the rules and had a written commitment that the Saskatchewan government fully backed his project.He said the media attention on the project has slowed sales of new units. He said it also appears to have attracted the attention of Immigration Canada, which is responsible for evaluating the applications of GTEC investors.""We have found these people have experienced a large amount of rejections seemingly through... an extraordinary scrutiny,"" Zhou said.He said in many of those cases, Ottawa rejected the application for the same reason — the proposed business was not deemed sufficiently beneficial to Canada.About 30 applicants have been stuck in limbo for a couple of years, having purchased a GTEC unit but having been rejected by Ottawa, Zhou said.Some GTEC applicants have asked for refunds because they've been waiting too long and have lost hope. Yet the bills have continued to pour in for Brightenview.""Our losses are in millions,"" Zhou said.Zhou acknowledges he still hasn't paid all the construction bills.In April, Brightenview's electrical contractor placed a $380,000 lien on the megamall and launched a lawsuit.In May, the general contractor that built GTEC placed $1.4 million in mortgages on Brightenview's properties.At the same time, the GTH has been going through struggles of its own.The organization has failed to sell any land since the Brightenview purchase. Every year it goes deeper into debt.In the fall of 2019, the government turned the management and sales of the GTH over to a private sector realtor.""The GTH notified Brightenview in person that our desire for their success hadn't changed, however the GTH would no longer be completing the contemplated actions pursuant to the co-operation agreement,"" said GTH CEO Schroeder.Zhou said that since that time he has been treated like a tenant, not a partner.When the land deal was originally signed, Brightenview committed to purchasing 30 acres. Zhou said that because of the Immigration Canada troubles, the company was unable to purchase the second 10-acre parcel, but it needed some of the land for its corporate office building, so he decided to temporarily lease the parcel and construct his $1-million corporate office there. The leasing fee was steep, $29,000/month, but he figured it would only be for a short period of time and he would need that land for phase two of his project.He was wrong. In early November 2019, the provincial government banned all immigration applications tied to Brightenview, effectively ending plans for phase two.Zhou said that rendered the leased land ""purposeless and useless,"" because 97 per cent of it is vacant ""with no evident opportunity to be put to business use.""The bill keeps going up every month, now totalling $538,000. Zhou said soon it could equal the $1 million he paid for the building.He said he feels trapped, unable to move the office building from the leased land.""My body is shaking."" He said he doesn't want to simply walk away from what he has built or from the entrepreneurs he has attracted to the province.""I'm trying to be a responsible business for the sake of the tenants,"" he said, adding he would still like to make the business work somehow.In a series of letters to the province, Zhou has implored the most recent Minister Responsible for the GTH, Don Morgan, for mercy in light of the cooperation agreement and the COVID-19 crisis.He asked the province to forgive the lease arrears in their entirety and rewrite the lease for just one acre of land instead of the current 10.""This worries me, this lease. Alright? Can you please dissolve that?,"" Zhou said. ""I did not demand or claim. I simply outcry to ask for assistance.""Zhou said he has been met with silence for months.CBC asked the GTH about Zhou's request. In an email, Schroeder said the organization isn't bound by the co-operation agreement because it is not a formal contract. ""While the document signed between Brightenview and the GTH is labelled an agreement, the absence of consideration, termination date, remedies for breach and other standard contract clauses indicate that this is not a formal contract but instead a memorandum of understanding,"" he wrote. He added that the GTH's partnership with Brightenview ""did not absolve Brightenview of meeting their contractual commitments or adapting to changing business climates.""Zhou said Schroeder is wrong about the co-operation agreement.He said that agreement was signed at the same time as the land sale and they were a package deal.""This is a bonafide contract with significant monetary considerations,"" he said, noting that his company invested millions in purchasing land and building the GTEC facility.He said he hopes he and the province can come to some sort of resolution. He said it would not be good for anyone if his company suffered a high-profile failure.""I would be very sorry if after all of this Brightenview and the project mission should end up being a victim, a casualty of the making and shaping of GTH and the government,"" he said."

He's confused everyone, even his own supporters,"" said Woodward, associate editor of The Washington Post.Such a direct comment is unusual for Woodward, who was part of the team that uncovered the Watergate scandal, leading to the eventual resignation of former U.S. President Richard Nixon. ""Ben Bradlee was the editor of The Post during Watergate. I learned from Ben: report the facts, don't get into name-calling one way or another,"" he said.But he said that after 19 interviews with Trump conducted over 10 months, he felt compelled to write his assessment of the current president in an epilogue to Rage. He then showed the section to his wife and editors.""They said: 'Well, you're writing a book about truth. And that's what you feel is the truth, based on evidence,"" he recalled.""'You can't leave that out of the book. You have an obligation to say that.'""Recordings of Woodward's interviews with Trump were released by The Washington Post and CNN in early September. In the taped conversations, the president indicated he understood the severity of the virus in the early days of the pandemic.In an interview on Feb. 7, Trump told Woodward that the virus ""goes through the air,"" and was ""more deadly than even your strenuous flus.""NewsPublicly that month, Trump repeatedly told the public that the U.S. was in control of the outbreak, at one point telling a Feb. 28 South Carolina rally that the coronavirus is ""[the Democrats'] new hoax.""On March 19, roughly a week after the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic and a state of emergency was declared in the U.S., Trump told Woodward that he ""wanted to always play it down.""""I still like playing it down, because I don't want to create a panic,"" he said.Woodward's new book follows his 2018 book Fear, in which he concluded that there was ""a nervous breakdown of the executive branch in America.""At the time, Trump denounced Fear as ""fiction, pure fiction,"" but he was still willing to talk to Woodward for the follow-up book.""I think he knew I would listen,"" Woodward said. ""I let him have his say; that was my responsibility as a reporter.""He added that he also had a responsibility to put Trump's words and actions in context.""The context is that 200,000 people have died and he could have averted some of it,"" he said. ""The big problem is this is a moving train. The pandemic may get worse.""WorldWoodward has faced criticism for not reporting Trump's remarks sooner, but said he didn't have the full timeline of what Trump knew, and when he knew it.""You can't write about something you don't know about, unfortunately,"" he said.Woodward said it was only in May that he discovered Trump had been briefed about the severity of the approaching pandemic in a classified Jan. 28 meeting. At that briefing, Trump's national security adviser Robert O' Brien warned the virus would be the biggest national security threat to Trump's presidency, Woodward said. But when they spoke in March, he thought Trump was reacting to new information from China. ""I'm in this question of 'Gee, I know what the president has told me — he's talking about China!' because he had just talked to President Xi [Jinping] the night before, and they had talked about the virus,"" Woodward told Galloway.""And I spent months trying to understand what Trump and Xi had talked about."" Bob Woodward had my quotes for many months. If he thought they were so bad or dangerous, why didn’t he immediately report them in an effort to save lives? Didn’t he have an obligation to do so? No, because he knew they were good and proper answers. Calm, no panic!Woodward said he spent weeks trying to figure out ""What did the president know? When did he know it? And how did he know?""""And I kept digging at that, and finally in May got the answer.""On May 6, Woodward asked Trump if he remembered O'Brien's warning.""Trump said: 'No, but I know he said that,'"" Woodward remembers.By then, 75,000 people had died of COVID-19 in the U.S., and ""everyone knew that it was something that could be transmitted through the air, transmitted by people who didn't show symptoms,"" Woodward said.""So there was no story to run. I wanted to make sure I could put all this together in a book,"" he said. The U.S.'s COVID death toll surpassed 200,000 on Tuesday, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.WorldAsked about the comments during a White House press conference on Sept. 9, Trump said he didn't want people to be frightened, but instead wanted to show confidence and strength as a nation.Following the release of the tape, White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said Trump did not intentionally mislead Americans about the severity of the coronavirus epidemic.""The president never downplayed the virus,"" she said. ""The president displayed calm.""Democrat presidential nominee Joe Biden said that Trump had committed ""a life-and-death betrayal of the American people,"" and was ""unfit for this job as a consequence.""Woodward also said Trump displayed a failure ""to understand the people he leads."" ""We know the people in this country, when they're told the truth, rally around together,"" he said, citing the attacks on Pearl Harbour and the World Trade Center on Sept. 11, 2001.""The president at this top secret meeting asked questions, was fully informed, and then instead of telling the public he chose denial and a failure to do his duty as president to protect the country and to tell the truth to the country."" NewsWoodward said the publication of his book shows that free speech is still protected in the U.S.""He has not sent the attorney general or the FBI or people to raid my house and steal my tape recordings and documents and put me in jail, and say I'm guilty of something,"" he said.""The democracy is functioning; the leadership is what's failed.""But he said he fears for his country because Trump has ""launched a full-scale attack on his own election process,"" in effect becoming ""an advocate for chaos.""Recent attacks on mail-in ballots are ""an extension of the self-centredness that he's practised in his presidency,"" he said.Because of the new and unprecedented massive amount of unsolicited ballots which will be sent to “voters”, or wherever, this year, the Nov 3rd Election result may NEVER BE ACCURATELY DETERMINED, which is what some want.

Local rice? Experimental farm showcases crop in Chatham-Kent | CBC News,"Rice is grown in Asia, Africa, the southern United States — and if Ontario FangZheng Agriculture Enterprise has its way — one day across Chatham-Kent.",2019-06-29T02:20:30.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/windsor/local-rice-experimental-chatham-kent-1.5194818,"Rice is grown in Asia, Africa, the southern United States — and if Ontario FangZheng Agriculture Enterprise has its way — one day across Chatham-Kent.On Friday, the company held an open house to celebrate the successful planting of its first-ever experimental crop of medium-grain rice, grown on a hectare of land on a roughly 29-hectare farm located off Queen's Line on Drake Road.CBC News WindsorFarm manager Wendy Zhang, who recently graduated from an agricultural masters program at the University of Guelph, said that the unusually wet spring that has concerned many local farmers actually helped her crop in a way, since rice is grown in wet conditions.""I kept saying to my farmer friends, ""I'm happy [that it's raining today] — I save money on [gas for my water pumps!]""Zhang explained that the goal is, once commercially viable, to export the rice internationally, particularly to the Chinese market.""Canada has got a very good reputation in the international market with food quality and safety control,"" she said. ""We want to produce high quality, clean rice ... in Canada we can ensure that.""Tap on the player to hear reporter Jonathan Pinto talk about his visit to the farm on CBC Radio's Afternoon Drive.When asked if the current tensions between Canada and China may put a damper on Chinese demand for Canadian products, Zhang wasn't concerned.""As a Chinese citizen who lives in Canada, Chinese people [have liked] Canada for a very long time,"" she said. ""There's something happening right now [between our two countries] but I truly believe it's a temporary thing.""Zhang also noted that her company is a private enterprise not controlled by the Chinese government.University of Guelph professor John Zandstra, who has been providing assistance to the project, said he was initially skeptical of the idea of growing rice in Canada.""I kinda laughed at first,"" he said, explaining that he thought of rice as something only viable in the southern United States. ""[But] when they got explaining where they grew it [in China] and when I went there and saw it, [I thought] 'well yeah, this might work.'""Gus Kotsakis, an industrial and commodities sales manager at Dainty Foods, which operates a rice mill in Windsor — the only of it's kind in Canada — said when he was first approached by Zhang, his company also didn't think growing rice in Canada would work.He was impressed with what he saw on the farm Friday.""I'm going to bring pictures and everything that was discussed here,"" he said. ""I think it's great news for the area. We look forward to working with them long term as a partner on this project, where we could help them with milling and processing the rice.""This year's crop will be harvested this fall, with the rice used to seed a larger crop for next year.While there are still a few regulatory hurdles before the crop can become commercially viable — the government, for example, doesn't have any approved fertilizers and pesticides for rice because the grain hasn't been grown here before — Zhang is confident those issues can be quickly addressed.""We want [commercial harvesting to] happen next year,"" she said. ""We have the passion to do it."""

"Don't blame bats for COVID-19, says University of Saskatchewan researcher | CBC News",A U of S researcher says there is no evidence that COVID-19 jumped to humans from bats.,2020-05-07T18:11:46.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatoon/u-of-s-researcher-dont-blame-bats-covid-1.5559763,"There are many theories about the source of the global COVIDs pandemic, including the idea the virus may have jumped from bats to humans at markets in China. Not so fast, said Vikram Misra, a bat expert and microbiologist at the University of Saskatchewan. ""There's no direct evidence,"" Misra said. ""The exact viruses, the very viruses that cause disease in people and other animals, those have not been found in bats.""There are, however, some important lessons to be learned about bats, according to Misra: how they deal with viruses, potentially spread them to humans and how to best prevent that from happening.""[Bats] have lots of viruses but there are very very few viral diseases that actually make them sick,"" said Misra. ""They also seem to have for some of these viruses a very balanced relationship...they don't get rid of the viruses, the viruses just sort of come along or multiply at a very very low rate.""The problem for bats is that when they are under stress, that delicate balance tips.""While this wonderfully balanced relationship exists between bats and some of their viruses,"" Misra said, ""If you stress the bats then that relationship changes and then the viruses start to multiply at a much higher rate.""According to Misra, the risk of passing disease from bats to the human population increases when the viruses begin multiplying. ""You know we shouldn't blame bats for these diseases, but if you want to sort of prevent spillovers of viruses from bats to other species and finally to humans we have to sort of treat them better.""There are several factors that can lead to higher levels of stress in bats, including fungal disease, having to fly long distances for food and being confined in cages, a situation that may sometimes be seen in wet markets in China where bats are sold as food for human consumption.There is one other compelling lesson that may prove useful to researchers trying to find new ways to treat COVID-19, but Misra offered an important disclaimer first. ""We don't work with COVID-19, we work with other coronaviruses. Also all our work is in the laboratory, and so you've got to be a bit cautious about extending that to the real world.""Misra suggested that when people get sick from COVID-19, the real problem that leads to severe symptoms and sometimes death is the way our bodies respond to the infection. For example, he said, inflammation can be a real problem. Bats are different, Misra said. When they become infected, their cells turn on antiviral responses and turn off inflammatory responses, the opposite of what seems to happen in humans. Misra said there are some clues about how bats do this. It's possible, he said, that drugs could be developed to switch on a similar response in humans."

Even though the gowns are designed in North America, just about everything Nelly Semaan sells comes from Asia, predominately China.""I had to turn a few orders away because I couldn't get them in on time,"" said Semaan, co-owner of His and Hers Wear and Bridal in Windsor, Ont.The boutique has been a family business for more than 50 years. Semaan said she's never witnessed delays to this extent ever before.And she's not alone. Other bridal shops in Windsor are also experiencing delays in getting dresses on time.Since wedding dresses are ordered so far in advance, Semaan isn't worried about any of her current brides. Plus, she has a lot of stock on-hand that can be tailored.However, even prom gowns and bridesmaids attire are being delayed upwards of three months. Before the coronavirus outbreak, she could place a rush order and receive it within weeks.""Usually I could, but now because of the coronavirus I'm sorry I can't,"" said Semaan. ""You're going to have to make due with what's here. We're going to have to figure things out.""Even area florists are worried how they'll function if these factory shutdowns in China are prolonged.""It's very concerning because if we're not finding it from there, are we able to find it anywhere else, or what's going to be the cost of it,"" said Tricia Xavier, owner of the Purple Pansy in Chatham, Ont.She orders roughly 80 per cent of the stores product from China due to the low cost, aside from its fresh flowers, which are sourced much closer to home. Things like containers for floral arrangements, artificial flowers and silks, Christmas garlands and wreaths all come from overseas.""We're a small store so a little glitch in things, a little bump in things, it affects us tremendously,"" said Xavier.Just last month she attended the Toronto Gift Show. She quickly learned one of her suppliers can't go to China to shop for products that she would receive in store months down the road.""This stains our livelihood,"" she worries, if it trickles down to her small flower shop.Roughly 30 per cent of her business also supports weddings.Even though some factories in China are operating again at half capacity, Semaan has already begun scoping out new suppliers in Europe in the event these delays are long-lasting. ""Hopefully, you know what, this can come back to North America,"" said Semaan. ""Years ago, goods were made in Montreal, in New York, in Toronto. It would be nice to get that back here.""She's even run out of custom-printed garment bags that are made overseas because of delays in shipping due to the coronavirus, forcing her to ""scrounge around"" to fill the void.Semaan watches her email closely as she's been getting daily updates on the delays for the dresses she sources from China.Luckily she hasn't had to tell any brides-to-be or potential prom queens that the gowns they already ordered would be delayed, as she always plans ""way ahead of time."""

Huawei sues U.S. over 'stonewalling' on Meng Wanzhou documents | CBC News,Huawei is suing multiple U.S. government agencies to try to force the release of documents the company believes could reveal political motivations behind the arrest of its chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou.,2020-11-04T09:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/huawei-meng-wanzhou-documents-suing-1.5788329,"Huawei is suing multiple U.S. government agencies to try to force the release of documents the company believes could reveal political motivations behind the arrest of its chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou.In a complaint filed last week in federal district court in Washington, D.C., the telecommunications giant accuses the Trump administration of ""stonewalling"" numerous freedom of information requests to 16 agencies, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the U.S. Department of Justice and the Department of Commerce.Huawei's lawyers say there are ""signs"" the U.S. wants to use criminal charges against the company and Meng ""to advance policy objectives unrelated to the evenhanded administration of criminal justice.""In addition to inter-agency documents, the lawsuit also seeks communications between the Department of Homeland Security, the Justice Department and ""certain Canadian authorities that participated in the investigation or arrest of Ms. Meng.""""These communications are primarily aimed at identifying communications that could indicate improper bases for the prosecution of [Huawei] and Ms. Meng,"" the lawsuit reads.The complaint goes on to list what Huawei claims are the reasons for Meng's extradition, including interfering with Huawei's ""dominance"" in the 5G wireless market and strengthening the U.S. position in trade negotiations with China.Meng was arrested on Dec. 1, 2018, after flying into Vancouver's airport on what was supposed to be a stopover on her way to Mexico City, with an ultimate destination of Argentina.Meng is the daughter of Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei.Both she and Huawei are charged with fraud for allegedly misleading HSBC about the company's control of a subsidiary accused of violating U.S. economic sanctions against Iran.HSBC had allegedly become concerned about the relationship after a series of Reuters articles detailing problems.Prosecutors say HSBC continued financing Huawei because of lies Meng allegedly told one of the bank's executives in a PowerPoint presentation in 2013. As a result, HSBC was allegedly placed at risk of loss and prosecution.The U.S. lawsuit aligns with efforts by Meng's Canadian defence team to have the extradition case tossed because of politicization and alleged violations of the 48-year-old's rights in the time leading up to her arrest.Meng's lawyers have cited comments made by U.S. President Donald Trump suggesting he would be willing to use her as a bargaining chip in a trade war with China.They have also accused Canadian authorities of conspiring to assist the FBI in its investigation by having Canada Border Services Agency officers use their extraordinary powers to question Meng for three hours without a lawyer before the RCMP arrested her.Police and border services officers will continue testimony in B.C. Supreme Court later this month about the details of Meng's customs examination and the seizure of her phones.Last week, a CBSA officer admitted to passing the code that unlocks both of Meng's phones to the RCMP by ""mistake.""Her lawyers have also accused the RCMP of giving detailed technical information from Meng's electronic devices to the FBI.The U.S. lawsuit claims Huawei made 12 requests more than a year ago under the U.S. Freedom of Information Act, but has received almost nothing back, despite an ""express requirement that agencies generally must act within 20 business days.""In addition to communications about Meng's arrest between Canada and the U.S. agencies, the company is also asking for communications about the indictment between the U.S. agencies and the White House.The lawsuit cites the global coverage of the B.C. court proceedings as justification for an expedited need for the documents in question ""on the ground that they involved matters of widespread and exceptional media interest in which there exist possible questions about the government's integrity which affect public confidence.""While it covers much of the same ground, the U.S. lawsuit is a separate matter to the extradition proceedings currently underway in B.C. Supreme Court.Huawei's U.S. lawyers are fighting the U.S. criminal charges against her and the company in New York. The U.S is arguing in B.C. that Meng should be sent to New York to stand trial. Meng's Canadian lawyers will have a chance in February to argue the alleged violations of her rights can only be remedied by staying the extradition proceedings.The CBSA and RCMP officers who have testified so far have denied any complicity and any improper information sharing with the FBI.The U.S. agencies named in the lawsuit have not yet filed any responses to it.Meng is currently living under a form of house arrest after being released on bail of $10 million. She wears a monitoring bracelet on her ankle as part of her bail conditions and is watched by private security guards around the clock.Meng has denied the allegations against her."

"Global carbon pollution continues to rise, but more slowly, studies say | CBC News","The world continues to increase the amount of heat-trapping carbon dioxide it pumps into the air, but it's not rising as fast as in the previous couple of years, new studies say.",2019-12-04T01:34:59.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/global-carbon-pollution-1.5383312,"The world continues to increase the amount of heat-trapping carbon dioxide it pumps into the air, but it's not rising as fast as in the previous couple of years.Led by big jumps from China and India, the world is projected to spew 36.8 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide into the air in 2019. That's up nearly 231 million tonnes from 2018, according to two scientific studies released Tuesday. The studies by Global Carbon Project, a group of international scientists who track emissions, show a 0.6 per cent increase from last year.In previous years, global carbon dioxide emissions grew by 2.1 per cent and 1.5 per cent after a few years in the mid-2010s when global emissions barely rose, according to the studies in Environmental Research Letters. Carbon dioxide from the burning of coal, oil and gas has caused 1 degree Celsius of warming since pre-industrial times and world leaders are meeting in Madrid to try to further limit warming.""Emissions grew more slowly than last year but we still set a global record. It's hard to be upbeat about that,"" said study co-author Rob Jackson, a Stanford University climate scientist. ""The U.S. National Academy of Sciences sounded the alarm on carbon and climate 40 years ago. Since then, global carbon dioxide emissions have doubled, and the world is hurtling towards catastrophic climate change.""The 2019 estimate is based on data through the first nine to ten months of the year, with a few national estimates based only on six months of data, said co-author Glen Peters, a climate scientist in Norway. Past projections have proven pretty accurate, he said.That means every second this year people put 2.57 million pounds of carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere. That's the equivalent weight of two Airbus A380s, the world's largest passenger airliner, going into the air every second.Both the United States and the European Union saw emissions drop 1.7 per cent from 2018 to 2019, but China saw a 2.6 per cent increase and India had a 1.8 per cent rise. China is by far the biggest carbon polluter, with 28 per cent of the 2019 emissions. The United States is No. 2 at 14.5 per cent.""Generally, I think this is bad news. Not terrible news, but bad news,"" said Cornell University climate scientist Natalie Mahowald, who wasn't part of the report. ""A stronger switch from coal to solar or wind needs to happen to reach low climate targets.""Led by 10 per cent drops in both the United States and Europe, carbon pollution from coal dropped worldwide nearly 1 per cent but increased 2.6 per cent from cleaner natural gas, according to the studies. Coal still is the No. 1 source of man-made carbon pollution putting 14.6 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide in the air this year, followed by oil and then gas. Coal generally emits 76 per cent more carbon dioxide than natural gas to produce the same amount of energy, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.""I don't think we have completely seen the end of coal yet, but it is certainly in the death throes,"" Peters said. ""Though, I would imagine a slow and protracted decline of coal because of the young infrastructure in Asia.""But with coal dropping or even just plateauing, it is now apparent that the world is not quite on the worst-case scenario carbon emissions path of the four charted by the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, Peters said. But the next two highest emission scenarios, which the world is closer to, are not ""pleasant worlds to live in,"" he said.Princeton University climate scientist Michael Oppenheimer, who wasn't part of the study, called the numbers grim: ""Stepping back and looking at 30 years of data, there is nothing at all that reveals any reason to be optimistic that the world is about to turn the corner on reducing carbon dioxide emissions.""The United States, which is in the early part of a year-long process of pulling out of the 2015 Paris climate agreement, has reduced its carbon dioxide pollution by 9.7 per cent between 2000 and 2018, Jackson calculated. Critics of the Paris agreement said the U.S. is the world leader in reducing emissions, but Jackson's numbers show 11 other nations have had bigger percentage cutbacks this century.From 2000 to 2018, the United Kingdom has cut its carbon pollution by about one-third, Greece and Italy cut their emissions by more than 28 per cent. At the same time, China's carbon pollution has tripled and India's has increased by 157 per cent.""The numbers show that the U.S. is not leading in terms of overall emissions reductions and this proves that we could be doing better,"" said University of Michigan environment dean Jonathan Overpeck. ""This highlights that more, not less, U.S. international leadership is urgently needed. I'm still hopeful we can turn this all around... If we don't, the planet is cooked."""
Lobster pound owner found guilty of illegally selling lobster | CBC News,The Chinese owner of a lobster pound in Nova Scotia has been found guilty of illegally selling lobster caught by Indigenous fishermen who were not allowed to sell their catch under the licences they held.,2020-08-26T21:50:33.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/guang-da-international-sheng-ren-zheng-guilty-illegally-selling-lobster-1.5701123,"The Chinese owner of a lobster pound in Nova Scotia has been found guilty of illegally selling lobster caught by Indigenous fishermen who were not allowed to sell their catch under the licences they held.Sheng Ren Zheng and his company, Guang Da International, were convicted Wednesday in Digby provincial court by Judge Tim Landry.The illegal sale of lobster caught outside of the commercial season by Indigenous fishermen in St. Marys Bay each summer has been an ongoing source of tension in the lucrative Nova Scotia fishery.The case against Zheng and his now defunct company in Belliveaus Cove centred on lobster caught in October 2017 under food, social and ceremonial licences by fishermen from the Sipekne'katik band outside Halifax. By regulation, those catches cannot be sold.In a sting operation called Operation Magnet, federal fishery officers pulled Sipekne'katik traps from St. Marys Bay, placed microchips on 73 lobsters inside, returned the traps and then traced the tagged lobster to the nearby Guang Da International pound.Three days later, officers followed a shipment from the plant containing 15 of the microchipped lobsters to a freight facility at the Halifax airport, where it was stopped before being loaded onto a flight for China.The 2,268-kilogram shipment was seized and Zheng and the company were charged with illegally selling lobster.At his trial, Zheng insisted it was a mix-up, that staff at his now-defunct pound mistakenly included lobster in a shipment for China that he was supposed to be holding for the band.There was no evidence that money changed hands, but Landry said ""the only rational conclusion"" was that the enterprise was a commercial operation.Landry noted the band's lobster were graded and sorted at the plant and that substantial effort was taken to get it to the airport.He also noted price and quantity were contained in paperwork seized at the plant.Landry said the lobster was purchased so that it could be resold.Zheng was not in court today. He appeared via a telephone link and heard the judge's verdict through a Mandarin translator.The maximum fine is $100,000 and sentencing will take place Nov. 1.The issue of Indigenous fishermen selling their catch under food, social and ceremonial licences remains an ongoing source of summertime tension in southwest Nova Scotia.Non-native fishermen insist the sale of lobster harvested through large scale, unregulated fishing by First Nations continues in St. Marys Bay while the season is closed for commercial fishermen.On Thursday, fishermen will protest outside the Bridgewater constituency office of federal Fisheries Minister Bernadette Jordan over what they say is inaction by the federal government."

Across 24 other countries, there are 270 confirmed cases and one death. There are five confirmed cases in Canada. The WHO declared the outbreak a global health emergency in late January. The Canadian government issued a Level 3 advisory for China, asking Canadians to avoid non-essential travel. There is only one higher level, which advises people to avoid all travel.The government recommends people avoid travelling to Hubei province, where Wuhan city is located. The province has recorded 22,112 of China's 31,211 coronavirus cases, according to the WHO. As soon as the Canadian government declares a Level 3 or 4 travel advisory, a person may cancel their upcoming trip and their insurance should cover any lost expenses, said Weir. ""You'd have to submit receipts,'' she said, but travellers should receive refunds for flights, hotels and other costs.<a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/China?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#China</a>: Most airlines have suspended or reduced flights to and from the country due to the <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/coronavirus?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#coronavirus</a> outbreak.

While 24 countries have confirmed coronavirus cases, Canada's travel advisory applies only to China. That means a person who feels uncomfortable travelling to any of the other countries won't be able to get a refund for cancelling their trip, she said.That is, unless they purchased what's known as cancel-for-any-reason insurance, she said, which does exactly what the name implies.Those who haven't purchased any travel insurance may still be able to secure a refund, Weir noted, as many major credit cards offer some kind of coverage.""But it depends on which credit card you have and what the benefits are,'' she said.

A third case has also been confirmed in B.C.Ontario public health officials have repeatedly stressed that the risk of coronavirus infection in Canada is low. Evidence suggests transmission of the virus from person to person requires close contact, like the kind between immediate family members who live together, said Dr. David Williams, the province's chief medical officer, this week. Further, lessons from the 2003 SARS outbreak suggest many airport screening procedures are ineffective.Beveridge was returning to Canada from Cambodia but changed planes in Hong Kong after flying from Phnom Penh.He said he was anxious, even though he had not been anywhere near Wuhan. Cambodia has so far reported only one case of the coronavirus and it was travel-related. Additionally, given the concerns over the coronavirus in China and other Southeast Asian countries, he figured he'd better do something on his return to make sure he didn't spread whatever he had.""Nobody even took my temperature. And you know if we're really trying to keep this out of Canada, it seems that that was not a very thorough screening process,"" Beveridge said.The outbreak of the new coronavirus began last month in Wuhan, a city of 11 million people. The World Health Organization (WHO) says it has killed at least 213 people, all in China. More than 9,600 people globally have been infected, the vast majority in China, though cases have been confirmed in 19 other countries. Yesterday, WHO declared the emerging situation a public health emergency of international concern.CBC News reached out to the Greater Toronto Airports Authority (GTAA), the body that oversees Pearson, for comment. A spokesperson said the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) is responsible for determining the response to coronavirus.Canada began implementing some enhanced screening measures for passengers on flights from China to Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver on Jan. 22. They include signs urging travellers to report flu-like symptoms, additional health-realted questions at kiosks and pamphlets with information about what people should do if their condition worsens.Watch infectious disease experts discuss why many enhanced screening measures are ineffective:The NationalDr. Theresa Tam, chief public health officer of Canada, said it's likely Beveridge was not screened because he was in Hong Kong only briefly and hadn't been to mainland China.""For the coronavirus, the enhanced border measures, on top of what we have as a foundation, is essentially providing the information on the screen and the kiosk questions and the referral to Canadian border service agents,"" Tam told CBC News.Tam said anyone who is sick should tell a border service agent.Frank Scarpitti, the mayor of Markham, 30 kilometres northeast of Toronto, says while he has great confidence in public health officials at the federal, provincial and local levels, he continues to press for the federal government to put in more enhanced screening at all Canadian airports.""I think it would just give Canadians a greater sense of confidence that that additional step is being taken,"" Scarpitti told CBC News.""It's not going to catch everyone but it's just another layer of screening, rather than just voluntary screening, and indicating where someone may have travelled.""Scarpitti also pointed to measures introduced at other major airports in New York City, San Francisco and Los Angeles that involve passengers from China being screened for symptoms.""You just have to look south of the border, the U.S. airports instituted that,"" he said.""Because of the number of airports that they have, they're actually redirecting passengers to the airports that have that technology,"" Scarpitti said.Global Affairs Canada said there are 196 Canadians currently seeking consular help to leave China, and Canada has secured a charter aircraft to bring home Canadians stranded in the affected region."

She is concerned how the minister's actions have already negatively impacted Chinese-Canadian relations and New Brunswick business interests in China.""If the issue does not get resolved soon that it will turn a lot of people away.""The Confucius Institute, which has operated in at least 28 schools in the province, teaches students about Chinese language and culture, but avoids discussions of the country's authoritarian one-party system and its human rights record.Cardy has criticized the program's ""one-dimensional"" approach to teaching about China and plans to get rid of the program, although Premier Blaine Higgs has said the government would abide by the contract with the Confucius Institute and not do anything that might jeopardize it's relationship with China.Yu said she feels the minister is using his platform to impose his personal views, rather than making a decision in consultation with others.""I don't think that is very thoughtful, certainly not very diplomatic,"" she said.Yu said she understands human rights are an issue for China, but said it's the jurisdiction of the federal government to deal with those concerns.""It's a much more global stage than a small province like New Brunswick could do by cutting out one small program.""Yu also said she is personally offended by Cardy's portrayal of the issue, which she says is misleading to those who may have never been to China.""China is nowadays very open. It's not like government is monitoring everyone 24 hours and so on.""Yu said she meets lots of teachers from New Brunswick in China, and there's value in the program for students in both countries.She said students in China who take the New Brunswick curriculum are better prepared to come to the province to attend university, and New Brunswick students who take the Chinese curriculum have the experience they need to work in China.""There are so many people that have been working over decades, building the relationships.""She said the way the issue has played out publicly is also a concern for Chinese people looking to immigrate to New Brunswick."

Right. While fewer people have been travelling during the economic downturn, cargo traffic has increased, said Brad Wells, vice president of operations with BBE, a logistics, expediting and cargo handling company headquartered in Edmonton.BBE moved 14.7 million pounds of freight in 2016, 50 per cent more than in 2015. The company supports 11 airlines including KLM and China Air, moving a panoply of products such as oilfield equipment, food, clothing, even animals.""Everything from penguins, to red pandas, kangaroos coming through,"" Wells said.Instead of travel, animal stories could have been the theme of the morning's show.Jennifer Kennedy, an officer with Canada Border Services Agency, told Connolly she's seen a variety of interesting items people try to bring through security. Drugs, weapons, even unique food items like swan meat and cooked bats.But one passenger took it one further than that, actually smuggling live tortoises through customs.""They really were trying to sneak those in,"" Kennedy said. ""You just don't expect to see live animals.""One family got to wait in luxury after Connolly handed them passes to Plaza Premium, an executive lounge, at the airport.Trisha and Jay Kasawski and their three children Devony, Talia and Drake were on their way to Cancun. McGowan, having gotten out of bed at 3:30 a.m., was having a bit of a rough morning.At least until Kane came along.The Doberman pinscher belongs to the Pet Therapy Society.When Connolly said it surprised him that a Doberman could be a therapy dog, handler Barb Olmstead said she hears that a lot.""He's a real softie,"" she said. ""Kane is just really gentle, he's not one to just run up to people and say, 'Pet me, pet me.""Olmstead even takes Kane to the palliative unit at the Grey Nuns and a nursing home to visit patients.EIA is the country's fifth-largest airport.Seven million travellers went through EIA in 2016.About 12,000 people work on the EIA property, which includes the golf course, Castrol raceway and agriculture."
Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam urges talks with protesters to end unrest | CBC News,"Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam said on Tuesday she hoped a peaceful weekend anti-government protest was the start of an effort to restore calm and that talks with non-violent protesters would provide ""a way out"" for the Chinese-ruled city.",2019-08-20T07:07:47.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/hong-kong-leader-carrie-lam-urges-talks-with-protesters-to-end-unrest-1.5252928,"Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam said on Tuesday she hoped a peaceful weekend anti-government protest was the start of an effort to restore calm and that talks with non-violent protesters would provide ""a way out"" for the Chinese-ruled city.Hundreds of thousands of protesters rallied peacefully in torrential rain on Sunday in the eleventh week of what have been often violent demonstrations.""I sincerely hope that this was the beginning of society returning to peace and staying away from violence,"" Lam said.""We will immediately start the work to establish a platform for dialogue. This dialogue, I hope, will be based on a mutual understanding and respect and find a way out for today's Hong Kong.""Anger erupted in June over a now-suspended bill that would allow criminal suspects in the former British colony to be extradited to mainland China for trial.Protest organizers have rejected the city leader's plan to set up a platform for dialogue, calling it a trap that is aimed at wasting time.Watch: CBC's Chris Brown in Hong Kong took your questions about the ongoing anti-government protests. Joining him was Antony Dapiran, a Hong Kong-based lawyer and writer. Members of the Civil Human Rights Front on Tuesday were responding to Lam's announcement that she is immediately setting up a ""communication platform"" to resolve differences to end the protests.The group's vice-convenor, Wong Yik-mo, said Lam is ""not responding at all"" to the protest movement's demands, including genuine democracy, her resignation and an independent inquiry into alleged police brutality.He said, ""We do not trust Carrie Lam, we do not trust her lies.""The unrest has been fuelled by broader worries about the erosion of freedoms guaranteed under the ""one country, two systems"" formula put in place after Hong Kong's return to China in 1997, including an independent judiciary and the right to protest.Three people were wounded, one critically, in a knife attack by an unknown assailant near a ""Lennon Wall"" of colourful pro-protest messages in the city's Tseung Kwan O district in the New Territories overnight, public broadcaster RTHK said. No arrests were made.The protests have prompted sharp reactions from Beijing, which has accused foreign countries, including the United States, of fomenting unrest in the territory. China has also sent clear warning that forceful intervention is possible, with paramilitary forces holding drills in neighbouring Shenzhen.Britain's Foreign Office said it was extremely concerned about reports that a Hong Kong staff member had been detained in mainland China, but there was no immediate suggestion that there was any link to the protests.Staff member Simon Cheng did not return to work on Aug. 9 after visiting the neighbouring mainland city of Shenzhen the previous day, Hong Kong news website HK01 reported. China's Foreign Ministry and the Hong Kong police did not respond immediately to requests for comment.Twitter and Facebook also said on Monday they had dismantled a state-backed social media campaign originating in mainland China that sought to undermine protests in Hong Kong.Further protests are planned in the next few days, including by MTR subway workers on Wednesday, secondary school students on Thursday and accountants on Friday.Singapore universities have cancelled exchange programs to Hong Kong after Singapore warned its citizens to defer travel there, news website Today reported.Singapore's foreign ministry said in an advisory last week large protests in Hong Kong had become unpredictable and could turn violent with little or no notice.Sunday's protest turnout, which organizers put at 1.7 million, showed that the movement still has widespread support despite chaotic scenes last week when protesters occupied the airport.Some activists had apologized for the airport turmoil and protesters could be seen on Sunday night urging others to go home peacefully.Aside from seeking Lam's resignation, demonstrators have five demands - complete withdrawal of the extradition bill, a halt to descriptions of the protests as ""rioting,"" a waiver of charges against those arrested, an independent inquiry and resumption of political reform.""The bill is dead,"" Lam told Tuesday's news briefing. ""There is no plan to revive the bill, especially in light of the public concerns.""Police have been criticized for using increasingly aggressive tactics to break up demonstrations but there was a minimal police presence on Sunday and no arrests were made. More than 700 people have been arrested since June.Lam said the police watchdog had set up a task force to investigate complaints.She said she hoped Hong Kong had ""unique advantages in attracting overseas companies,"" stressing the rule of law, but warned of the risk of pressure on the economy which shrank 0.4 per cent in April-June from the previous quarter.""The Hong Kong economy is facing the risk of downturn. We can see this from the data in the first half. Actually, I think the data in the first half has not fully reflected the seriousness of the problem,"" she said.China has put strong pressure on big companies in Hong Kong over the protests, especially Cathay Pacific Airways. CEO Rupert Hogg quit in a shock move last week after Beijing targeted the airline over staff involvement in the protests.Hogg's departure was announced by Chinese state television and was seen as a signal to other multinationals, such as HSBC Holdings and Jardine Matheson Holdings, to support Beijing.Cathay also fired two pilots for taking part in protests.China's State Council called on Monday for greater development of the southern city of Shenzhen and integration of its culture and economy with neighbouring Hong Kong and Macau, a former Portuguese-run enclave that returned to China in 1999."

I'd like to think that we are,"" he says. ""Are we doing it quick enough?

(Plus-sized model Ashley Graham was featured in a Sports Illustrated advertisement last month.)""Ultimately it's because men demanded it, men actually like voluptuous women and want to see them in Sports Illustrated,"" Barker says.

In 2014, at the height of the city's Umbrella Movement, Beijing cut access to photo-sharing app Instagram inside the mainland.Chinese officials have previously denied allegations of cyberattacks, pointing out that China is a frequently a victim of outside attacks."
P.E.I. Chinese community raising money for doctors dealing with coronavirus outbreak | CBC News,Members of the Chinese community on Prince Edward Island are aiming to get thousands of dollars in medical supplies to the areas of China dealing with the recent coronavirus outbreak.,2020-02-07T23:39:55.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-chinese-community-fundraising-feb-2020-1.5456540,"Members of the Chinese community on Prince Edward Island are aiming to get thousands of dollars in medical supplies to the areas of China dealing with the recent coronavirus outbreak.Fundraising efforts are being organized by the P.E.I. Chinese Canadian Association. There's one Islander who is friends with the head of a hospital in China's Hubei province — where Wuhan is. Another Islander is friends with the head of a group in the U.S. that's already shipped medical supplies to Chinese hospitals.It was through those connections that the P.E.I. Chinese Canadian Association learned about how much of a need there is for more medical supplies at Hubei hospitals and how to help get them there, said Paul Yin, head of the association, through interpreter Ally Guo.""In our Island, we do have friends with friends in Hubei. And they have direct contact with the hospitals. They have an urgent need for help. So that's why we decided to start this fundraiser,"" Yin said.There have been no confirmed cases of coronavirus on Prince Edward Island and seven in Canada.The live map tracking the outbreak on the World Health Organization website said China had 31,424 confirmed cases and 638 deaths as of Friday evening.The association is accepting e-transfers to purchase medical equipment.Even members of the Canadian Chinese community who lived on P.E.I. for a period before moving to another province are chipping in.""It's not just P.E.I., it's residents who were here before and also want to donate,"" Yin said.Yin said in particular, the doctors and nurses are lacking protective gear like suits, masks and glasses and that it's important doctors and nurses stay healthy in order to help other people.""There's a huge demand for the masks and everything.""""The Chinese government, they are doing a lot of purchases and activities to prevent this outbreak, but the numbers are too big,"" Yin said.""They might not be able to do all the things. And it's Chinese New Year festival time and a lot of factories in China that produce this equipment are on holiday.""Yin just returned from another, less affected area of China a few days ago, and while he feels fine he's staying inside his home, away from the public for two weeks as a precaution.However, since Yin has gotten back to the Island he's been busy online putting out the call to P.E.I.'s Chinese community for donations.In an email to CBC, P.E.I.'s Chief Public Health Office said the policy for those returning from China changed Thursday.Those who have travelled to Canada from Hubei province — which includes Wuhan — should voluntarily self-isolate for 14 days, staying at home and not going to school or work. This does not apply to people returning from other parts of China. Those travellers are being asked to monitor themselves and their children for 14 days — and call 811 if they develop symptoms such as fever, coughing or difficulty breathing.Yin is getting help in his fundraising efforts from volunteers like Guo, Yin's interpreter during his interview with CBC.Guo was born in Shanghai, but has lived on P.E.I. for the last five years. She runs a Chinese social media website aimed at bridging the gap between the Chinese community and other Islanders.In just three days, about 140 people have donated more than $15,000 and it will all go to that non-profit group in the U.S. to buy supplies and ship them to three hospitals in Hubei, Guo said.""We have seen their materials, like who do they buy from, who do they deliver to, and with the evidence that they've already delivered equipment to the hospitals with photos and everything, we believe they can do so,"" she said.Guo said the money raised so far is enough to provide a week's worth of protective gear for about 200 doctors and nurses, but she hopes they can at least double that amount.""Every day they need a lot of equipment. They don't have so many supplies just because the population there is so many,"" Guo said.""They have to protect themselves.""Guo said the group will continue to raise money for medical equipment in China for as long as it is needed. This year, P.E.I.'s Chinese New Year's gala was moved from early March to mid-March to give those trying to get back to the Island time to do so, Guo said.That gala is also becoming a charity event this year. Money raised  will go toward helping those dealing with the coronavirus outbreak, Guo said."

Chinese organizers cancel NBA fan event amid free speech uproar | CBC News,"Chinese organizers have cancelled a fan event on the eve of a National Basketball Association exhibition game in Shanghai, the latest fallout in a row over comments by a team official supporting protests in Hong Kong.",2019-10-09T13:36:34.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/chinese-organizers-cancel-nba-fan-event-1.5314475,"Chinese organizers on Wednesday cancelled a fan event on the eve of a National Basketball Association exhibition game in Shanghai, the latest fallout in a row over comments by a team official supporting protests in Hong Kong.Chinese sponsors and partners have been cutting ties with the NBA after a tweet by Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey last week supporting anti-government protests in the Chinese-ruled city.The Shanghai Sports Federation said the cancellation of the fan event ahead of Thursday's game between the Brooklyn Nets and Los Angeles Lakers was due to the ""inappropriate attitude"" of Morey and NBA commissioner Adam Silver.A Wednesday afternoon press conference with both teams was indefinitely delayed, organizers said. Outside the team hotel, workers tore down massive banners advertising the game, according to a Reuters witness.Silver said on Tuesday the league supported Morey's right to exercise his freedom of expression, further angering authorities and some fans in China and threatening the NBA's business there, said to be worth more than $4 billion US.Morey deleted the tweet and apologized on Monday, but Chinese broadcasters, sportswear companies and sponsors have said they are reviewing their ties with the NBA, which has had a presence in China since 1992.The NBA initially described the anger over Morey's post as ""regrettable,"" drawing criticism from U.S. politicians, who accused the league of putting its China business ahead of free speech.Silver, speaking on Tuesday in Japan before a preseason game between the Rockets and Toronto Raptors, said it was not up to the league to regulate what players, employees and team owners said.On Wednesday, an editorial in the official English-language China Daily accused Silver of ""brazenly endorsing Morey's secessionist-supporting tweet"" and giving ""a shot to the arms of the rioters of Hong Kong.""""If Silver thinks endorsing the indiscriminate violence the radical Hong Kong protesters are resorting to … is supporting freedom of expression, then he should think again,"" it said.The protests were ""a bid to liberate the city"" and ""a secessionist pipe-dream"" peddled by demonstrators ""to justify their summer hooliganism,"" the newspaper added.The protests were sparked by opposition to a bill allowing extradition to mainland China, but have since evolved into broader calls for democracy. None of the protesters' five demands is secession or independence.The basketball furore also comes against the backdrop of the U.S.-China trade war, which escalated after Washington imposed visa restrictions on Chinese officials on Tuesday.The Global Times, a Chinese tabloid published by the ruling Communist Party's People's Daily newspaper, accused Silver of caving in to political pressure, saying the NBA was treating the Chinese market with arrogant disregard.""Tweeting something offensive to the Chinese people before a series of NBA promotional activities in China only shows a lack of intellect, respect, and responsibility,"" it said.In a separate report, the newspaper also said that some Chinese internet users had made ""disrespectful comments"" about the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the World Trade Center in New York and the Pentagon in Washington, D.C.""[It] should remind Western media that for Chinese people, the Hong Kong riots are just like the 9/11, which is horrible and can't be justified,"" the Global Times said.No one has been killed in several months of protests in Hong Kong, although scores — mostly protesters and journalists — have been hurt. The Sept. 11, 2001, attacks killed 2,996 people and led to the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan.Basketball is the most popular sport in China, with about 500 million people consuming NBA content. The league has deals with TV and digital media outlets across the country, and teams have played exhibition games annually since 2014.NBA China, launched in 2008 to run the league's business, is now worth more than $4 billion, according to Forbes.The NBA had planned media events in Shanghai this week ahead of the Nets-Lakers game, but Chinese organizers cancelled an event at a Shanghai school on Tuesday and an open training session with the Nets on Wednesday.Chinese celebrities had already said they would boycott the ""fans' night"" before it was cancelled.State television dropped plans to air NBA exhibition games in China this week, saying a country's sovereignty and social stability were ""not within the scope of freedom of speech."" China has accused the West of stirring up anti-Beijing sentiment in Hong Kong.Some Chinese fans have asked for streaming subscription refunds from exclusive service provider Tencent, which halted broadcast of Rockets games after the Morey tweet.Tencent isn't the only company distancing itself from business dealings with the NBA.Online travel agency Ctrip said on Tuesday it had stopped selling tickets to NBA games and NBA-related tour packages. Smartphone maker Vivo and sportswear maker ANTA Sports Products Ltd. have also stopped working with the NBA.But the escalating row did not seem to bother some waiting outside Shanghai's Ritz Carlton hotel to catch a glimpse of the NBA players.""Personal opinions belong to them. It doesn't affect us chasing the stars,"" Xu Ziyang, a university student from Jiangsu, told Reuters."

Her waist-length hair is twisted into a complicated style with the aid of a delicate hair comb. It's a modern take on the traditional clothing of China's Han ethnic majority, to which Tang belongs.Traditional Han clothing — or Hanfu, as the style is called by devotees — ""gives me a lot of confidence,"" said Tang, 21, who moved to New Brunswick in 2017 to take e-commerce at the University of New Brunswick Saint John. Hanfu is a growing trend among young Han Chinese seeking to recapture their traditional culture lost during centuries of foreign domination. CBC NewsHanfu tends to turn heads in Saint John.  ""When you walk down the street, many people will look at you and say, 'Oh, you are pretty!' and they say good things to you.""Recently, photographer Nelson Cloud took pictures of Shui Tang at Saint John landmarks, including Rockwood Park, the Martello Tower, Market Square, and the New Brunswick Museum building on Douglas Avenue. Tang was introduced to the style as a middle school student in Shanghai.""I saw a picture,"" she said, ""and I thought, 'Wow, that is amazing!' So I did a little bit of research about it.""The trend has been popularized in recent years through the video app TikTok and Chinese micro-blogging service Weibo.""There are people who share all the information on the same page,"" she said. ""People are wearing Hanfu and getting to know it.""Historical accuracy is the first goal of Hanfu. ""If you imagine something, that becomes cosplay, not Hanfu,"" Tang said. The custom-made dresses can take months or even years to ship to Canada from Chinese suppliers and range in price from a few hundred dollars, to more than $3,000 for top-quality reproduction Ming dynasty robes. Tang wears Hanfu mainly for special occasions, she said, although sometimes she pairs a historical skirt or hair accessory with everyday Western clothes.  It's a passion Tang wants to share with other Han Chinese in New Brunswick. ""A lot of my friends come to my place and I will show them and let them try it on,"" she said.  Clothing is one way for people to express pride in their unique national identity, Tang. ""I really like to see more people wearing their own traditional clothes — not just our Han people, but also Koreans, Japanese, Indian,"" Tang said.""I hope they can express themselves in wearing all these traditional things and let other people know about their culture. ""If we all have our own styles, it will make the world more beautiful."" "

At Guelph Outdoor School in Guelph, Ont., the fresh air that's seen as a way to lower the risk of coronavirus transmission is pushing parents to enrol their children in the full-day programs at an unprecedented rate. ""The phone is [ringing] off the hook and I can't even keep track,"" Chris Green, a former classroom teacher who started the outdoor school eight years ago, told CBC News. He and his team have added seven new programs this year, all popular, and even a full-time option offered with a local Montessori school.Parents who were already converts to the school's belief in the educational and developmental value of learning outdoors are now thinking about the health benefits, too. Cheryl Cadogen's 13-year-old son, David, won't be returning to regular classes because Cheryl's partner is immunocompromised. Instead, David will take his Grade 8 classes online while spending a few days a week at the outdoor school. The benefits of being outside during a pandemic are clearer if you think of a smoker — an example given by Virginia Tech's Dr. Linsey Marr, who studies how viruses spread through the air. Outside, the smoke dissipates quickly, but inside it's ""trapped."" Masks, physical distancing and good ventilation can all help indoors, but Marr says she would seize upon ""any opportunity that there is to move an activity outdoors.""Canada's largest school board is pushing teachers to literally think outside the box. The Toronto District School Board is encouraging students to take classes outside whenever possible, says David Hawker-Budlovsky, the board's central co-ordinating principal for outdoor education. That could include scheduling time in the schoolyard or using the community as a classroom. Students could be taught about climate change in a nearby ravine or learn about local history while walking around the neighbourhood. ""I think what's really important is to be able to look at this [with] an open mind. Be creative and be as flexible as possible,"" he said.As for Canadian winters, an expert on outdoor learning says: ""There is no bad weather. There are just bad clothes."" Pamela Gibson, a former teacher who now consults on sustainability and outdoor education, said even a tree can be a math lesson, a science lesson or an arts lesson, bad weather or not. Holding classes outside in the community is not only possible, she said, but crucial. Curriculum is ""supposed to be what children need to function in the world, not just inside the building [and] not just inside their homes.""The National's feature about outdoor schooling will air tonight at 9 p.m. ET on CBC News Network and at 10 p.m. local time on your CBC television station, or you can watch The National online on CBC Gem.Click below to watch more from The NationalThe NationalIN BRIEFOffice work hasn't been returning to the office. Will it stay home forever?Just a fraction of people working at home during the pandemic have returned to their offices, a change that could permanently influence how workplaces are run, where workers live and whether office-adjacent businesses can survive, CBC's Brandie Weikle writes. Almost three-quarters of the 3.4 million Canadians who began working from home when the crisis started were still working remotely in August, Statistics Canada reported Friday. And a survey by Maru/Blue on behalf of ADP Canada suggests that many employees would like the trend to continue. The research found 45 per cent of respondents wanted to work remotely at least three days a week, while another 15 per cent would like to one or two days weekly.The survey also suggested that workers under 34 are most convinced the change will be permanent. Sandy Magat, who started at Vancouver-based Charli.ai just as the pandemic started, has been at work in her office for one day. She prefers working from home, even though going to the office is possible. ""I'm pretty happy working from home, being able to squeeze in a workout, catch up with a friend or run an errand,"" she said. ""In general, I just feel like I'm taking better care of myself. I'm eating more consistent meals.... I feel like I'm focused more on my health and wellness because you have more control over that in your own space."" Magat also notes she's spending less and, obviously, has no commuting time.Darren Fleming, CEO of commercial real estate company Real Strategy in Ottawa, said the sea change underway will have profound effects on the ""ecosystem"" of businesses that surround office buildings. ""It means the barbershop that only did business with office tenants during 9 to 5, Monday to Friday, suddenly may not have anybody to cut hair with,"" he said. ""We're already seeing a shift to people moving to the suburbs and residential, because if they're going to be working from home ... maybe they're going to need a second bedroom. I think it's a little bit early to say. But fundamentally, I think there's been a change in the way we work. And it's going to be very interesting.""Read more about the survey results here.Filmmakers relying on virtual world to build buzz at TIFFWith COVID-19 rattling the entire film circuit, resulting in a trimmed Toronto International Film Festival slate that's mostly online, the industry is looking for new ways to build momentum, The Canadian Press reports. The festival's 45th edition is banking on virtual offerings and a smattering of indoor/outdoor screenings to recreate the semblance of a traditional festival rollout. TIFF will screen films for the public across Canada on its online platform, Bell Digital Cinema, as well as its downtown TIFF Bell Lightbox headquarters, two drive-ins and an open-air cinema. Only 50 guests are allowed in indoor cinemas, and patrons must wear masks unless seated in the theatre.Screening films online and to physically distanced audiences is better than skipping the festival circuit entirely, said Laurie May, co-president of the Canadian film distribution company Elevation Pictures. ""I think it's making the best of a bad situation and trying to keep everything moving forward,"" she said. ""And I don't think this is the new world order. I think this is accommodating a difficult time and hoping to get back to normal."" TIFF will have an online industry festival, so international delegates will still be able to conduct business. May said she participated in the Cannes Film Festival's virtual market in June and it was a good business. She'd still prefer to pay for the flight to France. ""You lose talking to the other filmmakers,"" she said. ""This is a creative industry. You can't do it sitting at your home Zooming.""The event won't have the same level of excitement and fanfare it usually does amid splashy parties and galas. Most of the film talent won't be at TIFF because of border restrictions, although many will be online in cast reunions, interactive talks and Q&As, some of which will be available worldwide for free. TIFF also has a slew of celebrity ambassadors who will interact with audiences and industry delegates online. Stars will also be seen in the pre-recorded TIFF Tribute Awards.Read more about TIFF's approach here.N.L. woman accosted with anti-Chinese racism for 3rd time during pandemic The first time Ting-ting Chen experienced racism in Newfoundland and Labrador, she said, it shocked her. The second time, it scared her, forcing her inside for a month for fear of what people might say or think about her. The third time, it made her angry. ""I don't want to see this small percentage of people destroy the beauty of Newfoundland,"" Chen told CBC News.In the most recent incident, the PhD student from China said she was called a pig and a dog-eater during a confrontation with two teenagers on a popular walking trail in St. John's. She snapped a picture as the children ran away on Friday. Chen, who is studying Newfoundland folklore at Memorial University, has had ""Virus!"" yelled at her from a car. In a separate incident, a man yelled at her to ""Go back to China."" Finally, the two teenaged boys made squinted eyes at her and spewed lewd nonsense in her direction. ""Racist ideas have already poisoned our young generations like that,"" she said. ""I was astonished.""Chen said most of the province's people have treated her well, but decided after the latest incident that it was time to speak out and address racism head-on. ""I have been here two years, and I can hardly imagine I would have suffered this two years ago, before the pandemic,"" she said. ""I think the pandemic has just become an impetus for the racism here to be thriving and rise up, and that really saddens my heart."" Her story is not unique. In a recent video, well-known brewery owner Dave Fong was accosted by a woman outside his St. John's home to ""go back where you came from."" Fong's family has been in Newfoundland and Labrador since the 1890s. A woman is facing a criminal harassment charge in relation to the incident.Read more about Chen's story here.Stay informed with the latest COVID-19 data THE SCIENCESinovac says it coronavirus vaccine candidate appears to be safe in elderly people Chinese firm Sinovac Biotech Ltd. said on Monday its coronavirus vaccine appeared to be safe for older people, according to preliminary results from an early to mid-stage trial, Reuters reports, while the immune responses triggered by the vaccine were slightly weaker than for younger adults.Health officials have been concerned about whether experimental vaccines could safely protect the elderly, whose immune systems usually react less robustly to vaccines, against the virus that has led to hundreds of thousands of deaths worldwide. Sinovac's candidate CoronaVac did not cause severe side-effects in combined Phase 1 and Phase 2 trials launched in May involving 421 participants aged at least 60, Liu Peicheng, Sinovac's media representative, said.The World Health Organization is working with China on requirements for international approval of any Chinese COVID-19 vaccine, a senior official said on Monday. ""WHO's office in China and WHO headquarters has been working with the regulatory authorities in China,"" assistant director-general Mariangela Simao told a briefing in Geneva. ""We are in direct contact. We have been sharing information and the requirements for international approval of vaccines."" Four of the world's eight vaccines that are in the third phase of trials are from China.AND FINALLY...She was in China, he was in Canada. This couple reunited after being separated for 9 months because of COVID-19 Every three weeks for months, Kiera Norris would pack her bags, board a train to Beijing Capital International Airport, and hope against hope that she would be able to board a plane to take her home to her husband, Kevin. But nine times her flight was cancelled amid COVID-19, which meant she remained more than 9,700 kilometres from Windsor, Ont., and her husband of 10 years. ""You know those couples that enjoy their time apart?"" Kevin Norris told CBC News. ""We're not like that.""The couple runs a small business together, which is what takes them to China every year. Kiera arrived on Jan. 10, with Kevin planning to arrive two weeks later. But when COVID-19 hit, the pair knew they were in trouble. They usually spend every moment together, often hiking and biking. So instead of the great outdoors, they made do with Facetime and Skype. ""Our life is more and more perfect, more hopeful, more meaningful and actually very happy every day [we] see each other,"" said Kiera, who has family south of Beijing.The Norrises were finally reunited Sunday at Toronto Pearson International Airport. When they saw each other, the couple shared a long embrace, mumbling words of affection. Asked how they were feeling, they summed it up in one word: ""incredible.""Read more about their story here.Find out more about COVID-19Still looking for more information on the pandemic?

How one Italian town managed to stop the coronavirus in its tracks | CBC Radio,"At the beginning of the Coronavirus pandemic, the small Italian city of Vò had a dubious honour of being the site of the county's first COVID-19 death. Now it's a beacon of hope for the world.",2020-03-24T21:31:42.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/radio/asithappens/as-it-happens-tuesday-edition-1.5508052/how-one-italian-town-managed-to-stop-the-coronavirus-in-its-tracks-1.5508059,"TranscriptAt the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, the small Italian city of Vò had the dubious honour of being the site of the county's first COVID-19 death.Since then, Italy has seen more fatalities than any other country, with latest figures showing that 6,820 people have died from the infection in barely a month. The total number of confirmed cases hit 69,176 on Tuesday.But Vò has become a beacon of hope. Doctors there have been able to stop the spread of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19, and their work has become a model for other communities struggling to contain it""We managed to eradicate coronavirus from Vò, achieving a 100 per cent recovery rate for those previously infected while recording no further cases of transmission,"" Italian health officials Antonio Cassone and Andrea Crisanti wrote in the Guardian newspaper. Crisanti, a professor of microbiology at the University of Padua who led the experiment, spoke to As It Happens host Carol Off. Here is part of their conversation.What is the situation in Vò? Is the virus still contained there?Yes. The good news is that we haven't had new cases in Vò since we did the last survey. There was one case, but it was a relative of an infected person that was living in the same household. So that's quite, let's say, expected that these people are at very high risk. You're surrounded by parts of Italy that had a drastic infection. So how did you do it? What is the secret that Vò had that the others didn't?The secret is that, first of all, Vò was the first place where the epidemic started. And on that occasion, the city was locked down, and everybody was tested. So what happened [was] we could identify from the very beginning all those that were in the position to transmit the disease to others. They were isolated. Then nine days after, we did a second survey. We identified another eight people that were all asymptomatic. And then we put them in isolation as well.So what's different between what you're doing and what, say, we're doing here or other places are doing? We're having a lot of ... isolation [and] places are locking down. They are not testing everybody that's in that locked-down place. And so, how important was that testing to the success that you've had?We believe that that was crucial because we could identify all the people with the potential to transmit. They were isolated. And, in principle, they couldn't transmit the disease to others. Now, if you do only the lockdown, [that] can not necessarily lead to complete suppression of the disease. I want to draw a comparison. If you remember the Diamond Princess. They started with few cases. They did the tests only to those [who] were symptomatic. So you develop a symptom, you test positive, you were taken out of the ship. But day by day, cases, if you remember, they increased up to more than 700. So in this way, they couldn't stop the disease. That couldn't stop the disease in spite of the fact that they were isolated, they were kind of quarantined. And the reason why they couldn't stop it is because the ship was full of asymptomatic people that [were] spreading the virus. This is a very interesting comparison, because on one hand, you have a community of 3,000 people living in a small village, which was locked down. On another hand, you have a ship with a community, again, about 3,000 people, which was locked down. [When you started this in February], the protocol was that you tested people only if they … were returning from a foreign place, or from China, or if they had symptoms. ... You ignored that and went to everybody.Yeah, we ignored that because we weren't convinced that the disease was transmitted only by symptomatic individuals. We found this quite implausible. And so this is the reason why we tested everybody.You're talking about a town, Vò, of 3,000 people. Is it possible to turn that model, to do what you did in Vò, to a much larger population? Entire regions of Italy, or regions of Canada? What has been done in Vò, it proved to be extremely effective at the beginning of the infection. So if you have a cluster of cases, then the best thing to do is to lock down the place, stand still, and test everybody. Especially at the beginning of the infection, that's the best thing you can do.Now, when the epidemic is more widespread, then ... you have to combine several measures. Because at that point, you fight on several fronts. You have to deal with people that are healed. You need to have a hospital resuscitation unit. You need to implement quarantine, which unfortunately can never be 100 per cent because people have to go out to buy food, to buy medicines.But if you do active surveillance, let's say, around the people that are present with symptoms, rather than leaving them home and making no tests, I think what you should do [is] go home to their place, make the test, make the test to the relatives, make the test to friends and family, and to the neighborhood. If you do this systematically, you can then beat the disease. If you could give some advice to us in Canada from the mistakes and the learnings that you had in Italy, what would you tell us?I would suggest you do not underestimate. You act aggressively around each single case and cluster. If you have a couple of cases in a condo, you lock down the entire condo and you test everybody. If you have a few cases in a neighborhood, then you lock down the neighborhood, and you test everybody.That's the way to do it. Written by Sheena Goodyear with files from Reuters.

"B.C.'s 13th coronavirus patient in critical condition, officials announce | CBC News",A 13th presumptive case of novel coronavirus has been identified in B.C. The patient is a woman in her 80s who is in critical condition at Vancouver General Hospital.,2020-03-04T23:19:30.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/b-c-s-13th-coronavirus-patient-in-critical-condition-officials-announce-1.5486216,"A 13th presumptive case of novel coronavirus has been identified in B.C. The patient is a woman in her 80s who is in critical condition at Vancouver General Hospital.Provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry said the woman had recently returned from travel in India and Hong Kong, and officials are investigating where she might have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.""The timing of her symptom onset is much more likely to be related to Hong Kong,"" Henry said at a news conference Wednesday, but she added that the province is also looking into a tour group that the woman travelled with in India.The patient is currently in isolation in the intensive care unit, and Henry said ""all precautions"" have been taken to protect staff and other patients.This is B.C.'s first severe case of the novel coronavirus. Henry said the sick woman has several underlying conditions that put her at risk of serious illness. All of the previous 12 patients were able to stay in isolation at home and four have recovered completely. Three other patients are currently asymptomatic and are awaiting test results to clear them to return to normal life. All COVID-19 patients must test negative for the virus twice before they can leave isolation, said Henry.Of the previous 12 cases, seven have been connected to an outbreak in Iran and five have been connected to China.Watch: ""Wash your hands like you've been chopping jalapenos and you need to change your contacts,"" says Dr. Bonnie Henry. CBC News BCHenry said that while B.C. has experience dealing with disease pandemics, each outbreak is different, and it takes some time after the initial chaos to work out an effective response.""I am confident that it will never be easy,"" she said. ""There's a lot of unknowns at the beginning … but we're putting the puzzle together and breaking the chains of transmission.""She pointed out that China, which was the epicentre of the outbreak, has managed to significantly slow the spread of the virus, which gives hope to officials here in Canada.B.C. officials continue to ask members of the public to be vigilant about washing their hands, and to stay home from work or school and avoid large gatherings if they're feeling sick. People who've recently returned from trips to Iran and China are asked to self-isolate for 14 days.Health Minister Adrian Dix said he's asking employers to be understanding when employees ask for sick days and to consider dropping any requirements for doctors' notes.Watch: Dr. Bonnie Henry on ""keeping your germs to yourself.""  CBC News BCIn nearby Washington state, 10 people have now died from the virus. B.C. is not recommending against travel south of the border, except for those who are feeling ill.Henry pointed out that most of the cases in Washington are linked to an outbreak at a long-term care home, and said everyone needs to be cautious about visiting elderly loved ones right now.""This has been a devastating disease for older people,"" Henry said. ""If you are sick and you absolutely have to see your loved one in a long-term care home … then call ahead, talk to the staff."""
"Time for Canada to have 'authentically unique' voice, says Alexandre Trudeau | CBC News","Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s brother Alexandre says Canada has lost its unique voice in the world and has fallen into the role of a “confused follower nation,” but building a unique relationship with China could help fix the situation.",2016-09-14T01:20:20.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/alexandre-trudeau-follower-nation-1.3761033,"Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's brother Alexandre says Canada has lost its unique voice in the world and fallen into the role of a ""confused follower nation"" — but building a unique relationship with China could help fix that.Alexandre made the comments in an interview with CBC News Network's Power & Politics, where he was promoting his book Barbarian Lost: Travels in the New China.""In recent times Canada has disappeared as an independent voice, as a country that makes its own decisions about things,"" Alexandre told host Rosemary Barton. ""When's the last time you think: 'Well, Canada really has a position that is unlike any other?' We've kind of fallen into a confused follower nation.""The author and filmmaker said Canada should be surprising other countries with ""authentically unique"" positions on issues of international importance.""It's a constant challenge when we are so closely linked with the United States, obviously, they expect us to toe the line on so many issues, but it's not even good for them that we be so close to them,"" he said. ""We have to be independent, and developing an independently sophisticated relationship with China is one of the big features of that.""Alexandre said his brother's job is difficult when it comes to China, because Canada is a trading nation and his brother is the ""salesman in chief"" of a country where many citizens are uncomfortable with the human rights record of the Chinese government.""I'm not one who believes that trade should be politicized like that,"" he said. ""I think the way to go at human rights is to say China has to evolve, we want to be a long-term friend to China and be helpful as it evolves, and we have a lot to learn from them too. Not just Canada but the West in general.""While the rest of the world has been significantly influenced by European expansion over the last five or six centuries, Alexandre said, China is a place apart, a country where travellers can look at the West from the outside like nowhere else.One of the lessons there is the way Chinese culture puts a strong emphasis on family history and how that family is put above the individual.""What could be more true, that the only thing really real about us in the long run, is what we manage to receive from those who came before, and what we manage to pass on to those who follow,"" he said.As children, Alexandre and his brothers Justin and Michel travelled in China with their father. Alexandre related a story he mentions in the book in which the elder Trudeau chastised his sons for behaving like ""barbarians"" at some of China's most sacred sites.""My brother and I, when we get together, we're just like the young lions we were — one missing obviously —  we're boxing and pushing and throwing our kids around, we were rambunctious, still are,"" he said""My father mostly encouraged that, but at certain times he had a sense — 'this is kind of a sacred place for people and here are my boys just bouncing off the walls behaving.'  ""We ended up injuring ourselves and we were sort of crippled the next day, and he was like: 'You guys are ridiculous. Stop behaving like barbarians. The Chinese see us as barbarians; often, you're giving them reason to do that.'""Hence the title,"" Alexandre said of why he chose the name for his book."
"Hong Kong leader starts dialogue on protests, but won't budge on demands | CBC News","Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam said Tuesday she had met with a group of young people about the ongoing pro-democracy protests, but she showed no sign of budging in a continuing stalemate over the movement's demands.",2019-08-27T02:45:07.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/hong-kong-protests-carrie-lam-serious-violent-escalation-1.5260883,"Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam said Tuesday she had met with a group of young people about the ongoing pro-democracy protests, but she showed no sign of budging in a continuing stalemate over the movement's demands.Lam said she explained the government's position at the Monday closed-door meeting, which was unannounced. She disputed complaints her government is ignoring the protesters, whose demands include the withdrawal of an extradition bill, an independent inquiry into what they believe is excessive use of force by police at the demonstrations, and democratic elections.""It is not a question of not responding,"" she told reporters before a weekly meeting with her executive council. ""It is a question of not accepting those demands.""Hong Kong, a Chinese territory, has seen more than two months of youth-led protests that have sometimes ended in clashes with police. More than 80 people were arrested last weekend after protesters occupied city streets. They built barriers across the roads, and threw bricks and gasoline bombs to try to block the police, who used tear gas to drive them away.Lam announced last week she is creating a platform for dialogue and said Tuesday it would include protesters. Opposition lawmakers have questioned the sincerity of her initiative, calling it a delay tactic.It wasn't clear who attended the Monday meeting with Lam and the education and home affairs ministers. The South China Morning Post newspaper, citing an unidentified source, said about 20 people took part and that they were mostly in their 20s and 30s.Lam said her government had accepted the movement's main demand by suspending the extradition bill, which would have allowed suspects to be sent to mainland China to face trial. She has declared the legislation dead, but protesters are demanding its formal withdrawal.The proposal fuelled concern China is chipping away at the separate legal system and rights that semiautonomous Hong Kong has under a ""one-country, two-systems"" framework. Huge marches against the legislation have drawn more than a million people, according to organizer estimates.Protesters have also disrupted subways and the airport, surrounded and spray painted slogans on police stations, and broken into and vandalized the legislative chamber. Not all the protesters resort to confrontation, but those who do say it is needed because the government is not responding to peaceful demonstrations.Lam said it would be unacceptable for the government to accede to demands because of such pressure.""If violence continues, the only thing that we should do is to stamp out that violence through law enforcement actions.""Lam also dismissed talk of her resignation, telling reporters a responsible chief executive should continue ""to hold the fort and do her utmost to restore law and order in Hong Kong.""We should prepare for reconciliation in society by communicating with different people ... We want to put an end to the chaotic situation in Hong Kong,"" Lam said, adding she did not believe her government had lost control.The government said on Monday illegal violence was pushing Hong Kong to the brink of great danger after weekend clashes that included the first gunshot and the arrest of 86 people, the youngest just 12.More demonstrations are planned over coming days and weeks, posing a direct challenge to authorities in Beijing, who are eager to quell the unrest ahead of the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China on Oct. 1.China said it strongly deplores a statement by the leaders of the G7 nations, who called for the avoidance of violence in Hong Kong and affirmed the importance of a 1984 Sino-British agreement that gave the city its semiautonomous status. The former British colony was returned to China in 1997.""We expressed, collectively, deep concern about what is happening in Hong Kong,"" British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said after the G7 meeting in France. He added, ""We remain collectively committed to the one-country, two-systems framework.""Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Geng Shuang said in Beijing that no foreign government has the right to intervene in Hong Kong, which he called an internal Chinese issue.""We urge the members of the G7 countries not to meddle in other's affairs."""

The world could face a 2nd wave of COVID-19: Here's what Canada needs to do now to prepare | CBC News,"Countries must prepare for a second wave of the COVID-19 outbreak to emerge once social distancing measures are eased, and they should only lift those measures gradually, infectious disease experts say. Here's what you need to know about a potential second wave and what Canada can do to minimize the impact.",2020-03-24T08:00:38.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/canada-covid-19-second-wave-1.5507522,"Canada and other countries must prepare for a second wave of the COVID-19 outbreak to emerge once social distancing measures are eased, and they should only lift those measures gradually, infectious disease experts say.A second wave of an outbreak is an increase in infections that occurs after a sustained period of time when there are no — or very few — new cases of that illness, said Dr. Isaac Bogoch, a Toronto General Hospital Research Institute clinical investigator, who specializes in infectious diseases.""Essentially, what we have now is physical distancing measures in place as one of a multi-pronged approach to curb the Canadian epidemic,"" said Bogoch. ""Now, of course, we cannot sustain these physical distancing measures for an infinite period of time.… They're tough on the individual level, they're tough for communities, they're tough for businesses, tough for kids.""The good news is that Canada has the opportunity to learn from countries where the epidemic started months earlier by observing how public health measures in those places work to keep the case load from bubbling up again once people start to emerge from their homes and go about business as usual, he said.Places in East Asia are facing a second wave of the virus now. For instance, on Friday, Hong Kong recorded its biggest daily jump in cases since the pandemic started, though mostly connected to infected travellers, who are returning from abroad after being prevented from going home before.Dr. Theresa Tam, Canada's chief public health officer, warned last week that ""this virus is going to be with us for some time. It will not be eradicated from the world in months.""""We will need to be prepared for another wave, potentially.""Like Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan, Canada will also experience its own second wave after seeing initial success containing the virus through the social distancing measures currently in place, Bogoch believes.""When we start to lift those measures in the months down the line, are we going to start to see a rebound of the virus? The answer is most certainly yes. We probably will see, to some extent, a greater number of cases as people mingle again as life slowly returns to normal.""Several modelling studies have been conducted to explore how effective social distancing is at dampening disease spread, said Bogoch, and almost all show that when the reins are eventually loosened, cases will tick up again.But he said there are steps we can take to minimize the extent of a second wave.""The hope is that we can slowly lift these measures, rather than have them completely lifted, and we can control the rebound of the virus such that it does not cause a situation where we overwhelm our health-care system and negate everything that we've done for the past few months.""The key will be to change social distancing policies ""very slowly and carefully,"" he said.Eleanor Fish, a professor of immunology at the University of Toronto whose research group conducted treatment studies during the 2003 outbreak of SARS in Toronto, said a true second wave of an outbreak involves new community transmissions, not just sick returning travellers who are swiftly moved into quarantine.She said countries like China, where new cases are also travel-related, could face a second round of the outbreak but are ""nowhere near"" that territory yet.Fish also said she believes a second wave is ""unlikely to happen here.""""We haven't locked down our borders to Canadians. So any of those who might want to return, are returning. We're asking them to self-isolate for 14 days."" That means Canada is less likely than other countries who shut their borders to citizens to have cases shoot up again upon their return.Fish said she's optimistic that the government is listening to the scientific community and learning from places, like Italy, by preparing for a surge of severe cases by doing things like securing more ventilators. She also said she was buoyed by progress of research groups testing various forms of treatment.""The public needs to be reassured that there's a lot coming up that's going to be very positive.""Jason Kindrachuk, an assistant professor at the University of Manitoba's department of medical microbiology, said that during the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic, there was both a second wave and a small third wave of the outbreak.But he said Canada can prepare now for a second wave of COVID-19 illnesses in a number of different ways.It can improve the supply of personal protective equipment for front-line health-care workers, as well as the materials needed for testing, both of which have already been a challenge in the first phase of the epidemic, said Kindrachuk, who holds a Canada Research Chair in emerging viruses.And although little is known yet about the seasonality of the virus and how much immunity people will have after recovering from the illness, Canada can look to the nations that are months ahead of it in the progression of the pandemic.""We can learn from what those countries do in terms of when they start reducing the requirements for social distancing to help guide our own procedures and time frame for doing that so we don't see spikes in increased transmission.""The true long-term strategy, said Bogoch, is the creation of an effective vaccination, ""which we know is more than a year away.""""But for now, we just have to put up with the physical distancing measures."""

But Israel's seizure of what it calls part of an ""archive"" of Iran's past work appears to have yielded new clues on old activities.The IAEA suspects activities possibly related to developing nuclear weapons were carried out in the early 2000s at these sites. Iran has suggested the IAEA is seeking access based on the Israeli information, which it argues is inadmissible. It also says the IAEA file on its old activities has been closed.The resolution, the first by the board since 2015 and the implementation of the nuclear deal, was passed by a 25-2 margin with seven abstentions, diplomats said.Iranian allies China and Russia opposed the measure while South Africa, India, Pakistan, Thailand, Mongolia, Azerbaijan and Niger abstained.""I think the pronouncement has been clear,"" IAEA chief Rafael Grossi told reporters. ""I intend to sit down with Iran very soon and to try to solve this as soon as possible."""

Street art festival boosts LGBT visibility in Vancouver's Chinatown | CBC News,Curator Paul Wong and artist Kendall Yan speak about the resistance they've faced in the neighbourhood while promoting the annual celebration since 2018.,2020-08-08T21:27:59.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/street-art-festival-lgbt-chinatown-1.5679091,"Pride in Chinatown is celebrating its third anniversary and, unlike the Vancouver Pride Parade and other major events across the Lower Mainland, the event is not going online because of the COVID-19 pandemic.""The idea of Pride in Chinatown [is] to have a presence,"" said Paul Wong, the artistic director and curator of the month-long street art festival.The festival features eight artists' projects scattered throughout the neighbourhood, meant to promote the inclusion of LGBT people in the community. ""Chinatown has been segregated through discrimination and racism and fear. Chinatown has evolved from being very conservative and being very repressed ... and homophobic,"" Wong said to Stephen Quinn, host of CBC's The Early Edition.Most of the festival's artworks are displayed at a single location. But artist Kendell Yan's creation Quarantine is a bit different — with several locations across Chinatown. The drag performer — whose stage name is Maiden China and who has family ties to Chinatown — turned one of her Instagram self-portraits into a poster and put it up at multiple locations across the neighbourhood.""It's very pleasing for my ego,"" Yan said about seeing her face all over Chinatown.The project began after she uploaded 41 portraits to the photo-sharing platform while stuck at home during the height of the pandemic, one photo per day. But what came after was an unpleasant experience.Yan initially wanted to display all 41 of her self-portraits on a storefront. She approached three businesses near her studio, but said the responses were disappointing.""People are very hesitant to give space that's very visible, in the fear that someone is going to vandalize their business,"" she said.""That is a very homophobic thing in and of itself.""Wong faced similar resistance when he dispatched volunteers asking business associations and community service organizations to put ""Pride in Chinatown"" stickers on their doorways and windows. ""It's been an interesting way to see that kind of embracing or resistance to being queer out loud and proud in Chinatown,"" said Wong.On Saturday, community organization Youth Collaborative for Chinatown had an anonymous artist present a floral installation at the Millennium Gate as a tribute to people of different races and sexualities. Good morning, <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/ChinatownYVR?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#ChinatownYVR</a>!

Why health experts advise cancelling cruises amid coronavirus | CBC News,"Experts warn that cruise liners pose special danger as the coronavirus crisis worsens, and call on the industry to rethink ship design.",2020-03-10T08:00:58.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/coronavirus-cruise-warnings-1.5491789,"The coronavirus outbreak on the cruise ship Diamond Princess started with a single passenger who came aboard in late January with a slight cough, and then developed a fever shortly after disembarking, six days later. By the time doctors in Japan started testing the remaining passengers and crew on Feb. 3, there were 10 cases. After a 14-day quarantine, that number ballooned to 619, with seven resulting deaths so far.  A new study modelling the onboard outbreak, published in the Journal of Travel Medicine, reaches some sobering conclusions about how much worse — or better — things might have gone.In the early stages of the shipboard epidemic, the rate of infection on the Diamond Princess was four times higher than in Wuhan, China, the epicentre of what has now become a global outbreak. Left unchecked, the disease would have eventually touched 79 per cent of those on board, some 2,900 people, the Swedish researchers calculate. However, if all passengers and crew had been relocated, assessed and, where necessary, isolated when the first 10 cases were discovered, the outbreak might have been limited to a total of 76 people, they say. The difference was the boat. ""The cruise ship conditions clearly amplified an already highly transmissible disease,"" the epidemiologists write. Doctors have long known that it doesn't take much to turn a pleasure cruise into a ship of sickness. Passengers and crew are regularly laid-low by influenza, food poisoning or gastrointestinal viruses like Norwalk. Over the past decade, cruise companies operating out of U.S. ports alone have reported an average of almost 3,200 such illnesses each year. But the coronavirus outbreaks aboard the Diamond Princess — and now its Carnival Cruises sister ship, the Grand Princess, where 21 people and counting have been diagnosed with COVID-19 — show how the close quarters of onboard life have become potentially life-threatening. The current generation of massive, floating luxury hotels — some of them ferrying more than 6,000 passengers, from all over the world, each voyage — can function like a Petri dish, creating the perfect environment for the spread of a plague.""Cruise ships really provide a fairly unique situation because you take a large group of people and you confine them to a rather limited space, and really you rely on excellent hand hygiene and infection-control measures to be in place to prevent infections from spreading very widely,"" said Dr. Abdu Sharkawy, an infectious disease specialist with the University Health Network and associate professor at the University of Toronto. Unlike airplanes, where a majority of passengers tend to originate from one region or country, cruise ships host travellers from all corners of the world. And while plane passengers share a confined space for a few hours, people aboard ships are in close quarters for days, if not weeks.On Monday, Canada's Chief Public Health Officer Dr. Theresa Tam, asked Canadians to ""think twice about being on cruise ships."" The U.S. Centers for Disease Control has similarly recommended that all travellers — and most particularly those with underlying health issues — ""defer"" cruise vacations for the foreseeable future. Sharkawy says, as March break approaches, vacationers need to ""use common sense"" and look at what has already happened on the high seas. ""If I had a cruise booked, I would frankly cancel it,"" he said. ""You just don't have that degree of control, you don't have that amount of flexibility when you're stuck on a vessel with 3,000, or 4,000, or more, other passengers and you're kind at the mercy of the local authorities.""Ross Klein, a sociologist at Memorial University in St. John's, has been studying the cruise industry for more than two decades, tracking outbreaks and other on-board problems. He says the cruise companies have developed a fairly workable strategy to deal with things like stomach bugs and the flu, with illnesses hitting just a tiny fraction of the 30 million passengers they carried globally in 2019. But that playbook clearly isn't working for COVID-19.""I think the coronavirus caught them by surprise and I think they just weren't sure what to do,"" says Klein. ""It's almost like being caught like deer in the headlights.""Klein says that part of the problem might be that a modest amount of sickness has traditionally been a money-maker for cruise companies. ""There's a revenue stream that comes from illness, not just the cost stream,"" he explains. On-board health care isn't free. ""U.S. physician prices, you know? I mean, $150 for an office visit. And if you need drugs, you've got to pay too … The doctor gets a commission, and the ship makes money, and everybody's happy. Except for the passenger who doesn't have insurance.""Over the weekend, the Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA), an industry body, unveiled a coronavirus action plan, which will deny boarding to people who have visited or travelled from South Korea, Iran or China, or anyone who has come in contact with a COVID-19 patient within the past 14 days. All passengers will also have their temperatures taken as they embark, with those showing a fever above 38 C referred for secondary screening. CBC NewsWhether such measures will be sufficient to protect cruise passengers, who tend to skew older — one-third of all who sail are aged 60 or above, the age group most at risk from COVID-19 — remains to be seen. The CLIA did not respond to a request for an interview. And the three major ocean cruise companies — Carnival, Royal Caribbean and Norwegian — all declined to provide CBC News on-board access to document their cleaning and coronavirus control measures. Some experts say the coronavirus crisis points to a need to reimagine the spaces where we work, play and travel, and to start adapting them for 21st century, global health challenges.""We have to think beyond the everyday experiences. We have to anticipate risks and respond to threats,"" said Lindsay Tan, who studies how pathogens and people intersect as director of the Design Ecology Lab at Auburn University in Alabama. ""So that's both the shape of spaces, how big they are, how many people are going to be in them, how they're going to be used, but also the materials that we're using. Different materials have different properties that carry different loads of virus; properties that are easier to clean.""For cruise companies that may mean challenging consumers' definition of ""high-end"" and moving from fabric finishes to surfaces that can be more easily cleaned. ""If I told you that your cruise ship was going to have a vinyl headboard you might not think that sounds really luxurious, but I assure you there are properties that we can put into vinyl now that allow it to be comfortable, luxurious and safe,"" says Tan. ""We're already doing it in health-care spaces. You can have a seat that is beautiful and comfortable, and it's also able to be washed down with bleach."" The cruise industry is trying its best to weather the storm, by waiving cancellation fees and penalties, and offering full credit for passengers who agree to rebook for future voyages. Klein predicts that major PR campaigns and deep discounts will soon follow, in an effort to quell public fears.That's what has worked with past outbreaks of lesser illnesses. But with lives on the line, convincing people that it is safe to sail, might be a much tougher sell.""It could be years and years before people have confidence,"" said Klein."

International student recruitment behind growing Lakehead University partnership with Chinese private schools | CBC News,"A large operator of private schools in China opened its third high school on a Canadian university campus when it launched its site at Lakehead University this month, and officials with the northwestern Ontario institution say it will help strengthen international student recruiting in Asia.",2019-09-19T11:00:01.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/thunder-bay/lakehead-maple-leaf-schools-1.5288810,"A large operator of private schools in China opened its third high school on a Canadian university campus when it launched its site at Lakehead University in Thunder Bay this month, and officials with the northwestern Ontario institution say it will help strengthen international student recruiting in Asia.Maple Leaf Education has taught the British Columbia curriculum at its private schools in China and other countries since the mid-1990s, but opened its first two high schools in Canada at B.C. universities in 2016 and 2017. Earlier in September, Maple Leaf's Lakehead site opened with the first cohort of 33 Chinese students in Grades 10, 11 and 12.The school in Thunder Bay will teach the Ontario high school curriculum.The main benefit to Lakehead isn't necessarily that those students will transition to the university after they graduate, said David Barnett, the interim provost and vice president of academics at Lakehead, adding that he expects very few will.What the partnership will do, Barnett said, is raise Lakehead's profile in China — a large market for international students, and one where Lakehead recruits heavily.""Moreover than getting just the students that maybe want to stick around and go to university here, this is ... the largest school provider in China for private education,"" Barnett said of Maple Leaf Education. ""The affiliation ... is certainly a great way for us to explore international student recruitment more broadly in China and beyond.""Maple Leaf leases space at the university's Avila Centre.Canadian universities are increasingly relying on international student enrolment to sustain themselves, with one 2017 report projecting that the pool of university-aged prospective students from northern Ontario communities will continue to decline and likely won't recover.Within the past decade, ""we've gone from maybe 100, 150 students to close to 1,500 students now,"" Barnett said. ""China's a clearly important part of that and one of the early locations we went in to.""Lakehead has also had a relationship with Maple Leaf Education for over a decade, Barnett said, which includes graduates from their schools in China coming to study in Thunder Bay.The cohort at the Lakehead site will expand in subsequent years and include students from other countries as well, said Stuart McIlmoyle, the president of Maple Leaf's North American operations.The school on-campus allows students to get a taste of university life while completing high school in North America, he said.""They're focused on high school graduation, but with that opportunity to be able to be on a university campus,"" he said. ""At our B.C. university partners, students are able to have that dual credit experience where they're taking university courses from a select suite of courses and they're able to receive high school credit for those courses.""McIlmoyle said something like that could also come to the Thunder Bay campus as well.The opportunity for the students, however, isn't cheap. McIlmoyle said annual tuition is $19,800 Cdn — and with board, the uniform, insurance and out-of-school activities, the yearly cost generally sits around $35,000."

Churchill said they also met with Dr. Robert Strang, Nova Scotia's chief medical officer of health.All international trips scheduled before April 30 have been cancelled, affecting 1,200 students. The majority of the trips were bound for Italy and other parts of Europe.Churchill said the province and the centres will be monitoring the outbreak, and if it continues, the timeline will be re-evaluated. ""We've heard from a lot of parents, and folks concerned within the system, particularly chaperones for these trips, that they were very concerned about travel,"" he said.Churchill said families who purchased travel insurance will be able to claim the costs of cancelled trips.EF Educational Tours Canada, which runs student trips, confirmed that to be the case.""If the group, the school, or the school board collectively chose to cancel the trip, those travellers who purchased insurance would be able to make an insurance claim,"" spokesperson Adam Bickelman said in an email Monday.Churchill said travel agencies that organized the trips have been working with parents to provide other options, like travel vouchers.Seven people have been tested for COVID-19 in the province, but there have been no confirmed cases.Rumours that at least one patient had tested positive at a Halifax-area clinic received widespread circulation earlier this week, but the Nova Scotia Health Authority confirmed those claims were baseless.Churchill told reporters on Tuesday that the province is reviewing protocols developed during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic to prepare for a potential coronavirus outbreak in Nova Scotia that could impact schools.He said there isn't a finalized plan in place to deal with an outbreak.""We'll make sure that the kids get the best education they can in event that the worst-case scenario does occur,"" Churchill said.MORE TOP STORIES "
The 'embarrassing' U.S. response to CFO extradition could create future international problems | CBC Radio,"U.S. President Donald Trump's stated willingness to overthrow the extradition of Huawei's CFO to secure a trade deal undermines international relations, according to a legal expert.",2018-12-15T11:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/radio/thehouse/the-house-u-s-china-faceoff-puts-canada-in-an-awkward-position-1.4945159/the-embarrassing-u-s-response-to-cfo-extradition-could-create-future-international-problems-1.4945218,"U.S. President Donald Trump's stated willingness to overthrow the extradition of Huawei's CFO to secure a trade deal undermines international relations, according to a legal expert.Extradition treaties are ""time-honoured"" agreements, and Canada and the U.S. have an especially ""long-standing"" extradition arrangement, Mary Fan, a law professor at the University of Washington and a former federal prosecutor, told The House.Trump recently mused online about intervening in Meng's case. Fan said his actions could have serious blowback.""This embarrassment may give other nations reason to consider how expeditiously to respond to U.S. requests,"" she told host Chris Hall.Meng Wanzhou, an executive with the telecommunications firm Huawei, was arrested in British Columbia because she was wanted in the U.S. for allegedly violating sanctions against Iran in her business dealings.Security experts have warned Canada about doing business with Huawei, raising concerns about the close relationship between the company and the Chinese government.She has been released on bail and the U.S. has yet to formally file the paperwork for her extradition.The U.S. has 60 days from the date of her arrest to file an official request, along with the supporting documents.The NationalWhile questions about the extradition linger, Canada is considering whether to join several of its Five Eyes international intelligence partners in banning Huawei from accessing the country's 5G networks.Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale said no conclusion has been reached on that front, but talks continue with the objective to modernize telecommunications networks while keeping them secure.The government has yet to decide whether to classify Huawei as a security threat.Goodale said that decision is ""very actively developing,"" but he is not at liberty to say more at this point.""You don't want to embed something in your technology that makes you insecure or unsafe,"" he said.Meanwhile, Fan said she wonders if the president's Twitter flippancy could cause a breakdown of extradition norms.When the justice system is mixed up with other things, like trade and politics, it ""certainly undermines the trust and reciprocity,"" she said.""It's kind of, frankly, embarrassing.""Meng's next court appearance is Feb. 6."

Calgary Zoo seeks $16M upgrade to host Chinese pandas | CBC News,Calgary will ask the province for half the cash to upgrade a temporary panda enclosure at the Calgary Zoo.,2016-04-06T21:36:30.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/calgary-zoo-panda-upgrades-16m-alberta-government-1.3523945,"Calgary will ask the province for half the cash to upgrade a temporary panda enclosure at the Calgary Zoo.The project is expected to cost $16.3 million, and the zoo and its supporters would have to come up with the other half of the cost.In the spring of 2018, Calgary is expected to receive four giant pandas — two of them just recently born — that are on loan from China and currently residing at the Toronto Zoo. Coun.Gian-Carlo Carra, whose Ward 9 includes the zoo, said he's ""very supportive"" of the project. ""We also have a great master plan for the zoo and this dovetails into it so this is not just for the pandas,"" he said. ""This is about revamping and putting the zoo on a long term great track.""A city committee green-lighted the request for provincial funding Wednesday.The last time pandas came to the Calgary Zoo was in 1988, and the eight-month exhibit was credited with boosting visitation by 70 per cent over the previous year.""Aptly named 'Panda Magic' at the time, the excitement began well before the pandas arrived and grew throughout their stay,"" reads a report presented to city councillors.The project also includes a planned restoration and widening of a vintage swinging bridge north of the exhibit area that has been closed since 2012. That accounts for $1.4 million of the project's $16.3-million total cost, according to city estimates.The new panda enclosure would also be protected by flood mitigation projects, which are expected to be complete by late 2017, Carra noted."
Donald Trump's re-election campaign is bleeding votes. John Bolton's new book adds fresh paper cuts | CBC News,The forthcoming tell-all book from former U.S. national security adviser John Bolton will likely not rattle Donald Trump's base of supporters. But the problem for the U.S. president is that there aren't enough of those voters to guarantee his re-election in November. He needs swing voters.,2020-06-19T08:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/trump-bolton-book-election-1.5618394,"One tell-all book from a disgruntled, score-settling former aide will likely not rattle Donald Trump's base of stalwart supporters.The base might brush off John Bolton's forthcoming book, The Room Where It Happened. It might vilify the former national security adviser, call him a liar or, conversely, suggest he be charged for leaking state secrets.Streams of ink and star clusters of pixels have been devoted to media tales about the unwavering allegiance of the U.S. president's unshakeable base. But there's just one problem for Trump: there aren't enough of those supporters to guarantee his re-election in November. He needs swing voters.And this book, due to be published June 23, from a former insider delivers a few paper cuts to a campaign that's already begun bleeding support among those critical voters.Trump is nearly 10 percentage points behind Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden in the latest national polls, and a key reason seems to be the souring mood among a small cohort of past Republican voters.That's compounded by his dismal score among centrist voters. In one example among many, one poll this week showed a 27-point gap between Trump and Biden among self-described moderates.One disenchanted Republican who happened to work with Bolton in George W. Bush's White House said this book alone isn't a problem for Trump.What it does do, Canadian-American writer David Frum said in an interview, is add to a treasure trove of material for attack ads aimed at swing voters.The new damaging comments will, he said, compound ones made by other former Trump aides, including John Kelly, James Mattis and Rex Tillerson, who served as chief of staff, defence secretary and secretary of state, respectively.""You can make an ad out of that,"" said Frum, an unsparing critic of the current president who wrote a book, Trumpocalypse, about ideas for renewing U.S. democracy in a post-Trump era.""What the people who are [less-committed voters] will hear is Trump's former secretary of state Rex Tillerson called him a ... moron. Trump's former secretary of defence James Mattis said the only member of our military [Trump] respects is Colonel Sanders. Trump's former national security adviser John Bolton said that Trump asked the Chinese to help him win re-election....""You put up the faces and the quotes, and you send a message to people who say, 'I took a chance on him in 2016' ... It turns out everyone close to him in a national-security position thinks he's dangerous and incompetent.""One part of the book, published in an excerpt in the Wall Street Journal on Wednesday, poses a particular political headache for Trump.It involves China.It's almost impossible to overstate how central it is to Trump's re-election message that he's the China hawk in the election race.Text messages are constantly going out to Trump supporters encouraging them to amplify specific China-related messages in their social-media feeds.WATCH | The Room Where It Happened makes explosive allegations:The NationalThey include China being responsible for COVID-19, Chinese trade being the source of problems for American workers, allegations that Biden, a former vice-president, is soft on China and that Biden's son has questionable business connections in China.Biden, who described the published details in the book as ""morally repugnant,"" now has an abundant supply of fresh material with which to counter-attack.In the excerpt published this week, Bolton claims Trump personally asked China's Xi Jinping to help him win re-election by buying more U.S. farm goods. Bolton also alleges Trump encouraged the Chinese president to build concentration camps for members of the Uighur minority.""At the opening dinner of the Osaka G-20 meeting in June 2019, with only interpreters present, Xi had explained to Trump why he was basically building concentration camps in Xinjiang. According to our interpreter, Trump said that Xi should go ahead with building the camps, which Trump thought was exactly the right thing to do,"" Bolton writes.The book reportedly claims Trump was also willing to halt criminal investigations for dictators he liked; contradicted his own CIA and defended Saudi Arabia in the killing of a Washington Post columnist as a distraction tactic from a controversy involving his daughter; and spoke of executing journalists, whom he called scumbags.The president has now tweeted about Bolton at least a half-dozen times. His senior aides spent part of Wednesday and Thursday contesting details of the book.U.S. Trade Rep. Lighthizer denies Bolton claim that Trump asked Chinese President Xi Jinping for help winning the election. <a href=""https://t.co/WkIVBCYM68"">pic.twitter.com/WkIVBCYM68</a>""Absolutely untrue,"" U.S. trade representative Robert Lighthizer said of the characterization of the Xi meeting, which he also attended. ""Would I recollect something as crazy as that? Of course, I would recollect it.""Trump adviser Peter Navarro referred to his former colleague as ""Big Lie Bolton."" Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was equally critical, in less printable language. Meanwhile, the polls have steadily worsened this spring.Wendy Schiller, a political scientist at Brown University in Providence, R.I., said one reason is that a small slice of the electorate — no more than 10 per cent of voters representing fewer than 14 million people — is drifting away from Trump.She said they tend to live in the suburbs or outer rings of growing metropolitan areas — places such as the research triangle in Raleigh, N.C., the wealthy outskirts of Philadelphia, or between Tucson and Phoenix in Arizona.Many voted for Barack Obama, then Trump; others are longtime Republicans.These voters will decide the election, says Schiller.""What ties independent voters together is a sense of how well the government is running — for them,"" she said. ""In 2016, there was a sense that the economy had not improved fast enough under Obama and an undercurrent of dislike for Hillary Clinton, especially among independent men.... ""If the economy improves by October, independents might stick with Trump, but if they believe Biden will continue economic growth and run the government more smoothly, and calmly, than Trump will, they will switch their votes.""Two polls this week show Trump with less support among Republicans than Biden has among Democrats.Trump tried to re-energize some of the party faithful on Thursday with a new message.After losing a second major Supreme Court case in a week, first on LGBT rights and then on rights for undocumented immigrants, he promised to make the nomination of judges a campaign issue like he did in 2016.I will be releasing a new list of Conservative Supreme Court Justice nominees, which may include some, or many of those already on the list, by September 1, 2020. If given the opportunity, I will only choose from this list, as in the past, a Conservative Supreme Court Justice...His aides, meanwhile, blasted Bolton as a war-monger with a habit of knifing colleagues and burning bridges in Washington.""That's the pattern,"" Navarro said.But Frum said it's on Trump, not Bolton, that the president hired perhaps Washington's most famous advocate of military interventionism and put him in charge of national security in a White House that opposes foreign military entanglements.""There are just so many examples of people where Trump says, 'I hired this person, and he turned out to be no good,'"" Frum said. ""Here's one of the best-known people in Washington, with a record going back to before the Reagan administration who's written books and op-eds, hundreds of thousands of words ... and you seem not to have been aware of any of that material. ""You just hired him because he was a familiar face from Fox News. And then you were surprised to discover that he wanted to take you in directions you didn't want to go? Frum's own new book begins with a pastor, in March, describing churchgoers being willing to lick the floor to prove Trump's claim the coronavirus wasn't dangerous.History shows, however, that it takes more than deeply devoted partisans to put a presidential campaign over the top."

COC head Jim Thompson dies | CBC Sports,,2002-08-15T01:59:53.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/sports/coc-head-jim-thompson-dies-1.355016,"Jim Thompson, who was named CEO of the Canadian Olympic Committee only last January, died of a heart attack on Wednesday at the age of 60. He was in Vancouver attending meetings with the Vancouver 2010 Bid Corp. ""It's devastating to see someone so young, who really had so much more to give, especially in his new role with the Canadian Olympic Committee,"" said Netstar president Rick Brace, a broadcasting colleague of Thompson's for more than 20 years. ""Amateur sports was certainly his first love and he was so well-positioned and so happy to come out of retirement and take on that role and the challenges it brought for him. It's an absolute shame he didn't have the chance to enjoy it more fully."" Thompson succeeded the late Carol-Anne Letheren as head of the COC after a lengthy career as a sports broadcasting executive with CBC and TSN. The COC post had been vacant since Letheren died of a brain aneurysm in February 2001. ""The COC is deeply shocked and saddened by the sudden passing of our new CEO, Jim Thompson,"" COC president Mike Chambers said in a statement. ""Jim was passionate about high-performance athletes and was dedicated to the advancement of high-performance sport in Canada. ""With enthusiasm, he brought that vision to life within his few short months with the COC."" A native of Collingwood, Ont., Thompson served as an executive producer with CBC Sports until 1984, when he became a founding partner of TSN with Gordon Craig. Thompson remained with TSN until 2000. He came out of retirement in January to become CEO of the Olympic committee, a role his friends and colleagues said he was perfect for. ""There was just a natural passion and love for sport,"" said Diane Jones-Konihowski, a COC board member and former Olympic pentathlete. ""I just thought he was a breath of fresh air and a man I was really impressed with. He just cared about the athlete and he wanted to do what he could to make things happen. ""He just did it. He was like a bull in a china shop."" During his brief tenure at the helm of the COC, the organization changed its name from Canadian Olympic Association and instituted some controversial reforms, included an overhaul of its funding formula to focus more on sports and athletes with a strong chance of winning Olympic medals. His death left his friends and colleagues shocked. ""He really had a vision for how he wanted to see things done, and a real high-performance bent,"" said Dave Bedford, Canada's chef de mission for the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens. ""His belief, formulated from his broadcast years, was that Canadians rallied around teams and individuals when they performed well, and he wanted to foster that. ""It's tough, coming on the heels of Carol Anne's passing away, and a long search to find the appropriate replacement,"" he added. ""But more important, it's going to be tough for Jim's family."" Thompson is survived by his wife Sheila, son Jake and daughter Sam. "
Canadian cruise passengers who test negative for COVID-19 to leave Japan on charter flight | CBC News,Canadian passengers aboard the quarantined Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan who have not tested positive for COVID-19 were allowed off the ship today ahead of a charter flight that's scheduled to leave Tokyo on Friday.,2020-02-20T00:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/canadian-cruise-passengers-who-test-negative-for-covid-19-leave-ship-1.5469498,"The latest:Canadian passengers from the quarantined Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan who did not test positive for the coronavirus are on a charter flight that took off from Tokyo airport and is expected to arrive at CFB Trenton in Ontario in the wee hours of Friday morning. CFB Trenton was the destination for previous repatriation flights that brought people back from Wuhan, China — the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak.But instead of staying there, the Diamond Princess returnees will be transported to the NAV Canada Training Institute in Cornwall, Ont., where they will be placed in quarantine for up to 14 days. Foreign Affairs Minister François-Philippe Champagne tweeted that the plane was ""wheels up"" on Thursday afternoon. There were 256 Canadians on the Diamond Princess, which has been docked in Yokohama since early February. Of those, 47 have tested positive for the virus, Global Affairs Canada said. Those passengers are not among those returning to Canada on the repatriation flight. Allan and Diana Chow, an Ontario couple who were also on the Diamond Princess, have been eager to get off the ship, which Allan previously described as a ""floating jailhouse.""The pair, who have been sending photos back to their daughter in Toronto who then posts to Twitter, noted their departure from the ship on Thursday. Just waiting now <a href=""https://t.co/ZQfnzbayA9"">pic.twitter.com/ZQfnzbayA9</a>Global Affairs Canada (GAC) said that if space allowed, non-Canadian immediate family of citizens and permanent residents would be allowed on the flight to allow families to stay together. It's not yet clear how many people ended up on the flight.If people chose not to return home on the charter flight, GAC said they would have to finish the quarantine being run by health officials in Japan and follow local instructions.""Canadians seeking to return to Canada by commercial means will be subject to the Quarantine Act upon their return, in line with a determination to be made by the Public Health Agency of Canada,"" the statement read, though it did not say exactly what that would mean for those who elect not to board the charter.Speaking to reporters on Thursday, Health Minister Patty Hajdu said that none of the people who have been in quarantine at CFB Trenton have shown symptoms of coronavirus. Two flights brought back approximately 300 Canadians and their families evacuated from Wuhan earlier this month. The passengers from the first flight are completing their 14-day quarantine and due to be sent home on Friday.  The total number of coronavirus cases in Canada rose to nine on Thursday, as British Columbia's top health officer, Dr. Bonnie Henry, announced a woman in her 30s had been diagnosed after returning from Iran. She is the sixth person in the province believed to have COVID-19, the illness caused by the new coronavirus.As with all cases diagnosed at the provincial level, it is considered presumptive until confirmed by the National Microbiology Lab in Winnipeg.  Henry described the woman's infection as relatively mild, but said she has had contact with others since her return from Iran last week. Close family members are currently in isolation and being monitored by public health officials.BC has identified their sixth case of <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/COVID19?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#COVID19</a>, the ninth case in Canada. The individual recently returned from Iran, and is now recovering in isolation at home.The woman only visited Iran during her travels. Henry said that country has recently announced five cases of coronavirus and two deaths. The three other coronavirus cases in Canada have been in Ontario. There have been no coronavirus deaths in Canada.  Japan reported the deaths of two elderly passengers from the Diamond Princess on Thursday, the first fatalities from aboard the ship where more than 630 cases account for the biggest cluster of infection outside China.The two passengers, an 87-year-old man and an 84-year-old woman, both Japanese, had tested positive for the virus and been taken off the ship and hospitalized, Japanese public broadcaster NHK reported.""Our hearts go out to the families, friends and all who are impacted by these losses,"" the cruise line said in a statement to CBC News. ""All of us at Princess Cruises, as well as the crew of the Diamond Princess, offer our sincere condolences.""Hundreds of passengers who were cleared were able to get off the ship on Wednesday, the first batch of travellers to leave the ship after the two-week quarantine ended.Hajdu admitted to ""concern"" that Japan's handling of the outbreak might have increased the spread of the virus on board the ship. ""But I can also empathize with Japan in terms of quarantining almost 3,000 people,"" the health minister said. ""That's also a very challenging situation."" WATCH | Health minister on lessons learned from the Diamond Princess:HealthThat situation was something for Canada to ""keep our eye on as we enter into cruise season,"" she said, noting that the government was ""making some preparations now to consider how we'll deal with our own tourist season.""The coronavirus emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year, apparently in a wildlife market, and has now infected some 75,000 people and killed about 2,100.The vast majority of cases and deaths have been in China, and more specifically Hubei province, of which Wuhan is the capital, but the global spread appears inexorable."

The death toll in the United States and some European countries is much higher.India's lockdown, introduced on March 25 and extended several times, had been due to expire at midnight on Sunday.The curbs have sparked a crisis for the hundreds of millions of Indians who rely on daily wages to survive.With no work — and little public transport — many urban migrants attempting to return to their home villages have set out on gruelling journeys on foot or hitched rides in the back of trucks.In Rajkot in the western state of Gujarat, more than 1,500 migrant workers blocked roads, damaged more than a dozen vehicles and threw stones at police on Sunday, after two special trains that were supposed to take them home got cancelled.A police official in Shapar told Reuters police baton-charged the migrants to disperse them, with several officers injured in the process.""The workers had not gathered with the intention of violence. Two or three trains were rescheduled, but the workers misunderstood that the trains had been cancelled, and resorted to violence,"" Balram Meena, Rajkot's superintendent of police, told local media.""We are identifying the people who were involved in the violence,"" Meena added.At least 23 migrants were killed trying to reach their homes on Saturday when a truck crashed in northern India.Sixteen migrant workers died on May 8 after being struck by a train. They had fallen asleep on the tracks while walking back to their village after losing their jobs in a coronavirus lockdown, police said."
Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou loses court battle for freedom as B.C. judge rules extradition bid to proceed | CBC News,"After four months of deliberation, B.C. Supreme Court Associate Chief Justice Heather Holmes has delivered her ruling on whether the offence of which Meng Wenzhou is accused would be considered a crime in Canada.",2020-05-27T11:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/meng-wanzhou-extradition-decision-1.5585737,"A B.C. Supreme Court judge has delivered a major blow to Meng Wanzhou, ruling that extradition proceedings against the Huawei executive should proceed.In a widely anticipated decision on so-called double criminality, Associate Chief Justice Heather Holmes said the offence Meng is accused of by American prosecutors would be considered a crime if it occurred in Canada.The 48-year-old chief financial officer of the telecommunications giant is charged with fraud in the United States for allegedly deceiving banks into a possible violation of U.S. economic sanctions against Iran.In a 23-page ruling released Wednesday, Holmes said that the essence of Meng's alleged crime is fraud. And the fact that Canada doesn't have the same economic sanctions against Iran as the U.S. wouldn't stop someone being prosecuted in Canada for the same offence.""Canada's law of fraud looks beyond international boundaries,"" Holmes wrote in her decision.""Ms. Meng's approach to the double criminality analysis would seriously limit Canada's ability to fulfil its international obligations in the extradition context for fraud and other economic crimes.""Meng appeared in court shortly after the public release of the decision, showing no visible reaction to the loss.

Supreme Court after the legal defeat on WednesdayCBC News BCThe executive was arrested at Vancouver's airport in December 2018 on an extradition warrant. She is accused of lying to an HSBC executive in Hong Kong about Huawei's control of a company that was said to be violating U.S. economic sanctions against Iran.Prosecutors claim that Meng's alleged lies put banks at risk of prosecution and loss because they would be violating U.S. sanctions themselves in handling Huawei's finances.Meng has denied the allegations against her. A statement from Huawei on Wednesday said the company was ""disappointed"" in Holmes's ruling and that her lawyers will continue to push for her freedom.""Our view is that this is an early step in what's likely to be a much longer process for Meng Wanzhou here in Canada,"" said Alykhan Velshi, vice president of corporate affairs of Huawei Canada.""We're confident that Meng Wanzhou will be vindicated,"" Velshi told CBC News outside the courthouse.The ruling does not necessarily mean that Meng will be extradited to the U.S. The judge still has to hold hearings to determine whether there is sufficient evidence to warrant extradition, and Meng has also claimed that her rights were violated at the time of her arrest.Holmes pointed out that Canada's minister of justice will also have a chance to weigh in on whether a decision to commit Meng for extradition would be contrary to Canadian values.The ministry confirmed in a statement that extradition proceedings will go ahead ""as expeditiously as possible.""The decision Wednesday comes as a major setback to Meng, who is the daughter of Huawei's billionaire founder Ren Zhengfei. On Saturday night, she staged a photo shoot on the steps of the B.C. Supreme Court building in apparent anticipation of a victory.Meng's lawyers argued that the fact Canada does not have economic sanctions against Iran meant her alleged actions would not have been considered a crime in Canada because no bank would have suffered a loss in an identical set of circumstances.The Crown argued that Meng's alleged offence was fraud, pure and simple, which is a crime in both countries.In the ruling, Holmes wrestled with the question of whether a judge can consider the effect of U.S. sanctions in coming to a decision, given that she was supposed to be imagining a hypothetical version of the events set in Canada.But the judge said Meng's lawyers were trying to make the scope of her analysis too narrow.""Canada's law of fraud looks beyond international boundaries to encompass all the relevant details that make up the factual matrix, including foreign laws that may give meaning to some of the facts,"" Holmes said.""The offence of fraud has a vast potential scope. It may encompass a very wide range of conduct, a large expanse of time, and acts, people and consequences in multiple jurisdictions. Experience shows that many fraudsters benefit in particular from international dealings through which they can obscure their identity and the location of their fraudulent gains.""Holmes also addressed Meng's lawyers' concern that the offence would see Canada enforcing sanctions Canadians have explicitly rejected.She pointed out that economic sanctions are not as ""fundamentally contrary"" to Canadian values as something like slavery. And she said it would ultimately be the job of Justice Minister David Lametti to decide whether surrendering Meng to the U.S. authorities would be ""unjust or oppressive.""China has repeatedly expressed anger at Canada for arresting Meng.The Chinese government has targeted Canadian canola and meat imports. And within days of Meng's arrest, authorities detained two Canadians who were living and working in China, former diplomat Michael Kovrig and entrepreneur Michael Spavor.Both men have been accused of spying and have been held in custody ever since.Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister François-Philippe Champagne said Wednesday that Canada's ""top priority"" is securing the release of Kovrig and Spavor as well as clemency for Canadians facing the death penalty in China, including Robert Schellenberg.""We will continue to advocate for their immediate release,"" Champagne tweeted. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian called for Meng's release once more on Tuesday, insisting the dispute was political, not legal.""The Canadian side should immediately correct its mistake, release Ms. Meng and ensure her safe return to China at an early date so as to avoid any continuous harm to China-Canada relations,"" Zhao said in a news conference.The U.S. Department of Justice released a statement thanking the Canadian government for its ""continued assistance"" in the case against Meng. Champagne's statement reiterated that Canada's judiciary operates independently."

He did not say what those things were.""Maybe the Canadian government have not decided, but the Chinese side is already prepared,"" he said.One sticking point between the two countries is Canada's push to include labour rights in a joint statement announcing the launch of formal negotiations, said Guy Saint-Jacques, Canada's former ambassador to China (2012-16).Politics News""There was a problem with the wording of the communique, and the key problem was related to labour rights,"" he told Kapelos in a separate interview on Power & Politics.""We're at the stage where diplomats have to get into action and try to work out some compromise language.""Lu seemed to reject the idea of including ""progressive"" elements in trade talks with Canada.""I think the notion of progressive trade maybe is not a good factor in the negotiation of [a free trade agreement],"" Lu said, because those factors aren't related to commerce, which is what trade negotiations are about.""The conditions of China and Canada are different,"" he said.

'Uncertainty' and 'fear': Vancouver resident on why she has not returned to Hong Kong | CBC News,Hundreds of thousands of people marched through Hong Kong Sunday to voice opposition to government-sponsored legislation that would allow people to be extradited to mainland China to face charges.,2019-06-11T21:06:15.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/uncertainty-and-fear-vancouver-resident-on-why-she-has-not-returned-to-hong-kong-1.5171012,"Hundreds of thousands of people marched through Hong Kong Sunday to voice opposition to government-sponsored legislation that would allow people to be extradited to mainland China to face charges.Lawmakers in Hong Kong are expected to debate the controversial bill on Wednesday.Ivy Li moved from Hong Kong to Canada 36 years ago and is worried the bill will pass. She participated in solidarity in protests on Sunday outside the Chinese consulate in Vancouver.Many families in Hong Kong originally moved there to flee the Communist Party when it took over China in 1949, says Li.""They heard about the horror of the Cultural Revolution from friends and relatives who were still in China at that time. So, for many Hong Kong people, the mistrust and fear of Beijing was very deep-seated,"" Li told Stephen Quinn, host of The Early Edition.Hong Kong was guaranteed the right to retain its own social, legal and political systems for 50 years following its handover from British to Chinese rule in 1997, the so-called ""one country, two systems"" framework.""Many Hong Kongers were still worried but also hopeful that at least there would be 50 years,"" said Li.However, China's ruling Communist Party has been seen as increasingly reneging on that agreement by forcing through unpopular legal changes.When the Tiananmen Square Massacre happened in 1989, people in Hong Kong were horrified, says Li. The massacre occurred when Chinese troops fired on democratic demonstrators and those attempting to block the military's advance into the square in Beijing.  ""They were terrified by the brutality and they worry that they will lose their way of life, especially freedom of speech ... Then, in 1997 when Hong Kong was handed over to Beijing, the fear became more real.""The Tiananmen Square Massacre and the Hong Kong handover caused two large immigration waves to Canada. Li originally moved to the U.S. to study before moving to Canada. She decided it was safer to not return to Hong Kong.""I'm very, very worried about losing my freedom. And then also the worry about all the civil liberties I enjoyed under the British rule. The uncertainty about what would happen to Hong Kong is very frightening for most Hong Kong people.""If the extradition bill passes, it means Hong Kong will be one country, one system, says Li.""The major difference between Hong Kong and mainland China is the rule of law. And in China, we know that is arbitrary ... all the laws that are in the Constitution were basically ineffective because it depends on what the government wants at all times.""Listen to the full story here:With files by The Early Edition. "

Canada set to postpone Huawei 5G decision to after the election - sources | CBC News,"Canada is likely to postpone a decision on whether to allow China's Huawei Technologies Co Ltd to supply 5G network equipment until after the October federal election, given increasingly strained relations with Beijing, say three well-placed sources.",2019-07-15T18:24:37.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canada-china-huawei-5g-1.5212349,"Canada is likely to postpone a decision on whether to allow China's Huawei Technologies Co Ltd to supply 5G network equipment until after the October federal election, given increasingly strained relations with Beijing, say three well-placed sources.The sources, who requested anonymity given the sensitivity of the situation, said the Liberal government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was reluctant to move until the fate of two Canadians detained in China became clearer.China detained Canadians Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor last December and later charged them with spying. Beijing acted after Canadian police arrested Huawei's chief financial officer on a U.S. warrant, a move condemned by China.Experts in Ottawa are reviewing the security implications of 5G networks, including Huawei's participation. The United States is concerned the use of Huawei equipment could undermine national security.Two sources with direct knowledge of the situation said there was no chance of an announcement before the election. A third source stressed a final decision had not yet been made but added it was unlikely details would be released in time for the vote.A postponement could irritate telecommunications companies such as BCE Inc and Telus Corp, which cannot proceed with their plans for 5G wireless networks until Ottawa comes to a decision.The 5G issue is entangled in the broader trade and diplomatic dispute with China. Trudeau has condemned the arrests of Kovrig and Spavor and several Canadian allies, including the United States, are calling for their release.Whether Canada was willing to allow a Chinese company to dominate an important part of the telecommunications network for the next generation was an important issue, said the third source.China has also stopped importing some Canadian commodities.Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale, in charge of the 5G review, said in late April he intended the results to be made public by the election.""We will be taking appropriate decisions in due course,"" said Goodale spokesman Scott Bardsley. Bell, Telus and Huawei did not respond to requests for comment.Recent polls suggest the Liberals could retain power, fending off a challenge from the rival Conservative Party, which has said it would not allow Huawei 5G technology.A decision before October would not help Trudeau with voters, said the third source. Banning Huawei could anger Beijing but a positive decision would leave him open to attacks that he was ignoring the detainees' fate.The question of whether Huawei's 5G equipment could contain backdoors allowing access to spies is dividing Canada and its partners in the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing network.The United States, Australia and New Zealand have bans in place while Britain is taking a less firm line, indicating Huawei's 5G products could be used in less sensitive areas.Canada is watching what Britain does very closely, said the third source, indicating Ottawa could take a similar decision. Huawei has repeatedly insisted Beijing has no influence over it.In the meantime, Rogers Corp, Canada's third major telecommunications company, has announced it will use 5G equipment from Telefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson.""(That) potentially gives them quite a head start ... at a certain point the clamour from Bell and Telus will be louder than it is now,"" said the second source.Smaller telecommunications firms such as SaskTel in the western province of Saskatchewan are chafing at the delay.""It's a challenge for us ... we're pushing hard to get some answers from the federal government,"" Don Morgan, the cabinet minister responsible for SaskTel, said on July 8."
The latest on the coronavirus outbreak for Sept. 21 | CBC News,The latest on the coronavirus outbreak for Sept. 21.,2020-09-21T22:06:34.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/coronavirus-newsletter-sept-21-1.5733181,"TSX joins global stock market sell-off as coronavirus fears persistThe TSX joined stock markets around the world in a new round of selling off Monday as surging cases of the coronavirus reignited concerns that the economic impact of the pandemic is still far from over. The S&P/TSX composite index was down by almost 400 points, or more than 2.5 per cent, nearing midday, as health-care, energy, mining, banks and even tech sectors were all lower.Losses began in Asia as soon as trading opened for the week, and they accelerated in Europe on worries about the possibility of tougher restrictions there to stem rising coronavirus counts. In New York, the broad S&P 500 was down by 84 points, or 2.5 per cent, while the Dow Jones fared even worse, down almost 1,000 points, or 3.5 per cent. See the most recent numbers here.Bank stocks had sharp losses Monday morning after a report by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists alleged that several of them continue to profit from illicit dealings with criminal networks despite being previously fined for similar actions.Shares in technology companies have been on fire for the past six months, as pandemic lockdowns have caused booming demand for online services, such as Amazon, Netflix, Apple and Facebook. But tech companies have been selling off of late on fears that they have risen too far too fast. ""Stock markets around the world are trading lower to start the week amid mounting uncertainty,"" said Colin Cieszynski, chief market strategist with SIA Wealth Management in Toronto. ""Growing uncertainty and volatility in world markets has sparked a move of capital.""The NationalIN BRIEFPediatricians issue urgent call for help to get flu shot to more people this fallOntario pediatricians say their calls for the financial and logistical support needed to do more flu vaccinations during the COVID-19 pandemic have so far gone unheeded and an ""imminent crisis"" could lie ahead. ""We … would like to express our urgent concerns regarding an imminent crisis in influenza vaccination,"" said an online petition launched on Change.org Saturday by the pediatrics section of the Ontario Medical Association. ""Right now, Public Health seems to expect the status quo from years past, when individual doctor's offices and scattered flu clinics gave flu vaccines.""Public health officials and health-care experts have stressed the importance of getting the flu shot this year to avoid burdening the health-care system even more during the pandemic. Pediatricians say the coronavirus outbreak makes it more critical than ever for children to get flu shots, not only because influenza can make them very ill but also because they can easily spread the virus to vulnerable people, such as the elderly, for whom both flu and COVID-19 can be very dangerous.But health-care providers won't be able to give nearly the normal number of flu vaccinations in their offices and clinics this year, they say, because of COVID-19 safety protocols, such as eliminating crowded waiting rooms, seeing patients by appointment only, and the time needed for rigorous cleaning and disinfecting of exam rooms between each vaccination. The solution, they say, is ""planning large-scale, community-based provincewide flu vaccination clinics,"" which would be held in large venues that allow for physical distancing, as well as outdoor or drive-thru clinics. ""These would ensure that we can safely administer flu vaccine universally throughout the province in large numbers, quickly and efficiently,"" the petition says.People of colour make up 66% of Ottawa's COVID-19 casesRace-based data is confirming what some on the front lines of the COVID-19 pandemic have been saying for months — that the novel coronavirus affects communities of colour at a disproportionate rate. According to early data from Ottawa Public Health (OPH), 66 per cent of people who've tested positive for COVID-19 in Ottawa are ""racialized"" — which OPH defines as those who are Black or of other non-white backgrounds. The term does not include people who identify as Indigenous. Only 25 per cent of Ottawa residents identified as being a visible minority in the 2016 census, according to Statistics Canada.""We know that there are systemic inequities for these communities,"" said Naini Cloutier, executive director of the Somerset West Community Health Centre, in an interview with CBC. ""With COVID, the cracks are becoming bigger, and you're seeing the very negative impact.""Cloutier revealed those numbers at a technical briefing last Wednesday with Ottawa councillors and public health officials. She also laid out the Ottawa Health Team's plan for minimizing the impact of COVID-19 in those communities. The strategy will address the specific health and socioeconomic factors that make people from non-white backgrounds, immigrants and newcomers more likely to catch COVID-19 and experience worse health outcomes. OPH started collecting race-based data in June to get a fuller picture of the impact of COVID-19 and the barriers some residents face accessing health care in Ottawa.Ontario reports highest number of new cases in more than 3 months; Quebec has most new cases since May Ontario reported an additional 425 cases of COVID-19 on Monday, the most on any single day in the past three-and-a-half months. Consistent with recent trends, the majority of new infections were concentrated in three public health units. Toronto saw 175 while Peel confirmed 84 and Ottawa 60.​​Health Minister Christine Elliott said in a series of tweets that about 67 per cent of cases in Monday's update are people under the age of 40. Further, 18 of the newly confirmed cases are what the province classifies as ""school-related."" There have now been a cumulative total of 90 student-related cases reported across Ontario since the new school year began.In Quebec, the province is seeing the start of a ""second wave"" of COVID-19 infections, according to public health director Dr. Horacio Arruda. Quebec reported 586 new cases, the highest daily increase since late May, when the first wave of infections began to taper off.At a news conference in Quebec City, Arruda said the increases in recent days have convinced him that the province has entered dangerous territory. ""The [epidemiological] curve is not like it was in spring, but I think it is the start of a second wave,"" Arruda said. ""If we want to have a normal Christmas, people need to co-operate. It's important.""Stay informed with the latest COVID-19 data from Canada and around the world.THE SCIENCEHospitalizations, deaths will follow Ontario's COVID-19 surge, but how many remains unclear The fresh spike in new COVID-19 cases in Ontario is not yet bringing an equivalent spike in hospitalizations or deaths from the coronavirus, but experts say it's too early to draw conclusions. Over the past week, as Premier Doug Ford and his government slapped new restrictions on private gatherings, Ontario reported an average of 335 new confirmed COVID-19 infections daily, about two-thirds of them in people under 40. That's triple the pace of the last week of August.So far, the rise in hospitalizations is nowhere near as steep. There were 65 patients with confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Ontario hospitals as of Monday. The hospitalization rate hit its low ebb in the third week of August, with a daily average of 38 patients in beds around the province. However, hospitalizations and deaths are what epidemiologists call ""lagging indicators"" of the impact of a pandemic: you don't see those numbers rising until well after the infections were transmitted.But that's no reason to take the current spike in cases casually, according to the experts. ""The issue with this infection is that it's really, really contagious,"" said Dr. Isaac Bogoch, infectious disease physician at Toronto General Hospital.""It doesn't stay restricted to a single age cohort for long,"" he said. ""Unfortunately, I think we're starting to see some early trends of this spreading beyond the 20-year-old age group and into older age groups.""Ontario's surging number of new coronavirus cases is not just a function of increased testing, as some skeptics have claimed. The province completed an average of around 25,600 tests per day in August. Over the past week, that average daily testing number was up by 32 per cent. The average number of confirmed new COVID-19 cases has accelerated far more quickly. On Sept. 1, the daily number of new cases (based on a five-day average) was running at 121. That doubled by Sept. 12. It tripled by Sept. 18.Another sign that has the medical community worried about what's to come is Ontario's rising test positivity rate. That's the percentage of people tested whose results show a confirmed case of COVID-19. Over the past week, the positivity rate was 0.99 per cent. That's double the rate of late August, and triple the rate of early August.AND FINALLY...Struck by loneliness of seniors in pandemic, N.B. student launches program that pairs university students with seniors At 85, Brenda Trafford is well known along the southeastern part of New Brunswick for her colourful outfits, yellow car and bright jewelry. She is a tireless volunteer and a prolific maker of crafts. But even for a self-described ""active senior,"" COVID-19 restrictions have been tough. ""I do have my days when I'm at home and have been there for too long and haven't seen a single soul, and it does get gloomy,"" said Trafford.Enter Hannah Crouse, a third-year student at Mount Allison University in Sackville, whose eyes were opened in the spring to the needs of seniors like Trafford. Crouse was working with community groups, and one of her first assignments was delivering food to seniors in and around Port Elgin. Crouse found loneliness at every stop. ""It was every senior that I visited, and I mean every single senior that I visited,"" she told CBC News.That night, Crouse came up with the idea for her program that pairs university students with seniors. The goal is for the students to visit their seniors once a week and share a meal while remaining physically distanced. Crouse put out a call on social media for student volunteers from Mount Allison, then invited the seniors and students to a garden party earlier this summer. She played the role of matchmaker and paired 18 seniors with 20 students. Crouse said many friendships have blossomed, including her own friendship with Trafford.""We chatted a lot; we compared tattoos,"" Trafford said. ""I was hers, and she was mine, and that was it."" The feeling was mutual. Crouse said she immediately decided, ""Oh my gosh, I'm stealing Brenda.""Find out more about COVID-19Still looking for more information on the pandemic?

But sometimes, we have reason to keep quiet. This week, Piya explores what leads people to silence themselves... and what impact that can have on us all.Here are the stories from this week's episode...'It's just better for me to stay silent': Doctor feels unable to voice abortion views at work, in communityA doctor who we've agreed not to name says she's personally against abortion, partially because of her faith, and chooses not to offer such services as an OBGYN. But she also says abortion services are central to women's health and believes in the right to obtain them. As she tells Piya, she rarely talks about either of these stances - her faith at work or her support of abortion services among her faith community - because of the stigma she feels her beliefs hold in those contexts.Vancouver woman tries to come to grips with losing all communication with her family in ChinaDilnur Kurban came to Vancouver from China as an international student in 2011. Her family is Uighur, a persecuted Muslim minority group in China. They wanted to limit communication with her for a time, fearing that speaking to a foreign family member could lead to them being placed in detention camps. At first, Dilnur agreed and also never spoke of the situation to others. But now that she's lost complete contact with her family, she tells Piya why she's breaking her silence.Why one woman initially chose to tell no one about her plan to donate a kidneyAfter she turned 50, Leah Hager Cohen decided to donate her kidney.

International student program shrinks amid COVID-19 travel restrictions | CBC News,"Atlantic Education International normally recruits more than 600 students from ages 11 to 18 to come study for a semester or several years at anglophone schools. But with travel restrictions limiting entry to Canada, that number is expected to fall to about 90 this fall.",2020-08-22T11:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/international-student-program-shrinks-covid-19-1.5695928,"A program that brings international students to study in New Brunswick's public schools is facing a major drop in numbers during the pandemic. Atlantic Education International normally recruits more than 600 students from ages 11 to 18 to come study for a semester or several years at anglophone schools. But with travel restrictions limiting entry to Canada, that number is expected to fall to about 90 this fall.The federal government only allows entry to international students who received their study permits prior to March 18, under an order in council.""It's essentially a seventh [of] what we're used to seeing, so it's a pretty significant drop in numbers — financially as well,"" said Megan Stymiest, the director of policy, finance and legal counsel.As a provincial government-owned company, Atlantic Education International operates under the Department of Education and Early Childhood Development. It was created in 1997 to market and sell educational programs abroad, including the New Brunswick International Student Program.The company also sells the New Brunswick school curriculum to private schools in China.International high school students are a big source of revenue for the province. In 2018-19, the program generated about $10.4 million for the New Brunswick economy, including stipends paid to host families.Students come from 22 countries around the world. Those who study for a full school year pay about $20,000 for tuition, housing, health insurance and other fees. After covering Atlantic Education International's operating expenses, revenue flows to New Brunswick public schools and districts. Stymiest could not say what portion ultimately goes to schools.Families house the international students during their studies, but most will not meet until after 14 days of self-isolation. While many students from last semester stayed in the province to avoid travel restrictions, most recent arrivals will complete their quarantine at motels, hotels and other commercial accommodations.Students have recently arrived from Vietnam, China, South Korea and Italy. Under public health requirements, they are transported directly to their isolation accommodations and will be tested on the 10th day in quarantine.Stymiest said that finding hosts has not been a challenge during the pandemic. ""The host family piece of our program is really the pillar of what we do,"" she said. ""And having all of these families in every corner of the province that are really committed and really dedicated to the students is what sets us apart from all of the other programs across Canada.""High schools students will be spending every other day at home doing online learning. It's a change the program is making sure hosts are prepared for — but the reduced classroom time hasn't deterred people from coming. The program has grown exponentially the past few years. This past school year, more than 800 international students were in the province over both semesters.""In the beginning, students would come usually for one semester, and it was just for an experience,"" Symiest said. ""But in recent years we've seen students coming for full years and sometimes coming for Grade 11 and 12.""Some similar programs across Canada were forced to entirely close during the COVID-19 pandemic. ""We're hopeful that perhaps we may see some more students second semester,"" she said.""I think we'll bounce back quite quickly provided that travel restrictions dissipate and families are willing to send their children."""

"Why it's taking so long to get Canadians out of Wuhan, and other coronavirus airlift questions | CBC News","As Canadians are airlifted out of Wuhan, China, the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak, many are asking how the exodus will unfold, why it took so long for Canada to get its citizens out of the country and what happens when these Canadians arrive back home. ​​​​​​​",2020-02-06T09:00:02.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/china-outbreak-exodus-five-things-1.5453725,"As Canadians are airlifted out of Wuhan, China, the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak, many are asking how the exodus will unfold, why it took so long for Canada to get its citizens out of the country and what happens when these Canadians arrive back home. An aircraft, chartered by the federal government, with 211 Canadians on the manifest is expected to leave Wuhan around 12 p.m. ET on Thursday. As many as 373 Canadians have requested evacuation, but the number, according to officials and senior cabinet ministers, is a moving target. The chartered aircraft will fly to the Canadian military air base in Trenton, Ont.Foreign Affairs Minister François-Philippe Champagne revealed late Wednesday that the U.S. had offered up space for a ""handful"" of Canadians on one of its charter evacuation flights, which is due to leave Wuhan Tianhe International Airport shortly after the Canadian aircraft departs.The American plane will stop in Vancouver ""where Canadian passengers will disembark for onward travel to CFB Trenton, where they will be subject to the same processes as those Canadians travelling on the Canadian flight."" Champagne said. The federal government is considering a second chartered flight should more Canadian request repatriation.Health Minister Patty Hajdu has conceded the federal government was initially caught off guard and had ""a slow start in terms of organizing"" the evacuation plane. ""We didn't have an understanding of the number of people that needed assistance,"" she said.  ""As we communicated more [with people in the region] about the need to register and let us know, our numbers shot up rather dramatically.""PoliticsThe government has only a sketchy idea of the number of Canadians in China's Hubei province, which is the epicentre of the outbreak. Collecting information was also apparently hampered by the absence of a consulate in the area, senior government officials said on background. In addition, the Chinese government is apparently only allowing evacuation flights in and out of Wuhan at night because their own relief and quarantine efforts take place during the day. The Canadian government also said Wednesday that bad weather further delayed the flight. The United States, Japan, South Korea, Jordan, Britain, Portugal, Bangladesh, Egypt, Thailand and Indonesia have all gotten at least evacuation flights out of Wuhan.Hajdu said those countries have not faced the same challenges, mostly because ""they had a better sense"" of where and how many of their citizens were in the affected area.Chinese health authorities are set to screen each individual passenger and no one who is sick — or displays symptoms -— will be allowed to board the chartered aircraft. There will be a six-person Canadian military medical team on-board the aircraft who will conduct further screening and monitor the condition of the passengers.CBC NewsMaj.-Gen. Andrew Downes, the surgeon general of the Canadian Forces, told the House of Commons health committee Wednesday that the team will be wearing masks and protection and will offer the same to evacuees. ""Our medical team that deployed last weekend took with them an extensive array of personal protective equipment, including, masks, gowns gloves, face shields, et cetera,"" Downes testified. ""Should one of the passengers manifest symptoms that would be consistent with coronavirus during the flight, they will be isolated, so much as is possible, in the aircraft and they will be required to wear full protective equipment.""He insisted it will be the same level of protection as one sees in a hospital.The evacuees will be quarantined there for two weeks. Maj.-Gen. Trevor Cadieu, who is in charge of the military's strategic joint staff, told the Commons health committee that individuals and families will have their own quarters at the base's Yukon Lodge and will be sequestered from all military personnel and the outside world.During the quarantine period, ""they'll have an opportunity to move about in that very local area but they will not be mingling,"" Cadieau said.Canada Border Service Agency officials will meet the plane at the ramp upon arrival and Ontario health officials will conduct further medical tests, he said.In addition, if the federal government organizes further flights, Cadieu said the military is ""conducting a stocktaking of all infrastructure accommodations at Canadian Forces bases throughout Canada"" in case Trenton becomes full.   "

""Individuals will have to find ways to occupy themselves with very little movement on the base.""On Sunday night, the government announced that Canadian evacuees from the Chinese province afflicted with the novel coronavirus will be quarantined for two weeks upon their arrival at CFB Trenton, about 170 kilometres east of Toronto.The plane carrying the Canadians arrived at CFB Trenton early Friday. The hangar has been transformed into a processing area, where roped-off lines will guide Canadians to different stations, each equipped with masks and hand sanitizer bottles.Some stations will have red flags, to alert health officials of a suspected case.Anyone with symptoms was not allowed to board the plane in China, but those arriving at the military base who are ill or exhibiting symptoms will be immediately taken to the Ontario Emergency Medical Assistance Team (EMAT) unit section set up in the hangar. The station has two tents, each with isolation units to isolate someone potentially infected with the virus and filter any contaminants from entering the environment.WATCH | Inside CFB Trenton's quarantine zone:The NationalOtherwise, passengers, when they arrive inside the hangar, are greeted with ""Welcome Home"" signs, as they are processed by Canada Border Services Agency officials for immigration.Their health will then be checked, and a number of quarantine officers will be on hand to help assess the passengers.Officials at the Canadian Red Cross station, which included boxes of disposable diapers and teddy bears, will then register the Canadians through an electronic registration system, assess them for their basic needs or any comfort items requested during their 14-day stay.Then it's off to the waiting area, where they will be bused to Yukon Lodge, where the rooms include high-speed wireless internet, cable TV with a DVD player, a fridge and microwave.The base will also be equipped with a microbiology lab, which can swab Canadians to determine whether they have been infected with the virus.  Anyone determined to be very sick will be transported to Belleville or Trenton hospitals. On Thursday evening, hours before the Canadians were expected to arrive, Col. Ryan Deming, Commander of 8 Wing, CFB Trenton, tried to allay any fears residents may have of the risks posed by the Canadians coming from Wuhan. ""Risks to the community remains low,"" Deming said.""We are cognizant of the potential health risks. We are taking the necessary precautions to ensure the safety of our guests.""But area residents interviewed by CBC expressed few concerns about the influx of Canadians on the base.""They're probably set up a lot better than a lot of civilian agencies will be to handle this amount of people with this kind of threat on relatively short notice,"" said Brian Hicks, 57, who used to work on the base.""So now we have to adjust. As a community, we have to adjust.""Colleen Fox said she believes Yukon Lodge is set up well for this kind of situation.""I was kind of proud that our town gets to be involved,"" she said. "

Would I recollect something as crazy as that? Of course I would,"" Lighthizer said. ""This never happened in it for sure. Completely crazy.""Trump on Thursday called the book a ""compilation of lies and made up stories"" intended to make him look bad.

"Face masks provided by AHS are substandard, says group of Alberta doctors | CBC News",A group called #abdocs4patients has sent a letter to the province with concerns about the current supply of face masks being provided by Alberta Health Services.,2020-05-08T00:34:17.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/face-masks-provided-by-ahs-are-substandard-says-group-of-alberta-doctors-1.5560340,"A group of more than 150 Alberta doctors has sent a letter to the province expressing ""grave concerns"" about the current supply of face masks being provided to health-care workers by Alberta Health Services.The group, which calls itself #abdocs4patients, says Vanch disposable medical masks do not fit properly, consistently malfunction and cause skin irritation, nausea and headaches.Spokesperson Dr. John Julyan-Gudgeon said the letter was sent on Thursday to Health Minister Tyler Shandro and Dr. Verna Yiu, president and CEO of AHS.Julyan-Gudgeon thinks the biggest concern is that the masks don't provide adequate personal protection.""They do not have the particle filtration capacity nor the splash protection,"" he said in an interview on Thursday.Alberta health-care workers say new masks don't seal, cause rashes and headachesThe issue of the Vanch masks was first raised by health-care workers in mid-April.At the time, Jitendra Prasad, the AHS official in charge of contracting and procurement, said the masks met clinical standards and any issues had more to do with personal preferences for an older model.Prasad said the province has been buying masks from China for two decades. He said they were tested prior to being purchased.AHS reiterated its stance in a statement to CBC News on Thursday, almost identical to a statement it released on April 22.""All PPE purchased and provided by AHS is approved for medical use and meets health-care standards,"" the Thursday statement said.""AHS has worked with the suppliers to have the nose pieces adjusted and the length of the mask [from nose to chin] increased for a better fit. These changes will be in place for the next shipment to AHS.""Alberta mask issues a matter of personal preference, official saysIn the meantime, AHS recommends that doctors can compress the entire edge of the mask containing the nose piece in a 'W' shape to help the fit across the nose, and adding a face shield for extra protection.AHS says it is confident it can resolve the issues that have been identified and that it has created a quality control group to field test any new models or products.That's not good enough for Julyan-Gudgeon.""The government, in the form AHS media, has stated that they are meeting a standard,"" he said. ""Then when you challenge them on it they send you links as to how to wear the mask … but they seem to shy away from any discussion of the exact performance standards."" Julyan-Gudgeon believes AHS is only focusing on esthetics.""They're not getting the point that the actual protection performance of these masks are, by an established protocol, already substandard,"" he said.He said he wants the government to be more transparent about understanding the standards and then to follow through on delivering those standards."

"Sask., Alberta trade ministers travel to Asia with federal counterpart amid Chinese canola spat | CBC News",China's refusal to buy Canadian canola has led the federal trade minister to take his counterparts from Saskatchewan and Alberta to Asia this week in an effort to strengthen exports in the region.,2019-06-04T20:12:43.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/sask-fed-trade-mission-japan-korea-1.5161831,"Amid a trade dispute with China involving Canadian canola, Saskatchewan's trade minister is in Asia this week in an effort to strengthen the province's exports in the region.Jeremy Harrison is accompanying federal Minister of International Trade Diversification Jim Carr and Alberta Trade Minister Tanya Fir on a week-long trip to Japan and South Korea.Japan is Saskatchewan's third-largest export market, with nearly all exports being agri-food products — including canola seed, non-durum wheat, durum and barley.In 2018, Saskatchewan's exports to Japan were valued at $1.13 billion, the province says.""With Asian markets continuing to import more food every year, it is crucial we promote the safe, reliable and high-quality agri-food products Saskatchewan has to offer,"" Harrison said in a statement Tuesday.  Saskatchewan exports to South Korea were valued at more than $117 million in 2018, the province said. Those exports include canola oil, wheat, malt and oats.""Japan and South Korea remain two of Saskatchewan's most important and valued customers and it is important we strengthen those relationships,"" Harrison said.The ministers are being accompanied by agriculture producer groups.In May, Harrison and Premier Scott Moe said the federal government had invited them on a potential trip to Asia.In recent months, China has sent non-compliance notifications to Richardson International Ltd. and Viterra Inc., two major Canadian exporters of canola seed.China said customs inspectors said they found ""dangerous pests"" in shipments from Canada. Canadian officials have refuted that claim.China represents 40 per cent of Canada's canola seed export market.""Our trade mission to Japan and South Korea is part of our ongoing effort to sell high-quality Canadian canola and other agricultural products to alternative markets,"" a spokesperson for Carr said on Tuesday.Japan and South Korea represent Canada's fourth- and sixth-largest export markets, according to the federal government.""We are focused on opening doors, providing on-the-ground support so that companies can compete and succeed on the international playing field, and creating business-to-business connections for Canadian producers, companies and provinces looking to expand into these thriving Asian markets,"" said Carr.Back in March, the Saskatchewan government lobbied Ottawa to make changes to the Advance Payments Program —  a federal program that provides agricultural producers with access to low-interest cash advances.Some 43,000 canola producers across Canada currently face market challenges and dropping prices after China, their largest seed buyer, stopped buying the seed from Canada.The federal government went ahead with the changes on May 1. The maximum interest-free loan available for canola producers increased to $500,000 from $100,000.On May 24, Saskatchewan Minister of Agriculture David Marit said the implementation of the payments was not happening fast enough.""The response that we got back is that it's going to be delayed even more. Seeding is well in full swing. We're well over 70 per cent of the crop in the ground and farmers have bills to pay,"" Marit said.The canola blockade was preceded by events unrelated to international agri-food trade.A diplomatic dispute between China and Canada was sparked by the arrest of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou in Vancouver last year, at the request of American authorities.Two Canadian men, Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, were detained in China in December after being accused of spying. The two were picked up separately, shortly after Meng was arrested. They were formally arrested in May."

Wedding planners warning of delays due to coronavirus | CBC News,Wedding experts in Ottawa are warning clients about potential difficulties in receiving items for their big day because of the coronavirus outbreak.,2020-02-21T09:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/wedding-experts-in-ottawa-warn-of-delays-due-to-coronavirus-1.5469931,"Wedding experts in Ottawa are warning clients about potential difficulties in receiving items for their big day because of the coronavirus outbreak.Some bridal stores that rely on Chinese suppliers say they're starting to experience delays in receiving stock, and  that could worsen if shipments out of China are further restricted.""In past years, at this time in February, there would be no issue for us to order [custom dresses],"" said wedding consultant Danica Labonte.""Now, we're really recommending that people who are getting married in August and September do purchase off the rack."" Labonte, who works at Dominique Levesque Bridal in Ottawa, said custom dresses normally take up to six months to arrive, but since the outbreak she's added three to four weeks to that estimate.""[Our suppliers are] doing the best that they can, and they're definitely communicating with us ... but at this point we know very little information,"" she said.CBC News Ottawa""All we can do is reassure clients and keep moving forward.""Speaking at the Economic Club of Calgary earlier this month, Finance Minister Bill Morneau admitted the coronavirus would have ripple effects throughout the world because of China's massive economic footprint. Experts say the full effects of the coronavirus on Canadian businesses will become more evident in the coming months.""Everybody is a little worried and a little bit stressed,"" said Ottawa wedding planner Shannon Kennedy.  Kennedy said vendors that provide clients with things like furniture, linens, exotic flowers and even paper goods are feeling the effects of the coronavirus outbreak in China.""[It's all] trickling down from third-party manufacturers to larger national suppliers, and now our local suppliers,"" she said.Kennedy said given the circumstances, her focus right now is to help manage clients' expectations, and to plan weddings accordingly.""With everything that's happening globally, it's important to know that we might not get everything that we want, but it's still going to be amazing."""
Going against the grain: How the Chinese canola ban is affecting Manitoba | CBC News,"When the most populous nation on Earth suddenly decides it no longer covets Canadian canola, there's obviously more going on than the alleged trans-oceanic trade in unwanted organisms.",2019-03-27T10:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/canola-manitoba-economy-1.5071872,"When the most populous nation on Earth suddenly decides it no longer covets Canadian canola, there's obviously more going on than the alleged trans-oceanic trade in unwanted organisms.China is refusing to import Canadian canola, claiming unspecified creatures are crawling among our oilseeds.First, it revoked Richardson International's canola export permit, prompting a wave of consternation about potential retaliation for the December arrest of Huawei chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou.Then China claimed Viterra's canola shipments are also contaminated, further fuelling fears one of Canada's top agricultural exports could become a casualty of the volatile relationship between the Asian superpower and the United States, which had requested Meng's arrest.The stakes in this dispute are high in Manitoba, which covers more acres with canola than any other crop and counts on canola production and processing worth about $4.2 billion every year, according to the Canola Council of Canada.But for now, the province appears to be viewing the impasse more like a game of brinksmanship than as a straight-up trade dispute.This is partly because China has raised concerns about Canadian canola before, demanding higher standards to prevent the spread of the fungal disease blackleg.It's also because China has been buying more Canadian canola every year to fuel its voracious food-production industries.""We do know they need our canola and they will have to come back with cap in hand,"" Manitoba Agriculture Minister Ralph Eichler said in an interview on Tuesday.He reiterated his desire to take part in a trade mission to China, something Prime Minister Justin Trudeau confirmed he's considering in an effort to end the Sino-Canadian canola tiff.""Certainly we realize that we don't have a strong relationship with China. Obviously if we did, they wouldn't be doing this to us,"" Eichler said.While Canada is no stranger to trade disputes, the Chinese ban on canola imports bears little resemblance to the mundane likes of of the softwood lumber battles with the U.S. or the more recent Trump-era aluminum tariffs.For starters, there's the belief China is attempting to teach Canada a lesson for doing the diplomatic bidding of the United States.""Things are so globally interconnected that a major conflict between two big players is going to have downstream effects,"" said Paul Larson, a professor of supply-chain management at the Asper School of Business at the University of Manitoba.""It seemed like for years there would be disputes between nations, but they wouldn't really go so deeply into trying to harm each other with things like trade trade embargoes [or] trade sanctions.""The dispute also strikes observers as illogical, given that Canadian canola producers and Chinese buyers need each other.Canada is the world's largest canola producer and by far the top exporter. China, meanwhile, accounts for more Canadian canola purchases than the next three markets combined: the United States, Mexico and Japan.Canada simply can't absorb the loss of Chinese market, said Jim Everson, president of the Canola Council of Canada.""Our domestic processors are at or near capacity in the work that they're doing already,"" Everson said at his office in Winnipeg.""Certainly the industry will do everything they can to utilize canola through the processing side but, you know, it's very difficult to replace over four million tonnes of canola that would otherwise be going to China.""Manitoba nonetheless has plans to encourage more canola processing, Agriculture Minister Eichler said. The canola dispute with China also highlights the need to diversify Manitoba's crop cover, he said.That won't happen overnight. Manitoba farmers who were planning to grow canola this summer are not likely to change their plans six weeks away from the mid-May seeding, said Starbuck-area farmer Charles Fossay, who serves as president of Manitoba Canola Growers.While canola prices have dropped about $20 a tonne, that isn't enough to convince agricultural producers to consider other crops, Fossay said.Eichler said it's too soon to consider what effect this dispute could have on Manitoba's bottom line. It's more important to simply end it, he insisted.""This is more of a political ploy on behalf of the Chinese government,"" Eichler said.A longer-term concern is the global reputation of a commodity that was named after Canada. The sooner the Chinese claims about canola quality are put to bed, the better, Everson said.""We need to address that really quickly anyway, because we don't want a black mark in other global markets around the quality of Canadian canola."""

Coronavirus fears putting a damper on cruise bookings | CBC News,Some local travel agencies are reporting a decline in cruise vacation bookings and an increase in cancellations over fears caused by the coronavirus outbreak.,2020-02-20T16:00:11.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/coronavirus-cruise-ship-bookings-1.5469283,"Some local travel agencies are reporting a decline in cruise vacation bookings and an increase in cancellations over fears caused by the coronavirus outbreak.Katherine Le, president of Ottawa-based Eastview Travel, said about 15 per cent of her cruise vacation bookings have been cancelled or postponed in the past three weeks.""People are worried about what's going on if they go on a cruise ship,"" Le said. ""They worry about getting infected with the coronavirus.""The outbreak originated in Wuhan, China, and has since infected over 74,000 people in that country and another 924 worldwide, according to an update Wednesday from the World Health Organization (WHO).That includes passengers who were aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship in the Japanese port of Yokohama.The decline in cruise ship bookings comes as Canadian airlines have cancelled most flights to China and the government has issued a travel warning for the country, exacerbating the situation for travel agents like Le who focus on Asia.A total of 621 passengers from the Diamond Princess are now infected, including 57 Canadians. It's the largest cluster of cases outside China, the WHO has said.Passengers who tested negative for coronavirus began to disembark Wednesday after a two-week quarantine that infectious disease experts have criticized for doing more harm than good.Le said her customers have expressed fears of being caught in a similar situation.""When you get on a cruise ship that means you get trapped in there, and you cannot leave,"" Le said.In another case, the MS Westerdam sailed from port to port in Asia seeking to offload passengers, only to be denied at each one.Finally, the government of Cambodia allowed it to dock in Sihanoukville.One passenger who disembarked tested positive for the respiratory illness caused by the virus, which is officially known as COVID-19.Wen Jin, sales manager at Midearth Travel, which specializes in all-inclusive packages to China, said anxiety among potential cruise-goers extends beyond those travelling to Asia.Jin also organizes flight and cruise packages to the Caribbean in partnership with Sunwing Airlines. She said she hasn't received any new bookings for cruises since Jan. 15.Instead, Jin said she's been dealing mainly with cancellations and refunds, which has been eating into her commission.""I work double,"" Jin said. ""One time it's to buy the cruise, the other time it's to refund the cruise. So I work two hours, but I get nothing.""Jin said one family who had a cruise booked for Feb. 8 leaving from Miami, Fla., cancelled after they heard about an incident on a New Jersey cruise ship.In that case, the Royal Caribbean's Anthem of the Seas was delayed at its departure port over fears that four people had coronavirus.While the people later tested negative, the scare was enough for the family to decide the risk wasn't worth it, Jin said.""They are afraid off being stopped inside of the ship, so they cancelled the trip,"" she said.Jin said other families were forced to cancel and refund their trips when some cruise lines adopted policies barring people with Chinese, Hong Kong or Macau passports from their ships.The situation is not the same at all agencies.Mohinder Hona, general manager of Honda Travel, said his cruise vacation business has not been impacted so far.""Obviously, that is a concern right now, but it hasn't really stopped people from booking cruises because everyone knows that this is not something that is going to last forever,"" Honda said.Honda pointed out that people often book cruises months, if not years in advance.A spokesperson for the Association of Canadian Travel Agencies said the industry group is in the process of surveying its members to assess trends in light of the coronavirus outbreak, but won't have results until next week."
Global fossil fuel production on track to bust Paris climate targets | CBC News,"The world's major fossil fuel producers are set to bust global environmental goals with excessive coal, oil and gas extraction in the next decade, the United Nations and research groups said on Wednesday in the latest warning over climate crisis.",2019-11-20T12:38:04.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/fossil-fuel-overshoot-1.5365974,"The world's major fossil fuel producers are set to bust global environmental goals with excessive coal, oil and gas extraction in the next decade, the United Nations and research groups said on Wednesday in the latest warning over climate crisis.The report reviewed specific plans from 10 countries, including Canada, China and the United States, as well as trends for the rest of the world and estimated that global fossil fuel production by 2030 would be at levels between 50 to 120 per cent over Paris Agreement targets.Ahead of next week's <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/EmissionsGap?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#EmissionsGap</a> Report, <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/ProductionGap?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#ProductionGap</a> Report finds that the world is on track to produce far more coal, oil &amp; gas than would be consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C or 2°C.<br><br>This makes <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/ClimateAction?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#ClimateAction</a> goals much harder to reach: <a href=""https://t.co/xED8xd05rR"">https://t.co/xED8xd05rR</a> <a href=""https://t.co/vUGpK83uSH"">pic.twitter.com/vUGpK83uSH</a>Under that 2015 global pact, nations committed to a long-term goal of limiting the average temperature increase to within 1.5 to 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.But by 2030, global planned production would lead to 39 gigatonnes (Gt) of carbon dioxide emissions, 53 per cent higher than what is needed to reduce temperature rises to 2 C and 21 Gt, or 120 per cent, more than is needed for 1.5 C, the report said.""The world's energy supply remains dominated by coal, oil and gas, driving emission levels that are inconsistent with climate goals,"" said United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) executive director Inger Andersen.As well as UNEP, the report was produced by the Stockholm Environment Institute, the International Institute for Sustainable Development, the Overseas Development Institute, and the CICERO Centre for International Climate and Environmental Research and Climate Analytics.It created a new metric called ""the fossil fuel production gap,"" highlighting the difference between rising production and the decline needed to restrict global warming.The gap was largest for coal, with countries planning to produce 150 per cent more in 2030 than would be consistent with limiting warming to 2 C, and 280 per cent more than would limit warming to 1.5 C.""The continued expansion of fossil fuel production — and the widening of the global production gap — is underpinned by a combination of ambitious national plans, government subsidies to producers, and other forms of public finance,"" the report said.The report notes that some countries, such as Canada, the U.S., and Russia, appear to be using export markets to justify major increases in fossil fuel production. Others, such as India and China, are scaling up production to limit or end imports.""The net result could be significant over-investment, increasing the risk of stranded assets, workers, and communities, as well as locking in a higher emissions trajectory,"" the report said.The report precedes UNEP's annual ""emissions gap"" report, due next week, which assesses whether countries' emissions cut policies are enough."
Chinese students trying to recoup thousands of dollars from Canadian homestay providers they say misled them | CBC News,A group of students from China and their parents say they're trying to recoup thousands of dollars from a family of homestay providers in Canada who promised a level of service they didn't deliver.,2020-01-06T09:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/international-students-china-homestay-toronto-british-columbia-1.5402622,"Several Chinese international students are warning others about a pair of homestay providers thousands of kilometres apart who they allege are taking advantage of young newcomers moving to Canada for high school. CBC News has spoken with seven students from China and their parents who allege the mother-daughter pair lied about the living conditions in their homes in Toronto and Burnaby, B.C., and broke the terms of their room-and-board contracts.The students described similar experiences of moving into a situation that was not as advertised, including seeing their hosts eat steak after feeding the teens hot dogs and leftovers and discovering that what they had been told would be a short walk to and from school would actually take hours each day.Many of the students are now trying to recoup thousands of dollars after moving out early.""I want my money back, and I don't want any other students to go through what my daughter did,"" said Li Limei, the mother of a teenager who lived at the homestay in Toronto. In the summer of 2018, Li started scouring the internet for housing for her 15-year-old daughter, Angel An, who was to start Grade 10 at Loretto Abbey Catholic Secondary School in Toronto that fall. ""I wanted Angel to get a head start at a Canadian high school,"" Li said in Mandarin, during a video interview on the WeChat app from her home in Beijing. She hoped finishing high school in Toronto would boost her child's chances of getting accepted into a Canadian university.Angel was preparing to join the annual influx of tens of thousands of Chinese students to Canada whose parents share that hope.In 2019, there were almost 70,000 Chinese international students of elementary school, high school and university age in Canada — up by about 10,000 from five years ago, according to Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada.The sharp increase has fuelled the business of housing students.Li easily found housing for Angel through WeChat, a popular place for Chinese families, homestay providers and settlement agencies that help people find homestays to make connections. She said a woman named Fiona Liu saw her post to the homestay group and offered to host Angel. Li said she made it clear she did not want her teen daughter sharing a house with male students and the home had to be pet-free because of her daughter's allergies to cats and dogs. ""Fiona promised she only accepts girls, that there were no male students,"" said Li. The contract Li signed stipulated there would be no pets. Li was satisfied when she got a first-hand look inside the detached three-storey house when she helped Angel move in August 2018. CBC News reviewed Li's rental agreement, which showed she paid $20,800 for a year's rent before Angel moved in.Within a month, Angel called her mother to say Liu had a dog and a male student had moved in. Li immediately contacted the homestay provider saying her daughter couldn't live with male students or dogs. She said Liu didn't listen and even brought home a second dog a few months later. Angel's mom said her daughter's asthma flared up and she developed allergic dermatitis.Because of the stress of her living situation, Angel dropped out of school in May and moved back to China, four months before her homestay contract was up.""I regret it so much,"" said Li. ""It really affected my daughter."" Li has since been trying to get about $8,000 in rent and deposit money back because she argues Liu broke the terms of the contract. Despite trying to contact Liu multiple times, Li said the homeowner has not answered her.""To this day, she hasn't returned my money,"" she said. CBC News reached out to Liu through email and phone calls, but she has not responded. On a visit to Liu's Toronto house in October, CBC spoke with several Chinese international students who confirmed she was hosting them.A teenage girl who had been living there for four months said her experience has been positive. However, her male housemate's room does not have a door. She said there's just a carpet hanging over it. On a subsequent visit to the house in December, a man who several students confirmed is Liu's husband, spoke with CBC News outside the house. He refused to identify himself or confirm whether Liu or any international students live there. But, when asked why Liu would allow male students into the house when she had said there would only be females, he said such an arrangement would be nonsensical in the real world. ""Can you segregate men and women on the TTC, for example?"" he said in Mandarin, referring to Toronto's public transit system. The seven families with whom CBC spoke found accommodation for their children either with Liu in Toronto or with her daughter, Tiff Lei, in Burnaby, B.C.All seven have attempted to get refunds — that add up to about $40,000 — but they allege the pair either stall, send cheques that bounce or don't respond at all.CBC News tried to call, email and text Lei about the allegations. The calls went to voice mail each time. A response to a text said it was the wrong number, even though the families verified the number belongs to Lei. Oswald Li, 19, said he's trying to get back his $1,400 damage deposit from Lei. He and another Chinese student lived with her in Burnaby for six months before moving out in February 2019. He described the experience as a ""nightmare."" He said he was promised three nutritious meals a day but was often fed beef jerky, french fries and hot dogs. He said much of the food wasn't fresh. Sometimes, after he finished eating, he would see Lei enjoying a steak for dinner, he said. Photos on a now-defunct website advertising the homestays in Toronto and Burnaby showed photos of chicken, cake and crab.When asked about the quality of the food, the man at the Toronto home told CBC News, ""You can't eat seafood every day.""After he moved out, Oswald Li said Lei gave him a cheque equalling the amount of his damage deposit. He said it bounced.""It was frustrating,"" he said. The parents, children and settlement agencies with whom CBC News spoke found each other by chance on WeChat and soon discovered they'd had similar experiences dealing with the same two people in Canada. They discovered Liu went by different names in her communication with different families. To Li Limei, she was ""Fiona Liu"" or ""Liu Jia."" To others, she was ""Gao Ling Qian."" CBC News confirmed through property records that both properties in Ontario and B.C. are owned by the same family. The director of a Beijing-based agency that helped settle Oswald Li and some other students in Canada told CBC News he feels betrayed by both the mother and daughter, with whom he placed students.""I feel angry, really, really angry. The students are young, and [Liu and Lei] lied to them,"" said Li Peng, director of CAEL Education Consulting, from his office in Beijing. He said Lei gave the families an address of a home closer to the students' school, but when they arrived in Burnaby, the teens were taken to a homestay farther away. In Toronto, Liu told some students their home was a five- to 15-minute walk to their schools. When they arrived, they realized the walk was closer to 90 minutes. All the students CBC News spoke with moved out early but not all have returned to China.Li Peng said his company and another settlement agency based in Shijiazhuang, China, that also worked with Lei in Burnaby, reimbursed the students themselves.He said he got back $9,000 from Liu after suggesting he would send friends of his to her house to collect.Both companies say they are still owed thousands of dollars.""We trusted [them],"" he said. ""It was our mistake.""Some of the parents who spoke with CBC News are considering legal action, but say it's tough because they live in China and are not able to navigate Canada's legal system from there. Li Peng said the family took advantage of young students who are alone in the country and don't have a support network or knowledge of how the legal system works. ""They don't have any other relatives in Canada,"" he said. ""They don't know how to protect themselves."" "
Trump sets White House meeting with Chinese trade negotiator | CBC News,President Donald Trump said he would meet at the White House on Friday with the leader of the Chinese negotiating team now in Washington for the latest round of talks aimed at ending a 15-month trade battle that is weighing on the global economy.,2019-10-10T12:53:56.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/us-china-trade-talks-resume-1.5315934,"President Donald Trump said he would meet at the White House on Friday with the leader of the Chinese negotiating team now in Washington for the latest round of talks aimed at ending a 15-month trade battle that is weighing on the global economy.With expectations for this week's talks low, Trump tweeted Thursday: ""Big day of negotiations with China. They want to make a deal, but do I?""Chinese Vice Premier Liu He is leading the delegation in negotiations with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. The 13th round of talks began Thursday.The world's two biggest economies are deadlocked over U.S. allegations that China steals technology and pressures foreign companies to hand over trade secrets as part of a sharp-elbowed drive to become a world leader in advanced industries such as robotics and self-driving cars.Under Trump, the United States has slapped tariffs on more than $360 billion US worth of Chinese imports and is planning to hit another $160 billion Dec. 15. That would extend import taxes to virtually everything China ships to the United States. China has hit back by targeting about $120 billion in U.S. goods, focusing on farm products.The high cost of the tariffs and uncertainty over when and how the trade war will end have taken an economic toll, especially on manufacturing companies. A private survey last week found that U.S. factory output had dropped to its lowest level since 2009, when the economy was in the grips of a deep recession.""Both sides have been losing, and so has the global economy,"" said Myron Brilliant, head of international affairs at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.Brilliant, who spoke with both delegations before the meetings, sounded optimistic about the chances of progress, noting that Beijing has stepped up purchases of U.S. soybeans in a goodwill gesture. He said he hoped a productive meeting would persuade the Trump administration to call off or postpone plans next Tuesday to hike tariffs on $250 billion of Chinese imports from 25 per cent to 30 per cent.""We all know we can't afford a further escalation of the trade war,"" Brilliant said.Still, Beijing has been reluctant to make the kind of substantive policy reforms that would satisfy Washington. Doing so likely would require scaling back the Chinese leaders' aspirations to technological dominance they see as crucial to their country's future prosperity."
Doctors share concerns as ICUs brace for influx of patients due to coronavirus resurgence | CBC News,Intensive care physicians and nurses share their concerns as they brace for an influx of patients that threatens to overwhelm hospitals due to the resurgence of the coronavirus and the flu.,2020-10-29T08:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/covid-19-icu-canada-fall-1.5780468,"Intensive care physicians and nurses share their concerns as they brace for an influx of patients that threatens to overwhelm hospitals due to the resurgence of the coronavirus and the flu.When Canadians successfully flattened epidemic curves during the summer, the goal was to prevent hospitals and intensive care units from facing a crush of too many patients with COVID-19 all at once. Health officials wanted to avoid what happened in hospitals in New York City, where refrigerated trailers were used as temporary morgues.But the recent surge of new coronavirus cases in all provinces beyond Atlantic Canada has already thwarted surgery plans and led to the cancellation of surgeries such as hip replacements at one hospital in Toronto and postponements in Edmonton.Dr. Bram Rochwerg, an associate professor at McMaster University and critical care lead at the Juravinski Hospital in Hamilton, anticipates a surge of patients with COVID-19, and he worries they won't be able to accommodate them all as more surgeries resume.Unlike in the spring, beds and crucial staffing need to be reserved for medical and surgery patients, too. Traditionally, autumn in hospitals means scrambling for health-care workers such as nurses and respiratory therapists to backfill those sick with the cold and flu or who need to stay home to care for sick children.""We're all worried about it,"" Rochwerg said. ""You see the provincial [COVID-19] numbers creep up day by day. We see that critical care numbers [of ICU patients] creep up.""Rochwerg said that fortunately, the number of critically ill patients in Hamilton is currently in the single digits but that the trend is headed in the wrong direction. The challenge, he said, is to find a balance between adding restrictions to protect vulnerable populations such as residents in long-term care homes while preserving crucial aspects of society.Rochwerg also pointed to several lessons physicians worldwide have learned to help take better care of patients critically ill with COVID-19 during the resurgence.""We should treat them like we would any other patient,"" he said. ""Sometimes, you just need [to insert] a breathing tube.""When patients are on a ventilator, it takes the skilled hands of four to six hospital staff, including a respiratory therapist who regularly checks the breathing set up and tubing to ensure the airway is protected, as well as nurses to safely turn or ""prone"" them onto the stomach to improve ventilation.WATCH | Why trend in COVID-19 resurgence is concerning:NewsThe importance of getting patients up and out of bed, including those on ventilators when possible, as well as excellent nursing care and other day-to-day supportive care can't be minimized.""Supportive care is not the sexy part of it, but it's so crucial,"" Rochwerg said.It gives patients' bodies time to heal themselves, he said.Patty Tamlin, a registered nurse working in critical care at a hospital in Toronto's east end, said she's also concerned about the coming cold-and-flu season.""One of the biggest concerns is you may be overrun by patients,"" Tamlin said.Her message to Canadians? ""Tell everyone to get their flu shot.""In the spring, the Ontario government created more beds for patients needing long-term ventilated care at a rehabilitation hospital. Even if administrators find more space for more beds, adding temp agency nurses can only go so far, she said.""It's going to be a long time,"" Tamlin said. ""It's fatiguing … to have this constantly on our head all the time about COVID on top of our regular work.""Experience, though, has helped ICU staff to prepare for a resurgence of COVID-19 patients.""The more you do something, the more comfortable you are with going in and out of a room,"" for example, to perform CPR during a ""protected code blue"" for cardiac arrest when wearing full personal protective equipment, which can be exhausting. The masks, gowns and gloves need to be donned and removed carefully to avoid health-care workers contaminating themselves.Dr. Eddy Fan, medical director of the Extracorporeal Life Support (ECLS) program at Toronto's University Health Network, said the increase in COVID-19 cases so far is ""manageable.""Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is like an artificial heart and lung machine to support the sickest patients. People with COVID-19 who were intubated at hospitals across Ontario and didn't improve with conventional therapy were transported to Toronto General for ECMO. Still, Fan said, ""We're going to need to brace ourselves for another potential flood of very sick patients.""During the spring, patients were transferred to Toronto General, but family members could not visit. Fan said cutting off patients from their relatives harmed morale not only among loved ones, but it pained people working in the hospital, too.But influenza season also typically brings patients with lung failure who may need ECMO.""Their families ask questions like 'they're dying of the flu?'"" Fan said. ""COVID is no different as a viral infection. We see even young patients come with very severe lung failure requiring ECMO.""During Toronto's first wave of COVID-19, the team successfully treated a 22-year-old with ECMO.While respiratory failure from COVID-19 can resemble that of the flu, doctors say the scale is much larger.Dr. Gregory Haljan, head of Surrey Memorial Hospital's critical care department in British Columbia, said influenza has vaccines and medical treatments to shorten symptoms and improve death rates. COVID-19 doesn't, aside from corticosteroids for severe cases.When Haljan and his co-authors across the Lower Mainland looked at 117 people with COVID-19 who were admitted to ICU between Feb. 20 and April 17, they found the mortality rate ranged from one in six to one in 10.In comparison, the first studies from China and Italy showed mortality rates as high as one in two or one in three.Haljan credited having time to prepare, Dr. Bonnie Henry's ""outstanding"" leadership as the provincial health officer, the support of British Columbians, hard work and luck.""We never got overwhelmed,"" he said.To prevent being overwhelmed, Haljan said the hospital and its health region focused on basics, including:""It can be a challenge in that things change very, very slowly because safety is our primary focus,"" said Haljan, who works at one of the hospitals caring for among the highest volume of patients in the emergency department, according to the Canadian Institute for Health Information.""Research is how we keep change safe.""Haljan said that includes research not only on vaccines and drugs but also measuring patterns and assessing them in areas such as delivering health services."

Others, such as India and China, are scaling up production to limit or end imports.""The net result could be significant over-investment, increasing the risk of stranded assets, workers, and communities, as well as locking in a higher emissions trajectory,"" the report said.The report precedes UNEP's annual ""emissions gap"" report, due next week, which assesses whether countries' emissions cut policies are enough."

Four swimmers with Artistic Swimming Canada break silence about allegedly toxic environment | CBC News,Four members of Canada's artistic swimming team say there is a toxic environment at the Montreal training centre.,2020-10-19T22:23:25.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/swimmers-break-silence-artistic-swimming-canada-allegations-1.5768537,"Four members of Canada's artistic swimming team, training in Montreal, are speaking out about what they call a toxic environment.Last month, allegations of abuse and harassment from swimmers and people outside the program led to the shutdown of the senior national artistic swimming team's training centre, pending a review by an external firm.Due to their fear of reprisals, Radio-Canada has agreed to protect the swimmers' identities and to refer to them as Caroline, Sarah, Patricia and Rose.""It's been going on for too long within that organization,"" said Caroline. ""There is a toxic environment in artistic swimming.""According to the swimmers, the alleged incident that sparked last month's shutdown was troubling to several athletes.During a conversation with team members, head coach Gabor Szauder is said to have made what were qualified as racist and hateful remarks.""He was talking about what's happening in China, the Black Lives Matter movement and Muslim people,"" said Rose.""He said all Muslims were extremists,"" said Patricia. ""And then he added: 'When is the last time you saw a white person crash a plane?'""When one of the swimmers confronted him about the comment, Szauder allegedly became verbally aggressive.""He answered: 'This is a free country. I can say whatever I want. Who are you to tell me what hate speech is? Are you God?'""Another swimmer, Sion Ormond, isn't surprised by these events. She says she retired two months ago because, amongst other reasons, the atmosphere at the training centre had become unbearable.""The abuse that I witnessed regularly at the pool — It was just something that I did not want to be a part of anymore,"" she said.Ormond claims she and some of her teammates were victims of verbal abuse last year in China, during a competition.""He said that if we kept swimming like that, he would hit us so hard, we wouldn't know what happened,"" she added.Those comments were allegedly addressed to substitutes with the entire team present after a pre-competition warm-up deemed inadequate by the head coach.""Maybe it was like ten minutes before our competition swim,"" said Rose. ""And there were various adults who were there that witnessed what was said.""The coach apparently explained his comments after the fact, but the swimmers say they were not satisfied.""He just said that we all misunderstood what he had said and that he was going to hit us really hard with a hard workout,"" explained Patricia.According to the swimmers, Szauder would often zero in on one athlete to pick on.Patricia recalls one incident in Hawaii during training camp.""There was a girl that was publicly shamed for her weight, in front of the whole team. The staff was there. It was made clear to us that she was being publicly shamed. He verbalized that to us,"" said Patricia.""I felt sick listening to the conversation,"" Rose said. ""It was a really inappropriate way to handle that type of subject.""Ultimately, the swimmers say these types of incidents became a burden, affecting the mood at the centre. They say Szauder is prone to mood swings and can get carried away, causing tears and anxiety.""There's been times when he's yelled at girls to the point that they have panic attacks in the pool, in the gym,"" Patricia said.""And then he will continue to yell at them and harass them and swear at them. He will call them babies and tell them to stop crying, to compose themselves.""The coach is also alleged to have made sexist comments on more than one occasion.""He told us that girls should learn how to cook and clean, to take care of our men, or else they won't want us,"" Sarah said. ""And that was all men looked for in a woman.""They also say Szauder made comments of a sexual nature.Ormond recalls one incident that took place in Prince George, B.C..""He said: 'Sion, zip up your hoodie before I get too excited,"" Ormond said. ""It was in front of multiple athletes. This is a 47-year-old man.""Ormond is emotional as she recounts what happened. She claims she only found the courage to tell her parents about it after her retirement.""I knew how inappropriate that comment was, that it never should've been said and I was scared,"" she said. ""I was afraid of what my dad would either say or do. I was afraid he would get involved and I would be perceived as a troublemaker.""The four swimmers are critical of Canada Artistic Swimming for not taking the situation seriously enough, when incidents were reported.Caroline says she often heard the same thing.""We were constantly told: 'You know, he comes from Eastern Europe.'""""They would often meet with us after the fact to tell us we weren't resilient enough and could not deal with anxiety and stress in training situations,"" said Patricia. ""It only made us more and more fearful to report it.""Canada Artistic Swimming declined Radio-Canada Sports' interview requests, citing the ongoing review that is being carried out by an outside firm.In a written statement, coach Szauder denied the allegations. He says he is confident that the report will ultimately negate any sort of misconduct on his part.The four swimmers say if nothing changes, they will seriously consider following Ormond's lead and retiring — with the next Olympic Games less than a year away."

What does Venezuela's pursuit of Beijing's money mean for the Americas? | CBC News,"Venezuela wants to borrow money from China to help with its economic and political crisis. But China has a pattern of predatory lending, demanding ports, natural resource concessions and other sacrifices of sovereignty from debtor nations. Is the Maduro regime about to give away the farm to ensure its own survival?",2018-09-15T08:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/venezuela-china-beijing-maduro-economy-support-1.4824112,"Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro took his exhausted country by surprise on Wednesday by boarding a flight to China.The visit — widely believed to be a pitch by Maduro's fiscally-crippled government for a loan — is likely to sound alarms in capitals around the hemisphere as governments try to guess what Venezuela is offering China and what China's motives might be for lending money to a country that can't pay its debts now.Beijing knows about Venezuela's solvency crisis better than most. Three years ago, China turned off the credit taps after lending Venezuela more than US$50 billion. It later had to grant the Latin nation a grace period for repayment.Venezuela watchers say that if China is reopening those taps, it can only be in return for far-reaching concessions, leading some to ask whether Beijing is about to establish its first real beachhead here in the Americas.""At this stage of the collapse of not only the Venezuelan economy, but also the regime, I believe that Maduro is ready to sell the farm at any price,"" said Diego Arria, Venezuela's former permanent representative to the UN, now exiled in New York. ""There is no limit to what he can surrender to the Chinese at this stage.""Maduro seemed unconcerned about his hosts' intentions as he toured Mao's mausoleum on Friday. ""We've come to render homage to the Great Helmsman Mao Zedong. I feel very moved remembering one of the great founders of our multipolar 21st century, without hegemonic empires that blackmail, that dominate,"" Maduro said in comments broadcast by Venezuela's official VTV network.When China, flush with hard currency from exports, emerged as a big lender to developing nations, it was welcomed by many as offering an alternative to institutions controlled by Washington and former colonial powers.But the borrowers soon found that China has nothing to learn from the debt hegemons of the past when it comes to blackmailing and dominating cash-poor countries.Last December, Sri Lanka handed over Hambantota — its most modern port — to Chinese state-controlled firms. The surrender came after years of the island nation struggling to make payments on high-interest loans from China.Across the Indian Ocean, some Zambians speak of China as the new colonial power. This week, their government had to deny publicly it's in talks to turn over its national broadcaster, its national electrical company and international airport to Chinese creditors.The U.S. government believes that China is interested in using predatory lending and port investments to expand its footprint in the Americas, with the leftist alliance of Venezuela, Cuba, Bolivia, Nicaragua and El Salvador as its entry point.El Salvador's government has hinted it intends to invite China to develop its Pacific port of La Union, prompting a warning from U.S. Ambassador Jean Manes in July:""They are trying to find weak spots in the region, where they can make these kinds of arrangements. We are concerned that it is not only investment in a port, but then they want to do something with their military and they want to expand Chinese influence in the region.""With a population weakened by hunger and a corrupt government that seems willing to go to great lengths to remain in power, no country in the hemisphere presents as many opportunities for China's debt-trap diplomacy as Venezuela.Venezuela's soil contains two things China needs: the world's largest proven oil reserves and abundant coltan, a mineral used in smartphones.""Venezuela has given so much already to the Chinese,"" said Arria, ""not only in oil concessions, but in mining. A concession of the Venezuelan ports is also a potential giveaway.""Arria, a diplomat who served as president of the United Nations Security Council in 1992, said the Chinese would never have provoked the U.S. by seeking a military presence in this hemisphere in the past. Now, he's not so sure.""I think they have taken the temperature of the area, and what other countries might do. There's no doubt they're getting bolder.""Venezuelan economist Diego Moya-Ocampos is chief analyst for the Americas at the London-based risk consultancy firm IHS. He said Venezuela is caught in a downward spiral: it lacks the money to keep up its oil infrastructure, and falling oil production in turn means less money coming in.From about three million barrels a day at the turn of the century, Venezuelan production has fallen to a 60-year low of 1.2 million, mostly because of corrupt and incompetent management.China is already entitled to take 375,000 barrels a day of Venezuelan oil as payment on existing debts.""If things keep going the way they're going, they will close the year below one million barrels a day. So Maduro is desperate to achieve a deal. The administration is surviving day by day,"" Moya-Ocampos said.""China now has become Venezuela's lender of last resort, and the future of Maduro's regime depends on which stance the Chinese take.""One thing is certain, said Moya-Ocampos: ""(The Chinese are) going to make sure they're going to be paid.""China's cooperation with the Venezuelan government extends beyond loans. It's also sharing its expertise in the technology of totalitarianism.Venezuela is too cash-strapped and chaotic to mimic Beijing's Orwellian system of mass facial recognition, but China has helped it to develop a new digitized Carnet de la Patria (""Fatherland"" ID card) that the state uses to control its citizens.""The system of the Carnet de la Patria is the same as the 'libreta' (ration book) in Cuba and in many communist systems to control access to food,"" said Venezuelan-Canadian human rights activist Alessandra Polga.""It's coercion. If you're not registered under the carnet you can't work, you can't get your pension, you can't even fill your car. Everything is connected to the same database.""One factor might give the Chinese pause, said Moya-Ocampos — the prospect of never getting their money back.""The opposition have warned that according to Article 150 of the constitution, any strategic arrangement or new loan needs to be approved by Venezuela's legislature,"" he said. ""If not, then if in the future the opposition takes control, there is no guarantee they would pay back.""Venezuela's opposition wrested control of the country's National Assembly in the 2015 election with a ""supermajority"" that would have allowed it to overrule Maduro. The ruling Socialist Party responded by simply creating a new ""constituent assembly,"" with different voting rules that guaranteed it a majority. (Most foreign governments, including Canada's, continue to recognize the elected National Assembly of 2015 as the lawful government of Venezuela.)Moya-Ocampos​ said regime change likely would lead to the repudiation of any new Chinese debts. ""Nobody, the Chinese included, can guarantee that the incumbent leadership is going to be the same five years from now."""

Canadians celebrate Lunar New Year despite concerns over coronavirus | CBC News,At least one event in the Lower Mainland has been cancelled over fears of coronavirus.,2020-01-26T19:59:01.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/coronavirus-lunar-new-year-1.5441077,"Lunar New Year celebrations lit up Vancouver's Chinatown with firecrackers and colourful lion dancers on Sunday, though at least one other event in the Lower Mainland was cancelled over fears of the new coronavirus.The Live in Langley Chinese Association cancelled its gala, which was also sponsored by the Township of Langley, as fears rose after authorities detected Canada's first case of coronavirus on Saturday in a patient who had travelled to Toronto from Wuhan, China.Health Minister Patty Hajdu said Sunday that the risk of infection is low and Canadians should not worry about contracting the virus in a casual setting, urging people to take normal precautions but otherwise continue their lives.Vancouver's Spring Festival Parade, said to be one of the largest Lunar New Year celebrations in North America, carried on.⁠⠀Vancouver resident Jason Ng attended the Lunar New Year celebrations with his wife, father and three-year-old son to watch his other five-year-old son dance in the parade.""It was something kind of in the back of our heads,'' Ng said of the virus. ""It wasn't a huge concern.''Another spectator, Ethan Donnelly, said he works at the University of British Columbia and a coworker who is from China skipped this year's celebrations for fear of the virus.""We want to celebrate, but better safe than sorry,'' he said, gesturing to the mask he wore during the parade.Though some donned the surgical masks at the event, experts advise against them, saying the ones widely available at drug stores aren't particularly effective and noting that repeatedly adjusting them with unwashed hands can actually exacerbate risk of infection.Ella Lewis-Vass, who also works and studies at the university, said she believed those who were most concerned about contracting the virus likely stayed home.The illness has sickened at least 1,975 people and killed 56 in China, but it remains to be seen whether it's as dangerous as the common flu, which kills 3,500 people every year in Canada alone."

	Building medical clinics and treating disease doesn't leave much time for spreading the word of God. But for generations of missionaries in China, it was all part of their Christian duty and their faith in the social gospel. Canadians working in China were inspired by this movement which sought to address societal problems through social change. In this CBC Radio clip, missionaries from the 1940s and earlier remember the challenges of working in China. The social gospel movement also afforded a place for women who wanted to contribute in the missions. No longer was missionary work solely a man's job; wives, nuns and single career women also had a role to play. In China they worked for the emancipation of women in a culture where foot-binding was still the norm. Anne Story, the first social worker sent to China by a Canadian church, says the missions created generations of women who saw themselves as equals.

New public safety minister says Huawei 5G review 'a priority' but offers no timeline | CBC News,"Bill Blair’s promotion to public safety minister is receiving mixed reviews, with some observers saying they're worried the former police chief’s appointment signals a shift away from national security matters.",2019-11-21T09:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/5g-huawei-china-bill-blair-1.5367002,"There's still no timetable indicating when Canada will decide whether Chinese tech giant Huawei will be allowed to join Canada's next-generation 5G wireless network, newly sworn-in Public Safety Minister Bill Blair said Thursday.""I think there are some complex economic and security issues that need to be addressed,"" Blair said outside of Rideau Hall last night.""And it will be a priority when we come back to government and when cabinet meets to examine those issues and make that decision. I don't have a specific timetable at this time.""His predecessor Ralph Goodale, who was defeated in the Oct. 21 election, had said a decision would be coming after the election campaign, adding that Canada needed more information from the United States about the nature of the possible security threat.Some of Canada's Five Eyes intelligence-sharing allies have made moves against Huawei, citing concerns that it is an arm of Chinese military intelligence — an accusation the company denies.Canada's relationship with Huawei is further complicated by the broader political dispute with China. For nearly a year now, Beijing has held two Canadian civilians in prison without charges. Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig have been held by the Chinese since shortly after the RCMP arrested Huawei senior executive Meng Wanzhou in Vancouver on an American extradition warrant.""It wouldn't surprise me if a decision has been made [on Huawei] but we're waiting on our allies,"" said Stephanie Carvin, a former analyst for CSIS and an assistant professor of international affairs at Carleton University.""For me, it's bigger than Huawei, though. After Huawei, there's going to be something more. As our physical infrastructure is increasingly becoming attached to our digital infrastructure, this is this is going to keep happening. So we need to figure out how the government deals with this from an economic national security standpoint.""The 5G review is just one of the files on Blair's new desk. His portfolio also covers Canada's spy agency, the RCMP, border control. the federal prison system. As the minister of public safety and emergency management, he'll also be called on during natural disasters.Before the election, the former Toronto police chief sat at the cabinet table as the minister of border security and organized crime reduction — a ministerial offshoot of Public Safety that no longer exists.Carvin said the decision to collapse the two ministries back into one massive department is disappointing and reflects what she sees as the wider message of the new cabinet: a renewed focus on domestic issues.""I strongly suspect [Blair is] going to be, probably, given his background, more concerned with the policing aspects than the ... national security aspects,"" she said.""The next year and a half, two years is about [the government's] survival. OK, fine. But that means two more years where we're not going to get our long term interests and our national security. And that I think is unfortunate.""Blair told reporters on Wednesday that firearm reform is another vital file on his agenda.On the campaign trail, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said a re-elected Liberal government would ban semi-automatic assault weapons and enable municipalities to restrict or prohibit handguns.""We have made a commitment to strengthen gun laws in Canada,"" said Blair. ""There is a sense of urgency."" Heidi Rathjen, coordinator of the pro-gun control group Poly Remembers, said she's happy to see Blair's appointment. ""Our feeling is that he is genuinely convinced of the need to substantially strengthen our gun control law, particularly with respect to assault weapons,"" she told CBC.""We are hoping that one of his first moves will be to freeze the importation and manufacture of all assault weapons and handguns, in keeping with the spirit of his party's election promises. Why allow the continued sale of assault weapons since they are to be banned in the near future?""Rod Giltaca, executive director of the Canadian Coalition for Firearm Rights, said Blair's comments Wednesday about the timing of gun legislation were vague.""He was incredibly vague when responding to every question that he was asked regarding gun control, which I can assume may be good for gun owners or maybe bad for gun owners. We don't know,"" he said.""I'd like to see them leave the system the way it is at this point. Allowing municipalities to ban handguns is absurd. The only thing that municipalities can do is pass bylaws and issue fines. So I'm not sure how that would affect the lives and activities of criminals."""
Paleontologists have found the tiniest dinosaur ever | CBC News,A bird-like dinosaur with a beak full of teeth and claws on its wings is the tiniest extinct dinosaur ever found.,2020-03-11T16:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/hummingbird-dinosaur-amber-1.5492775,"A bird-like dinosaur with a beak full of teeth and claws on its wings is the tiniest extinct dinosaur ever found.The dinosaur's beautifully preserved skull — about as long as your thumbnail from the tip of its beak to the back of its head — was found in a hunk of amber from northern Myanmar, researchers report in a new study published Wednesday in Nature.Its brain is a little smaller than that of the bee hummingbird, the smallest living bird, said Ryan McKellar, a Canadian paleontologist who co-authored the study with Chinese, Canadian and U.S. researchers. ""But once you include the snout, you're talking about something that's about the same size.""Technically, the bee hummingbird is a dinosaur itself, as all modern living birds are, making the new species the smallest extinct dinosaur.Despite being so tiny, the bones in its skull have fused together, indicating that it's an adult or near adult.It lived about 99 million years ago in what was then a tropical mangrove forest teeming with insects, frogs, salamanders, lizards and other bird-like dinosaurs — though they had not yet evolved completely to resemble modern birds.""They're sort of our neat little guys that scurried around on tree trunks … that still had claws in their wings and still had teeth in their snout,"" said McKellar, curator of paleontology for the Royal Saskatchewan Museum in Regina.In fact, this particular animal's teeth were unusual. Unlike most birds at the time, who had teeth just on the tips of their beaks, it had dozens that extended close to the back of its mouth under its eye. For that reason, the new species was named Oculudentavis khaungraae.The first part of its name means ""eye-teeth-bird,"" while the second part of its name honours Khuang Ra, the woman who bought the fossil at a market and donated it to the Hupoge Amber Museum in China where it could be studied.McKellar says this particular bird would likely have been adapted to eat insects and snails. Its large, lizard-like eyes were adapted to narrowing its pupil in bright light, suggesting it was active during the day. They're also pointed more sideways than forward compared with modern birds.""So [it was] maybe even better adapted for escaping as prey as opposed to actually hunting things,"" he added.The study was led by Lida Xing, an associate professor at the China University of Geosciences in Beijing who previously studied and worked in Canada, and Jingmai O'Connor, a paleontologist at the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology in Beijing.O'Connor said in the email that the discovery shows how small dinosaurs could be, and that even ones this tiny could be predators — something that wasn't known before.McKellar got involved in the project a couple of years ago while collaborating with Xing on a different study, and was tasked with figuring out how the animal became encased in amber. It appears the bird was already dead — though freshly so — and rather wet when it became trapped in sticky, syrupy amber oozing down a tree trunk. The types of insects trapped with it suggest the amber never made it to the forest floor before hardening.He said the special thing about amber is it provides a snapshot of animals so small that they're rarely preserved as fossils. Most dinosaur fossils are the size of crows or larger. In this case, Oculudentavis is even smaller than other birds found in Myanmar amber, which are usually about the size of sparrows or robins.In this case, none of Oculudentavis's feathers were preserved, as its skin got separated from its skull during decomposition.But McKellar said Myanmar amber is also key to figuring out the origin of feathers trapped in Canadian amber found in Alberta and Saskatchewan.While about 10 tonnes of amber are mined for jewelry each year in Myanmar, Canada produces only about a kilogram a year ""and the pieces are smaller and more fragile,"" McKellar said.By comparing the feathers found in those pieces to larger pieces with more body parts found in Myanmar, scientists are able to learn more about the feathered dinosaurs that lived in Canada."

Toothless dinosaur find could provide clues into evolution of bird beaks | CBC News,"Researchers have discovered a species of dinosaur permanently lost its teeth in adolescence, the first fossil find of its kind.",2016-12-28T20:53:52.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/toothless-dinosaur-birds-1.3914277,"Researchers have discovered a species of dinosaur permanently lost its teeth in adolescence, the first fossil find of its kind.The study, by a team of researchers from China and the United States, examined the skeletons of 13 Limusaurus inextricabilis from the Xinjiang Province in China. The dinosaurs were discovered in ""death traps"" where they became stuck in the mud and died. A baby skeleton in the collection had small, sharp teeth. However, the adults were all toothless.Researchers from China first reported on the initial findings of these dinosaurs in 2001. However, due to the differences between one toothed fossil and ones without any teeth, they believed they had different species. As they began to classify various characteristics of the fossils, they realized they all belonged to the same species.This finding led the researchers to conclude that a baby Limusaurus would have been a carnivore or even an omnivore, using its sharp teeth to tear through meat. As they grew older and lost those teeth, they became herbivores with no need for teeth.The Limusaurus belongs to a group of dinosaurs known as theropods. These two-legged, carnivorous dinosaurs include what is likely the most well-known dinosaur, the Tyrannosaurus rex. But it's also believed that today's birds evolved from the theropods. The new finding may provide a clue as to how birds went from being toothy predators to beaked creatures.Though there were 78 identifiable developmental changes between the young and adult Limusaurus, the tooth findings were the most surprising. "

And that I think is unfortunate.""Blair told reporters on Wednesday that firearm reform is another vital file on his agenda.On the campaign trail, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said a re-elected Liberal government would ban semi-automatic assault weapons and enable municipalities to restrict or prohibit handguns.""We have made a commitment to strengthen gun laws in Canada,"" said Blair. ""There is a sense of urgency."" Heidi Rathjen, coordinator of the pro-gun control group Poly Remembers, said she's happy to see Blair's appointment. ""Our feeling is that he is genuinely convinced of the need to substantially strengthen our gun control law, particularly with respect to assault weapons,"" she told CBC.""We are hoping that one of his first moves will be to freeze the importation and manufacture of all assault weapons and handguns, in keeping with the spirit of his party's election promises. Why allow the continued sale of assault weapons since they are to be banned in the near future?""Rod Giltaca, executive director of the Canadian Coalition for Firearm Rights, said Blair's comments Wednesday about the timing of gun legislation were vague.""He was incredibly vague when responding to every question that he was asked regarding gun control, which I can assume may be good for gun owners or maybe bad for gun owners. We don't know,"" he said.""I'd like to see them leave the system the way it is at this point. Allowing municipalities to ban handguns is absurd. The only thing that municipalities can do is pass bylaws and issue fines. So I'm not sure how that would affect the lives and activities of criminals."""
"United Nations atomic watchdog chief heading to Iran, seeks more access to nuclear sites | CBC News","The head of the UN's atomic watchdog agency will head to Tehran next week to press Iranian authorities for access to sites where the country is thought to have stored or used undeclared nuclear material, the organization said Saturday.",2020-08-22T16:19:02.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/united-nations-atomic-watchdog-iran-1.5696437,"The head of the United Nations atomic watchdog agency will head to Tehran next week to press Iranian authorities for access to sites where the country is thought to have stored or used undeclared nuclear material, the organization said Saturday.It will be the first visit to Iran of International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) director general Rafael Grossi since he took office last December and comes amid intense international pressure on the country over its nuclear program.The focus will be on access to sites thought to be from the early 2000s, before Iran signed the 2015 nuclear deal with world powers. Iran maintains the IAEA inspectors have no legal basis to inspect the sites.""My objective is that my meetings in Tehran will lead to concrete progress in addressing the outstanding questions that the agency has related to safeguards in Iran and, in particular, to resolve the issue of access,"" Grossi said in a statement.""I also hope to establish a fruitful and co-operative channel of direct dialogue with the Iranian government which will be valuable now and in the future.""The Iranian delegation to international organizations in Vienna tweeted that ""we hope this visit will lead to reinforced mutual co-operation.""Since President Donald Trump unilaterally pulled the U.S. out of the nuclear deal with Iran in 2018, the other countries involved — France, Britain, Germany, Russia and China — have been struggling to keep it alive.The deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, promises Iran economic incentives in exchange for curbs on its nuclear program. But with the reinstatement of some American sanctions, Iran's economy has been steadily deteriorating, and Tehran has begun violating provisions of the agreement to try to pressure the other countries to do more to offset those sanctions.At the same time, Iran has continued to provide IAEA inspectors with access to its nuclear facilities — one of the major reasons the countries still party to the agreement stress that it's important to keep it alive.Last week, the U.S. ratcheted up the pressure, officially informing the United Nations it was demanding the restoration of all UN sanctions on Iran, arguing that Iran is in non-compliance and invoking a provision of the nuclear deal to ""snap back"" even more sanctions.Russia, China, Britain, France and Germany, who often disagree, all declared the U.S. action illegal, arguing it is impossible to withdraw from a deal and then use the resolution that endorsed it to reimpose sanctions.Iran has also rejected the move, but the U.S. has stuck to its guns, declaring that a 30-day countdown for the snapback of penalties eased after the 2015 agreement was signed had begun.The five nations and Iran are due to meet in Vienna on Sept. 1."

Hong Kong braces for another weekend of protests despite leader's public meeting | CBC News,Analysts say Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam's hope of using a town hall to buy some goodwill that will diffuse tensions ahead of rallies planned this weekend in the lead-up to Oct. 1 celebrations of China's National Day is unlikely to succeed.,2019-09-27T08:00:54.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/hong-kong-weekend-demonstrations-lam-meeting-1.5299388,"Hong Kong's beleaguered leader Carrie Lam faced her public with humility, but she may not get the response she hoped for.Analysts say Lam's hope of using the community engagement to buy some goodwill that will diffuse tensions ahead of rallies planned this weekend in the lead-up to Oct. 1 celebrations of China's National Day is unlikely to succeed.In a face-off with an antagonistic audience, Lam quietly took blow after blow as citizens at a town hall session Thursday vented anger at her refusal to give more concessions to finally end more than three months of anti-government protests that have rocked the semi-autonomous Chinese territory.After the dialogue ended, Lam stayed holed up in the building for another four hours to avoid confrontation with angry protesters outside and left only after most of them dispersed.""Carrie Lam showed some sincerity,"" said Willy Lam, an adjunct professor at the Center for China Studies at Hong Kong's Chinese University who is not related to the Hong Kong leader. ""She sat through more than two hours of humiliation and demonstrated at least willingness to hear radically different views. She has the guts to face opposition but still it's not good enough.""The protests began in June in opposition to a proposed law that would have allowed some criminal suspects to be sent for trial on the mainland, but have since widened into an anti-China protest spurred by widespread concern that Beijing has been eroding the autonomy Hong Kong was promised when the former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997.Another major rally organized by the Civil Human Rights Front is set Saturday to mark the fifth anniversary of the Umbrella Revolution, when protesters occupied key thoroughfares in the city for 79 days in 2014 to demand universal suffrage. That movement ended without any government concession.Protesters are also organizing ""anti-totalitarianism"" rallies in Hong and many cities worldwide on Sunday against what they denounced as China's tyranny.The Front is also planning another big march on Oct. 1, sparking fears of a bloody showdown that will embarrass China's ruling Communist Party as it marks its 70th year in power with grand festivities in Beijing. The Hong Kong government has scaled down National Day celebrations by calling off an annual firework display and moving a reception indoors.Lam's government has insisted that it can handle the conflict on its own, amid fears of Chinese military intervention. Despite the bashing Thursday, Lam vowed to continue talks with various communities, including protesters, to hear their grievances.The response to the town hall on social media was generally negative, with many calling it a public relations stunt.The dialogue was timed to try reduce potential ferocity at upcoming rallies, but protesters aren't buying it, said Phil Chan, senior fellow at the Institute for Security and Development Policy in Stockholm.""I don't think Hong Kong people will fall for it,"" Chan said. ""She was just repeating herself and hasn't accepted another view point other than her own.""During the town hall, Lam vowed to work to regain public trust and shouldered the responsibility for causing political havoc with the extradition bill. Yet she offered no concrete actions she will take apart from promises to listen and address deep-seated societal woes such as a lack of affordable housing that the government believes has contributed to the protests.Lam stood her ground against demands for an independent inquiry into accusations of police brutality against protesters and the unconditional release of more than 1,500 people detained since the protests began in June. She also sidestepped calls for direct elections of the city's leaders.""It was a good occasion for people to reduce pent-up anger, but it will not cool down emotions because there was no concrete reconciliatory moves,"" Willy Lam said.Nevertheless, he said it was a good sign that the tightly guarded event proceeded without disruption and opens the possibility that future planned dialogue with the community could be more in-depth or even show results.So far the only concession the Hong Kong leader has made was a promise to completely withdraw the extradition bill, a move that may have eased tensions had it been made in June but did little to calm things when announced in September. Huge protests have continued on most weekends, as have the clashes with police that often break out after nightfall."

"CEOs say Trump policies hurt business, investment | CBC News","Foreign direct investment to the United States fell in 2018, and companies gathered at the World Economic Forum in the Swiss Alps this year say they are worried Trump's trade war with China will dampen the global economy and business investments even further.",2019-01-23T19:33:28.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/ceos-davos-trump-bad-for-business-1.4989829,"From center stage in Davos last year, U.S. President Donald Trump told the world's corporate bosses that America is a great place to invest. It hasn't quite turned out that way.Foreign direct investment to the United States fell in 2018, and companies gathered at the World Economic Forum in the Swiss Alps this year say they are worried Trump's trade war with China will dampen the global economy and business investments even further.One key complaint here this week: Companies increasingly reliant on consumers in China have had to lower their earnings outlooks as the world's second-largest economy cools.And while the U.S. administration has cut taxes and regulations to attract new investment, a wave of caution is rippling through many industries in the United States.""The trade war has been very damaging for the U.S. agricultural economy,"" said David MacLennan, chief executive of U.S. food and agricultural giant Cargill Inc, which announced worse-than-expected results out of China earlier in January.""The longer this goes on, the worse it is,"" he told Reuters.Foreign investment in the United States, which includes cross-border mergers and acquisitions as well as intra-company loans, fell about 18 per cent in 2018 from the prior year, according to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD).That is close to the 19 per cent year-on-year drop in foreign investment globally. But it is notable given the deregulation and tax cuts that might have otherwise fed into inward investment. In January of last year, at Davos, many executives said they planned to spend money in the U.S. in 2018.While the UN trade agency attributed the global and U.S. declines to the tariffs that the United States and China have imposed on each other's imports since mid-2018, foreign investment in China actually rose three per cent last year over the previous year. Foreign investment to India rose seven per cent.Alan Jope, chief executive of consumer goods company Unilever, said the United States remains a good market for its products, which include Dove deodorant, Magnum ice cream and Lipton tea.But it is China, where Unilever last year joined forces with e-commerce giant JD.com to move its products around the country, that has become the more resilient market.Jope said China was ""one of our most reliable sources of growth. China provides the new stability in consumer consumption.""The U.S.-China trade war has hit industries around the world over the past few months.Big Chinese companies such as Alibaba have shrunk their plans to invest in the United States. Taiwan-based Foxconn has scaled back its plans for a Wisconsin factory, and Chinese automaker GAC Motor has also delayed a move into the U.S. market.In September, Austria's fiber producer Lenzing halted a planned U.S. expansion, blaming rising tariffs between the United States and China.Chinese textile exports to the U.S. are among the goods facing tariffs. Lenzing mothballed a $322 million US project in Alabama to focus on setting up a new production facility in Thailand.To be sure, foreign companies are still investing, particularly in the auto industry.Volkswagen said earlier this month that it would invest $800 million to build a new electric car at its plant in Chattanooga, Tennessee. Toyota and Mazda are working on a new assembly plant, and Daimler and BMW are investing in existing operations.But the economic malaise driven by the upending of trade flows is hitting tech companies hard due to both supply-chain disruption and the economic slowdown in China.Apple this month warned of disappointing quarterly revenues, citing slowing iPhone demand in China. Samsung Electronics Co Ltd. — the world's biggest maker of smartphones and the manufacturer of chips for other smartphone makers, including Apple and Huawei — said its fourth-quarter profit likely dropped 29 per cent.""For the long run … I worry that the trend will expand to many other countries and industries, and at that time … we all will be negatively affected,"" Ken Hu, deputy chairman of China's Huawei Technologies, said in Davos.Huawei, the world's biggest producer of telecommunications equipment, is ""probably suffering the most right now"" because it relies on heavily integrated and globalized supply chains, Hu said.As a result of the disruption, Trump's trade war with Chinese President Xi Jinping is looming large over Davos this year, even if neither man is here.The International Monetary Fund trimmed its global growth forecasts on Monday and a survey by auditing and accounting giant PwC of nearly 1,400 chief executives showed increasing pessimism among business chiefs.The PwC research showed 27 per cent of executives from outside the United States see the United States as the number one place with the most potential for growth, down from 46 per cent in 2018.It's not only economics that is clouding the skies. Foreign companies, mainly Chinese, also face tighter scrutiny when they bring deals to the United States, after the Trump administration last year strengthened the powers of the Committee on Foreign Investment (CFIUS), said Stuart Eizenstat, former U.S. ambassador to the European Union and now head of law firm Covington & Burlington LLP's international practice.CFIUS is an intra-agency panel that reviews acquisitions on national security grounds.Chinese state-owned Sinochem Group, which has been in merger talks with ChemChina to create the world's biggest industrial chemicals firm, said that it did not think it could clinch a U.S. acquisition in the current environment.""You know what's happening today, so I think you will see there will be less investment going abroad,"" Sinochem Chairman Ning Gaoning said.""The Chinese are getting quite confused. They thought they were welcome to invest in other countries. Now they realize they are not being welcomed all the time.""Takeshi Niinami, chief executive of Japanese brewer Suntory Holdings Ltd., told Reuters in an interview that the world has ""very big emotional leaders"" including one in the Washington.""Davos is a body to work on one voice, to give [a message that says]: 'Come on, we have to be rational,'"" he said. ""Business should be the one to let them cool down."""

Energy stocks also fell as crude oil prices headed lower.Trading was choppy for much of the day after falling in the early going. The muted trading follows a rally Friday spurred by investor optimism amid signs of progress in the latest round of trade negotiations between the U.S. and China.Washington and Beijing agreed to a truce following talks last week. The U.S. held off on tariffs set to kick in this week and China agreed to buy more farm goods. But the U.S. has yet to cancel plans for more tariffs in December and the nations still have several complicated issues to negotiate, which may have dimmed some of the optimism that fuelled last week's market rally.Procter & Gamble contributed to the slide in consumer goods makers, dropping 0.8 per cent. Colgate-Palmolive fell 1.5 per cent.Deere & Co. helped pull industrial sector stocks lower, falling 1.3 per cent. Communication services companies also fell. Comcast dropped 0.7 per cent and Twitter was down 1.3 per cent.Some energy companies declined as crude oil prices dropped 2 per cent. Devon Energy slid 1.9 per cent.Financial stocks rose, with insurers among the gainers. Progressive added 0.6 per cent. Several pharmaceutical companies helped drive health care stocks higher. Amgen rose 1.3 per cent and Alexion Pharmaceuticals climbed 2.3 per cent.Bond markets and the U.S. government were closed for the Columbus Day holiday.Investors are also looking ahead to the start of the third-quarter earnings season, as companies begin to report their latest quarterly results. Major investment banks and other big companies are scheduled to serve up their report cards for the July-September quarter this week, including JPMorgan Chase, Johnson & Johnson, United Airlines, Netflix, Coca-Cola and UnitedHealth Group.Expectations for S&P 500 companies' third-quarter results are generally low, with analysts forecasting a drop of 4.2 per cent from a year ago. The results, plus what CEOs say about their spending and revenue forecasts, should give a better picture of the economy's potential direction.""The market is a little bit nervous about earnings because there are some estimates out there that say there's going to be negative growth,"" said Karyn Cavanaugh, senior markets strategist at Voya Investment Management.The S&P 500 index was down 0.1 per cent as of 3:18 p.m. ET. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 24 points, or 0.1 per cent, to 26,791. The Nasdaq rose less 0.1 per cent. Small-company stocks did worse than the rest of the market. The Russell 2000 index lost 0.4 per cent.Investors applauded the progress made by the U.S. and China last week, but uncertainty remains over whether they can ink a broader deal. The U.S. agreed to suspend a planned hike in tariffs on $250 billion US of Chinese goods that had been set to kick in Tuesday. Beijing, meanwhile, agreed to buy $40 billion to $50 billion in U.S. farm products.The truce was a result of the 13th round of negotiations between the nations since the trade war began well over a year ago. The key sticking points of intellectual property and trade secrets still hang over the dispute.The overall picture hasn't changed for companies, which are still holding off on forecasts and investments because of the uncertain trade situation.""There is not yet a viable path to existing tariffs declining and tariff escalation remains a meaningful risk,"" Michael D. Zezas, a Morgan Stanley strategist, wrote in a note to clients. ""Thus, we do not expect a meaningful rebound in corporate behaviour that would drive global growth expectations higher.""Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping are due to attend an economic conference in Chile in mid-November. That is raising hopes a face-to-face meeting might produce progress.Several major banks will report their latest quarterly financial results this week and give investors an opening glimpse into the latest round of corporate earnings. JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Wells Fargo will all report results on Tuesday. Bank of America and PNC Financial will report results on Wednesday.Investors will be watching for information on income from loans as banks contend with sinking bond yields. Falling yields force banks to set lower rates on mortgages and other kinds of loans.Shares in Parsley Energy slid 11.1 per cent on news the oil and gas company is buying Jagged Peak Energy in an all-stock deal. Jagged Peak shares dropped 1.3 per cent.Aecom climbed 6.1 per cent after the provider of technical and management-support services said it is selling its management services business.European markets closed lower. The European Union faces a potential trade war with the U.S. as the Trump administration readies trade sanctions on up to $7.5 billion worth of goods. The tariffs are set to go into effect Friday and stem from a dispute over subsidies to the airplane maker Airbus."

The party has been running a similar ad on Facebook.Canada's Chinese community is one of the groups the Conservative Party hopes to win over in this election.Trudeau has denied the Liberals have any plans to legalize hard drugs.The Liberals said they are advertising on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, but not on WeChat. The New Democrats said the party has focused its online advertising on Facebook and Instagram and the national campaign is not advertising on WeChat.Under recent changes to Canada's elections law, online companies that accept political ads during the election campaign have to set up digital registries of all of the political ads running on their platforms, with copies of the ads and information about who authorized them. The requirement has prompted some internet giants, including Google, to stop accepting political ads in Canada during the federal election.The law can apply to companies located anywhere in the world if the number of visitors from Canada to their sites exceeds a certain threshold.Platforms that publish in a language other than English or French must have more than 100,000 unique visitors from Canada each month to be subject to the law. Bryan Segal, senior vice-president of Comscore (which measures web traffic), said WeChat gets an average of 616,000 unique visitors in Canada per month.Gauthier said Elections Canada's monitors are looking for examples of online misinformation or disinformation about how and where to vote. They are not, however, responsible for checking whether an online platform that is subject to the law has set up an online registry.Commissioner of Canada Elections Yves Côté can investigate if someone files a complaint, said Gauthier.""It is an offence to be an online platform that meets these thresholds and to not have this registry. So that is an offence under the act,"" she said.""Penalties can range from administrative monetary penalties to what the commissioner calls compliance agreements, which it publishes on its website.""However, parties and candidates are not required by law to verify whether an online platform has set up a digital ad registry before they advertise, she said.Michelle Laliberté, a spokeswoman for Côté, said the commissioner's office doesn't ""proactively carry out monitoring or surveillance of digital platforms,"" but it can investigate complaints.""While I can't speak to whether or not we have received complaints in relation to this issue, if someone were to bring forward a complaint we would evaluate it to see if it falls within the Commissioner's mandate.""Elizabeth Thompson can be reached at elizabeth.thompson@cbc.ca"

OPEC faces 'make-or-break' decision on oil production | CBC News,Members of OPEC meet this week to discuss oil production cuts as the spread of COVID-19 has eroded crude prices worldwide.,2020-03-03T23:30:26.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/opec-oil-caronavirus-1.5483779,"OPEC and its allies meet regularly to assess the supply and demand for oil around the globe, but few gatherings have happened under such volatile and trying circumstances.COVID-19's spread has weighed mightily on stock markets and oil prices in recent weeks, with experts still trying to assess the risk the virus poses worldwide.For OPEC, the situation is another big test of the cartel's ability to stabilize oil prices when struck with unexpected turbulence.""It's very important,"" said Judith Dwarkin, chief economist of RS Energy Group in Calgary.""They're facing a make-or-break decision about how to respond to COVID-19 disease, which has now spread beyond China and does pose a threat to global public health and the global economy.""While the impact of the illness on citizens' welfare is a paramount concern, markets are growing increasingly troubled about the blow it will have on world economies.Global oil prices have fallen 20 per cent since the start of the year as the novel coronavirus has spread. In Canada, a downturn in oil prices might not only have an impact on the revenues of oil companies but government coffers, too.Last week, Alberta revealed a provincial budget built in part on oil prices averaging $58 US a barrel in North America. On Monday, oil prices closed a little above $47 US a barrel.Members of OPEC and their allies are meeting this week at the group's headquarters in Vienna, Austria.OPEC, Russia and other producers already have a deal in place to cut output from Jan. 1 by 2.1 million barrels per day (bpd), a figure that includes additional voluntary cuts by Saudi Arabia.But that has not been enough to counter the impact of the virus on China, the world's biggest oil importer, and on the  global economy, as factories are disrupted, fewer people travel and other business slows, curbing oil demand.""China is the front line for impact in the first quarter [of the year],"" Dwarkin said. ""We estimate roughly 900,000 barrels per day has probably been sliced out of China's oil demand. So the need to make a decision to deepen cuts is important."" On Tuesday, officials indicated they were considering deeper cuts in a bid to lift crude prices.Reuters reported a panel of OPEC and its allies recommended cutting oil output by an extra one million bpd on Tuesday signalling that Russia and Saudi Arabia were moving closer to a deal to prop up prices.Leading into this week's meetings, some experts anticipated the cartel's cut might amount to only 600,000 bpd — a figure that might have underwhelmed the market given current uncertainty.Indeed, things are moving quickly and analysts are trying to understand just how the virus' spread will impact economic activity, especially consumer activity.Denton Cinquegrana, chief oil analyst at the Oil Price Information Service by IHS Markit, said it seems like China may be turning a corner, but the virus is only beginning to impact people in the U.S.""Here, in the United States, you're starting to see a little bit of the panic and spread of the virus start to take place and have an impact on demand,"" he said. ""The demand impact we may not know for really a couple months down the road.""Cinquegrana said if OPEC agreed to just the 600,000 bpd cut, Saudi Arabia may go ""a little bit on their own"" to bring the number closer to one million bpd.""That may be enough to get it back close to the $50-a-barrel level,"" he said. ""But, again, there's some real concerns about demand going forward."" A cut in U.S. interest rates on Tuesday offered only limited support for crude ahead of the OPEC meetings on Thursday and Friday.The price of West Texas Intermediate crude, the North American benchmark, closed up 43 cents at $47.18 US per barrel on Tuesday. Brent crude, the global benchmark, fell four cents a barrel to settle at $51.86 US a barrel.Dwarkin said COVID-19 has made OPEC's work an even heavier lift this week.""But as one former Saudi oil minister said, OPEC is like a teabag,"" Dwarkin added.""It works best when it's plunged into hot water. Well, it's definitely in hot water right now.""  "

'Stark differences': how Derek Sloan's words could test Erin O'Toole's leadership skills | CBC News,"On Tuesday morning, shortly before O'Toole's first official news conference as leader of the Official Opposition, the Liberals tossed out their first challenge: the new Conservative leader, they said, should move forthwith to remove inflammatory backbencher Derek Sloan from the Conservative caucus.",2020-08-25T20:42:59.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/erin-otoole-derek-sloan-conservative-leadership-abortion-lgbtq-1.5699489,"The Liberals were at least gracious enough to give Erin O'Toole a full 24 hours before openly trying to cause him trouble. But on Tuesday morning, shortly before O'Toole's first official news conference as leader of the Official Opposition, the Liberals tossed out their first challenge: the new Conservative leader, they said, should move forthwith to remove inflammatory backbencher Derek Sloan from the Conservative caucus.""Mr. O'Toole has an important decision to make, which will help Canadians understand his vision for the future of our country,"" Liberal MP Pam Damoff said in a written statement laying out just some of the things Sloan said while pursuing his own campaign for the Conservative leadership.Derek Sloan's status as a Conservative MP is not quite the most pressing issue facing the nation at this moment and the politics of it are not subtle. But it's a rite of passage for Conservative leaders to be faced with this sort of thing — so Sloan becomes the first test of O'Toole's ability to both lead his party and explain himself.The Liberals' challenge is somewhat unfair. Under the rules adopted by the Conservatives, the leader of the party cannot unilaterally expel an MP from the parliamentary caucus. Even if O'Toole wanted to be rid of Sloan, he would still have to convince a majority of Conservative MPs to vote to expel him.Some Conservative MPs reportedly pushed for Sloan's ouster in May, after he publicly questioned whether Canada's chief public health officer, Dr. Theresa Tam — who was born in Hong Kong — was working for China. Ultimately, a backbencher put forward a motion calling on him to retract his comments. Sloan insisted that his question had been ""rhetorical.""The only Conservative MP to join Sloan in opposing that motion was O'Toole. A few months later, Sloan's supporters helped push O'Toole past Peter MacKay for the Conservative leadership.His comments about Tam may have crossed a line for a significant number of Conservative MPs but Sloan has made multiple statements that O'Toole might not want to be associated with now.In January, Sloan said that the ""the cause of sexual orientation"" was ""scientifically unclear."" He later said that Liberal legislation to ban conversion therapy — the discredited practice of trying to change someone's sexual orientation with counselling — was tantamount to legalized ""child abuse.""Sloan has said he believes Canada should pull out of the UN's Paris agreement on climate change and withdraw all funding from the World Health Organization. He opposes both mandatory vaccination for COVID-19 and any rule requiring Canadians to wear face masks to curb the spread of the virus. Echoing Donald Trump, Sloan has said that ""antifa"" should be officially listed as a terrorist organization.Watch: Erin O'Toole courts social conservatives and broader baseThe NationalO'Toole is apparently of the view that Sloan has not yet said enough to justify expulsion.""During a leadership race, there's always some pressure, there's a contrast of ideas, and that's finished,"" O'Toole said today when a reporter asked him whether Sloan would remain in caucus. ""I received a clear mandate and I'm very excited to meet with my caucus and talk with all of them about uniting and going forward together.""Asked whether his fellow leadership candidates would have prominent roles on his team, O'Toole expanded on his answer only slightly.""Derek and I had some very stark differences. We had some areas of overlap, with our concern about the Communist Party of China and some issues. I didn't agree with some of the ways he characterized those concerns,"" he said. ""But certainly within a pandemic, within the race we were in, a lot of things are said. We're united now. We're going to talk together as a caucus soon.""The ""hey, people say a lot of things during a leadership race"" defence is candid, at least. O'Toole might have even been referring subconsciously to himself. But there is no rule stating that everything said during a leadership race becomes null and void once the ballots are counted.For as long as the Conservative Party of Canada has existed, its leaders have struggled to account for the opinions held within its caucus. After being repeatedly tripped up by his backbenchers' public statements, Stephen Harper came to insist on tight message control and discipline. Andrew Scheer declined to put Kellie Leitch in his shadow cabinet after the former cabinet minister proposed a ""values test"" for people immigrating to Canada. But then he struggled to explain his own views on abortion and homosexuality.Perhaps the most democratically altruistic thing for any leader to say is that they are not responsible for all of the opinions held by every member of their caucus, nor is every member of their caucus obligated to share the leader's opinions. But that explanation only goes so far — it might cover a difference over public policy but it isn't enough to completely sidestep something truly objectionable or even merely unpopular.Sloan is staunchly anti-abortion and if that viewpoint or any of his other opinions speaks to some substantial segment of the Conservative base (Sloan won 15.6 per cent of the popular vote on the first ballot Sunday night) then Conservatives might be reluctant to banish him. The flipside of that would be the question of whether Sloan's presence already threatens to undermine the idea of conservatism that O'Toole wants to present.If Conservatives are not convinced that Sloan is already more trouble than he is worth, then excluding Sloan from the official list of critics might at least allow O'Toole to put some space between himself and his most notorious backbencher. But it won't stop the Liberals from pointing in Sloan's direction.At that point, if Conservatives are willing to stick with him for now, it might become a question of whether Sloan is content to fade into quiet obscurity or will continue to say things that O'Toole will be asked to explain later."

Raptors' Gasol says frustration from hamstring injury fuelled transformation | CBC Sports,"Coming off a heady few months of an NBA title and a FIBA World Cup win, Marc Gasol couldn't replicate that success with the Toronto Raptors this season. The frustration gnawed at him.",2020-07-15T19:58:06.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/sports/basketball/nba/toronto-raptors-marc-gasol-transformation-1.5650983,"Coming off a heady few months of an NBA title and a FIBA World Cup win, Marc Gasol couldn't replicate that success with the Toronto Raptors this season.The frustration gnawed at him.And so when COVID-19 shut down the NBA on March 11, the Raptors veteran forward reached out to his personal training staff and vowed to make good use of the down time.While Gasol wouldn't divulge how much weight he'd shed from his six-foot-11 frame — he said it ""wasn't relevant"" — his trimmed-down physique is obvious.""It was a frustrating season for me personally because I could never get a rhythm and help the team the way that I should be helping the team,"" Gasol said Wednesday, in his first comments to the media since the league shuttered four months ago.""As soon as... we got informed the [Toronto training] facility was closing down, I got together with my team on a phone call and got going on a plan to resolve these ongoing issues.""Those issues kept Gasol on the bench for 28 of the Raptors' 64 games with a nagging hamstring injury.The 35-year-old credited consistency with part of the weight loss — eating and sleeping with more regularity at home in Spain, removed from the rigours of NBA travel.""[Consistency] goes with training regimen, goals, sleeping habits, everything,"" he said. ""Obviously when you're at home, everything is a lot easier than when you're on the road and travelling and trying to make everything work and winning games, which at the end of the day, that's what you're judged for.""Soon after Toronto's historic championship run, Gasol punched in with Spain's national team, which won the World Cup in China in August. He figures his hamstring troubles were a product of those gruelling few months.""You have to put in the time, you have to put in the work if you're going to use that much energy,"" he said. ""If you only take money out of the bank and never put money in the bank, you're going to go broke.""Gasol's teammates have raved about his transformation.Gasol isn't the only Raptor who showed up in Florida for the NBA's restart in terrific shape. Coach Nick Nurse has praised the hard work of team leader Kyle Lowry, who looks fit and trim. And Chris Boucher put a much-needed 15 pounds of muscle on his long-limbed frame.Gasol said beyond the fitness component, he and his teammates are itching to play. He can see it in the competitiveness on the court and off.""We compete amongst each other every single day and try to go at each other's neck a little bit. I think that's always positive,"" he said. ""That is one of the things we missed the most during confinement — the competition. Some guys like to compete at computer games. Some of us are not really into those things. We missed competing against other human beings in real life.""Gasol said there's been some cutthroat video games between players.""You don't want to play me in video games, I'll tell you that much,"" Gasol said.Pascal Siakam then jumped into the frame on the Zoom call and told reporters ""FIFA king right here. Make sure you get that on camera.""Let’s do this! 👊🏽<br>It’s the little details that are vital 🤙🏽<br>Step by step ✍🏽 <a href=""https://t.co/4IgJbNhsga"">pic.twitter.com/4IgJbNhsga</a>The 22 teams in the NBA restart are being housed at Walt Disney World in Orlando under strict health and safety protocols. While there are social activities such as a players lounge, boat trips, fishing, and water parks, the Raptors know one of the toughest challenges over what could stretch into three months on the campus will be loneliness.Gasol appreciated the photos of his family Raptors staff had placed in his room before he checked in.""Obviously it's not ideal to be separated from your family but once you know they are well, also understanding and explaining to them the risk and make sure they follow all the protocols that they have to follow,"" said Gasol, whose wife and two kids are in Spain.""[The photos] were a great gesture.""While there've been complaints from players about the food and accommodations, and a couple of players have been quarantined for inadvertently straying outside the campus bubble, Gasol said they're all in the same boat, and ""trying to make the best out of it.""I'm sure if you want to you can find millions of excuses of why this is not a good idea, you just have to find a good reason to stick with it and try to win another championship,"" he said.""So, whatever that is for, for each player, I hope that they can really hold it strong and lean on one another when the tough time comes, because they will come and things will get a little bit tougher on the mental aspect, and just knowing that you have your teammates, always next to you to support you.""Gasol lived under full lockdown in Spain, which was one of the hardest hit countries in the pandemic's early days.Now, the NBA sits virtually in one of the epicentres of the coronavirus. Florida reported more than 10,000 new cases Wednesday, surpassing 300,000 cases.The Raptors play the Houston Rockets on July 24 in their first of three scrimmages. They play the Los Angeles Lakers on Aug. 1 in the first of eight seeding games.Gasol spent part of the summer of 2018 on a rescue ship in the Mediterranean Sea, helping pluck terrified people from the water, migrants fleeing Libya for the shores of Europe.Gasol was vocal about his anger and frustration at the time at an Italian government that was trying to halt the influx of refugees.The Toronto Raptors centre has seen the stain of racism in Europe, including his home country of Spain.And so while the U.S. has erupted in anti-racism Black Lives Matter protests, and social and racial justice will be a theme of the NBA's restart at Walt Disney World, Gasol knows racism extends far beyond America's borders.""We can see how we treat a lot of immigrants that come from Africa to Europe, the way we deal with it — not 'we,' but a lot of people do, sadly in Spain or Italy or other countries around Europe.""We look at them as immigrants, not only as human beings. So that tag that you put on [them] already tells you a lot of stuff about the way you view them. All those things needs to needs to change, and if it doesn't come from the top and from the government, it has to come from the people."""
Mining ventilation expert says better air flow could clear the air and curb spread of COVID | CBC News,"As store owners continue to open their doors, they're making sure to think about the health and safety of their customers and staff. But an expert in ventilation and public health wants these businesses to also be thinking about air flow in their building. He says small particles of COVID-19 can linger in the air particularly where there is poor ventilation.",2020-07-14T09:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/sudbury/indoor-air-ventilation-covid19-1.5648186,"As store owners continue to open their doors, they're making sure to think about the health and safety of their customers and staff.Of course physical distancing measures are still in place, and many communities, like Sudbury, have made face coverings a required accessory for indoor public spaces.But a Sudbury physicist who develops ventilation systems for the mining industry, feels we need to take more than just physical distancing into consideration when we're indoors.Daniel Cluff is the CEO of CanMIND Associates, which develops ventilation systems for the mining industry. He even worked on the first clean room underground for the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory (SNOlab).Cluff feels that physical distancing is important with COVID-19 to ensure droplets or large particles of the virus, from an infected person, fall to the floor instead of passing on to someone else.He admits he's not a medical expert but he's been following much of the research on ventilation systems connected to COVID-19.He thinks it's possible that smaller particles could continue to linger, suspended in the air, long after the large particles have fallen.""Eventually they might even hit the roof, depending on if there's a little bit of turbulence. As time goes by these [small particles] will build up.""In order to clear these built-up particles from the air within indoor public spaces, Cluff says proper ventilation is essential.But he says there is a danger if the air flow speeds up or blows too quickly.""The more the air is moving the more the larger particles can get entrained in the air, then it has the reverse effect. It's actually more dangerous because now you've got all the big particles flying around. They could splash you in the face, get in your eye.""He suggests a fine balance of air changing, called laminar flow.Paul Bozek is a professor in the Occupational and Environmental Health Division with the Dalla Lana School of Public Health at the University of Toronto. He teaches about ventilation to students pursuing a career in public health.He says the risk is low of contracting the virus through small particles in the air. But it's not impossible. If air flow is closed off in a space, then anyone spending a long time in that space could be affected. ""It's not just distance when you're talking about living or working or shopping indoors. Time and ventilation can affect your risk of being infected,"" Bozek said.""For a well ventilated space where you're keeping your physical distance and you're minimizing your time, it's not a risk."" He adds the same goes for just momentarily passing through a poorly ventilated space.Bozek cites one instance where individuals contracted COVID-19 at a restaurant in Guangzhou, China.A cluster of COVID-19 developed after several groups of patrons had been eating at tables which were far enough apart for physical distancing. It was the air conditioning unit that turned out to be the culprit.To improve ventilation, Bozek suggests letting some outdoor air in to help dilute any indoor air that could have lingering particles of COVID-19.Bozek says he's rather disappointed with what the provincial government has offered up for ventilation directives on its website for businesses that are looking to reopen. It simply says to ""Open doors and windows to let in more fresh air.""In an email to CBC News, Public Health Ontario (PHO) offered general advice on ventilation in indoor and general public settings, such as increasing outdoor air ventilation, maintaining air handling systems and possibly running them longer, and increasing air flows with portable fans and air conditioning.PHO also added that reducing the risk of infection also means following current public health guidance, like physical distancing, and using a non-medical face mask while in indoor public spaces."

"Cheers for trade minister's talk on canola, Churchill port at Sask. municipalities conference | CBC News",International Trade Minister Jim Carr tried to assuage fears about canola trade with China at the Saskatchewan Association of Rural Municipalities conference on Thursday.,2019-03-14T20:15:20.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatoon/sarm-conference-jim-carr-1.5056789,"China's refusal to buy Richardson International's canola has many farmers in Saskatchewan nervous, but International Trade Minister Jim Carr tried to assuage those fears Thursday.Carr spoke to a full conference hall at the Saskatchewan Association of Rural Municipalities' annual convention in Saskatoon. Unlike his federal Liberal counterpart Ralph Goodale, who was booed at the conference the day before, Carr stepped on stage to a warm reception.Early in his speech, he addressed the trade situation with China — undoubtedly one of the biggest concerns for rural municipalities in the province, which represent many of Saskatchewan's farmers.""The Canadian Food Inspection Agency said it was an  absolutely fine batch. The Chinese think differently. So what we want is the evidence that there's a problem,"" Carr told reporters after his speech at the SARM convention. He did not take questions from the audience.China banned imports of canola seed and other products from Winnipeg-based Richardson last week.The country's foreign ministry said the decision to revoke Richardson's registration to ship canola seeds to China was due to fears of insect infestation, but many in Canada suspect the issue is connected to conflict between the countries over Canada's arrest of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou.Both Goodale and Carr spoke at length at the SARM convention about the need for ""scientific evidence"" in the canola dispute, which they say is lacking from China's claims about Richardson's product.While farmers at SARM have been vocal about the fact that they want the canola trade issue resolved quickly, Carr was non-commital about what will happen if China does not produce that scientific evidence.""Let's take it one day at a time,"" Carr said.""We know that within the next 60 days, decisions will have to be made.""The Winnipeg MP did bring some well-recieved news to the SARM convention, when he mentioned the federal government's work on increasing rail service to the northern port of Churchill, Man.It's the location of Canada's only deep-water Arctic port. The feds made a $117-million commitment to reopening the rail line and port, after the railway was out of service for more than a year following flooding in 2017.The railway to the northern Manitoba town, a marine fuel tank farm there and the Port of Churchill were sold by Denver-based Omnitrax to Arctic Gateway Group last year.Carr said the Arctic Gateway deal will improve the trade prospects for products from northern Saskatchewan.""Now we have access to this port with a refurbished train track, and a port that's going to be positioned to trade with the world,"" said Carr.""Not only is it good for us as Prairie folk but it's good for the country as we expand our trade opportunities worldwide.""Speaking to reporters after the speech, he identified a facet of climate change that he believes might be beneficial for trade — more open water in Canada's north.""Some say that within a generation or more that the water is going to be open, which means that we will have access through our northern port to trading routes around the world.""Carr said research out of the University of Manitoba has centred on ice and permafrost in Churchill."

Love and divorce in the time of COVID | CBC News,"Divorces are on the rise globally, but is COVID-19 to blame? Happiness columnist Jennifer Moss looks at what couples should consider if their relationship is on the rocks and how to make positive change.",2020-07-11T12:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/kitchener-waterloo/happiness-column-jennifer-moss-divorce-covid-19-1.5643587,"When a major crisis hits, it tends to pull people together or divide them.Unfortunately, for some marriages during COVID-19, the pandemic has forced a divide. Around the world, divorce rates are increasing.In China, marriage registration offices saw an unprecedented number of divorce requests when they re-opened in March. Italian lawyers report a 30 per cent increase in the number of couples embarking on divorce proceedings.The trend of 'COVID divorce' is also showing up in Canada. It's no wonder relationships are suffering. COVID-19 has wreaked havoc on our emotional and mental well-being. We've been living with health-related stress for months and add to that a lack of financial security and too much time on our hands, it's pushing relationships to the edge.Social isolation has been hard on couples that are not used to spending this much time together and a lack of outside time to regroup from arguments or stress can take its toll. But that doesn't mean it has to be over. There are some ways people can take stock of their relationship and make changes if they're motivated to do so.Some may wonder, why the increase in divorce? Isn't it just the pandemic that's making our relationships harder? And the answer to that is complex.It's playing a role, but it isn't the only reason, particularly for couples who are already dealing with marital problems. Those problems can become highly exaggerated when another major stressor enters the picture.But the pandemic has been atypically challenging because of the lockdown component. Couples may have already been arguing more frequently, or they've been growing apart and emotionally disconnected from each other and then suddenly they're forced to spend so much time together without a way to escape. The physical proximity can overwhelm couples. Another issue is the shared responsibility of household duties — often an issue even without a pandemic. New research shows women are working 20 more hours per week to balance family and work obligations. In general people are working 30 per cent more hours in the day to accomplish the same pre-pandemic goals.This workplace burnout is causing significant stress at home. Add to that, financial stress which happens to be one of the top reasons couples get divorced and there you have it — a recipe for the breakdown of a marriage already on the brink. When we face a major emotional event, particularly one of this magnitude, it forces us to take stock of our lives. We feel the limitations we have on time and our own mortality and that can speed up decisions, particularly about our relationships. Something that seemed acceptable before, may now seem intolerable.Crises can highlight the disparities in a relationship that won't be fixed after the pandemic is over. But, for some marriages, the pandemic has created a closeness and a bond that is unlike any time in their history. I've listened to stories of couples who are finally getting time together around the dinner table or one woman who said she finally gets her husband back after years of him travelling for work.Many relationships are being rekindled for the same reasons others are being divided.For many of those couples who live somewhere in the middle, this is the time to discuss whether it's the unsustainable stressors of COVID that is taking their marriage off course or if it's more than that. If it's something more, this would be a good time to get virtual access to counselling. Recognizing that this is an intensely challenging time, counselling can help generate a compassion and empathy reset. If it's the former, and you're a couple looking to find a healthy way back, there are ways to work on and revive your relationships.The most notable researchers, like Dr. John Gottman from the Gottman Institute and author of How to Make Love Last, believes that it is about figuring out how to really fall in love with your partner's qualities again.Typically, after the honeymoon phase ends, we fall into what psychologists call the partnership phase. This is considered healthy because it's much more sustainable than the passion-driven highs and lows of those first years. But we can fall into ruts and forget why we loved that person in the first place. The qualities and quirks that we used to love about our partner has over time, become irritating and frustrating. When that happens, we stop admiring and respecting those behaviours and actions. One of the ways to revive that part of the relationship is to make your relationship novel again, like how it was in the honeymoon phase.New or novel experiences elicit a high level of neurotransmitter activity in the brain. When you engage in new experiences with your partner, feelings similar to those you both experienced when you were initially dating can become activated. This happens because dopamine and norepinephrine levels — our brain's reward system – tend to increase dramatically when you engage in new experiences.I've had people say, well what can I do? Even in a pandemic, there are plenty of things we can still do that is novel. Couples therapist Dr. Brian Gersho suggests people be creative, cast a wide net, and don't hold back.For example:Just make sure that these are things that other partner will not despise and flat-out reject. Make sure it's a plan you make together. And, schedule your date nights/outings in advance and allow each partner to take turns planning the activity.This may seem oversimplified in the middle of everything feeling like it's falling apart around you. I want to make clear that I am not diminishing the pain of divorce or suggesting that a divorce can be fixed with a list of novel ideas. For some, divorce is the right decision for them and their families. "

Chinese oil company gets go-ahead for exploration drilling in Flemish Pass Basin | CBC News,The federal government has approved the proposal of a new offshore exploration drilling project set to begin in the Flemish Pass Basin — about 400 kilometres east of Newfoundland and Labrador.,2019-12-18T22:40:59.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/cnooc-exploration-drilling-flemish-pass-1.5401425,"The federal government has approved the proposal of a new offshore exploration drilling project set to begin in the Flemish Pass Basin — about 400 kilometres east of Newfoundland and Labrador. ""The decision was made following a thorough and science-based environmental assessment process concluding that the project is not likely to cause significant adverse environmental effects when mitigation measures are taken into account,"" the federal government said in a news release. Federal Environment and Climate Change Minister Jonathan Wilkinson established 101 legally binding conditions that the proponent, the China National Offshore Oil Corporation, must follow for the entirety of the project.CNOOC bid $300 million for two offshore exploration licenses.The conditions CNOOC must follow include measures to protect fish and fish habitat, migratory birds, the use of lands and resources by Indigenous peoples, and species at risk, according to the federal government. CNOOC can now proceed with obtaining additional permits from federal government departments as well as the Canada-Newfoundland and Labrador Offshore Petroleum Board.Provincial Natural Resources Minister Siobhan Coady said the proposal approval is a positive development for Newfoundland and Labrador's offshore oil industry. CNOOC, which has had offices in St. John's for several years, provided figures to the federal government indicating that 100 to 200 people would be working on the offshore drilling installation during its operation with equal that or more working in support activities.""A lot of the big players have come to Newfoundland and Labrador, and that's a very positive development. As you've seen over the last number of years [there] is increased interest in the offshore bidding processes,"" Coady said.""We have $4 billion committed to exploration offshore Newfoundland and Labrador. And that of course will drive success and drive discovery and that's what we hope to have happen."" Coady said through seismic review and independent verification there are an estimated 650 leads and prospects for offshore oil. ""There could be 650 Hibernias, in other words. I don't expect there is, but [there] will be discoveries made in offshore Newfoundland and Labrador and we want to make sure that companies are focused on environmental protection and, of course, safety of its workers,"" she said.On top of CNOOC, eight other new entrants have entered Newfoundland and Labrador offshore oil in the last number of years, according to Coady.Four other oil and gas companies are currently undergoing the federal environmental assessment process, which took CNOOC three years to wade through, but Coady said a regional assessment process should be online midway through 2020.Read more from CBC Newfoundland and Labrador"

The heavyweight financials sector was off 0.37 per cent as shares of Brookfield Asset Management Inc. lost 1.77 per cent, followed by the Bank of Montreal.Fehr said bank stocks are facing headwinds because the pace of loans isn't sustainable amid emerging economic weakness.""I think that's going to continue to be a headwind for banks overall and lest we forget interest rates continue to remain exceptionally low. So while that might be helpful for demand of loans, the profitability of those loans is a little bit impaired by the rate environment,"" he said in an interview.Industrials and technology were also lower.Materials led as the price of gold continued to rise. First Quantum Minerals Ltd. closed up nearly 10 per cent after it denied speculation last week about a possible bid for the company by Chinese mining company Jiangxi Copper Corp. Ltd.The December gold contract was up $16.40 US at $1,531.50 US an ounce and the December copper contract was up half a cent at $2.61 US a pound.Energy was up slightly on a lift in crude oil prices that helped Canadian Natural Resources and Encana Corp.The November crude contract was up 55 cents at $58.64 US per barrel and the November natural gas contract was unchanged at US$2.56 per mmBTU.The Canadian dollar traded for an average of 75.36 cents US compared with an average of 75.33 cents US on Friday.In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average was up 14.92 points at 26,949.99. The S&P 500 index was down 0.29 points at 2,991.78, while the Nasdaq composite was down 5.21 points at 8,112.46.U.S. markets were mixed while European and global equity markets were lower on data showing that Germany continues to grapple with a manufacturing slowdown that is hampering the growth of Europe's largest economy.In the backdrop are ongoing trade tensions between the United States and China.Both sides have suggested that last week's meetings were positive even though the Chinese delegation cancelled its tour of U.S. farms.Barring any major news, the market has interpreted no trade news as being positive, said Fehr.""The market is really looking for the big deal. The market is waiting to see if there will be some grand compromise which I think ultimately there can be but I don't think it's happening any time soon."""
Student union scrambled to help international students understand hurricane | CBC News,"Some international students in Cape Breton were not fully aware of the danger posed by last weekend's storm moving through the region. Now there is a call for an emergency plan involving students, the university and the municipality.",2019-09-13T09:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/international-students-hurricane-cape-breton-1.5281287,"While Nova Scotia prepared for the arrival of Hurricane Dorian last weekend, some newcomers to the province were left wondering how to do just that.About half of Cape Breton University's roughly 5,400 students are international students. According to student union vice-president Samual Shaji, many of those students had never experienced a hurricane and did not know what to expect.""They never thought there could be a power outage for two or three days,"" said Shaji, adding they encouraged students to buy things like bread and finish cooking supper by 6 p.m. before the storm rolled in.Although the university used social media and posters to encourage students to stay inside, Shaji said it didn't always translate well for some international students.That's in part because Canadian protocols for storms confused some of the students. For example, if there was a flood in India, residents would rely on local government and police for both information and instruction.""There would be cops with big speakers going through each and every street giving instructions,"" he said. ""So when we hear the word disaster these are the things in our minds.""Shaji said the onus to take precautions is more personal in Canada. That led to some students not understanding the severity of the storm.Several students went to Dominion Beach to check out the waves before being called back.While Shaji wanted international students to understand the severity of the storm, he said he also didn't want to frighten them. Some students were particularly worried after seeing footage of the Bahamas in the news.The student union put up posters regarding the storm and reached out to international students through social media to warn them.International students also faced another challenge during the storm when it was announced public transit would be taken off the roads at 7 p.m. Saturday. Many students rely on buses to get to and from work on the weekends.According to a spokesperson from CBU, the university encouraged students to check on the transit situation as the storm progressed. They university put updates on social media and fielded calls from students regarding which cabs were running.But Shaji said the student union had to explain to international students it was acceptable to call in to cancel their shifts or leave early if they didn't have a way home from work.He feared many students who live kilometres from the bus stops would walk home just as the hurricane was reaching the Sydney area.Reaching all of the international students and keeping them updated was complicated by the fact that some don't use the same social media platforms.According to Shaji, Indian students use the same social media platforms as Canadians, which meant notices put out by the university or municipality were easily found on Instagram or Facebook.However, Shaji worries even the student union's information didn't reach international students from South Korea and China. They use their own social media platforms.The student union was in contact with the municipality throughout the weekend gathering information. Mayor Cecil Clarke said the municipality would be looking into its communications with both newcomers and locals in the future.""We have thousands of new citizens … that don't understand our protocols when there is a major weather event,"" said Clarke.Shaji wants the municipality, university, and student union to work together on an emergency plan.MORE TOP STORIES"

Chinese bid for Aecon construction comes with warnings for Trudeau Liberals | CBC News,The government says that Canada's pursuit of deeper trade relations with China is full steam ahead despite suggestions that such enthusiasm could risk angering the Trump administration during NAFTA talks.,2017-10-29T17:39:43.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/china-aecon-purchase-warnings-trudeau-liberals-1.4377577,"The Trudeau Liberals are facing warnings to proceed cautiously and in as transparent a manner as possible as they weigh a Chinese state-owned company's bid to take over Aecon construction, which has headquarters in Toronto, Calgary and Vancouver.The warnings come in the face of strong affirmations by the Liberal government that Canada's pursuit of deeper trade relations with China is full steam ahead despite suggestions that such enthusiasm could risk angering the Trump administration during the North American Free Trade renegotiations.CCCC International Holding Ltd. of China has made a $1.5-billion bid to buy Aecon Group Inc., which has a storied 140-year history in landmark Canadian construction and engineering projects such as the CN Tower, Vancouver's SkyTrain and the Halifax Shipyard.CCCC International has some less auspicious recent history. The World Bank banned it from bidding on construction projects for eight years until this past January because of a bid-rigging scandal in the Philippines.The state-owned company has also been linked to the construction of artificial islands in the South China Sea, which has created high tension between China and several Asian countries.The government says it will review the offer to decide if there is a ""net benefit"" to Canada as required, but has not made clear whether a national security test will be imposed on the company. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said the deal will be reviewed ""very carefully"" under the Canada Investment Act.Rejecting the deal would anger China, which is anxious to start free trade talks with Canada, and maintains that an eventual deal would provide more certainty for its potential investors in Canada.David Mulroney, a former Canadian ambassador to China, urged the government to keep its guard up in the face of shifting circumstances with Beijing.""We can't make every decision with a view to making the Chinese happy. The more you do that, the more bad deals come your way from China,"" said Mulroney.""You have to show there are limits to our flexibility. We have real standards and we will live up to them.""Canada needs to pursue free trade talks with China otherwise it will become ""hostage to an American negotiating strategy and the fate of NAFTA,"" said Paul Evans, of the School of Public Policy and Global Affairs at the University of British Columbia.But the government needs to exercise caution when it weighs all investment bids by China, he said.""There is still a high degree of wariness about FDI (foreign direct investment) and particularly from state-owned enterprises,"" said Evans.""It's going to be really important for the government to be both transparent and forthcoming on what are the calculations that lay beneath their decision on either national security or net benefit to Canada.""The Chinese embassy in Ottawa argues the Aecon acquisition is in Canada's interest, saying it is ""purely a commercial activity.""In a statement to The Canadian Press, the embassy said conducting a security review is a matter of ""internal affairs"" for Canada. But it said the deal would be in the economic interest of Canada.""We have learned that in recent years, a number of Canadian companies, acquired by Chinese companies, have not only ceased to lose and begun to turn out a profit, increased employment, but also entered a broader platform for development,"" the embassy said.""There are numerous such successful stories.""The government faced criticism earlier this year when it allowed the takeover of Norsat by China-based Hytera Communications Co. Ltd. without a full national security review. Vancouver-based Norsat makes radio systems and transceivers used by the American military and other NATO partners.In 2012, the Harper government allowed Chinese state-owned CNOOC Ltd. to purchase Calgary-based Nexen Inc. for $15.1-billion in what was then the largest oil and gas purchase by China. But then-prime minister Stephen Harper said the takeovers would not be allowed to continue unless there were ""exceptional"" circumstances.Wariness about deepening ties with China surfaced again this past week.Following a similar warning this spring from the former interim Conservative leader Rona Ambrose, ex-industry minister James Moore, also a member of the government's NAFTA advisory panel, said Ottawa risks angering President Donald Trump if it pursues free trade talks with China. Trump has a history of anti-China rhetoric.Trudeau, Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland and a spokesman for International Trade Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne have since dismissed Moore, saying it remains in Canada's interest to push forward, unabated, with China.""There's an argument to be made that demonstrating that we have a diversification and a broader range of interests than simple dependence on NAFTA might actually strengthen our NAFTA negotiating position,"" Trudeau said. "

By the skin of their teeth: Americans somehow survive Turkey at FIBA World Cup | CBC Sports,"Khris Middleton's two free throws with 2.1 seconds remaining in overtime saved the United States from what would have been a shocking loss, and the two-time defending champion Americans somehow rallied to beat Turkey 93-92 in a World Cup Group E game on Tuesday night.",2019-09-03T16:54:43.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/sports/basketball/basketball-world-cup-usa-turkey-1.5268765,"In the ultimate moments, everything hinged on free throws.Turkey missed them.The U.S. made them.And that is how the Americans escaped what would have been a massive World Cup upset. Khris Middleton's two foul shots with 2.1 seconds left in overtime capped a wild finish to a wild game, as the U.S. held off Turkey 93-92 in a Group E game on Tuesday night — a contest that the underdogs simply gave away in the final moments.""It was a heck of a game,"" U.S. coach Gregg Popovich said. ""As we all know, it was anybody's game. We will accept the win.""The U.S. wasted a 15-point lead in the first half, didn't trail until the final moments of regulation, needed two free throws from Jayson Tatum with one-tenth of a second left just to get into overtime, came back from five points down in the extra session and — if all that wasn't enough — needed Turkey to go 0 for 4 from the foul line in the last 9 seconds.""It means a lot. It means a lot, man,"" U.S. guard Kemba Walker said.Dogus Balbay missed a pair following an intentional foul with the U.S. down one, and Cedi Osman missed two more about a second later. Those misses by Osman set up the last U.S. possession, one where Tatum controlled a rebound, brought the ball down and found Middleton for a drive to the rim. Tatum went down, spraining his left ankle on the play.The U.S. didn't go down with him.Middleton made both, Ersan Ilyasova missed a jumper for Turkey as time expired and the U.S. survived.""It really hurts,"" Turkey's Furkan Korkmaz said. ""I think it was in our hands — not their hands.""Middleton led the U.S. with 15 points. Walker, who single-handedly accounted for the rally from down five, scored 14. Tatum finished with 11 points and 11 rebounds.Ilyasova led Turkey with 23 points. Melih Mahmutoglu had 18, Furkan Korkmaz scored 16 and Osman added 15 for Turkey — which was within a hair of one of the biggest wins in its basketball history, on a night when it seemed like all 18,000 whistling and hooting fans at the Shanghai Oriental Sports Center were in their favour.""I need mental strength to overcome this,"" Turkey coach Ufuk Sarica said.The Americans have now won 21 consecutive World Cup games, extending the record for any nation at FIBA's signature event. The U.S. also extended its winning streak to 55 games in international tournaments with NBA players on the roster, starting with the bronze-medal game at the 2006 world championships.And they clinched a spot in the second round — though that seemed ancillary.""We capped it off at the end,"" U.S. centre Myles Turner said. ""All that matters. JT, Kemba, Khris, a lot of guys made big plays down the stretch.""Ilyasova's tip-in with 12.3 seconds remaining in regulation gave Turkey its first lead at 81-79. Turkey had gone 0 for 9 on shots to take the lead before Ilyasova's swat bounced off the rim and dropped through the net.The U.S. went for the win on the ensuing possession, first with Middleton missing a 3-pointer and then the ball finding Tatum as the last seconds ticked away. He got fouled by Osman as he took a 3-point attempt from the top of the key; the scoreboard showed no time left, but officials put one-tenth of a second on after review.He made the first. The second rimmed out. The third, with the game on the line, rattled home.""JT, that kid is 21 years old, man,"" Walker said of his Boston teammate. ""He was huge for us.""The U.S. led 41-26 in the second quarter when Turkey got a spark from a guard — from Gainesville, Florida.Scottie Wilbekin, who played four years of college ball for Florida and got his Turkish passport last year, fueled a 12-0 run that awoke the pro-Turkey crowd. He got it going with a 3-pointer, fed Ilyasova for another 3 not long afterward and converted a four-point play with 3:12 left in the half.The U.S. lead was 46-41 at the break, Turkey tied the game in the third quarter, and it stayed tight the rest of the way.""Every team wants to beat us,"" Turner said. ""Every team will give us their best shot. But more than anything, we stick together."""

B.C. judge considers how to deliver Meng Wanzhou decision in a physically distant way | CBC News,The B.C. Supreme Court is considering creative ways to deliver a decision in an extradition hearing for Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou as a global pandemic restricts travel and gatherings.,2020-03-31T03:04:08.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/b-c-judge-considers-how-to-deliver-meng-wanzhou-decision-in-a-physically-distant-way-1.5515646,"The B.C. Supreme Court is considering creative ways to deliver a decision in an extradition hearing for Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou as a global pandemic restricts travel and gatherings.Associate Chief Justice Heather Holmes convened a meeting Monday between Crown prosecutors, defence lawyers, Meng and her interpreter via teleconference.The United States is seeking Meng's extradition on fraud charges and the court heard arguments in January about whether her alleged conduct would constitute a crime in Canada. Her defence has made an application to the court contending that the case against her does not pass the so-called ""double criminality"" test.A court transcript shows Holmes told those who dialled in that she does not plan to release her decision on that application ""in the near future.""But when the decision is released and if the COVID-19 crisis is still ongoing, one of Meng's lawyers outlined a proposal that would require Meng's physical presence in court only if Holmes rules in her favour.According to the transcript, defence lawyer David Martin says there is a need for an in-person appearance only if the judgment falls in her favour.""Ms. Meng would only appear if the circumstances were appropriate, but the suggestion that she not appear if the application was dismissed is motivated by a concern for the court's and its staff's health and safety,'' Martin said during the conference.Holmes said she would take the proposal into account and the interests of the public, media and whatever safety restrictions are in place at the time.The case is adjourned until April 27, when another case management meeting is scheduled. Holmes warned Meng that the next meeting would also likely be conducted via teleconference.Meng is accused of lying to HSBC about Huawei's relationship with an Iran-based subsidiary, putting the bank at risk of violating American sanctions against Iran.Her defence has argued that the court must dismiss the case because Canada has rejected similar sanctions, while the Crown said the judge's job is to determine if there's evidence of fraud, not to uphold Canadian sovereignty.Holmes' ruling on the test of ""double criminality'' will determine if Meng is set free or if the court will hear further arguments, including whether her arrest at Vancouver's airport in December 2018 was unlawful.Court hearings have been cancelled across Canada due to COVID-19 and directions from public health officials prohibiting large gatherings. But those on the conference call said they wanted to keep pushing Meng's case forward.""This is a unique case occurring in unique times, but it's important, and this has been communicated with my learned friends, to keep this litigation moving forward as best as possible despite the difficult circumstances,'' prosecutor John Gibb-Carsley said.While counsel participated by phone, Holmes was in court and counted eight other people in the room, saying she directed the sheriffs to ensure everyone obeyed social distancing regulations.Given widespread public interest in the case, Holmes suggested teleconferencing is not a long-term solution. Meng's arrest in December 2018 at Vancouver's airport ignited diplomatic tensions between Canada and China.The detention of Canadians Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor in China the same month is widely viewed as retaliation for her arrest.Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the Chinese embassy in Canada said earlier this month that Kovrig was allowed to have a telephone conversation with his father, who is very ill.The embassy said in a statement that they allowed this for humanitarian reasons, and it also says Kovrig and Spavor were being given better food to strengthen their immunity against the novel coronavirus, which originated in China."

Sun served a three-month ban in 2014 for a positive test.If WADA wins, the three-time Olympic freestyle champion will miss the 2020 Tokyo Games.WADA has challenged world swimming body FINA's ruling to merely warn Sun after a disputed attempt by sample collectors to take blood and urine from him at his home in China in September 2018. The late-night confrontation lasted from 11 p.m. to beyond 3:30 a.m.The day-long hearing will examine why a secure box storing a glass vial of blood came to be destroyed by Sun's entourage, who questioned the sample team's authority. A FINA tribunal panel agreed the officials lacked proper credentials to make the sample collection valid.WADA believes Sun broke anti-doping rules by refusing to submit to a sample collection.All sides agreed to Sun's request to hold a first CAS appeal in public for 20 years. A verdict is unlikely until early next year."

The officers retreated into a building. One officer who fell was beaten by members of the crowd, CBC's Chris Brown reported.Sunday's biggest showdown took place on a major street in the outlying Tsuen Wan district following a protest march that ended in a nearby park. While a large crowd rallied in the park, a group of hardline protesters took over a main street, strewing bamboo poles on the pavement and lining up orange and white traffic barriers and cones to obstruct police.After hoisting warning flags, police used tear gas to try to disperse the crowd. Protesters responded by throwing bricks and gasoline bombs.The result was a surreal scene of small fires and scattered paving bricks on the street between the two sides, rising clouds of tear gas, and green and blue laser lights pointed by the protesters at the police.The protesters eventually decided to abandon their position. Two water cannon trucks and a phalanx of police vehicles with flashing lights joined riot police on foot as they advanced up the street. They met little resistance. Television footage showed a water cannon being fired once, but perhaps more as a test, as it didn't appear to reach the retreating protesters.Some protesters said they are resorting to violence because the government has not responded to their peaceful demonstrations.""The escalation you're seeing now is just a product of our government's indifference toward the people of Hong Kong,"" said Rory Wong, who was at the clash after the march.One neighbourhood resident, Dong Wong, complained about the tear gas.""I live on the 15th floor and I can even smell it at home,"" he said. ""I have four dogs, sneezing, sneezing all day. ... The protesters didn't do anything, they just blocked the road to protect themselves.""Officers pulled their guns after protesters chased them down a street with sticks and rods, calling them ""gangsters."" Public broadcaster RTHK said one of its reporters saw a uniformed officer fire a shot into the sky.Earlier Sunday, tens of thousands of umbrella-carrying protesters marched in the rain. Many filled Tsuen Wan Park, the endpoint of the rally, chanting, ""Fight for freedom, stand with Hong Kong,"" the South China Morning Post newspaper reported.The march in Hong Kong's New Territories started near the Kwai Fong train station, which has become a focal point for protesters after police used tear gas there earlier this month. Police with riot gear could be seen moving into position along the march route.Protesters have taken to the semiautonomous Chinese territory's streets for more than two months. Their demands include democratic elections and an investigation into police use of force to quell the protests.A large group clashed with police on Saturday after a march in the Kowloon Bay neighbourhood, building barricades and setting fires in the streets. Police said they arrested 29 people for various offences, including unlawful assembly, possession of offensive weapons and assaulting police officers.The clashes, while not as prolonged or violent as some earlier ones, ended a brief lull in the violence. The protests had turned largely peaceful the previous weekend, after weeks of escalating violence.In nearby Macao, another Chinese territory, a pro-Beijing committee chose a businessman as the gambling hub's next leader with little of the controversy surrounding the government in Hong Kong.Ho Iat-seng, running unopposed, will succeed current leader Chui Sai-on in December. Asked about the protests in Hong Kong, the 62-year-old Ho said they would end eventually, like a major typhoon.Protesters in Hong Kong have demanded that the city's leader, Carrie Lam, also chosen by a pro-Beijing committee, step down, though that demand has evolved into a broader call for fully democratic elections."
Your recycling could become trash: The 'golden age' of recycling is coming to an end | CBC Radio,"With China banning more recycling imports, Canadian municipalities will see no place for their mounting waste to go but into the landfill.",2017-12-27T12:50:54.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/radio/thecurrent/the-current-for-december-26-2017-1.4462065/your-recycling-could-become-trash-the-golden-age-of-recycling-is-coming-to-an-end-1.4462101,"View Segment TranscriptAs of January 1, 2018, China will no longer import much of the plastic and paper we have been shipping there for decades.China is the world's biggest importer of recycled materials, unloading the burden from countries like Canada and the U.S.Adam Minter, a Bloomberg columnist and author of Junkyard Planet: Travels in the Billion-Dollar Trash Trade, describes China's change in policy as ""a massive deal.""""It's going to be disruptive both within and outside of China,"" he tells The Current's guest host Catherine Cullen.Minter says the shift is informed by China's desire to protect importers from bad trades and keep used goods from flooding its markets. Accordingly, China is unlikely to revert or delay the policy, despite international pressure.So what happens if there's no longer a market for all of our recyclables?In what many are calling a ""waste crisis,"" Canadian municipalities are already finding they have no place for their mounting trash to go — but into the landfill.Matt Keliher, the manager of solid waste for Halifax, is among those dealing with this landslide firsthand. Keliher is seeking special permission from Nova Scotia to dump growing piles of plastic, the size of houses.""The province has banned basically every material in this facility from going to landfill. The challenge is when there's no market to take it, it's not recyclable anymore and it needs to find a home. And unfortunately landfilling is the only available option at this point.""In addition to environmental concerns, Minter says municipalities are going to take a significant hit financially, given that they were selling off their recycling material to China.""Now that the party's over these various programs have to figure out where to send this recycling and how to replace these revenues.""""The individual recycler is probably going to be asked to pay more for their recycling down the line.""Listen to the full segment at the top of this post.This segment was produced by Halifax network producer, Mary-Catherine McIntosh."

It also offers delivery in 30 minutes or less, and says it gives customers refunds for any delays or spilled drinks.Luckin raised $561 million in its initial public offering Friday by selling 33 million American depositary shares (ADS) at $17 apiece. That values the company at around $4 billion US. The ADS, which is trading on the Nasdaq under the symbol ""LK,"" shot up 44 per cent to $24.50 Friday. An ADS is a U.S. dollar-denominated equity share of a foreign-based company that can be bought or traded on a U.S. stock exchange.Luckin has never been profitable. It brought in $125 million in revenue last year, but spent much more than that on coffee beans, store rent and other costs. Last year, it lost $475 million."
"Investing in conservation generates huge returns for economy, study finds | CBC News","With Earth's wildlife now facing an extinction crisis, a group of economists and scientists is hoping to persuade governments that it pays to protect nature.",2020-07-08T19:05:19.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/conservation-economy-1.5642220,"With Earth's wildlife now facing an extinction crisis, a group of economists and scientists is hoping to persuade governments that it pays to protect nature.Specifically, expanding areas under conservation could yield a return of at least $5 for every $1 spent just by giving nature more room to thrive.That in turn would boost agricultural and forestry yields, improve freshwater supplies, preserve wildlife and help fight climate change — all of which would boost global economic output on average by about $337 billion ($250 billion US) annually, the group of more than 100 researchers argues in a paper published online Wednesday by The Campaign for Nature, a coalition of conservation organizations from around the world.The work represents one of the most comprehensive studies of the potential economic benefits from protecting nature — a research area fraught with best-guess estimates on the monetary value of animals, plants and ecosystems left intact.Released as the United Nations lobbies governments to set aside 30 per cent of their land and sea by 2030, the report aims to challenge the notion that conservation is costly.""You cannot put a price tag on nature, but the economic numbers point to its protection,"" said Anthony Waldron, an ecologist at the University of Cambridge who lead the group examining the economic implications of designating a third of the Earth as a nature reserve.Others question how precise accounting for nature's economic contribution is even possible, said Bram Büscher, a political scientist at Wageningen University & Research in the Netherlands.""What are two ducks worth? And would these ducks in the U.S. be the same as in Latin America? And how would you compare those things, and what would be their role?"" Büscher told Reuters.Leaning too heavily on economic arguments could also backfire, if governments end up opening areas deemed valuable to the highest bidders, warned Julia Steinberger, an environmental economist at the University of Leeds.""All it takes is one lobbyist to come along and say, 'This program is no longer economically viable,'"" Steinberger said. ""That's the risk we see when we tie environmental protection to economic performance.""But even a rough estimate of nature's economic value is better than nothing, given the scale of what is at stake, the report's authors argue. Scientists estimate that at least a million species are facing extinction in the next few decades, largely due to human-driven activities including habitat loss, pollution and climate change.Hoping to halt the global die-off, 30 countries are already backing a draft document pledging to conserve 30 per cent of the Earth's surface by 2030, which will be discussed at the UN Biodiversity Convention postponed to next year in Kunming, China.Currently, about 15 per cent of the Earth's land and 7 per cent of the ocean has some degree of protection.A 30 per cent conservation goal, aside from producing natural resources like fish stocks and timber, would also help to guarantee healthy ecosystems that provide an additional $472 billion ($350 billion US) a year in services that are essential to life, including filtering water, clearing air pollutants or preventing coastal erosion, the report said.Such a goal would require an average annual investment of roughly $189 billion ($140 billion US) by 2030, the researchers estimated. Currently, about $32 billion ($24 billion US) is spent globally per year on protecting natural areas, they said.""The well-being of humanity and global economic prosperity depends on us fixing our broken relationship with nature,"" said report co-author Enric Sala, an ocean explorer in residence at National Geographic Society.The report said that a major expansion in protected areas would have to be managed carefully to ensure that the economic benefits were spread evenly throughout populations.But first, countries have to join the effort. And even then, compliance is not guaranteed. Despite having more than 190 countries pledge to fight climate change under the 2015 Paris Agreement, emissions of heat-trapping gases continue to rise.Nevertheless, with some U.S. states pledging to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, there is growing interest in finding ways to account for the economic benefits provided by forests and other ecosystems, said economist John Talberth at the Center For Sustainable Economy in Portland, Oregon.Understanding these economic benefits can also help policymakers decide, for example, whether a forest can be felled for timber or better left untouched to absorb carbon dioxide and support wildlife or water cycles. ""The climate crisis has put a foot on the accelerator of getting this done,"" Talberth said."

Video game company backpedals after disqualifying esports player for political comments | CBC News,Video game behemoth Activision Blizzard is returning prize money and reducing its ban on a Hong Kong-based pro esports player who made political comments on air after a win.,2019-10-12T21:10:06.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/blizzard-backpedals-decision-1.5317629,"Video game behemoth Activision Blizzard is returning prize money and reducing its ban on a Hong Kong-based pro esports player who made political comments on air after a win.The company, which faced international backlash for its initial decision, says it ""reacted too quickly"" when it slapped a one-year ban on Ng Wai Chung, known under the stagename Blitzchung, and rescinded thousands of dollars in winnings after the gamer shouted a pro-democracy slogan at the Hearthstone Grandmasters tournament last weekend.""We've had a chance to pause, to listen to our community, and to reflect on what we could have done better,"" said Blizzard president J. Allen Brack in a lengthy statement Friday. ""In hindsight, our process wasn't adequate, and we reacted too quickly.""The American company is responsible for some of the industry's biggest hits including World of Warcraft, StarCraft, Overwatch and the Call of Duty franchise. Blizzard's second quarter net revenue for 2019 was $1.4 billion US.The backpedaling comes after there were threats by major players to boycott the business, prompting the hashtag #BoycottBlizzard to trend worldwide. There were also reports of various forms of protest by Blizzard employees, including a staged walkout at the company's campus in Irvine, Calif., and company signs saying ""Think Globally"" and ""Every Voice Matters"" being covered up.Not everyone at Blizzard agrees with what happened.<br><br>Both the ""Think Globally"" and ""Every Voice Matters"" values have been covered up by incensed employees this morning. <a href=""https://t.co/I7nAYUes6Q"">pic.twitter.com/I7nAYUes6Q</a>While being interviewed on a Twitch broadcast following his match at the Hearthstone streaming event Oct. 6, Ng donned a gas mask similar to those worn by Hong Kong protesters and said in Mandarin: ""Liberate Hong Kong, the revolution of our times.""Watch the interview with esports pro player Ng Wai Chung, known as Blitzchung, that led to his suspension[BREAKING] Hong Kong Hearthstone player <a href=""https://twitter.com/blitzchungHS?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">@blitzchungHS</a> calls for liberation of his country in post-game interview:<a href=""https://t.co/3AgQAaPioj"">https://t.co/3AgQAaPioj</a><br><br> <a href=""https://twitter.com/Matthieist?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">@Matthieist</a> <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/Hearthstone?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#Hearthstone</a> <a href=""https://t.co/DnaMSEaM4g"">pic.twitter.com/DnaMSEaM4g</a>The phrase, a slogan used in the pro-democracy movement, was considered to be a violation of tournament rules, which allow for disqualification if a player is brought into ""public disrepute"" or ""damages"" Blizzard's image.""There is a consequence for taking the conversation away from the purpose of the event and disrupting or derailing the broadcast,"" said Brack.Blizzard was perceived to be siding with communist-led China — the country is a huge market for gaming and a Chinese holding company has a five per cent stake in Blizzard. Decision-makers were quickly criticized, putting them on the defensive.""I want to be clear: Our relationships in China had no influence on our decision,"" Brack said in the statement. ""If this had been the opposing viewpoint delivered in the same divisive and deliberate way, we would have felt and acted the same.""It's the latest example of how the entertainment world is trying to navigate the sensitive and complex issues surrounding the Hong Kong protests.Anti-government protesters have been demonstrating for months, accusing China of stifling Hong Kong's territorial freedoms, which were guaranteed in the 1997 handover.China denies the accusations. Political commentary on both sides has drawn unsuspecting but prominent figures into the conflict.The NBA recently took heat over a pro-Hong Kong tweet by the general manager of the Houston Rockets, Daryl Morey. Morey was forced to apologize, insisting he ""always appreciated the significant support"" of Chinese fans and sponsors.2/ I have always appreciated the significant support our Chinese fans and sponsors have provided and I would hope that those who are upset will know that offending or misunderstanding them was not my intention. My tweets are my own and in no way represent the Rockets or the NBA.And when creators of the animated comedy South Park did an episode satirizing Hollywood and its efforts to access China's vast consumer market, there were efforts to hastily remove the show from the Chinese internet. The move prompted the series to tweet a parody apology.The star of Disney's upcoming Mulan waded into the debate in August, voicing her support for the Hong Kong police force. It drew both praise from some and calls by others to boycott her film.In a statement, Ng, 21, said he was ""grateful for Blizzard reconsidering its position."" He said he still feels the revised six-month suspension is too long but appreciated the company recognizing he ""played fair in the tournament"" and returning his winnings.""In the future, I will be more careful on that and express my opinions or show my support to Hong Kong on my personal platforms,"" Ng said in a statement Saturday. "

It owns fashion names such as Christian Dior, Fendi, Louis Vuitton and Givenchy as well as watchmaker Tag Heuer.It would also give LVMH a much broader foothold in the United States and broaden its offerings in jewelry.LVMH cautioned in a brief statement that ""there can be no assurance that these discussions will result in any agreement.""Tiffany said the offer was for $120 a share, which is about $14.5 billion. The Wall Street Journal first reported on the offer over the weekend.The New York-based company said Monday that it was considering the offer. Its shares jumped 31 per cent to $128.81 in premarket trading in New York.The offer comes as luxury goods companies have been wrestling with changing habits of shoppers who are increasingly buying online. They're also purchasing second-hand luxury items from places like The RealReal.com.In addition, luxury companies are facing fears of an economic slowdown in China, a key area of business, while they're already dealing with a slowdown in international tourism in the U.S.Under its CEO Alessandro Bogliolo, Tiffany is trying to appeal to younger shoppers with more modern takes on jewelry. Earlier this year, it launched a men's jewelry collection, and it's increasing its marketing to a more diverse customer base like same-sex couples. It's also been renovating its flagship store in Manhattan.Tiffany has struggled with stagnating sales as China's slowing economy has weighed on spending by Chinese tourists, who make up a substantial portion of luxury spending. The strong U.S. dollar has also made Tiffany products more expensive for consumers outside the U.S.""We believe Tiffany has many characteristics that are difficult to replicate and represent competitive advantages,"" wrote Oliver Chen, luxury analyst at Cowen & Co., an investment research firm.

Chinese army releases promo video for its troops in Hong Kong | CBC News,The Chinese army has released a promotional video for its Hong Kong-based troops at a time of uncertainty over whether its troops will intervene in the city's summer of protest.,2019-08-01T11:36:35.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/china-army-promotional-video-hong-kong-1.5232747,"The Chinese army has released a promotional video for its Hong Kong-based troops at a time of uncertainty over whether the military will intervene in the city's summer of protest.On the eve of Thursday's anniversary of the army's founding, the Hong Kong Garrison of China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) posted on its official social media account a three-minute video showing soldiers rappelling from helicopters, aiming sniper rifles and, in one sequence, throwing tear gas at a crowd dressed as civilians.This section of the footage, labelled ""anti-riot drill,"" shows armed soldiers in riot gear launching tear gas canisters and shooting water cannons in a scene with stark similarities to the current situation in Hong Kong, where the police have used tear gas, pepper spray and rubber bullets to quell pro-democracy demonstrators.Soldiers in the video hold up a red warning banner that declares: ""Stop Charging Or We Use Force."" A similar banner is used by Hong Kong police when they quell protests.""All consequences are at your own risk,"" one soldier shouted in Cantonese, the main Chinese dialect in Hong Kong, during the video clip.Some of the targeted civilians shown in the army video are wearing helmets and masks, much like those worn by protesters who have taken to Hong Kong's streets in the hundreds of thousands over the past two months.Watch part of the promotional video released by the Chinese army's Hong Kong Garrison: CBC NewsAt the end of the drill, soldiers are seen taking some handcuffed civilians away.This week, Hong Kong police arrested 44 people on rioting charges, which carry a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment. It's the first time authorities have resorted to using the rioting charge.A former British colony, Hong Kong was returned to China in 1997 on the principle of ""one country, two systems."" The framework promises Hong Kong certain democratic freedoms not afforded to the mainland. In recent years, however, Hong Kong residents have complained that Beijing is increasingly encroaching on their freedoms.An undercurrent of distrust for the Communist Party-led central government has propelled the mass demonstrations, which began in response to extradition legislation that would have allowed Hong Kong residents to be sent to mainland China to stand trial. Hong Kong suspended the bill, but protests have continued unabated over broader demands for greater democratic rights and government accountability.As the movement has progressed, both protesters and police have at times resorted to violence.In response to questions about whether the army will be sent in to handle demonstrators, Chinese officials have pointed to an article in Hong Kong's Garrison Law stating that troops already stationed in the city can be deployed at the request of the Hong Kong government.Article 14 of the Basic Law, Hong Kong's mini-constitution, says PLA troops ""shall not interfere"" in local affairs, but that Hong Kong's government can ask for assistance from the garrison ""in the maintenance of public order and in disaster relief.""In remarks ahead of Thursday's anniversary, garrison commander Maj.-Gen. Chen Daoxiang said Beijing ""firmly supports"" Hong Kong's embattled leader Carrie Lam and moves by police and the courts to enforce the law and punish ""violent criminals.""""And we firmly support the patriotic people in Hong Kong in defending the rule of law in Hong Kong and safeguarding national sovereignty and security and Hong Kong's prosperity and stability,"" Chen said.""We believe that the PLA force stationed in Hong Kong will continue to be the anchor for Hong Kong's long-term prosperity and stability.""Hong Kong's police chiefs have insisted their forces are capable of maintaining order without the assistance of Chinese troops.Any use of the PLA against protesters would conjure up memories of the army's bloody June 1989 crackdown on student pro-democracy protests centred on Beijing's Tiananmen Square in which hundreds, possibly thousands were killed. The PLA struggled in the years afterward to rehabilitate its reputation after turning its guns on its own people.The world's largest standing army, the PLA is actually the military wing of the ruling Communist Party with explicit instructions to follow the orders of the party, not the Hong Kong government."

Top U.S. general says competition with old foes requires new strategies | CBC News,America's top soldier says the world is witnessing a return of an open competition between the U.S. and its allies and old adversaries Russia and China.,2018-11-17T17:45:36.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/u-s-general-nato-halifax-security-hall-1.4910319,"America's top soldier says the world is witnessing a return of an open competition between the U.S. and its allies and old adversaries Russia and China.Gen. Joseph Dunford says the U.S. is having to adapt its military strategy to confront new challenges presented by the re-emergence of these old foes.That's a change from the 1990s and early part of this century, when the Allies could ""project power when and where necessary to advance our collective interests relatively uncontested,"" he told delegates at the Halifax International Security Forum on Saturday.""The military dimension of that great power competition is, in fact, the efforts that China and Russia in particular have taken to undermine the credibility of the U.S. and its allies to meet Alliance commitment, whether it be in Europe or in China,"" Dunford said.  Dunford insists the U.S. and its allies continue to have a competitive advantage over any adversary, but he's not complacent about the need to modernize and to address new threats such as cyber-warfare and violent extremism.""We do have a technological advantage over Russia and China,"" he said. ""But if you look at the investments they have made over the past decade, they have invested at a greater rate for tomorrow than we have.""This week a report by civilian and military experts warned that the 2018 U.S. National Defence Strategy lacks the needed financial resources, and warned that, despite the new focus on Russia and China, the U.S. risked being overwhelmed by those countries if there was a conflict.As chair of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, Dunford oversees the work of every branch of the U.S. armed forces and is responsible for meeting the objectives of the defence strategy.""We don't say that, necessarily, competition equals conflict. But, again, in the military dimension, our responsibility is to assure our partners that we can deter potential adversaries. We can respond in the event deterrence fails,"" Dunford says.Canada is facing similar challenges in responding to the ever-changing nature of security threats.Gen. Jonathan Vance, chief of the defence staff, told CBC's The House this weekend that the Trudeau government's defence policy requires armed forces to take a more holistic approach to security issues. That includes working with the Americans to modernize NORAD to deter incursions by Russian submarines in Canada's Arctic, and to address the continued nuclear posturing of North Korea.""We have to think about new ways to deal with these threats. Not everything is a shoot-down type of scenario,"" he said. ""We have to watch technology and those things that, at a strategic level, could cause potential harm to our countries.""The policy also led Canada to contribute a warship to U.S. naval exercises in the South China Sea, to deter China from unilaterally laying claim to international waters.""Exercising freedom of navigation through the vital trade routes in the South China Sea is simply a continuation of the international norms that the world needs to be prosperous and  safe,"" Vance said.Power and PoliticsBoth military leaders also spoke in Halifax about the military's role in dealing with potential threats posed by mass human migration around the world, as people seek safer havens to escape poverty and violence.President Donald Trump ordered more than 5,000 U.S. troops to the border with Mexico to stop the so-called caravan of migrants heading north from Central America.Dunford told the forum that the role of soldiers is to support the work of police and border patrol officers with the Department of Homeland Security.""Nothing we are doing is illegal. I can tell you we looked at that very carefully,"" he said. ""We are not coming in contact with the migrants. Our job is not to deny access to migrants to the United States. I think it's important people understand that.""Vance told The House that mass migration is a problem, but the answer is not to thwart migrants, but to address the reasons they are on the move.""And these things tend to be tied together. We must understand that problems are not in and of themselves for the military to solve or to define. More and more the security threats we face, the defence threats that we face, can be seen through so many lenses that we have to tie it all together.""Earlier this month, the Trudeau government unveiled a campaign to inform Canadians of the benefits of immigration. The campaign followed weeks of pressure from the opposition Conservatives who've called the influx of asylum-seekers from the U.S. a crisis.At the same time, Canada Border Services Agency is stepping up efforts to deport failed refugee complainants. More than 68,000 asylum-seekers have crossed the border into Canada since the beginning of last year."

Chaos as Hong Kong lawmakers thwart leader's annual address | CBC News,"In chaotic scenes, furious pro-democracy lawmakers twice forced Hong Kong's leader to stop delivering a speech laying out her policy objectives and clamoured for her to resign after she walked out of the legislature on Wednesday and then delivered the annual address 75 minutes late via television.",2019-10-16T06:19:24.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/hong-kong-lawmakers-thwart-annual-address-1.5322330,"In chaotic scenes, furious pro-democracy lawmakers twice forced Hong Kong's leader to stop delivering a speech laying out her policy objectives and clamoured for her to resign after she walked out of the legislature on Wednesday and then delivered the annual address 75 minutes late via television.Carrie Lam's inability to deliver her policy address inside the Legislative Council marked a slap in the face for the embattled chief executive grappling with anti-government protests now in their fifth month.When Lam started delivering the speech, she was shouted down by chanting pro-democracy lawmakers who held aloft placards showing her waving with hands coloured blood-red.She left the chamber and then came back a few minutes later to try again, only to be interrupted one more time. Again, she left. One lawmaker wearing a paper mask showing the face of Chinese President Xi Jinping tossed a placard as Lam was leaving.Finally, 75 minutes after the previously scheduled start of the lengthy address, Lam delivered it via video link, with China's yellow-starred red flag to her right and Hong Kong's flag on her left.Describing the semi-autonomous Chinese city as going through ""major crisis,"" Lam said: ""People are asking: Will Hong Kong return to normal?""She appealed for its 7.5 million citizens to ""cherish the city,"" warning that ""continued violence and spread of hatred will erode the core values of Hong Kong.""Standing ramrod-straight, she then launched into a dry and detailed explanation of plans to tackle Hong Kong's shortage of affordable housing, a long-standing source of discontent, and other welfare issues. With its focus on such minutiae as building new tunnels and freeing up land for development, the 50-minute speech seemed likely to fuel protesters' criticism that Lam is deaf to their concerns about the future of the territory's freedoms, unique in China.Even before Lam delivered it, one of the protesting lawmakers, Claudia Mo, dismissed the address as a ""shame and a sham"" and said the chief executive had lost all authority.""She is just a puppet on strings, being played by Beijing,"" Mo said at an impromptu news conference with other lawmakers outside the chamber after they successfully thwarted Lam's address there.They played a recording on a small loudspeaker they said was the sound of police tear-gassing protesters and of protesters' wails.""These are the voices of people screaming and they are just ordinary Hong Kong people,"" said lawmaker Tanya Chan. ""Please, please, please Mrs. Carrie Lam, don't let us suffer any more.""She and others called for Lam's resignation. ""This is the only way that we can have a good future,"" said Chan.Lam had been bracing for trouble in the chamber as her government battles the protests that started in June over a contested extradition bill and have snowballed into a sustained anti-government, anti-police and anti-China movement.Hong Kong's leader is expressing ""frustration and disappointment and regret"" over steps by U.S. Congress to support pro-democracy protesters in the territory.Lam said, ""This Hong Kong human rights and democracy act is totally unjustified and unwarranted.""She said it ""will hurt not only the Hong Kong business. It will hurt American interests in Hong Kong. They have 1,400 companies, 85,000 citizens in Hong Kong.""The House on Tuesday passed three bills, approved on separate voicevotes, aimed at showing U.S. support for pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong, one each that:"
Former correspondent describes a culture of 'friendly stonewalling' at the BBC over issue of pay gap | CBC Radio,"Eleanor Bradford is telling her story after Carrie Gracie, the former BBC China Editor, quit in protest of pay inequality.",2018-02-01T21:17:29.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/radio/asithappens/as-it-happens-wednesday-edition-1.4512118/former-correspondent-describes-a-culture-of-friendly-stonewalling-at-the-bbc-over-issue-of-pay-gap-1.4512123,"Read Story TranscriptWhen former BBC China Editor Carrie Gracie spoke in the British Parliament on Wednesday on the issue of the gender pay gap, Eleanor Bradford was watching. ""I thought Carrie was magnificent,"" Bradford, a former BBC Scotland health correspondent who left in part over the pay gap, told As It Happens guest host Helen Mann. Gracie, 55, who has worked at the BBC for over 30 years, quit her position as BBC's China Editor last month and released an open letter where she said two of her male colleagues earned at least 50 per cent more than her —  U.S. editor Jon Sopel and Middle East editor Jeremy Bowen. She said the BBC told her the reasoning was because she was ""in development"". Gracie is still employed by the BBC in London. On Wednesday, she appeared before British lawmakers to detail, over two hours, the circumstances that led to her departure. Tony Hall, the BBC's director general, denied any gender discrimination during this testimony.A review published by the the BBC on Tuesday also found ""no gender bias in on-air pay decisions."" Since Gracie resigned as China Editor, a group of 170 women at the BBC have called for an apology and back pay over claims the corporation broke equality laws. Bradford was one of the only women to publicly give written testimony for the questioning of Hall about the pay gap. She spoke with Mann about what prompted her, in part, to leave the BBC Scotland in 2016. Ms. Bradford, what is it like to hear Carrie Gracie speak so forcefully against the BBC in British Parliament?I thought Carrie was magnificent. She has clearly been through the mill. I would say that I don't feel as angry as Carrie because I haven't sacrificed as much as she has. In order to be a correspondent at her level she really wouldn't have seen her family very much. In my case, although I did sacrifice a lot for the BBC — including my partner giving up his job because my job was so unpredictable he needed to stay at home to look after the children — but I was met with friendly stonewalling, I would describe it as. I wasn't bullied, I wasn't harassed when I asked for equal pay. But neither did any of the management really deal with my complaint properly and even when they did admit that I was underpaid, they didn't offer me any back pay. Carrie Gracie said that her bosses justified the lower pay because they said she is ""in development"". You've already indicated she had a very senior position. Does that make any sense to you, given the job she held?It's clearly ridiculous. I mean she wasn't someone who was in development. She was one of the only people who spoke Mandarin. She worked in China, she had a Chinese degree. There was simply no one else for that position.In my situation, the frustration was that the men who were doing exactly the same job as me had a different job title, which was editor. Which you would think meant a different level of responsibly. You would think they had staff working for them or had more managerial responsibilities. But in actual fact we all did exactly the same. And I actually measured and made sure that we had the same number of stories on air and the same profile, and yet they were deemed worthy of this more senior title which allowed them to access a  higher pay balance.Did they have any more experience as journalists?One of them had been with the BBC longer and was... certainly more experienced than me. I don't know whether the pay difference was reflected in that or whether it was beyond that level of expertise.The other one was appointed after me, and although he'd worked elsewhere he'd never broadcasted before.  So after Carrie Gracie quit her post, the BBC decided to commission a report to examine the issue of gender bias in pay. That came out yesterday. What did it determine?Well that report found that whilst there were some discrepancies, it said that these could be explained because of different levels of experience, which I think really they clearly didn't look very hard.The issue I have with that report is that it was a report that  was commissioned from accountants and paid for by the BBC, and anyone who knows anything about research will tell you that if an organization pays another organization to do a report on that then there's automatic bias there.Well and in fact Ms. Gracie and many of the other women who have come out to support her from the BBC seemed enraged by the findings of the report and the way it was handled. I mean, has it made the situation worse for the BBC and given these women more of a case?I certainly think the BBC hasn't handled in glory particularly in the way it's reacted to Carrie's situation and briefing against her and suggesting she only worked 100 days a year. I mean that's absolutely outrageous.I also think that the BBC is having to deal with this issue, which is a society issues. And if the pay packets of other organizations were laid bare we'd find a much bigger problem. But I still think that it should be the BBC that deals with this and maybe the BBC who has to deal with this first because its paid for by us, the public.This interview has been edited for length and clarity. "

That's according to a new report issued by Freedom House, a human-rights NGO based in Washington, DC.Adrian Shahbaz has been researching and writing the annual report for many of those years. This year's examination was sobering, he told Spark host Nora Young.""Over the past year 17 countries that we cover had passed or proposed new laws to restrict online speech,"" Shahbaz said.The report examines access and free-speech rights in 65 countries, whose residents make up almost 90 per cent of the internet's users.""The number of countries that have these so-called 'patriotic trolls,' paid pro-government commentators that shape online discussions, has risen each year to now where it's in almost half of all the countries that we cover,"" he said.China scored the lowest in the rankings, because it restricts access to the internet so severely, and has set up such a strong system for online surveillance, he said.""Over the past year we've really seen how China has been unlike any other country in terms of channeling technology for its own domestic repression,"" Shahbaz said.More worrisome, however, is how China has been exporting that model to other countries.As China steps exerts more power on the international stage, it's also using its position as the world's top manufacturer of digital technology to extend its influence, he said.""We're starting to see this kind of central planning on behalf of the Chinese government, whereby the technological prowess of Chinese companies is a very important part of China's overall global strategy for dominating the 21st century.""All these things, including what's happening in the United States, mean the idea of global citizenship enabled by the internet seems to be slipping away, he said, and could be replaced with a Balkanized system where the internet experience is dramatically different depending on whether you live under a democratic or authoritarian regime, he said.Canada held onto its third-place position in terms of internet freedom, behind Iceland and Estonia.However, that doesn't mean it's beyond reproach.Shahbaz cited a Supreme Court decision that upheld the Canadian government's authority to force Google to take down any pages that violate Canadian law — not just in Canada, but everywhere in the world. Although there is little worry that a Canadian government might abuse that power, such a precedent could be cited by an authoritarian government, leading to ""troubling"" consequences, he said."

That building will include a 600-person conference centre, dining room, bar and gym. Flaherty said the corporation's board of directors chose to ship the pre-made rooms to save time and money.""It was going to take another two years to construct [the rooms] and having the labour pool that we don't have, and having to hire a lot of other tradespeople from other jurisdictions would have made it more costly,"" he said.""It will probably save us about $6 million initially and put the project one year ahead.""The rooms are expected to arrive in Iqaluit July 24.Flaherty said not only did Canadian inspectors take a look at the rooms during construction in Shanghai, but inspectors are going to take another look once they are assembled in Iqaluit.Not only that, but he said they will all be soundproof.""Our goal is when you stay in this hotel, you will rest well,"" he said. Flaherty said he is still in negotiations with the city over how to fund a new section of water and sewer lines that will be needed to satisfy increased demand on the system once the hotel, located on Federal Road, is built.""Everybody is working hand-in-hand to make sure this is progressing well,"" he said.Flaherty estimates the hotel, once complete, will create 60 new year-round jobs. Like other Qikiqtaaluk​​-owned businesses, he said he anticipates an Inuit majority will fill those jobs.He couldn't say how much the rooms will cost per night, but did say he's hoping to have an official opening next spring."
I'm working to unlearn the racism I internalized as a biracial kid | CBC News,"Growing up as a mixed race kid in a white suburb, I saw myself through the lens of whiteness and aspired to it. Doing family research into my Chinese history is part of healing that, writes Brandon Yan.",2020-08-09T08:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/unlearning-internalized-racism-1.5677387,"This column is an opinion by Brandon Yan, who is biracial and grew up in Langley, B.C. For more information about CBC's Opinion section, please see the FAQ.I used to imagine myself with a different nose or with different eyes. I even used to imagine what it would be like to have a different dad — a dad who looked like other dads, like the ones I'd see on TV playing sports with their kids. (And I didn't even like sports; I was definitely a theatre kid.) I used to imagine what it would be like to be white and what it would be like to have a white dad.And here's the thing, I don't think anyone ever told me to be ashamed of being half-Chinese or mixed race. Not explicitly, anyway. That's the insidiousness of racism and white supremacy. It exists as normal and as abundant as the air that I breathed. It was on the TV. It was on the radio and in my music. It was every family on my block. It was most of the kids at school. It was most of my teachers and it was every textbook. Growing up, I saw myself through the lens of whiteness and aspired to it. It deprived me of possible futures where I could be proud of every aspect of my being. Instead, I tried everything to fit in, including forsaking language, culture, dignity, and even, at times, my last name. On resumes, I used my middle name, Oliver, in place of Yan. Overnight, it was much easier to get job interviews. Life rewarded me for erasing my Chineseness. Dating brought its own challenges — especially in the gay community, where it can be difficult to feel attractive or desirable in the age of ""No fats, no femmes, no Asians."" It's a common refrain on some gay dating apps for a so-called preference that some gay or bisexual men have for fit, masculine and non-Asian men.It really wasn't until my mid-20s that I started to undo, unpack and heal some of this internalized racism and homophobia that I harboured within myself.One gift that was given to me by the queer community is that once you start to chip away at the shame within yourself, you can finally live as you were meant to. Part of this process was watching my younger sibling transform into a fierce drag queen by the name of Maiden China. Through the subversion of stereotypes and the reclamation of chinoiserie — especially in the queer community — she showed me how to take up as much space as I need.She was one of the sparks that lit the way for me to really delve into unlearning my internalized racism.  I even started to learn a bit of Cantonese.When I told my dad that I had been taking Cantonese lessons, his first response was, ""But why would you want to learn such an ugly language?"" This stung. Not because I was hoping he would be proud of me, but because it just reiterated the damage that white supremacy can inflict on someone's self-worth and I want that cycle to stop. I've also been re-connecting with my remaining aunts and uncles. My Uncle Robert has become the family historian and has been sharing family photos with me. He sent me this photo of my grandmother who we called Ngin Ngin. Every Sunday, my dad would drive me and sometimes some of my other siblings from Langley to pick up Ngin Ngin in Vancouver. We would go for lunch at Maxim's restaurant on Keefer Street. Fried rice. Gai lan. Hong Kong lemon iced tea as a treat.After, my dad would make me go with Ngin Ngin for her shopping. To be honest, I hated doing this. My small hands strained to carry all the heavy oranges she bought and Chinatown as a kid was an alienating place for me.But now I cherish these memories. She was always kind despite our inability to communicate. I think about her a lot these days. Our stories are linked and I'm working to fill in the gaps so I can better build the foundation for my own understanding of where I come from.Though I've never had a ""real"" conversation with my grandmother, she's the person who bestowed me with my Chinese name: 念本 That's something I learned from Uncle Robert: ""Do you know what your Chinese name means? Your grandma picked 'Nim Boon' ('Nam Bon' in Toisan dialect) for you. It means 'remember origin.' ""念 can mean remembrance or to remember, and 本 can mean origin or roots. My name is a gift, no longer a burden.It's also a beautiful reminder that I was born here on the unceded territories of the xʷməθkwəy̓əm (Musqueam), Skwxwú7mesh (Squamish), and səl'ilwətaɁɬ/Selilwitulh (Tsleil-Waututh) Nations from complicated journeys of immigrants and settlers.Part of the continuing movements against injustices and racism here and around the world is doing the work to undo systems of oppression within ourselves.

Canadian Club sends notice barring reporters from Stephen Harper speech | CBC News,The news media has been uninvited to a speech by former prime minister Stephen Harper on Thursday.,2018-10-10T21:59:48.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/stephen-harper-book-canadian-club-media-barred-1.4857438,"The news media has been uninvited to a speech by Stephen Harper on Thursday, underscoring the apparent antipathy the former prime minister continues to harbour in private life towards the Canadian press corps.Harper is to address the Canadian Club of Toronto, which had previously invited reporters to cover the event. But the club sent out a notice to the media Wednesday saying the invitation had been sent in error.""The Canadian Club of Toronto would like to apologize for inviting the media to our event with The Right Honourable Stephen Harper. This is a closed event. The previous media advisories were sent in error,"" said the notice.Colleen Kennedy, the club's executive director, said the event was always considered private and that her organization should not have sent out an invitation for the media to cover it.Harper is plugging a new book, ""Right Here, Right Now,"" in which he addresses how conservatives should tackle the challenge of rising populism since the election of Donald Trump to the U.S. presidency.Harper spoke to a series of American media outlets earlier in the week to promote his book.During his near decade in power, Harper's office had an acrimonious relationship with the national media. He distrusted reporters' motives and his office tightly controlled access to his ministers, foreign diplomats and senior public servants.Harper's book argues that the forces that propelled Trump to power can't be ignored by political leaders, and that conservatives need to find practical ways to bridge the disconnect and distrust separating working people and those who govern them.The message is similar to the one Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has made in numerous speeches but Harper draws a sharp partisan distinction, arguing that ""a pragmatic conservative approach to market-oriented economics"" is the best way to deal with the current disruption.""If conservatives do not develop answers, we will not only seem disconnected, we will cede territory to the bad ideas of the other side,"" he writes.Harper says Trump supporters can't simply be written off as ill-informed bigots. While he avoids heavy-handed criticism of Trump, Harper does say the president's focus on renegotiating a well-functioning North American Free Trade Agreement was ""an enormous and unnecessary distraction for all of us.""He says the three North American countries should have been focusing on their shared problem — China.Harper says Chinese President Xi Jinping is ""utterly committed to authoritarian governance"" and holding power for life.China is poised to become the world's largest economy, and that is not a good thing in Harper's view.""This, combined with its renewed authoritarianism, its increasing foreign aggressiveness, and its military buildup, cannot be seen as anything other than a serious threat to the Western democratic model.""Harper also argues against granting China market economy status and accuses the Liberal government before him of attempting to ""slip special treatment of China into our regulations"" before he reversed them.Harper says the non-market status that China was assigned in 2001 when it joined the World Trade Organization must be maintained, and he supports Trump's efforts to do that. A controversial clause in the recently renegotiated North American free trade pact requires countries to notify each other if they enter into trade talks with a ""non-market"" economy.""Trump needs to hold his ground here and continue to resist the calls to change China's WTO status in the absence of sufficient reform,"" Harper writes.""The Chinese government wants market economy status badly. It needs to earn it."""

Manitobans say changes to federal loan program a 'Band-Aid' solution for canola farmers | CBC News,"Canola producers can now access up to $1 million, with the first $500,000 interest-free up from a maximum of $400,000 with 100-thousand interest-free., federal agriculture minister Marie-Claude Bibeau announced in Ottawa on Wednesday morning.",2019-05-01T23:29:13.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/manitoba-farmers-canola-announcement-1.5119267,"Some Manitoba farmers say a boost to a federal loan program for canola producers is only a Band-Aid solution. In response to an ongoing dispute with China around canola imports, the federal government announced changes Wednesday to the Advance Payments Program — a federal program that provides agricultural businesses with access to low-interest cash advances.Under the changes, the maximum amount of money available to individual producers under the program will increase to $1 million, with the first $500,000 interest-free. That's up from a maximum of $400,000 with the first $100,000 interest-free, federal Agriculture Minister Marie-Claude Bibeau announced in Ottawa on Wednesday morning.But it's not a long-term solution, says the president of the Manitoba Canola Growers Association.""This is really just a Band-Aid approach [which] is going to assist farmers with cash flow,"" said Charles Fossay.""If they can't sell their canola or don't want to sell their canola because the cost is now below the cost of production … this will allow us to pay those bills and then hopefully market the canola at a profit in the future."" In March, China banned imports of canola seed from Winnipeg-based Richardson International and Viterra, citing concerns surrounding pests.The Canola Council of Canada said in March that Chinese importers were unwilling to purchase any Canadian canola seed.The federal government has disputed the pest claims and has asked China for more information.It's been speculated the ban is retaliation for Canada's arrest of Meng Wanzhou, a executive with the Chinese tech company Huawei who is facing extradition to the United States. On Wednesday, Bibeau said farmers often face tremendous pressures, and trade uncertainties can add to stress and mental health issues.""We must consider that this is bridge funding and this is going to be beneficial in some respects,"" said Bill Campbell, president of Manitoba's Keystone Agricultural Producers, whose farm south of Brandon, Man., includes about 600 acres of canola.""But it will not resolve the issue of international trade.""Campbell said with the growing season starting and canola going into the ground, farmers need certainty over the situation — fast. ""Essentially this is like taking a 15 per cent cut to your paycheque and having no recourse to resolve it,"" he said, while echoing Fossay's sentiment that the federal government's move is, at best, a temporary solution.""What the government has done is a step and is a Band-Aid, but we need to realize that if we do not get the production out of this canola, a loan does not help us,"" he said. Campbell says he's under pressure to get more yield from his canola crop because of the drop in prices. He said he needs a 20 per cent higher yield this year to make up for the lost revenue.""If we can't get it in price, we have to get it from yield,"" he said. If the yield isn't increased, he said, some producers' farms could be in jeopardy.Gunter Jochum, a canola producer near St. François Xavier — a community about 30 kilometres west of Winnipeg — says the government needs to resolve agriculture disputes not just with China, but other nations as well.""While it looks at the surface like a great idea, it doesn't really solve any of our trade problems that we have with China or India, or Italy for that matter,"" he said on Wednesday.Jochum says India is not taking Canadian pulses because of a different dispute, and Italy is not accepting Canadian durum wheat. He thinks Ottawa needs to send trade delegations directly to those countries to solve the trade disputes.During Wednesday's announcement in Ottawa, Manitoba MP and International Trade Minister Jim Carr also said he will lead a trade mission to Japan and South Korea to promote Canadian canola.Jochum is among those who are calling on the federal government to send a delegation directly to China. ""Right at the moment I'm not very optimistic,"" said Jochum. ""However … I do believe we can get this resolved, but we can't get it resolved if we don't send a delegation to China."" Campbell said the next few weeks will be crucial and he hopes to see a solution before the House of Commons rises for the summer, and before this fall's federal election. ""This is fairly important and this is fairly significant,"" said Campbell.""We need a really good growing season this year."""

"IOC's Thomas Bach warns against Olympic boycotts, ready to run for 2nd term as president | CBC Sports",International Olympic Committee (IOC) President Thomas Bach said on Friday he was ready to run for a second term at next year's election. The 66-year-old German was first elected in 2013 for an eight-year term and is eligible for one further term of four years after that.,2020-07-17T11:47:57.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/sports/olympics/ioc-thomas-bach-election-1.5653234,"IOC president Thomas Bach warned against Olympic boycotts on Friday while also confirming he will seek re-election next year.Bach seems certain to get four more years in 2021 after almost half of the 100 International Olympic Committee members from around the world praised him in an online version of their annual meeting.""As you can imagine, I could hear this forever,"" Bach quipped during nearly a full hour of tributes to his leadership since his eight-year first term started in 2013, and from members welcoming his candidacy for the second term.Bach's first term was marred by the Russian doping scandal but it has been a financially stable period for the IOC. American broadcaster NBC signed a long-term rights deal and new top-tier sponsors were added, including Chinese retail giant Alibaba.The Beijing Winter Olympics, currently scheduled for February 2022, will be an early highlight and a potential test of Bach's second and, according to current IOC rules, final term in office.WATCH | Christian Taylor discuss the power of the athletes voice: SportsAlthough serious talk of a boycott has not begun, China's human rights record is an expected target ahead of the Olympics. Some lawmakers and diplomats have criticized China for its detention and treatment of its Muslim minority Uighur people and pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong.""Boycotts and discrimination because of political background or nationality are once again a real danger,"" Bach warned in his keynote speech in Lausanne, Switzerland. ""A sporting boycott only punishes the athletes of the boycotting country and deprives their people of sharing in the success, pride and joy of their Olympic team.""Asked at a later news conference if the IOC recently discussed the Uighur issue with Chinese authorities, Bach limited the focus of its role — to ""whatever is related to the Olympic Games"" rather than society as a whole.""This is our remit. And we are fully confident that, there, China will deliver on this commitment,"" he said.The boycott issue is personal for Bach, who won a gold medal in team fencing at the 1976 Montreal Olympics but could not defend the title when West Germany joined the United States and others in refusing to send teams to the 1980 Moscow Games.""The Soviet army stayed nine long more years in Afghanistan after the boycott,"" said Bach, who as an athlete spokesman in 1980 failed to change the minds of German political leaders. ""It appears that today, some just do not want to learn anything from history.""The only political effect the boycott of 1980 had, was to trigger the revenge boycott of the following [Los Angeles] Olympic Games,"" he said.If Bach is re-elected unopposed as expected, a big challenge of his next term is likely to be the economic and social recovery of sports from the global health crisis.In March, the IOC postponed this year's Tokyo Olympics for one year. Organizers confirmed Friday they had secured all the venues and the Athletes Village for next year. IOC members on Friday also ratified postponing the 2022 Dakar Youth Olympics in Senegal to 2026.""Unfortunately, we are already seeing clear signs in some parts of the world that ΓÇª society and nations are driven by even more egoism and self-interest,"" Bach said. ""This leads to more confrontation and to the politicization of all aspects of life: Culture, economy, health, science, humanitarian aid. Even the fight against doping is already being targeted.""That comment appeared to criticize the United States after a government-funded study last month raised the possibility of withholding money from the World Anti-Doping Agency.The IOC said its presidential election will be in ""spring 2021,"" possibly in Athens, as members agreed to have two full meetings next year. The second is due to be in Tokyo on the sidelines of the Olympics.Also on Friday, the IOC elected five new members, including two-time Olympic champion Sebastian Coe of Britain, the president of World Athletics. The others are: Former Olympic champion Maria Colon of Cuba; Princess Reema Bandar Al-Saud, Saudi Arabia's ambassador to the United States; Kolinda Grabar-Kitarovic, the former president of Croatia; and Battushig Batbold of Mongolia.Two members, John Coates of Australia and Ser Miang Ng of Singapore, were elevated to IOC vice-president status, with seats on the executive board.Two vacant seats on the 15-member board were won in elections by Mikaela Cojuangco Jaworski of the Philippines and Gerardo Werthein of Argentina, one of Bach's main allies."
I'm working to unlearn the racism I internalized as a biracial kid | CBC News,"Growing up as a mixed race kid in a white suburb, I saw myself through the lens of whiteness and aspired to it. Doing family research into my Chinese history is part of healing that, writes Brandon Yan.",2020-08-09T08:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/unlearning-internalized-racism-1.5677387,"This column is an opinion by Brandon Yan, who is biracial and grew up in Langley, B.C. For more information about CBC's Opinion section, please see the FAQ.I used to imagine myself with a different nose or with different eyes. I even used to imagine what it would be like to have a different dad — a dad who looked like other dads, like the ones I'd see on TV playing sports with their kids. (And I didn't even like sports; I was definitely a theatre kid.) I used to imagine what it would be like to be white and what it would be like to have a white dad.And here's the thing, I don't think anyone ever told me to be ashamed of being half-Chinese or mixed race. Not explicitly, anyway. That's the insidiousness of racism and white supremacy. It exists as normal and as abundant as the air that I breathed. It was on the TV. It was on the radio and in my music. It was every family on my block. It was most of the kids at school. It was most of my teachers and it was every textbook. Growing up, I saw myself through the lens of whiteness and aspired to it. It deprived me of possible futures where I could be proud of every aspect of my being. Instead, I tried everything to fit in, including forsaking language, culture, dignity, and even, at times, my last name. On resumes, I used my middle name, Oliver, in place of Yan. Overnight, it was much easier to get job interviews. Life rewarded me for erasing my Chineseness. Dating brought its own challenges — especially in the gay community, where it can be difficult to feel attractive or desirable in the age of ""No fats, no femmes, no Asians."" It's a common refrain on some gay dating apps for a so-called preference that some gay or bisexual men have for fit, masculine and non-Asian men.It really wasn't until my mid-20s that I started to undo, unpack and heal some of this internalized racism and homophobia that I harboured within myself.One gift that was given to me by the queer community is that once you start to chip away at the shame within yourself, you can finally live as you were meant to. Part of this process was watching my younger sibling transform into a fierce drag queen by the name of Maiden China. Through the subversion of stereotypes and the reclamation of chinoiserie — especially in the queer community — she showed me how to take up as much space as I need.She was one of the sparks that lit the way for me to really delve into unlearning my internalized racism.  I even started to learn a bit of Cantonese.When I told my dad that I had been taking Cantonese lessons, his first response was, ""But why would you want to learn such an ugly language?"" This stung. Not because I was hoping he would be proud of me, but because it just reiterated the damage that white supremacy can inflict on someone's self-worth and I want that cycle to stop. I've also been re-connecting with my remaining aunts and uncles. My Uncle Robert has become the family historian and has been sharing family photos with me. He sent me this photo of my grandmother who we called Ngin Ngin. Every Sunday, my dad would drive me and sometimes some of my other siblings from Langley to pick up Ngin Ngin in Vancouver. We would go for lunch at Maxim's restaurant on Keefer Street. Fried rice. Gai lan. Hong Kong lemon iced tea as a treat.After, my dad would make me go with Ngin Ngin for her shopping. To be honest, I hated doing this. My small hands strained to carry all the heavy oranges she bought and Chinatown as a kid was an alienating place for me.But now I cherish these memories. She was always kind despite our inability to communicate. I think about her a lot these days. Our stories are linked and I'm working to fill in the gaps so I can better build the foundation for my own understanding of where I come from.Though I've never had a ""real"" conversation with my grandmother, she's the person who bestowed me with my Chinese name: 念本 That's something I learned from Uncle Robert: ""Do you know what your Chinese name means? Your grandma picked 'Nim Boon' ('Nam Bon' in Toisan dialect) for you. It means 'remember origin.' ""念 can mean remembrance or to remember, and 本 can mean origin or roots. My name is a gift, no longer a burden.It's also a beautiful reminder that I was born here on the unceded territories of the xʷməθkwəy̓əm (Musqueam), Skwxwú7mesh (Squamish), and səl'ilwətaɁɬ/Selilwitulh (Tsleil-Waututh) Nations from complicated journeys of immigrants and settlers.Part of the continuing movements against injustices and racism here and around the world is doing the work to undo systems of oppression within ourselves. My ancestors are my allies in this work. Do you have a strong opinion that could change how people think about an issue? A personal story that can educate or help others? We want to hear from you.CBC Vancouver is looking for British Columbians who want to write 500-600-word opinion and point of view pieces. Send us a pitch at bcvoices@cbc.ca and we'll be in touch."

RCMP questions legality of Chinese drivers' licences | CBC News,Richmond RCMP and ICBC say they are working together following media reports exposing a conflict between the two institutions over the legality of driving on B.C. roads with a licence issued from China.,2014-04-10T20:25:08.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/chinese-drivers-licences-questioned-by-richmond-rcmp-1.2605771,"Richmond RCMP and ICBC say they are working together following media reports exposing a conflict between the two institutions over the legality of driving on B.C. roads with a licence issued from China.Drivers stopped by Richmond RCMP who are found to be in possession of a Chinese licence have, for years, been routinely fined $267 and had their cars impounded, reported the Richmond News.But according to guidelines of the Insurance Corporation of British Columbia, a new resident of B.C. is legally allowed to drive on their previously-issued licence for 90 days, and if they are visiting B.C. temporarily, they may drive with that licence for six months.Adam Grossman of ICBC, told 24 Hours that full-time students are able to drive on a licence issued by the People's Republic of China or any other country for the duration of their studies.Const. Dennis Hwang, of Richmond RCMP’s road safety unit, told the Richmond News the problem stems from there being no agreement to verify drivers' information between China and Canada.“It’s not a legal document because it’s not verifiable, there’s no agreement between the two governments to share information,” he said.Both the RCMP and ICBC say they are committed to quickly working out the conflict, which has seen thousands of drivers issued tickets.""We are in discussions to try and assist with this issue as quickly as possible,"" Grossman told CBC in an email. ""We will continue to discuss the issue with police today and we are committed to coming up with a solution.""Sgt. Rob Vermeulen confirmed the RCMP are also working fast to come to an agreement: ""We are working in concert with our stakeholders on a resolution to the concerns that have been raised,"" he said in an email.""This is a complex issue which requires further discussion. We are committed to coming up with a solution and providing an update in a timely manner."""

"Egypt arrests doctors, silences critics over virus outbreak | CBC News",Egyptian security agencies have tried to stifle criticism about the handling of the coronavirus health crisis by the government of President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi.,2020-07-06T07:28:23.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/egypt-critics-coronavirus-1.5638627,"A doctor arrested after writing an article about Egypt's fragile health system. A pharmacist picked up from work after posting online about a shortage of protective gear. An editor taken from his home after questioning official coronavirus figures. A pregnant doctor arrested after a colleague used her phone to report a suspected coronavirus case.As Egyptian authorities fight the swelling coronavirus outbreak, security agencies have tried to stifle criticism about the government of President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi's handling of the health crisis.At least 10 doctors and six journalists have been arrested since the virus hit Egypt in February, according to rights groups. Other health workers say they have been warned by administrators to keep quiet or face punishment. One foreign correspondent has fled the country, fearing arrest, and another two have been reprimanded over ""professional violations.""The coronavirus is surging in the country of 100 million, threatening to overwhelm hospitals. As of Monday, the Health Ministry recorded 76,253 infections, including 3,343 deaths — the highest death toll in the Arab world.""Every day I go to work, I sacrifice myself and my whole family,"" said a doctor in greater Cairo, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals, like all doctors interviewed for this story. ""Then they arrest my colleagues to send us a message. I see no light on the horizon.""In 2013, el-Sissi, as defence minister, led the military's removal of Egypt's first democratically elected president, Mohamed Morsi, after his brief rule sparked nationwide protests. Since then, el-Sissi has stamped out dissent, jailing Islamist political opponents, secular activists, journalists, even belly dancers.Now the clampdown has extended to doctors who speak out about their working conditions.A government press officer did not respond to requests for comment on the arrests of doctors and journalists.In recent weeks, authorities have marshalled medical supplies to prepare for more patients. The military has set up field hospitals with 4,000 beds, scaled up testing and ordered companies to churn out face masks and other supplies.But health workers are sounding the alarm on social media. Doctors say they are forced to purchase surgical masks with their meagre salaries. Families plead for intensive care beds.The pandemic has pushed the Egyptian Medical Syndicate, a non-political professional group, into a new role as the sole advocate for doctors' rights.Last month, the union released a letter to the public prosecutor demanding the release of five doctors detained for expressing opinions about the virus response.Another syndicate member, Mohamed el-Fawal, landed in jail last week, after demanding online that the prime minister apologize for comments that appeared to blame health workers for a spike in deaths.Incensed doctors hit back, saying they're under-trained, underpaid and under-resourced, struggling to save patients. So far, 117 doctors, 39 nurses and 32 pharmacists have died from COVID-19, according to syndicate members' counts. Thousands have fallen ill.Security forces shut down a syndicate press conference that was to respond to the prime minister's comments and discuss supply shortages, according to former leader Mona Mina.""These doctors have no history of activism. They were arrested because they offered criticism of their very specific professional circumstances,"" said Amr Magdi of Human Rights Watch, which has confirmed the arrests of eight doctors and two pharmacists. Two have been released, he said, while the rest remain in pretrial detention.In one case, security agents burst into the home of Hany Bakr, an ophthalmologist north of Cairo, according to his lawyer and Amnesty International, over his Facebook post that criticized the government for sending aid to Italy and China while Egypt's doctors were short of equipment.In March, public prosecutors accused 26-year-old Alaa Shaaban Hamida of terrorism charges after she let a colleague call the government coronavirus hotline from her phone instead of first reporting the case to her managers, according to Amnesty International. Three months pregnant, she remains in pretrial detention.Doctors in three provinces say administrators threatened to report them if they publicly expressed frustration toward authorities or failed to show up for work.In one voice recording obtained by The Associated Press, a health deputy in a Nile Delta province can be heard saying, ""Even if a doctor is dying, he must keep working or be subjected to the most severe punishment.""A doctor in Cairo shared WhatsApp messages with the AP from his manager, alerting staff that their attendance was monitored by state security. In two other hospitals in the capital, workers retracted letters of collective resignation over working conditions for fear of reprisals.The suppression of criticism in Egypt is hardly unusual, analysts say, but the government has become more jittery as the pandemic tests its capabilities and economy.With borders shut and planes idled, Egypt's critical tourism revenue has vanished. Last week, fearing further economic fallout, the government reopened much of society and welcomed hundreds of international tourists to resorts, even as daily reported deaths exceeded 80.""Because of Egypt's constant attention to its image as a place open for tourism, open for business, open for investment, authorities appear particularly sensitive to divergent perspectives during the pandemic,"" said Amy Hawthorne, an Egypt expert at the Project on Middle East Democracy.At least 15 individuals have been arrested for broadcasting ""false news"" about the pandemic, said the UN human rights office. Four Egyptian journalists who reported on the outbreak remain in prison, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, which has labelled Egypt among the world's worst jailers of journalists, along with Turkey and China.In March, Egypt expelled a reporter for The Guardian who cited a report disputing the official virus count. Egypt's state information body summoned The Washington Post and New York Times correspondents over their critical coverage during the pandemic.Despite growing human rights abuses, the international community counts on Egypt as a bulwark against regional instability, said a Middle East-focused rights advocate at the UN, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss policy matters.""There is no appetite,"" the advocate said, ""to address what is going on in Egypt let alone sanction them in any way for what the government is doing to their own people."""

"Deadly explosion at Chinese kindergarten was intentional, officials say | CBC News","Chinese authorities say a homemade bomb was used in an explosion at the front gate of a kindergarten that killed eight people, including the suspect.",2017-06-16T07:13:11.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/china-kindergarten-explosion-1.4163510,"A 22-year-old man made the bomb that exploded at the front gate of a kindergarten in eastern China, killing eight people, including himself, investigators said Friday.Police said the suspect was identified primarily using security camera footage and DNA collected at the scene of the blast, which struck Thursday as relatives were waiting to pick up students at the end of the school day. Only the suspect's surname, Xu, was released and no motive was provided.Investigators say they found materials for making a homemade bomb at Xu's nearby residence. Emblazoned on its walls were the Chinese characters for death, disaster and other related dark themes.Xu had left school because of a nervous system disorder, whose symptoms can include depression, anxiety, dizziness, vision problems and problems with basic bodily functions, the police said at a news conference in the city of Xuzhou in Jiangsu province.Two people died at the scene and six died after being taken to a hospital. Sixty-five people were injured, including eight listed in critical condition.The blast at the Chuangxin Kindergarten in Xuzhou's Fengxian county occurred at 4:50 p.m. before school had let out for the day and no students or teachers from the kindergarten were among the injured, according to a statement from local authorities.However, videos purportedly from the scene showed children — possibly relatives of the kindergartners or passers-by — among the casualties.A witness identified only by the surname Shi said the force of the blast sent people flying several metres into the air, according to the state-run Global Times.Videos posted by the People's Daily showed a chaotic scene, with children and adults lying on the ground, some of them motionless, their clothes blown off them, and others struggling to get up. Clothing, shoes and other items were strewn across the area beside pools of blood.The videos showed ambulances arriving, medics wheeling people into an emergency room and medical personnel treating what appeared to be a child.Kindergartens and elementary schools in China have been attacked several times before by suspects authorities have said were mentally ill or bore grudges against their neighbours and society.In 2010, nearly 20 children were killed in attacks on schools, prompting a response from top government officials and leading many schools to beef up security by posting guards and installing gates and other barriers. Last year, a knife-wielding assailant injured seven students outside a primary school in a northern city.China maintains tight control over firearms and most attacks are carried out using knives, axes or homemade explosives."
Walter Hiebert YVR lawsuit reminiscent of Dziekanksi case | CBC News,"Seven years after the death of Robert Dziekanski, Vancouver International Airport is facing a lawsuit after a man became so disoriented and frustrated at the lack of help offered, he tried to climb over a wall, fracturing his hip in the process.",2014-05-05T22:21:09.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/walter-hiebert-yvr-lawsuit-reminiscent-of-dziekanksi-case-1.2632631,"Seven years after the death of Robert Dziekanski, Vancouver International Airport is facing a lawsuit after a man became so disoriented and frustrated at the lack of help offered, he tried to climb over a wall, fracturing his hip in the process.In October, 2007, Dziekanski, 40, who did not speak English, became agitated after spending more than nine hours wandering in the airport arrivals area, before being confronted by four Mounties who stunned him several times with a Taser.In a recently filed statement of claim, Walter Hiebert says he suffered a stroke some years earlier that left him with impaired speech and an awkward gait. Hiebert says he was disembarked via wheelchair from a China Airlines flight from Taipei, in May 2012, transferred to a golf cart and left unattended for approximately 15 minutes, then offered a walker and given cursory directions.The New Westminster man (then, 57) was left to wander the hallways of the airport unassisted for twenty minutes, before opening a set of alarmed doors — an act of desperation, his statement claims — in the hope security would arrive.But no one came.A video, held by the Airport Authority, but made available to Hiebert's lawyer, Paul Warnett, apparently shows his client stuck in the restricted area for six minutes, before being asked by staff to show his passport through a glass wall. The staff member then left without comment.Frustrated at the situation, Hiebert used his wheelchair to boost himself over a wall, falling and fracturing his hip.Hiebert's suit makes claim against several organizations, including the Vancouver Airport Authority, China Airlines Limited and Canada Border Services Agency.""These sorts of things happen to people. And one of the allegations we're making is that the airport should be prepared to handle these situations,"" Warnett told CBC.""You would expect that someone is watching to make sure that you make your way down to where you're supposed to go,"" he said. ""And we know that his movements were captured on video for approximately a half hour before he has his fall and injures himself.""In an email, the Vancouver Airport Authority expressed regret at the concern the incident caused Hiebert.""We recognized a breakdown in customer care and immediately commenced an investigation involving personnel from the airline and other organizations at the airport,"" the email reads.The email also said the VAA is yet to be served with court documents.Hiebert's statement of claim only represents one side of a civil argument. None of his claims have yet been proven in court."
"Virus concerns close doors at Armani, but other Milan Fashion Week shows go on | CBC News","The fashion crowd put a defiant face against the spread of a new virus, packing runway shows on the last big day of Milan Fashion Week on Sunday, even as Giorgio Armani made a last-minute decision to stream his latest collection from an empty theatre out of concerns for guests' health.",2020-02-24T15:43:33.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/milan-fashion-week-1.5473624,"The fashion crowd put a defiant face against the spread of a new virus, packing runway shows on the last big day of Milan Fashion Week on Sunday, even as Giorgio Armani made a last-minute decision to stream his latest collection from an empty theatre out of concerns for guests' health.Condé Naste artistic director Anna Wintour took her usual spot in the front-row of Dolce&Gabbana across from a gaggle of global social media Tik-Tok influencers, none of whom were deterred by the spreading virus that had put about a dozen northern Italian towns on lockdown.The Italian National Fashion Chamber said in a statement early Sunday there were no indications from health officials that changes in the schedule were called for, adding that it was up to brands to decide if they would go ahead. Only Armani made changes, among nine shows scheduled.Later in the day, Lombard officials closed theatres, cinemas and other places, like discos and pubs where people might crowd, for at least seven days, as confirmed cases in Italy jumped to at least 152.Venice officials took the step of cancelling Carnival celebrations, unprecedented in modern times, in a bid to stop the virus spread.Even as the shows went on, the coronavirus threat cast a strange mood over the Italian fashion capital. Despite pockets of activity around the venues at showtime, the city was more empty than normal for an unusually warm winter Sunday, when people from the surrounding province often come for a stroll or to soak in the fashion week energy.Inside shows, just a handful of people wore protective masks.Asked about the impact of coronavirus on the fashion schedule, Wintour pivoted to the unexpected announcement of a collaboration between creative forces Raf Simons and Miuccia Prada at Prada going forward, calling it ""the most inspiring news of the season.""""To me that just shows how we can all be much stronger together at a time when things are so politically divisive. The idea of two creative geniuses coming together supersedes other concerns,"" Wintour told The Associated Press after Dolce&Gabbana.The economic impact of the virus on the wider industry remains a concern. At least 1,000 Chinese journalists, buyers and industry insiders couldn't travel from China, which contributes one-third of global luxury revenues in domestic sales and shopping abroad.The Giorgio Armani fashion house announced overnight his runway show on Sunday would be conducted in an empty showroom and streamed for the fashion public on the internet as a ""preventative measure decided by Mr. Armani to support national efforts in safeguarding public health.""Mr Armani with his models at the <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/GiorgioArmani?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#GiorgioArmani</a> Women's FW20-21 fashion show. <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/MFW?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#MFW</a><br>Credits: Stefano Guindani / SGP Italia <a href=""https://t.co/2SfrmVLJS3"">pic.twitter.com/2SfrmVLJS3</a>It was the first time the 45-year-old Milan fashion house has taken such a step out of public health concerns, though Armani did stage a show in an empty venue in Paris in 1998 after officials said the big tent posed a safety hazard. At that time, he distributed video of the event to fashion editors, then restaged it in New York to protest what he said had been a decision dictated by fashion world politics and not safety concerns.In streaming, Armani models moved across a dark background, giving contrast to pink, teal and pearl gray silky printed trousers and skirts, while black velvet jackets that blended in with the darkness.Mr Armani with his models at the <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/GiorgioArmani?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#GiorgioArmani</a> Women's FW20-21 fashion show. <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/MFW?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#MFW</a><br>Credits: Stefano Guindani / SGP Italia <a href=""https://t.co/M95tZ1Pm5R"">pic.twitter.com/M95tZ1Pm5R</a>The show ended with what notes said was a ""message of love for China,"" where the coronavirus first broke out. Models in glistening, sculpted gowns from archival couture Armani Prive' collections inspired by China stopped along the runway, while the 85-year-old took a bow to the virtual audience. Empty seats were visible behind him.At Dolce&Gabbana, designers Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana showed a predominantly black and white collection in a world that is anything but. The looks included many iterations of the brand's famous black dresses, but this season was distinguished by cozy, enveloping knits in oversized stitching. To underline the artisanal quality, the brand's knitters and other craftspeople demonstrated their skills in the foyer.Tik-Tocker Anna O'Brien, whose videos empowering curvy women are posted as @glittersandlazers, was thrilled to be in the front row of her first-ever international runway show, virus or no.""Working in this industry, you learn about the hot story, right? And that's the hot story right now. Is it a threat? Definitely. But is it the only thing that's threatening the world right now? Not really,"" said O'Brien, who travelled from Austin, Texas, to Milan.Earlier Sunday, emerging talent Mariana Rosati was preparing models for its morning show of her Tuscan brand DROMe, which has found fans with Bella Hadid and Ariana Grande. Rosati said she didn't believe there was reason to fear, as models sat nearby waiting for hair and make-up.""I am very sorry what is going on. I know it is not predictable and obviously we need to be careful. But I actually think a lot of panic has been spread for not enough reasons,"" Rosati said.Though she expected fewer people would show, it was standing room only for the collection meant to inspire sensuality in women with its oversized jackets complemented by body-defining mini-dresses with deep slits that show off knitted underwear with a vintage feel.""Good vibes,"" Rosati said. ""This morning the news was that people would not show up. They did and that is great."" "

No recession but little optimism in ATB's economic outlook for Alberta | CBC News,The economic outlook anticipates GDP growth of 0.7 per cent this year and 1.6 per cent in 2020. Unemployment is forecast to tick up slightly from 6.6 per cent to 6.9 per cent this year and remain fairly consistent into 2021.,2019-05-16T15:46:54.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/atb-ecomomic-outlook-alberta-no-recession-1.5138318,"Alberta is in for a challenging economic year, according to the latest forecast from ATB Financial, but the institution says the province will likely avoid another recession.The economic outlook anticipates GDP growth of 0.7 per cent this year and 1.6 per cent in 2020. Unemployment is forecast to tick up slightly from 6.6 per cent to 6.9 per cent this year and remain fairly consistent into 2021. ""Despite all the headwinds hampering Alberta's economic progress, it looks like we will avoid slipping back into recession. With that said, we've cut our growth forecast in half from where it was in March,"" said ATB's chief economist Todd Hirsch in a news release.""With real GDP growth of just 0.7 per cent, it is going to feel slow in our province.""Continuing challenges in the oilpatch are a big factor in the sluggish outlook, with improved prices tempered by transportation constraints, low natural gas prices and a lack of new investment.""From an economic perspective, that's really what we need is some assurance that we can expand oil production and that it will have a pipeline to go into,"" said Rob Roach, director of insight on ATB Financial's economics and research team. ""So that's the big piece and the one thing we look at a lot is the capital spending in the oil and gas sector and that's been down. And that's what we think will be down even more in 2019 until we get that bottleneck solved, and then everything kind of ripples out from there.""Housing starts are also expected to drop in the province in 2019, falling 13 per cent after a drop of 11.4 per cent in 2018. Non-residential capital expenditures on construction are forecast to shrink by 0.9 per cent.There is some positive news in the manufacturing sector, according to ATB, with sales up at the beginning of the year and the expectation of stronger performance across all sub-sectors in 2019. Agriculture and agrifood also show encouraging signs. The other area of growth is population, with natural increases and international immigration contributing to the rise of 1.9 per cent in 2019 and 1.3 per cent in 2020. Of course, all of this is dependent on a global system over which the province has little control — Brexit and the China-U.S. trade war among them. ""The global oversupply of crude oil caused the price to collapse in late 2014 and sent Alberta spiralling down into the worst recession in 30 years,"" said Hirsch in the release. ""At the moment, domestic challenges to new pipeline development are hindering Alberta's economy. Hopefully, a major global slowdown will be avoided and not add to the barriers we face.""On the federal front, the Bank of Canada said on Thursday there are vulnerabilities to the Canadian financial system, including the rising risk of a ""severe nationwide recession leading to a rise in financial stress.""Other areas of concern include climate change, imbalances in housing markets as well as household and corporate debt. Alberta and Saskatchewan have the highest rate of people falling behind on debt payments.But the bank's governor isn't sounding the alarm just yet.""Global uncertainty is rising, and risks to financial stability have edged up in the past year,"" said Stephen Poloz in a news release.""Still, confidence in the resilience of Canada's financial system remains high, and we are seeing improvements in some of the key vulnerabilities we've been worried about for many years."""
