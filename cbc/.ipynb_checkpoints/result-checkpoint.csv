0,"As Canadians sour on China, an ambassador changes his tone | CBC News","Dominic Barton, Canada's ambassador to China, made his first appearance at the China committee this week since before the pandemic hit Canada. He was noticeably less forgiving of Beijing and less bullish on business opportunities than last time — perhaps reflecting a turn against China in public opinion.",2020-12-10T09:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/china-kovrig-spavor-dominic-barton-1.5835036,"Today marks two years since the two Michaels were detained by China.It's also been ten long pandemic months since Canada's ambassador to Beijing, Dominic Barton, made his previous appearance before the Commons subcommittee on Canada-China relations. Tuesday's second round of that hearing showed how much the mood around China has changed during 2020. Barton appeared conscious of the need to make some repairs to the impression he left in February, when his testimony drew unusually direct criticism from former diplomats with experience working in China.Back then, Barton suggested that it was incumbent upon Canadians to recognize that ""China values unity and the needs of society at large, rather than freedom of individual choice ... we just have to understand that.""Former diplomat and China expert Charles Burton told the subcommittee that Barton's words parroted Communist Party propaganda asserting that Chinese culture is inherently averse to liberty and democracy — when in fact the aversion comes from Xi Jinping's Politburo.Watch: Trudeau says government will examine all options to bring Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig.:Politics NewsIn his Tuesday appearance, however, Barton opened with remarks on ""our efforts to promote rights and freedoms in China.""""We are concerned by the decline of civil and political rights in China,"" he told MPs.Barton began his appearance with a lengthy description of a recent visit to the Tibet Autonomous Region, which he toured in a party of foreign diplomats. It was one of two closely-supervised Tibetan tours put on for mostly western diplomats this year, a sign that the Communist Party — bravado notwithstanding — still cares about what western countries say regarding its human rights record.It may also have been an attempt to switch foreign attention to Tibet from the even more problematic neighbouring region of Xinjiang, where China's heavy-handed persecution of the Muslim Uighur people is opening new fronts for confrontation with the West.Barton said that he had consulted with pro-Tibet groups and academics in Canada before accepting the trip, which he said he undertook partly to show Tibetans the world was still concerned about their plight.In addition to discussing what he'd seen on the tour — which took in a school, a monastery and greenhouses — Barton also talked about the motives of the Communist Party in allowing the trip. He said he understood that ""what I saw was not the complete picture on any issue"" and described one effort to escape his minders — when he left his hotel at 5 a.m. for an unaccompanied stroll through the streets of Lhasa.Barton once famously described himself as ""a bull on China"" and his entire pre-diplomatic career was built on viewing China primarily as a business opportunity.During his last committee appearance, Barton told members he ""would love to talk more about promoting trade and investment. I probably should shut up and move on, but I'm very excited by the opportunity we have on many fronts.""This time, he took his own advice and left out the economic boosterism — suggesting that the ambassador had not only learned to read the room but perhaps understood how the ground had shifted under him.""Countries all around the world are evolving their approach to China,"" he told the subcommittee Tuesday night. That's certainly true in Europe, where both public attitudes and government approaches to China have become considerably tougher over the course of 2020. Shachi Kurl of the Angus Reid Institute said Barton's changed tone also reflects new realities at home.""This isn't just about Canada and Ambassador Barton aligning with the Western consensus,"" she told CBC's Power and Politics. ""It really is about aligning with the Canadian consensus, because for several years we have seen a deterioration, and then a deterioration, and then a further deterioration in Canadian views of the Beijing regime.""Opinion polls do show a crashing decline in China's standing in Canadian public opinion, reaching what Kurl calls ""an all-time low"" as 2020 draws to a close.""You now find among the Canadian population a bloody-mindedness that says, 'You know what? This is not OK,'"" she said. ""This is about more than the human rights situation, this is about more than events in Hong Kong. What has really viscerally affected Canadians is the kidnapping of the two Michaels.""Obviously, the detention of Kovrig and Spavor was always intended by Beijing to be a pressure tactic — not a play for hearts and minds. But it hasn't worked as a pressure tactic and has instead backfired disastrously upon China's public image.Would the CCP judge the strategy wise in hindsight, or consider it a failure? Either way, the need to save face makes it hard for the Communist Party — famously averse to backing down on anything — to alter its course now.During his committee appearance, Barton praised the two Canadians for their resilience, which he said was an inspiration to him.Barton was eager to mend fences when asked about another Canadian detainee: Huseyin Celil, a Uighur rights activist from Burlington, Ont. who was snatched on behalf of Chinese authorities while visiting Uzbekistan 14 years ago, whisked across the border and given a life sentence.When asked about the case in February, Barton said he had not been able to visit Celil because Celil was not a Canadian citizen. Once again, he was echoing a view espoused by the government of China, which has refused to recognize the fact that Celil has been a Canadian citizen since 2001. Foreign Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne was forced to correct the record in the House of Commons a few days after Barton's misstatement.Two former ambassadors to China condemned Barton's mischaracterization of Celil. ""China doesn't get to determine who is or becomes a Canadian citizen,"" said David Mulroney, who represented Canada in Beijing from 2009 to 2012.This time, Barton described the steps he had taken to reach out to the Celil family in the wake of that embarrassing incident.There is still no sign of progress in Celil's case, however. His detention differs from that of Kovrig and Spavor in that Celil was not seized as a bargaining chip to pressure Canada, and his case predates the Huawei dispute.Instead, Celil's detention intersects with another issue that has raised tensions between China and Canada — one that also came up in one of the tenser moments in this week's meeting between Barton and MPs.Conservative MP Garnett Genuis pressed Barton to make a clear statement on China's suppression of its Uighur minority, who are concentrated in the far western Xinjiang region.He read out the recent words of the Trudeau government's newish ambassador to the UN, Bob Rae, who told CBC News ""there's no question that there's aspects of what the Chinese are doing that fits into the definition of genocide in the genocide convention."" Did Barton agree with that statement? The ambassador refused to be pinned down, saying that while the situation was ""very, very concerning,"" more reports from the area were needed.Rights activists are particularly suspicious of Barton on this file because the company he headed, McKinsey, earned a reputation for indifference to Uighur suffering while eagerly promoting the Chinese government's economic plans for their homeland.The company defended itself but faced harsh criticism — even from the traditional business press.""I think we need to see the reports,"" Barton said. ""I haven't talked to Ambassador Rae about the particular evidence he has on that side.""""We need to have independent people on the ground who can go wherever they want"" in Xinjiang in order to determine what's happening, he added. Genuis was skeptical. ""We'd love to get access,"" he said. ""I think there's realities in terms of whether that's ever going to be given.""""Is Mr. Rae's statement consistent with the government's policy, or is yours?"" Genuis asked.Barton minimized the gap between the two, arguing that Rae was also seeking more investigation. A noticeable difference remained, however, in how the two men described the situation.",0.0875765364685819,0.342675455857274

Hong Kong police later said they had arrested nine men and one woman for suspected offences including ""collusion with a foreign country/external elements to endanger national security, conspiracy to defraud"" and others.The tycoon had been a frequent visitor to Washington, where he has met officials, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, to rally support for Hong Kong democracy, prompting Beijing to label him a ""traitor.""",0.12404250841750843,0.36782407407407414

While questions remain about the Sinopharm shot, already at least one country outside China plans to roll it out in a mass-vaccination campaign.The U.A.E., home to Dubai and Abu Dhabi, conducted a trial beginning in September of the vaccine by Chinese state-owned pharmaceutical giant Sinopharm involving 31,000 volunteers from 125 nations. Volunteers between 18 and 60 years old received two doses of the vaccine over 28 days.The U.A.E.'s Health and Prevention Ministry announced the results via a statement on the state-run WAM news agency, saying it has ""reviewed Sinopharm CNBG's interim analysis of the Phase III trials.""""The analysis shows no serious safety concerns,"" the statement said, without detailing whether any participant suffered side effects.It wasn't immediately clear if the announced results included only those taking part in the testing in the UAE or if they also include results from China and elsewhere. The statement described the vaccine as receiving ""official registration"" without elaborating on what that meant.Emirati officials and Sinopharm did not respond to questions from The Associated Press.However, calls Wednesday to SEHA, the Abu Dhabi health authority, included an option for individuals to schedule an appointment to receive a ""COVID-19 vaccine."" The centre was swamped with calls following the announcement on the vaccine's efficacy.The Sinopharm vaccine has been approved for emergency use in a few countries and the company is still conducting late-stage clinical trials in 10 countries. Morocco is gearing up for an ambitious COVID-19 vaccination program, aiming to vaccinate 80 per cent of its adults in an operation starting this month that's relying initially on the Sinopharm vaccine.Sinopharm's shot relies on a tested technology, using a killed virus to deliver the vaccine, similar to how polio immunizations are made. Leading Western competitors, like the shot made by Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech, use newer, less-proven technology to target the coronavirus's spike protein using RNA. The United Kingdom already has begun vaccinating people with the Pfizer shot.WATCH | Inside the scramble to mass produce a COVID-19 vaccine:The NationalTop officials in the UAE, including Dubai's ruler, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, have publicly received the shots as part of the vaccine testing.Already, Pfizer reports its shot as being 95 per cent effective, while another RNA candidate from Moderna appears to be 94.5 per cent effective. Results suggest a third vaccine from Oxford University and AstraZeneca is safe and about 70 per cent effective, but questions remain about how well it may help protect those over 55.In transport, Pfizer says its vaccine must be stored in a freezer at –80 C to –60 C or in a thermal container at –90 C to –60 C. The Moderna vaccine must remain at a temperature of –20 C.The Sinopharm vaccine is believed to be able to travel at a temperature of 2 C to 8 C, a major draw for areas of the world where nearly three billion people live without stable electricity and refrigeration. In November, the Communist Party secretary for Sinopharm said almost one million people in China had received its vaccine.Since the pandemic began, the UAE has detected over 178,000 cases of the virus, with 160,000 recoveries and nearly 600 deaths. Its aggressive testing policy has seen over 17 million tests conducted in a country home to just over nine million people.",0.0,0.36782407407407414

Washington considers it an important democratic outpost and is required by law to provide it with the means to defend itself.Responding to the U.S. approval of a potential $1.8 billion US arms sale to Taiwan, China's Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said during a daily news briefing that such sales should stop.The sales ""seriously interfere with China's internal affairs, seriously damage China's sovereignty and security interests, send a seriously wrong signal to Taiwan independence forces and severely damage China-U.S. relations and peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait,"" he said.""China will make a legitimate and necessary response according to how the situation develops,"" Zhao added.He did not give details, but China has sanctioned U.S. companies in the past for selling weapons to Taiwan, though it is unclear what form they have taken.In Taipei, Taiwan Defence Minister Yen De-fa thanked the United States and said the weapons were to help Taiwan improve their defensive capabilities to deal with the ""enemy threat and new situation.""""This includes a credible combat capability and asymmetric warfare capabilities to strengthen our determination to defend ourselves,"" he added.""This shows the importance attached by the United States to security in the Indo-Pacific and Taiwan Strait. We will continue to consolidate our security partnership with the United States.""Yen said they were not looking for confrontation.""We will not engage in an arms race with the Chinese Communists. We will put forward requirements and build fully in accordance with the strategic concept of heavy deterrence, defending our position and defensive needs.""Taiwan's armed forces are dwarfed by China's, which are expanding their capability with new weapons like aircraft carriers and stealth fighters.Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen has made defence modernization a priority in the face of a rising Chinese threat, particularly ""asymmetric warfare"" capabilities, which refers to making any Chinese attack difficult and costly, for example with smart mines and portable missiles.Like most countries, Washington has no formal diplomatic ties with Taipei, though it is its strongest global backer. The U.S. has been pushing Taiwan to modernize its military so it can become a ""porcupine"" — that is, hard for China to attack.Among other weapons systems, Wednesday's formal notifications to Congress by the State Department were for 11 truck-based rocket launchers made by Lockheed Martin called a High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS), for an estimated cost of $436.1 million.The notifications also covered 135 AGM-84H Standoff Land Attack Missile Expanded Response (SLAM-ER) Missiles and related equipment made by Boeing for an estimated $1.008 billion, and six MS-110 Recce external sensor pods made by Collins Aerospace for jets, at an estimated cost of $367.2 million.Further congressional notifications are expected to follow, including drones made by General Atomics and land-based Harpoon anti-ship missiles made by Boeing to serve as coastal defence cruise missiles.The U.S. administration has stepped up pressure on Beijing in the run-up to the Nov. 3 U.S. presidential election, in which President Donald Trump has made a tough approach to China a key foreign policy theme.Last week, the U.S. national security adviser, Robert O'Brien, said that while China probably was not ready to invade Taiwan for now, the island needed to ""fortify itself"" against a future attack or any bid to isolate it through non-military means, such as an embargo.Taiwan has been testing new surface-to-surface missiles, which its media says have the ability to strike deep inside China, potentially giving the island the ability to attack far-off Chinese air bases and command centres.",0.0,0.4812643515904384

25,"China, top global emitter, aims to go carbon-neutral by 2060 | CBC News",Chinese President Xi Jinping says his country will aim to stop adding to the global warming problem by 2060.,2020-09-23T13:01:48.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/china-carbon-neutral-1.5735172,"Chinese President Xi Jinping says his country will aim to stop adding to the global warming problem by 2060.Xi's announcement during a speech Tuesday to the UN General Assembly is a significant step for the world's biggest emitter of greenhouse gases.Calling for a ""green revolution,"" Xi said the coronavirus pandemic had shown the need to preserve the environment.""Humankind can no longer afford to ignore the repeated warnings of nature,"" he said.Citing the Paris Agreement that he and former U.S. President Barack Obama helped forge in 2015, Xi said his country would raise its emissions reduction targets with ""vigorous policies and measures.""""We aim to have CO2 emissions peak before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2060,"" he said.The term ""carbon neutrality"" means releasing no additional CO2 into the atmosphere, though technically it allows countries to keep emitting if they ensure that an equal amount is captured again in some form.The announcement was cheered by climate campaigners. Greenpeace executive director Jennifer Morgan called it ""an important signal"" that showed climate change is ""top of agenda for China.""""A big shift for curbing emissions and a significant step forward in international cooperation"" U.N. climate chief Patricia Espinosa said.The goal will be a challenge for China, which relies heavily for its electricity on coal, one of the most carbon-intensive fossil fuels.China released the equivalent of 10 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide, or CO2, into the atmosphere in 2018, according to the Global Carbon Project that tracks emissions worldwide. That was almost twice as much as the United States and three times as much as the European Union.Several other major emitters have set earlier deadlines, with the EU aiming to be carbon neutral by 2050. Frans Timmermans, who leads the EU executive's efforts on climate change, welcomed Xi's announcement.""We need decisive action from every country to keep temperatures under control, tackle climate change and keep our planet inhabitable,"" he said.The United States has so far not set such a goal. President Donald Trump, who once described climate change as a hoax invented by China, has started the process of pulling the U.S. out of the Paris accord.If China fulfills Xi's goal, it could prevent 0.2 to 0.4 C further warming for the world, according to ""very rough estimates"" by MIT management professor John Sterman, who models and tracks emission reductions and pledges with Climate Interactive.But much depends on how they do their emissions reduction and how soon they cut them, he said, adding he has to do a more thorough analysis.""That's a lot,"" Sterman said. ""China's by far the world's big emitter. They're emitting more than the EU and US together.""""It puts a lot more pressure on the United States,"" Sterman said.Perhaps even more important than the carbon neutrality pledge is the effort to peak carbon dioxide emissions before 2030 instead of by 2030, Sterman said. Carbon dioxide's more than 100-year lifetime in the air makes earlier emission cuts more effective than promises in the future, he said.""Emissions that don't happen between now and 2030 are going to reduce warming a lot more than the same emission reductions after 2060,"" Sterman said.However, pledges are not the same as actions. What's needed is signs of action, such as eliminating plans to build new coal-fired power plants, cutting subsidies for coal power and getting off coal entirely, Sterman said. Coal is the biggest carbon dioxide emitter of power sources.Twenty-nine nations before China have pledged to achieve climate neutrality in different years, according to the Carbon Neutrality Coalition. They include Canada.With China, the 30 countries that have some kind of carbon neutrality pledges, account for about 43 per cent of the world's carbon dioxide emissions from the burning of fossil fuels. The largest polluting countries not on the list are the United States, India, Russia, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, South Africa, Turkey, Brazil and Australia.",0.14487727272727274,0.42899090909090903

I don't believe that this will be repeated again,"" said Hagerman.Barges bring critical fuel and other dry goods to Arctic coastal and Mackenzie River communities every summer in both the N.W.T. and Nunavut.Hagermen said these four barges from China Merchants Jinling Shipyard are part of a new series that are made specifically to handle large volumes of fuel products. With the increased capacity, it will allow MTS to decrease the number of deliveries into some communities.An Infrastructure spokesperson said the total budget to design, build and deliver the four barges is $20.7 million; the federal government paid for 75 per cent, and the territorial government covered the other 25 per cent.Hagerman said, so far, organizing the delivery has been going better than he anticipated — despite the shipyard in China shutting down ""for well over a month"" since the height of the pandemic in March.Another concern has been that, like the N.W.T., China has been seeing high water levels, and the country is dealing with severe flooding.""We were really concerned, of course, that we wouldn't be able to get the barges at all this year,"" he said. ""I don't know how they did it, but they fast-tracked and put us right back on schedule.""With the ships coming in during the COVID-19 pandemic, there will be restrictions in place, said an Infrastructure spokesperson in an email Tuesday. Interactions between crew and residents are already restricted for regular community cargo deliveries, with designated drop-off zones. ""For the delivery of the barges from China, the barges will be unloaded by another vessel between 30 and 60 kilometres offshore, depending on weather. There will be no physical interactions or contact between vessels or vessel crews,"" the email said.The crew from China will not leave their vessel, with communication between crews only by radio. The email said MTS staff who are physically involved with attaching the new barges have gone through 14 days of self-isolation, as have the Chinese crew members.Nunakput MLA Jackie Jacobson said the new barges are going to be a big deal for his riding and other Arctic coastal communities.""It just reassures, having new barges in place that are able to carry as much fuel as we need for these communities. Instead of doing two trips a year, they are able to do it all in one,"" said Jacobson.""I'm looking forward to making sure that all my coastal communities are being serviced and I think this is a big step for our government working with the coastal communities.""""We haven't seen any big boats since last year, so it will be good to see,"" said Jacobson.Hagerman, with MTS, said the heavy-lift ship is slated to head overseas with the barges on July 28.It should arrive about 14 days later, depending on the weather.Hagerman said the new vessels won't be replacing any current barges, and although these vessels are generally used on the ocean, they can also be used on rivers.",0.1316830808080808,0.42580186480186477

Pompeo called for the free world to ""induce"" change in China, making an overt appeal for a new coalition of democratic nations to force the Chinese Communist Party change direction or face isolation. Pompeo said western engagement with China could not continue as it has.""The free world must triumph over this new tyranny,"" he said in speech to an invited audience that included exiled Chinese dissidents. ""The old paradigm of blind engagement with China simply won't get it done. We must not continue it. We must not return to it.""Pompeo's speech was just the latest in series of Trump administration broadsides against China that have become an almost daily occurrence with cabinet-level officials from Pompeo, U.S. Defence Secretary Mark Esper and Attorney General Bill Barr launching harsh criticisms of Beijing. The three men have each delivered public addresses attacking China in recent weeks, as has FBI director Christopher Wray.WATCH | Trump signals bashing China will be part of re-election campaign:CBC NewsTrump, who in the early days of the coronavirus pandemic, was playing up his ""friendship"" and positive relationship with Chinese President Xi Jinping in an apparent effort to preserve trade negotiations with the Chinese, now seems to have signed off on an all-out assault on China. This has come as his polling numbers decline over COVID-19 and he looks to paint his presumed challenger in November's election, former vice-president Joe Biden, as soft on China.In his speech Pompeo called on nations to induce change in the Chinese Communist Party's behaviour ""because Beijing's actions threaten our people and our prosperity.""China has roundly rejected the administration's accusations and taken particular aim at Pompeo, who it has accused of fomenting anti-Chinese sentiment around the world. China maintains that it is only seeking to develop its economy and society for the benefit of its own people and the world.Pompeo heaped scorn on China's position, calling it a clear threat to the world. ""If the free world doesn't change Communist China, Communist China will surely change us. There can be no return to past practices because they're comfortable, or because they're convenient.""""The kind of engagement we have been pursuing has not brought the kind of change in China that President Nixon hoped to induce,"" Pompeo said. ""The truth is that our policies — and those of other free nations — resurrected China's failing economy, only to see Beijing bite the international hands that fed it.""Pompeo suggested the creation of a bloc, what he termed ""a new grouping of like-minded nations — a new alliance of democracies,"" to oppose China, although he was not specific about which countries should join. He did not mention the ""Community of Democracies"" group that was co-founded by the U.S. and Poland during former president Bill Clinton's administration to promote global human rights and rule of law globally, which has been ignored since Trump became president.China, meanwhile, has embarked on its own effort to build alliances with infrastructure and financial assistance packages to developing nations. It has established a bloc of nations that vote with it at various United Nations and other international institutions, some of which the Trump administration has withdrawn from.The State Department has been curtailing visas for Chinese and Communist Party officials involved in Xinjiang, Tibet and Hong Kong, and limiting the number of Chinese students and journalists allowed to come to the United States. In addition, the Commerce and Treasury departments have both announced new sanctions against China. They have warned private U.S. and foreign firms of potential penalties and reputational risk if they start or continue business with Chinese entities implicated by the U.S. in human rights abuses or clamping down on freedoms in Hong Kong.On Wednesday, the administration ordered China to close its consulate in Houston, citing intellectual property theft, inappropriate actions on behalf of Chinese students and researchers and behaviour inconsistent with legitimate diplomats by consular officials based in the Texas city.

Ye had been found guilty of manufacturing and transporting drugs, the court said in a brief statement.Another suspect in the case was also given the death penalty and four others sentenced to between seven years and life in prison. Death sentences are automatically referred to China's highest court for review.Ties between Canada and China have soured over Canada's late 2018 arrest of Meng Wanzhou, a company executive and the daughter of Huawei's founder, at Vancouver's airport in at the request of the U.S., which wants her extradited to face fraud charges over the company's dealings with Iran.Her arrest angered Beijing, which calls it a political move aimed at constraining China's rise as a global technology power.Ye's sentencing comes a day after fellow Canadian Xu Weihong was given the death penalty by the Guangzhou Municipal Intermediate Court, also in Guandong province. Convicted Canadian drug smuggler Robert Schellenberg was sentenced to death in a sudden retrial shortly after Meng's arrest, and a Canadian citizen identified as Fan Wei was given the death penalty in April 2019 for his role in a multinational drug smuggling case.In apparent retaliation, China also detained former Canadian diplomat Michael Kovrig and Canadian entrepreneur Michael Spavor weeks after Meng's arrest, accusing them of vague national security crimes.Foreign Affairs Minister François-Philippe Champagne, reacting Thursday to news of Xu's sentence, said Ottawa was profoundly concerned.""We oppose the death penalty at every step of the way,"" Champagne said in an interview on CBC's Power and Politics. ""We have said it time and time and time again to the Chinese government and will continue to do that.""Champagne said Canada is trying to build an international coalition of nations to advocate against the arbitrary detention of foreign nationals and for consular access when they are detained.",-0.09277777777777778,0.2791666666666667
45,Canada building its own PPE network in China | CBC News,When Cargojet flight 1392 touched down in Hamilton on Saturday it brought with it millions of badly needed N95 respirator masks to help in the fight against COVID-19.,2020-04-13T08:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canada-building-own-ppe-supply-chain-in-china-1.5530259,"Note: This story was updated with new information on April 16, 2020.When Cargojet flight 1392 touched down in Hamilton on Saturday it brought with it millions of badly needed N95 respirator masks to help in the fight against COVID-19.The Boeing 767 was the third delivery of critical supplies arriving under a made-for-Canada plan set up with the help of diplomats and consultants in China, a warehouse in Shanghai, and two of Canada's airlines.The plan was born out of urgency. With the global market for medical supplies overwhelmed by chaos and acts of piracy, Canada needed to take some of the risk out of securing everything from badly needed medical masks to gowns to gloves. Federal bureaucrats and political staff handling procurement of medical supplies were frustrated by deliveries showing up late. Unreliable and profiteering brokers were driving prices through the roof. Rival countries were buying shipments out from under each other.Yesterday, we received our third shipment of supplies needed to help our front-line healthcare workers protect themselves and continue caring for Canadians. The shipment contained millions of N95 respirators.There are even stories circulating of unnamed countries sending government planes to China — ferrying suitcases stuffed with cash — to buy supplies right on the tarmac or at the factory door.""It is really a Wild West when it comes to buying medical supplies right now,"" Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland told reporters on April 6.That intense global competition comes as health professionals in Canada warn of extreme shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE) that they say is putting the lives of front-line workers at risk. Some staff have even walked off the job because of a lack of protective gear.What Canada hopes will be a partial solution got its start in the embassy in Beijing.Dominic Barton, Canada's ambassador to China, may be new to the world of diplomacy, but the former managing director of the management consulting firm McKinsey brings a deep understanding of the Chinese economy to his role. Prior to his ambassadorship, Barton also sat on the advisory board of the state-run China Development Bank. His experience is being put to use in the global bidding wars for medical supplies. ""We're lucky we have Barton,"" said a federal official working directly on the procurement efforts. ""He's a business person first. He has good links into China, gets China, gets Chinese business.""Barton redeployed much of the staff at Canada's embassy, consulates and trade offices all over China. The diplomatic staff flipped their role from selling Canada to the Chinese, to buying Chinese medical supplies for Canada.""We have engaged our embassy on the ground in efforts to ensure that our orders are delivered on schedule and those parties are also identifying new opportunities for us,"" Public Services and Procurement Minister Anita Anand said on April 7.  But Canada's diplomats lacked an intimate knowledge of China's medical manufacturing sector and supply chains. So Canada hired a multi-national management consulting firm to help officials navigate what had suddenly become the world's most competitive industry. Federal officials would not initially confirm the name of the consulting firm because of the sensitive nature of these operations, but a source with direct knowledge of the arrangement said it was not Barton's old firm McKinsey. The unnamed consulting firm is helping Canada identify which factories are more reliable in terms of delivering quality goods that will meet Canadian standards. Stories have been surfacing around the world of sub-par masks and other defective supplies arriving from China only to be sent back or thrown out.Public Services and Procurement Minister Anita confirmed April 16 that Deloitte Canada will provide assistance on transportation, receiving, storage services and customs clearances.Members of the Chinese diaspora in Canada are also using their business connections to help federal and provincial governments secure reliable supplies. Canada's plan helps. But it isn't foolproof. The Toronto Star reported that Canada recently received a shipment of badly needed testing swabs only to find they were contaminated with what is believed to be mould. ""Cutting deals and securing quality supplies quickly is probably the biggest challenge in this entire thing,"" said the official working on procurement. There is also the challenge of ensuring that what Canada orders actually arrives. Barton may know business and the consultants may know the supply chains, but none of that guarantees medical supplies actually make it to Canada. ""Ordering of course does not guarantee a delivery,"" Anand said recently. ""In order to make sure that goods find their way back to Canada, we are taking very serious steps on the ground.""Those steps include hiring France-based Bolloré Logistics — a global transportation and logistics firm that has operated in Shanghai since 1994 — to help with on-the-ground support, including the transportation and receiving of goods, to ensure the Canadian orders are delivered in as timely a fashion as possible and are not diverted to a higher bidder. Bolloré Logistics helps get the supplies from the factory to a secure warehouse in Shanghai near the airport where they can be stored while the company works on customs clearance. This is where the near shut-down of international travel that is crippling global airlines actually helps Canada. There is a sudden glut of planes and pilots available to fly and maintain a critical air bridge for medical supplies. The first two flights organized as part of this effort arrived in Toronto on April 1 and April 6, delivering a resupply of personal protective equipment. The April 6 flight arrived with about eight million surgical masks ordered by the federal government, and other orders made directly by the governments of Nova Scotia and Quebec. The federal government has secured an arrangement with Air Canada and Cargojet to run more supply flights from China once Bolloré Logistics has enough supplies in the warehouse ready to go. The Cargojet flight that landed in Hamilton was the most recent delivery. Air Canada is due to send planes to Shanghai this week to deliver additional shipments. Touchdown in Hamilton from Shanghai today <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/CJT1392?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#CJT1392</a> 75,000 pounds of Personal Protection Equipment for Canadian front line workers &amp; <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/GovtOfCanada?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#GovtOfCanada</a> Proud of our entire <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/Cargojet?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#Cargojet</a> team for all their hard work &amp; sacrifice. 🇨🇦✈️ <a href=""https://t.co/nakmWoxJNk"">pic.twitter.com/nakmWoxJNk</a>The plan is for the number of flights to grow as the supply chain in China is able to deliver more supplies. Airlines are working to be ready to meet the demand.On April 7, Air Canada's Vice President of Flight Operations Murray Strom issued an internal call for pilots to volunteer for special flight assignments to support this effort.""The government of Canada has requested Air Canada provide emergency airlift capabilities to operate cargo-only flights"" from Shanghai to Canada, Strom wrote to his pilots in a memo obtained by CBC News. Strom specifically asked pilots trained to fly Boeing 777s and 787s to step up — suggesting there could be as many as four daily flights travelling to Shanghai via Japan. ""This operation will require a lot of pilots over the next seven to 10 days to assist both Canada and our airline to make this happen,"" Strom wrote. ""These are truly unique times we are going through, but we all need to be willing to do our part to assist our fellow Canadians who are going through some very tough times.""On Saturday Air Canada publicly announced that it was boosting its cargo capacity by stripping the seats out of three of its enormous Boeing 777 aircraft to double their cargo capacity.""Bringing critical medical and other vital supplies rapidly to Canada and helping distribute them across the country is imperative to combating the COVID-19 crisis,"" Tim Strauss, vice-president of cargo at Air Canada, said in a statement. We’re transforming three of our <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/B777s?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#B777s</a> to transport goods in the cabin, thereby doubling their cargo capacity to help fly critical medical and vital supplies to and across Canada.

But it's backstopping a still-fragile supply chain in a time of great stress. To further reduce risk, Canada is buying from as many Chinese factories as possible so it doesn't become reliant on a single operator. The idea is to reduce the exposure from having a manufacturing line bought out by a rival country or being left vulnerable due to a sudden drop in quality from a specific supplier. ""These supply chains are complex,"" Anand said on April 7. ""But we are taking every effort to make sure that we get those goods back to Canada and in the hands of front-line health-care workers.""The global procurements are part of what Public Services and Procurement Canada calls an ""aggressive approach"" to getting PPE for front-line workers, including bulk-buying for the provinces and scaling up domestic manufacturing capacity. Provinces and territories are also taking steps to build their own inventory of supplies.""We are exploring all options for securing the necessary equipment and supplies to fight COVID-19, through both domestic and international supply chains, to ensure that front-line health-care workers across the country are equipped and protected in the fight against COVID-19,"" spokesperson Michèle LaRose said in an email.",0.06809925719321691,0.3972871088642899

She's got a ticket booked for Sept. 15, but isn't sure how she'll be allowed to board the flight unless she's able to get tested for COVID-19 within three days of the trip. Speaking through Guo, the new grandmother told CBC that she worries for her husband, who is in poor health and lives alone in China. She also said she brought only enough medication for a few months, and has been using less of it to stretch out what she's got. That supply is quickly running out. Guo said those wishing to travel internationally and require a negative COVID-19 test for travel are willing to pay the costs of being tested.They can't get them done privately, even if that were an available option, because the Chinese government specifies that for travel from Canada, the tests need to be administered by institutions designated or recognized by the Chinese embassy or consulates in Canada.In P.E.I., the only acceptable tests would be administered by the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Charlottetown or the Prince County Hospital in Summerside. Officials with the Chief Public Health Office say they are working on the possibility of a testing option for travel purposes, but don't have any additional details at this time. They say more countries are requesting this as a prerequisite for entry for travel so they do plan to address this.No timelines have been provided, however.",0.0,0.36719121719121717

The United States is responsible for all this,"" Wang said. ""We once again urge the United States to immediately retract its wrong decision and create necessary conditions for bringing the bilateral relationship back on track.""The White House urged China on Friday not to engage in ""tit-for-tat retaliation.""""Our action to direct the closure of PRC [People's Republic of China] Consulate General in Houston was taken to protect American intellectual property and Americans' private information,"" National Security Council spokesperson John Ullyot said.""We urge the CCP [Chinese Communist Party] to cease these malign actions rather than engage in tit-for-tat retaliation,"" Ullyot saidWang said some consulate personnel ""interfered in China's internal affairs and harmed China's security interests,"" but gave no details. He said Beijing complained ""many times"" to Washington about that.Also Friday, the U.S. State Department sent out a notice warning Americans in China of a ""heightened risk of arbitrary detention.""""U.S. citizens may be subjected to prolonged interrogations and extended detention for reasons related to 'state security,""' the notice said.Americans may be detained or deported for ""sending private electronic messages critical"" of the Chinese government, it said. The notice gave no indication of what prompted the warning.On Tuesday, the Trump administration ordered the Houston consulate closed within 72 hours. It alleged Chinese agents tried to steal data from facilities including the Texas A&M medical system.The ministry on Thursday rejected the allegations as ""malicious slander"" and warned the Houston consulate's closure was ""breaking down the bridge of friendship"" between the two countries.The United States has an embassy in Beijing and consulates in five other mainland cities — Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu, Shenyang and Wuhan. It also has a consulate in Hong Kong, a Chinese territory.The Chengdu consulate was in the news in 2012 when Wang Lijun, the police chief of the major city of Chongqing, visited and told American officials his concerns about the death of a British business associate of the wife of Chongqing's Communist Party secretary, Bo Xilai.That prompted the British Embassy to ask for a new investigation, which led to the arrest and conviction of Bo's wife. Bo was later dismissed and sentenced to prison.The consulate was surrounded by police while Wang was inside. He later emerged and was arrested and sentenced to 15 years on charges of corruption and defection. The U.S. government has refused to confirm whether Wang asked for asylum.Also Thursday, the U.S. Justice Department said it believes the Chinese Consulate in San Francisco is harbouring a Chinese researcher, Tang Juan, who is accused of lying about her background in the Communist Party's military wing on a visa application.The department announced criminal charges of visa fraud against Tang and three other Chinese researchers.U.S. authorities this week announced criminal charges against two Chinese computer hackers who are accused of targeting companies that are working on vaccines for the coronavirus.WATCH | Pompeo takes aim at China in Nixon Library speech:NewsThe Justice Department said Tang lied on a visa application last October as she made plans to work at the University of California, Davis, and again during an FBI interview months later.U.S. officials including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have stepped up accusations of technology theft.

However Canadian groups say the tests are unfounded since there is no scientific evidence that COVID-19 has been transmitted in food.,2020-06-19T09:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/nova-scotia-lobster-covid-19-testing-china-1.5618215,"A recent coronavirus outbreak traced to a market in Beijing is disrupting Canadian live lobster exports to China.New testing measures imposed in at least three cities — Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou— have led to cancelled lobster shipments from Nova Scotia this week and delays for shipments that do arrive.""We've hit a significant snag,"" said Geoff Irvine, executive director of the Lobster Council of Canada.""The latest news is that they will continue to do these random inspections, which has effectively caused many of the large shipments to stop.""Chinese authorities began testing for COVID-19 in imported food after an outbreak was traced to a cutting board used for salmon in the Xinfadi market in the Chinese capital. China is a crucial market for Canadian lobster fishermen. Before the pandemic struck, China was edging closer to overtaking the United States as the top importer, with sales of live lobster to China reaching $457 million last year.Random seafood shipments, including live lobster from Canada, are being held until test results come back.""The tests can take up to 36 hours, which means that the product sits out of water for 36 hours, so there can be mortality issues that someone has to pay for,"" Irvine said.The inspections have interrupted a rebound in live lobster sales to China after the market collapsed earlier in the year due to the pandemic.Figures from Statistics Canada, first reported by seafood publication Undercurrent News, reveal the scale of the collapse.In January, Canada sent 4,323 tonnes of live lobster worth $79.3 million in China. The majority of it was from Nova Scotia.In February, sales fell to 46 tonnes — worth just $940,000.""We've known since the start of the pandemic that there were going to be bumps in the road with regards to export markets. We've seen those challenges from day one,"" said Federal Fisheries and Oceans Minister Bernadette Jordan.The hope is this setback is a blip.""There's been no official closure of the borders or border ban on seafood products. It's just this testing regime that makes doing the business very, very risky,"" said Irvine.""The effect of these inspections are that the live shippers just simply don't want to ship there to take the risk.""I do know some shippers who are changing their terms of sale. If Chinese buyers want to pay for the product in advance and take the risk … of the inspections, they can still do that.""Other industry associations are also speaking out, including the Fisheries Council of Canada and the National Fisheries Institute in Washington.All say there is no scientific evidence that COVID-19 has been transmitted in food or food packaging, citing multiple public health agencies from the World Health Organization to the Canadian Food Inspection Agency.""The bigger problem is that it's completely unfounded,"" said Irvine.Earlier this week, Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada told provincial officials and industry stakeholders the Chinese government has not notified Canada of what it is doing.""There are no clear details on the type of products that will be targeted or the delay that may be caused for clearing customs as a result of testing,"" said a June 16 note. ""However, there are indications that meat, poultry, aquatic products and fruit and vegetables may be subject to testing.""The Government of Canada remains in close contact with the Canadian Mission in Beijing and will continue to seek further clarifications from official sources.""On Thursday night, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency said Chinese authorities have asked Canada and other countries for ""assurances"" food is free of COVID-19.""The General Administration of Customs China (GACC) has written to trading partners, including Canada, to officially request that government authorities provide assurances that food processing establishments eligible to export to China follow measures to prevent any COVID-19 contamination of food products during food production,"" spokesperson Christine Carnaffan said in an email response to CBC News.""The Government of Canada continues to engage with Chinese counterparts to reassure China of the strong measures in place in Canada to ensure the safety of the food and food products exported from Canada.""The statement reiterated the Canadian Food Inspection Agency's position: ""There is currently no scientific evidence that food or food packaging is a likely source or route of transmission of COVID-19. In addition, there have been no confirmed cases of food or food packaging being associated with the transmission of the virus.""",0.06153607503607502,0.41302988531935914

So, be careful. There's a lot of fake news,"" he said  As for the concentration camps, as you call it ... actually it was used to be vocational training centres.""PoliticsHe stuck to Beijing's often-repeated position that the camps were necessary to quell the unrest from a few years ago.""So, that's why the government had to take preventative measures when it comes to counter-terrorism,"" he said.Cong also faced questions about the detention of two Canadians, Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig, who have been held for over year, an action widely seen as retaliation for the arrest of Chinese telecommunication executive Meng Wanzhou by federal authorities.She is wanted in the U.S. in connection with the alleged violation of Iranian sanctions by her company, Huawei.Cong insisted Spavor and Kovrig are being treated fairly according to Chinese law, although he would not say when the country will present evidence to back up the claims of security officials that the two men are spies and a threat to national security. He faced several questions about the case during the panel discussion and afterward when speaking with journalists. The ambassador did suggest the frosty relationship between Canada and China has thawed a bit because of the Liberal government's measured response to the outbreak of the novel coronavirus. ""I would like to commend and appreciate what the Canadian side has done so far in the fight against the outbreak,"" Cong said. ""I think, first, it has adopted a cool-headed approach and an evidence-based manner.""Expressions of ""support, solidarity and sympathy"" by Canada have been also appreciated, he added.Politics",0.0,0.32905982905982906

The novel coronavirus has spread widely throughout China, even though Chinese New Year celebrations were cancelled and the government has promoted hand-washing, wearing medical masks and seeking immediate medical attention.Earlier this month, the World Health Organization announced a chronic shortage of gowns, masks, gloves and other personal protective equipment in every region, but especially China. The WHO is working to distribute the equipment to those who need it, and health-care workers are the first priority.Although the hospital the masks are going to isn't in Wuhan, the epicentre of the epidemic, it's still in need, Ducas said.""It's at least 500 kilometres away, but that doesn't stop a virus,"" he said.""This is a relatively large hospital. There's lots of people in and out of there. This is a potential hazard to the health-care workers and to the patients.

Sadly, as you all know, Canadian efforts in this area have so far been unsuccessful."" The committee has been examining Canada's relations with China, which have plummeted to an all-time low since December 2018.Earlier Tuesday, Conservative MP Michael Chong urged Foreign Affairs Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne to adopt a more consistent approach to getting tough with China. The Conservative foreign affairs critic told Champagne during a House of Commons committee meeting Tuesday that the government needs to show Canadians how it will deal with growing Chinese intimidation of Canadians within Canada. Chong said it is inconsistent for the government to be talking tougher on China, while Canada's current ambassador, Dominic Barton, is making speeches about the need to broaden trade with the People's Republic. ""I think it needs to be a lot clearer, a lot more consistent if Canada is going to have a clear, consistent voice with respect to China on the world stage,"" said Chong. Chong sponsored a motion that won approval in the Commons last week that calls on the government to decide within 30 days whether to allow China's Huawei Technologies to supply equipment for its next generation 5G internet network. Meng is a chief executive of Huawei. Champagne replied that Canada has taken a smart and firm approach with China lately that includes speaking out against its ill treatment of pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong and of ethnic Muslim Uighurs. ""Whether it comes to the Uighurs or whether it comes to Hong Kong, I've outlined places where we're going to challenge China, places where we're going to, for example, coexist with China,"" Champagne said.",0.0,0.36879699248120307

What we want to see going into 2021 is core funding for frontline organizations that are doing the work ... to not have to worry about piecing together project funding or having to do fundraising events and bake sales.""A CBC investigation launched just days before the pandemic upended Canadian life found that women and children who were victims of domestic violence were turned away from shelters in Canada almost 19,000 times a month. And a national survey found that during the height of the COVID-19 lockdown in Canada gender-based violence was more severe and more frequent, with abusers' tactics become more violent, and frequently deadly.MacDougall said the pandemic has robbed women of many resources that allowed them to exercise independence and power — income, childcare, and a public identity — all while increasing domestic burdens like elder care and housework.""We've been turning back the dial on gender equity. Women were already doing the bulk of the child rearing and the house care, and it's complicated by the work from home context,"" said MacDougall.""For anybody who is experiencing violence in a relationship, that has intensified that.""MacDougall said what has been remarkable for the past months, is that women have still found ways to remove themselves and their children from violent relationships.""That has been extraordinary, in what has been a time of a lot of precarity and fear ... women are leaving,"" she said.She said early in the pandemic she spoke with advocates in China, who said it was critical to ensure resources were available, and could be accessed even in lockdown.Canada's minister for women and gender equality Maryam Monsef said early in the pandemic that the COVID-19 crisis had empowered perpetrators of domestic violence, citing a 20 to 30 per cent increase in rates of gender-based violence in some parts of Canada.In March the federal government pledged $50 million to assist women's shelters, sexual assault centres and similar facilities in Indigenous communities throughout the crisis.But a recent report from Women's Shelters Canada has called for more funding — saying many organizations have had to raise their own funds to cover shelter staff salaries, which aren't high enough to retain staff to begin with.MacDougall said that organizations have been nimble in the face of the crisis, but the need to maintain physical distancing has forced them to pare back already limited services, like those offered to women in Vancouver's downtown eastside.A recently-circulated video, which appears to show a man having sex with a woman on a sidewalk near the busy intersection of Main and Hastings streets in broad daylight as people pass by, has reignited debates around women's safety in the area.And news that RCMP are now charging the common-law spouse of the man responsible for killing 22 people in April's mass shooting in Nova Scotia — who also had a long record of domestic violence — has triggered conversations around the role played by police and the criminal justice system in cases involving intimate partner violence.""This is a difficult conversation to have because we always want to believe that police are a part of a woman's safety plan,"" said MacDougall.""As we move through Dec. 6 and into 2021, this is a really good time for us to have in a very important [discussion] about the role of policing in gender-based violence and the extent to which police are a remedy or are a safety mechanism for victims.""",0.04164578111946533,0.36879699248120307

This is the first robotic sample return mission since Russian efforts in the 1960s. Those were an effort to make their mark on the lunar surface after their manned moon program failed.When Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin made their historic landing on the moon in July 1969, a secret Russian robotic probe called Luna 15 was there at the same time. It was an attempt to grab a sample of lunar soil and return it to Earth before the American astronauts got back. The Russians had lost the race to put humans on the moon, but were trying to grab a 'first' and master the moon robotically.Unfortunately, Luna 15 crashed during it's landing attempt and the opportunity for a propaganda coup was lost. However, their Luna 16 mission did successfully return about 100 grams of lunar soil a year later and two other sample return missions succeeded in following years, with the last one, Luna 24, in 1976 — two years after the Apollo program had ended. While these robotic sample return missions did not deliver as much lunar material as the Apollo astronauts, they were considerably cheaper and part of a long history of both Russian and American robotic lunar exploration involving dozens of impactors, orbiters, landers and rovers. In a way, we're in another moon race right now that echoes the race of fifty years ago — except this time it seems the robots might be in the lead. China is using robotic landers to explore the moon, and, if all goes well, Chang'e 5 will bring back several kilograms of moon rocks. In the meantime, the U.S. is struggling to develop a far more expensive effort, relying on huge (and much delayed) rockets that will carry humans to the moon with their Artemis program. It once again brings up the question of whether humans or robots are best suited to space exploration. We debated this on a special edition of Quirks & Quarks last year.Human missions are much more expensive, and historically they are much more politically driven than robotic exploration. The decision by the Kennedy administration in 1961 to send humans to the moon was part of the Cold War competition between the U.S. and Soviet Union to prove technical superiority over one another. The current Artemis program has also been politically influenced. Originally the plan was to first build a space station called Gateway in orbit around the moon. Once it was completed, astronauts would be sent down to the surface some time later this decade. When the Trump administration came to power, the landing was pushed forward to 2024, which would have been the last year of President Trump's second term in office. The Biden administration has not said whether it will keep to that tight schedule.NASA's giant new moon rocket, the Space Launch System (SLS) is slated to make its first flight next year. In the meantime three private companies — SpaceX, Blue Origin and Dynetics — have been contracted to develop lunar landers that would ride on their own rockets. But the pace of development in these programs makes NASA's current 2024 moon landing deadline pretty ambitious.Meanwhile, China is continuing its robotic program beyond the moon with the Tianwen 1 mission currently on its way to Mars. The spacecraft includes an orbiter and a lander, which will make China the third country to make a soft landing on Mars after Russia and the U.S. This is not a sample return mission, but it is not unreasonable to think that China could apply similar technology it is using on the moon to return samples from Mars in the future.Robots have always boldly gone where no one has gone before, exploring every planet in the solar system, as well as dwarf planets, moons, asteroids and comets. They conduct the initial reconnaissance of other worlds, survey the lay of the land and choose the best landing sites for humans who follow.  A whole fleet of robots are currently flying around the solar system. Two others are on their way to Mars with the United Arab Emirates' Hope mission and NASA's Perseverance lander scheduled to arrive in February.Beyond Mars, the Japanese Hayabusa2 and American, OSIRIS-REx spacecraft are bringing home samples they collected from asteroids. NASA is planning future missions to visit Europa, a moon of Jupiter and Titan, a mysterious moon of Saturn, the only moon with a thick atmosphere and liquid methane lakes on its surface.There is no doubt it will be a dramatic moment when the next human feet step out onto lunar soil again. Human exploration of space captures the imagination of the public, provides role models for young people and tests the limits of technical, physical and psychological endurance. But humans have not gone very far. The last mission to the moon was in 1972. It will still stretch the limits of our technology to get back there almost half a century later, Meanwhile, the true explorers of space, our silent mechanical servants, will continue their more far-reaching journeys to literally reach out and touch other worlds.",0.0,0.30963786494089524

Gilbert Gapay said in a meeting with disaster-response officials.""We'll continue to look for the missing, help in damage assessment,"" Gapay said.The national police reported that the death toll had risen to at least 42 with 20 missing. The government's main disaster-response agency, which waits for provincial reports and follows a laborious process of verifying casualties, reported a much lower death count, causing confusion.Among the dead were at least 12 villagers who were dug out from mud and rockslides in the northern provinces of Cagayan and Nueva Vizcaya, police said.After slamming into northeastern Quezon province, Vamco gained strength with sustained winds of 155 km/h and gusts of up to 255 km/h. It blew north of metropolitan Manila overnight Wednesday, toppling trees and power poles, swelling rivers, flooding residential communities and setting off landslides and storm surges.In hard-hit Marikina city in the capital region and the towns of Rodriguez and Cainta in nearby Rizal province, several villages were inundated by water that reached the second and third floors of many houses, prompting hundreds of residents to flee to their roofs and call TV and radio networks or post desperate messages on social media. The panic was exacerbated by widespread power outages and loss of internet access.Videos of Marikina showed a thick coat of muddy water covering roads and staining houses and cars. Residents carried appliances and furniture from their homes and used pails and shovels to remove the mud after the water receded.In a televised meeting of Cabinet and disaster-response officials Friday, a reporter asked where President Rodrigo Duterte was, prompting an annoyed response from his spokesperson.""The president's whereabouts should not be asked.

According to a map the ministry provided, none got close to mainland Taiwan itself or flew over it.""ROCAF scrambled fighters, and deployed air defence missile system to monitor the activities,"" the ministry said in a tweet, referring to the Republic of China Air Force, the formal name of Taiwan's air force.Taiwan has complained of repeated incidents of Chinese aircraft near the island this year, and has regularly had to scramble its F-16s and other jets to intercept them.China had on Friday announced at a news conference in Beijing about China's UN peacekeeping efforts combat drills near the Taiwan Strait, and denounced what it called collusion between the island and the United States.U.S. Undersecretary for Economic Affairs Keith Krach arrived in Taipei on Thursday for a three-day visit, the most senior State Department official to come to Taiwan in four decades, angering China. He left Saturday afternoon, according to Taiwan's foreign ministry.Taiwan's defence ministry, in a separate statement, said China was carrying out provocative activities, seriously damaging peace and stability.""The defence ministry sternly condemns this, and calls on the mainland authorities to control themselves and pull back from the edge.""China's widely read state-backed tabloid the Global Times, published by the ruling Communist Party's official People's Daily, said in a Saturday editorial that Friday's drills were a rehearsal to take over Taiwan.""The U.S. and Taiwan must not misjudge the situation, or believe the exercise is a bluff. Should they continue to make provocations, a war will inevitably break out,"" it said.Both sides need to resume dialogue to reduce the risk of war, Johnny Chiang, leader of Taiwan's main opposition party the Kuomintang, wrote on his Facebook page.""People who are willing to play a communication role are stigmatized and people who clamour for war are regarded as heroes. Such an atmosphere is definitely not conducive to the peaceful and stable development of the Taiwan Strait,"" said Chiang, whose party traditionally favours close ties with China.Life has continued as normal in Taiwan with no sign of panic. The island has long been accustomed to living with Chinese threats.Taiwan's people have shown no interest in being ruled by autocratic China, re-electing President Tsai Ing-wen in a landslide last year on what was largely a platform of standing up to Beijing.The latest Chinese flights came the same day Taiwan held a memorial service for former president Lee Teng-hui, dubbed ""Mr. Democracy"" for ending autocratic rule in favour of free elections and championing Taiwan's separate identity from China.Lee, who died in July, became Taiwan's first democratically elected president in March 1996 after eight months of intimidating war games and missile tests by China in waters around the island.Those events brought China and Taiwan to the verge of conflict, prompting the United States to send an aircraft carrier task force to the area in a warning to Beijing's government.",0.01382700632700632,0.3696797646797646
517,Government quietly made 'back door' agreement with U.S. that could undermine treaty on plastic waste | CBC News,The Trudeau government quietly signed a protocol with the U.S. on October 26 that will allow Canada to continue to ship plastic waste to American waste brokers — opening a 'back door' that will allow it to evade the plastic waste shipping restrictions the federal government committed to under the Basel Treaty plastic ban.,2020-12-03T22:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canada-us-plastic-waste-basel-1.5827340,"Environmental groups are accusing the Trudeau government of acting in bad faith after it quietly signed a bilateral agreement with the U.S. that could allow it to evade some of its obligations to stop shipping plastic waste to poor countries around the world.The agreement — which was never publicly announced or gazetted — was signed on Oct. 26, 2020, the U.S. State Department told CBC News. Environment Canada declined CBC's requests to see the text. But experts on plastic waste say it runs counter to the spirit of the Basel Convention on plastic waste and appears to be designed to allow Canada to evade its obligations.""This is, in effect, a backdoor for Canada to offload its waste problems to the U.S., who will offload to the very countries potentially that the Basel Convention amendment is meant to stop,"" said Myra Hird of Queens University, a fellow of the Royal Society of Canada who represented Canada at the G7's microplastics summit last year.""It was not the spirit of the amendment and what we were proclaiming to sign on to.""The plastic waste amendments to the Basel Convention, which take effect on January 1, 2021, effectively limit nations to shipping plastic recyclables only to other signatory countries that are bound by the same rules.They also require prior informed consent from the receiving country.Canada accepted those amendments after a flood of negative publicity about Canadian plastic waste — much of it mislabelled as recyclable — being dumped in developing countries such as the Philippines and Cambodia.A dispute with the Philippines over the issue led to Manila recalling its ambassador to Ottawa, and only ended in May when the Canadian government paid to ship 69 containers of garbage back to Vancouver.Canada informed the UN on March 9 of this year that it ""supports and fully intends to comply"" with the ban.But the Trudeau government also sought to ensure it could use a loophole that allows countries to ship plastic waste to non-signatory nations if they do so under an existing bilateral agreement. The United States is one of only two countries never to ratify the Basel Convention; Haiti is the other. As such, the U.S. is not bound by the new rules on plastic waste. By signing the deal with the U.S. prior to ratifying the Basel plastic amendments, Canada keeps open the option of sending its waste to brokers south of the border.Once Canadian plastic waste enters the States, it can change hands several times. There is no reliable mechanism to track it and no way to ensure it is not re-exported to developing countries, where it often ends up in landfills or in the ocean.Environment and Climate Change Canada discussed the proposed agreement in a webinar with two environmental groups in September — the Canadian Environmental Law Association and Health and Environment Justice Support (HEJ Support) — thereby technically meeting its duty to consult. But most environmental groups that have consulted with the government on plastics say they were blindsided when they learned of the agreement at a U.S. State Department briefing three weeks after it was signed.""This was signed about five weeks ago now and it still is secret and no one has seen it, apart from those who signed it,"" said Kathleen Ruff, former head of the B.C. Human Rights Commission. She now heads Right On Canada, a group that campaigns against plastic pollution.Moira Kelly of Environment Canada confirmed the existence of the agreement to CBC News. ""In accordance with its obligations under the Basel Convention, Canada concluded an arrangement with the United States affirming that the waste subject to the arrangement and circulating between Canada and the U.S. is managed in an environmentally sound manner,"" she said.""This arrangement balances the need to manage the traded plastic waste in an environmentally sound manner in both Canada and the U.S. while reducing barriers to recycling, developing secondary markets and meeting domestic goals, such as recycled content. Maintaining circulation of these materials between Canada and the U.S. can also disincentivize exports overseas.""The Basel treaty amendments require any such bilateral agreement to meet standards as high as, or higher than, those in the treaty, which is legally binding.Kelly said the U.S.-Canada deal ""affirms"" that ""waste moving between Canada and the U.S. is managed in an environmentally sound manner."" When pressed on the meaning of the word ""affirms,"" however, Environment Canada conceded that the agreement with the U.S. is not legally binding.Hird said that makes all the difference.""If this bilateral agreement allows us to get around that in any way, then we're taking a step backwards, we're not taking a step forward,"" she said.""It's more of a pretence of complying, a gesture of complying,"" said Ruff. ""According to the legal experts we've talked to who are experts on the convention, it's a violation of the convention.""Although the Trudeau government has portrayed itself as a global leader in the struggle to control plastic waste, Canada is one of just three countries among the 188 Basel signatory nations that have yet to ratify the plastic ban amendments. The other two are China and Turkey.The government tabled the amendments in Parliament on Oct. 28. Kelly said ""the Government of Canada is working to complete the ratification process as soon as possible and we continue to aim for ratification on or before January 1.""People who work in the field question why Canada is the only developed country in the Basel Treaty not to ratify the plastic accords.""It's difficult to see that in any kind of good faith,"" said Hird. ""It's difficult to see this ratification, this delay in ratification as being justified at all, in terms of bureaucratic necessity. So I think, really, this will be seen by Canadians as stalling.""Ruff said the situation is an example of the yawning gap between government words and actions when it comes to protecting the environment.""I think one of the huge issues in the world is that environmental laws have not been taken seriously,"" she told CBC News. ""Everyone pays lip service to them, but when the rubber hits the road, too often we see governments not complying.""And this is exactly what seems to be happening right here, right now, with this arrangement with the United States.""WATCH: Plastic waste and supermarket shopping — a Marketplace reportMarketplace",0.0,0.3696797646797646

Any Hong Kong resident who has graduated from university in the past three years can apply to work for up to three years in Canada, and will be offered a way to transition more easily to permanent residency.But the announcement also includes some measures for Hong Kongers fleeing persecution by China, Mendicino said.For Hong Kongers, Canada will waive the one-year period that failed asylum seekers usually have to wait in order to have their claims re-assessed. What's more, no asylum claims will be rejected on the basis of conviction under Beijing's national security law, which criminalizes ""secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces,"" and which pro-democracy activists view as a tool to quell political dissent. Here is part of Mendicino's conversation with As It Happens host Carol Off. Minister Mendicino, what message should China take from your announcement today?I was very proud to make an announcement that is aimed at recruiting and retaining young Hong Kong graduates who I hope will see an opportunity in this policy, in this initiative. I hope that they see something that speaks to their aspiration in finding work, continuing their studies and building a better life in Canada.The question, though, is what should China see in this? Our announcement is focused on strengthening the ties between Canada and the people of Hong Kong, and it builds on the immigration plan, which I announced a little less than two weeks ago. Our focus is on creating jobs, on ensuring that we accelerate our economic recovery. And we think that young graduates and the young people of Hong Kong have something to contribute, not only in the long term, but today.Take the health-care sector where our workers are, you know, [working] tirelessly around the clock. We need reinforcements. Hong Kong is also well known as a tech and innovation hub. We think that the experience that young Hong Kongers have will benefit our economy today and also address some of the long-term demographic challenges, which I've been speaking of for some time.Your program, your arrangement, is aimed to attract people with high education who would be economically useful to Canada. But it's not an offer of help to those who may need to flee because of political persecution. How is this supposed to help those people?Well, I dispute that for a number of reasons. One, Canada has a robust asylum system, and those claims, which are adjudicated by our independent tribunal, not a political process, has the capacity to accept claims for those who are fleeing persecution.In addition to that, I highlighted a number of measures, which we've aligned based on our own ongoing monitoring of the situation in Hong Kong, including waving the one-year period that usually applies to failed asylum claimants. And in this particular case, failed asylum claimants from Hong Kong will not have to wait that one year. They can apply for an assessment, and that may mean, in practical terms, that they get to stay in Canada.The other thing that I underlined today is that … no Hong Kong foreign national will be disqualified for applying for asylum by virtue of the sole reason that they've been charged under the Chinese national security law. And more than that, no one will be disqualified from Hong Kong or anywhere else by sole virtue of the fact that they've been charged under the national security law.A few things about that. First of all, very few people have been charged under the national security law. Very many of those pro-democracy activists who've been out in the streets have been charged under previous laws that may be laws that are recognized under Canadian law. So it's not really helpful to them, is it? Why not expand it so that those pro-democracy activists have a better chance at making an asylum claim in Canada, if that's your intention?Well, I hear you, but I want to be absolutely clear about this. No person will be disqualified from claiming asylum who is fleeing persecution, or any other immigration route, if they have not committed a crime that would be applicable under Canadian law.OK, just to stop you there, sir, because what I'm saying is that some of the charges [that] have been levelled at pro-democracy activists might be regarded under Canadian law, even though they were used against people exercising their free speech or their democratic rights. The laws themselves would be consistent with Canadian law. So it's quite possible that many people will be disqualified because they have faced charges in Hong Kong.In those circumstances, if somebody has been deemed inadmissible because they were deemed to have committed, potentially, an offence under Canadian law, then I think the vast majority of Canadians, if not all Canadians, would understand that. Those admissibility requirements are there to ensure that we have an asylum system that is fair, that is transparent, and that does protect those of us who are here.But at the same time, the policies that I announced today do ensure that the national security law, which is one of the developments that we are concerned about, is not a barrier to claiming asylum. And that is an important measure and one that is responsive to some of the concerns in the community.So if someone has been charged previously, a pro-democracy activist, as having been a threat to national security — and we know those laws were used rather liberally before this new law came into place — then you would anticipate that those people would not be qualified?Carol, I understand why you're probing on the issue. I think it's very important to remind your listeners that these are claims that are adjudicated by the Immigration and Refugee Board. We don't want politicians making these determinations. We have expert appointees who look at the merits of each of these claims. We ensure that people who are claiming asylum meet all of our admissibility requirements. And the point of situating the policies that I announced today in the broader context of our asylum system is to say that the national security law will not be a barrier.We spoke with Dennis Kwok yesterday. He is one of the pro-democracy members of the Hong Kong legislature who were expelled, one of the four. He was born in Canada. He said that he doesn't want to have to leave. He wants to see the international community do more to make it so that he doesn't have to. And that's long been Canada's response to these situations, where the effort is put into doing everything possible so that people don't have to flee their homes, they don't have to leave. Is this, in fact, a kind of an admission that you can't change things, that the only course for these people is to leave?Well, I can't speak for his comments, but I certainly appreciate where he's coming from. And that's why, you know, today I emphasize that this is about expanding opportunities, that it is about providing additional routes and pathways for young Hong Kongers who may be seeking opportunities elsewhere, including in Canada.I know, sir. My question is, though, do you believe that Canada has done everything possible to make it so that people don't have to leave … Hong Kong, which is where they would like to be? … Do you think that is an admission that there's nothing more you can do?I don't think it's an admission, but I do think that Canada continues to be a very constructive partner on the world stage. And I think that our immigration policies, including the initiative I announced today, is consistent with our tradition and our values of being an open and inclusive country that believes that we benefit from the talent and the skills, the experience and the diversity of welcoming people from all around the world.And notwithstanding the fact that we are in the midst of a pandemic, we have found ways to proceed with safe and orderly immigration, and we will continue to chart a course that builds on those traditions. Written by Sheena Goodyear with files from The Canadian Press.

They know my job description.""  MarketplaceBased on the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, an international treaty Canada ratified in 1966, ""consul general"" is reserved for top envoys from countries with full diplomatic ties with Canada stationed in cities other than Ottawa. Top envoys assigned to Ottawa bear the title ""ambassador.""Taiwan lost its diplomatic recognition with many countries along with its seat at the United Nations when the People's Republic of China joined the UN in 1971.For decades, Taiwanese across the globe — including around 40,000 in B.C. — have been pushing for the island to be recognized as a sovereign state and to once again be represented in the UN. Many hope the country's impressive management of the COVID-19 pandemic will help its bid for recognition.The island has kept the number of infections at around 500 out of its 24 million population, while China, where COVID-19 originated, has had more than 90,000 positive tests so far.Along with Chen's comments on how he's viewed by consuls general, Taiwan's search for recognition was given another surprising boost last week when Hsiao Bi-khim, the island's top envoy to Washington, D.C., changed her Twitter bio to ""Taiwan Ambassador to the US."" Sorry to disappoint so many supporters, but Taiwan Ambassador is what many call me and also my job description. My title remains Representative, Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office, when engaging with the US government.Taiwan's identity has always been a sensitive topic in China's foreign relations. Although Hsiao later tweeted that her official title is the Representative of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office, her new online ID triggered a fresh round of debates between Beijing and Taipei. In a statement to CBC News, the People's Republic of China's consulate in Vancouver says Taiwan is an ""inalienable part"" of China that is solely represented by its central government in Beijing. This doesn't reverberate with Taiwanese Canadians like Carol Pan, who lives in Vancouver and volunteers with Overseas Community Affairs Council, an organization affiliated with the Taiwanese government to arrange social activities for its citizens living in other countries. ""Taiwan has always been an independent country,"" Pan said. ""After the Second World War, the People's Republic of China never set foot on Taiwan.""Pan said Hsiao's self-identification as ambassador is ""wonderful"" and gives thumbs-up to Chen's being called ""consul general.""""We are hoping eventually some democratic countries can support Taiwan going to be recognized at first and then going to the United Nations,"" she said.In a statement to CBC, Global Affairs said Canada will continue to build people-to-people ties based on shared democratic values and respect for human rights.",0.0,0.3915123456790123

""It's about technologies.""According to Murakami Wood, it's not just countries using their own goals to interfere with the global tech sector, major tech players — including Google's parent company, Alphabet — are finding ways to collaborate with governments to advance corporate interests.""Google is already the kind of default search engine of choice for everybody, but that's just the beginning,"" he said. ""We're seeing them going into undersea cabling, into creating ideal communities as we saw with Sidewalk Labs … they're building housing in the Valley in California too, which is based on Google principles.""Facebook co-founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg has also suggested in the past that the social networking giant ""can do things better than government,"" Murakami Wood said.He added that the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has also shown that as life moves steadily more online, ""the more we are forced to interact with these companies, whether we know it or not.""""We'll find sooner or later that everything in our lives is being run by these corporations,"" he said.As for Chinese tech giants like Huawei, Baidu and TenCent, that have been accused of having close ties to the Chinese Communist Party, Murakami Wood said he believes the ""alignment is much more sympathetic.""""Not necessarily because the Chinese government controls those companies,"" he said. ""I think because there is a genuine agreement in terms of what strategic aims are between the leaders of those companies and the Chinese state.""""So long as the Chinese state continues to be successful using technology in order to advance its particular interests, I think all of those companies will be totally on board with them.""Murakami Wood also addressed the recently announced Chinese ""Global Initiative on Data Security"" — a move that saw the Asian superpower calling on all nations to better handle data security by setting consistent, global standards. ""It's really sort of taken the wind out of those U.S. accusations, because they're putting this forward not just as a kind of bilateral deal between the U.S. and China, what they're proposing is a whole new global order,"" said Murakami Wood. ""They're actually proposing new global rules for how data management and data collection should work, which, if you're in the kind of academic or activist field, they don't look too bad,"" he said. ""Actually, they look better than actually what many people proposed before in this context.""Nonetheless, Murakami Wood said he acknowledged the moral high ground to be gained from such a move, saying that China knows ""Trump is incredibly unpopular in the world, so he's not going to win over countries that are neutral on this.""""China can be seen then as a more honest broker than Trump: Proposing kind of progressive, even human rights-oriented policies, which will absolutely infuriate the U.S.,"" he said. Murakami Wood added that China's arguments for a kind of data sovereignty belie a more nationalist approach to the internet, similar to arguments that some other countries have proposed about building independent ""internets."" ""Even at one point France was talking about this, about having a Francophone internet that would be free from Anglophone spying and so on,"" he said. ""And so China is certainly trying to win over those sorts of people as well… not just the new authoritarians, but the new nationalists out there in general — the people who are talking about a more nationalist technological agenda.""As for Canada's own interests — placed firmly between the soaring American eagle and the ever growing Chinese dragon — Murakami Wood said the country will need to ""play it clever.""""We're in a very weak position at the moment, because of a lack of current innovation,"" he said. ""That's where we need to concentrate: Making sure [we're] building up capacity within Canada in this area, and not worrying so much about where we are in relation to China and the U.S.""""We're always going to be caught in the middle, so we've just got to build up our own.""For his part, Dwayne Winseck, director of the Canadian Media Concentration Research project and a professor at Carleton University's school of journalism and communication, says communications technology is often seen as a political lever.""They're basically seen as a kind of a weapon of politics, a spearhead of national power for projecting the interests and influence and power of major global superpowers into the international sphere,"" he said. ""So it becomes seen as a major resource through which powerful countries exert their influence and their interests on an international plane.""",0.0,0.4308830815648996
535,T. Rex got huge via major teenage growth spurt: study | CBC News,"A close look at the bones of huge meat-eating dinosaurs, including Sue the T. Rex, reveals that some went through a major growth spurt, while others took decades longer to reach their gigantic adult size.",2020-11-26T12:43:26.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/t-rex-growth-spurt-1.5817064,"Large meat-eating dinosaurs attained their great size through very different growth strategies, with some taking a slow and steady path and others experiencing an adolescent growth spurt, according to scientists who analyzed slices of fossilized bones.The researchers examined the annual growth rings — akin to those in tree trunks — in bones from 11 species of theropods, a broad group spanning all the big carnivorous dinosaurs including Tyrannosaurus rex and even birds. The study provides insight into the lives of some of the most fearsome predators ever to walk the Earth.The team looked at samples from museums in the United States, Canada, China and Argentina and even received clearance to cut into bones from one of the world's most famous T. Rex fossils, known as Sue and housed at the Field Museum in Chicago, using a diamond-tipped saw and drill.Sue's leg bones — a huge femur and fibula — helped illustrate that T. Rex and its relatives — known as tyrannosaurs — experienced a period of extreme growth during adolescence and reached full adult size by around age 20. Sue, measuring about 13 metres, lived around 33 years.Sue inhabited South Dakota about a million years before dinosaurs and many other species were wiped out by an asteroid impact 66 million years ago.Other groups of large theropods tended to have more steady rates of growth over a longer period of time. That growth strategy was detected in lineages that arose worldwide earlier in the dinosaur era and later were concentrated in the southern continents.Examples included Allosaurus and Acrocanthosaurus from North America, Cryolophosaurus from Antarctica and a recently discovered as-yet-unnamed species from Argentina that rivaled T. Rex in size. The Argentine dinosaur, from a group called carcharodontosaurs, did not reach its full adult size until its 40s and lived to about age 50.Congrats to lab alum ⁦<a href=""https://twitter.com/cullen_thomas?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">@cullen_thomas</a>⁩ &amp; ⁦<a href=""https://twitter.com/PeteMakovicky?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">@PeteMakovicky</a>⁩ on a cool new histo paper: T. rex had a teenage growth spurt — but not all dinosaurs did - CNN <a href=""https://t.co/n1eXXcTGbK"">https://t.co/n1eXXcTGbK</a>Big theropods share the same general body design, walking on two legs and boasting large skulls, strong jaws and menacing teeth.""Prior to our study, it was known that T.

540,Bell and Telus snub Huawei in move to build 5G network in Canada | CBC News,BCE Inc. and Telus Corp. will both use equipment from Scandinavian component makers Nokia and Ericsson to build out their next-generation 5G networks in Canada.,2020-06-02T13:27:04.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/bce-5g-ericsson-1.5594601,"BCE Inc. and Telus Corp. will both use equipment from Scandinavian component makers Nokia and Ericsson to build out their next-generation 5G networks in Canada.BCE, the parent company of Bell, said Tuesday morning it will partner with Swedish telecommunications equipment maker Ericsson to build out its next generation wireless network, known as 5G.That makes Ericsson just the second company that Bell will allow on its network, along with Finnish supplier Nokia, which Bell announced it would work with in February in its quarterly earnings release.Notably absent from that list of two suppliers is Huawei, the Chinese technology company that has become a lightning rod because of its close relationship with the Chinese government.Huawei has become something of a household name in Canada in recent years after its vice-president Meng Wangzhou was arrested at Vancouver's airport two years ago at the request of U.S. authorities.Many countries around the world say Huawei's close relationship with the Chinese government could expose cellular networks to spying.The United States and Australia have forbidden telecom firms in those countries from using Huawei components in their 5G networks.Canadian authorities are currently mulling whether to allow Huawei to participate in Canadian networks. Canada's Public Safety Minister Bill Blair said in a statement to CBC News that the government is ""taking all security factors into account, including those from our allies and our security agencies. We will ensure that our networks are kept secure and will take the appropriate decisions in due course.""Tuesday's news show the industry isn't waiting around for that decision either way.A few hours after Bell's move, Telus announced that it, too, would use Nokia and Ericsson for its 5G network. That's a departure from what the company said as recently as February, when Telus announced it was moving ahead with plans to roll out 5G using Huawei equipment.Huawei gear is in use on the lower-generation equipment at both telecom companies, but appears to be in the process of getting shut out of their 5G plans.Patrick Horan, a portfolio manager with Agilith Capital, said Bell's decision came as something of a surprise, given Bell's support for Huawei in the past and its current use of Huawei technology.""They were probably the most outspoken of the carriers in Canada"" in expressing their support for Huawei, he said.Horan says Huawei's prickly status with governments outside China was a factor in Bell's decision. ""[Bell] probably looked at their ability to garner any U.S. government telecom contracts with Huawei equipment in their [network]. My guess is that would be a negative for them,"" he said.""My guess is they decided to take that off the table.""Rogers has had a long-standing partnership with Ericsson on its existing wireless networks, and announced in 2018 that it would use Ericsson equipment for its 5G network, which it started to roll out in Toronto, Vancouver, Ottawa and Montreal earlier this year.",0.0,0.2442982456140351

The fact that it's still here and still surviving and thriving speaks volumes,"" Labelle said. ""I don't want to jinx it.""There have been hard times, she said, but nothing quite like this.""This is the hardest one we've ever endured. The smoking bylaw would be the closest second to it, for the severity of an overnight change."" To survive Ottawa's smoking crackdown, the venerable watering hole was severed in two, with half becoming a Quiznos franchise so the remaining bar could sustain itself.Unlike other establishments, The Laff hasn't stayed open for takeout or delivery during the pandemic.""The bar is the experience. You can't take that out,"" Labelle observed.Labelle hopes to reopen this summer and is considering applying for a larger patio so customers, when they return, can spread out and enjoy themselves like old times.""We just want to see our regulars again, our friends. These are people we see weekly, if not daily.""Jacques Marchand can trace his family's lighting and electrical business back three generations. ""My father's father's father,"" Marchand noted proudly. He's the fourth.Founded just 14 years after Thomas Edison unveiled the first practical incandescent light bulb, Marchand Electric has seen its share of history. Now, the company is trying to survive COVID-19.""We have experience with slowdowns before, and the trick … is to react quickly. You have to look at your costs and your staff. We had to lay some people off, unfortunately,"" Marchand said.A skeleton staff continues to work at the Algoma Road location. Retail sales have been limited to online purchases, but the store has been deemed an essential service because they supply to hospitals.There are already signs things are picking up: Marchand has recalled three of the six people he laid off. ""So we got the guys back working in the warehouse. They're also working on inventories and painting floors. Make-work projects. You have to retain these employees,"" he said.Marchand is also trying to convince clients to plan —  and order — ahead.""You've got a project coming up? Why don't we talk about it now instead of freaking out at the last minute, two months from now?""Sonia Fisher is a fourth-generation purveyor of quality men's clothing, a retail business established by her great-grandfather, Emerson Ralph Fisher, 115 years ago. It was ER Fisher who got the company through the Depression years. Part of company lore is that ""he did not lay off a single person,"" Sonia Fisher noted. Back then, the company reduced its hours, but stayed open.With COVID-19, things are different. Forced to close the Westboro store, Fisher has had to lay off 12 employees.""I didn't want to get the business in a situation where we were worse off five to six months down the road,"" she said.Most spring merchandise had already been delivered, but ""anything that hadn't arrived, we cancelled,"" Fisher said. They're already trimming back on their fall orders.""It'll take time for people to develop confidence again in the economy,"" Fisher said, ""so we are predicting a drop in sales over the next year.""Unlike other retailers, ER Fisher doesn't sell online. Personalized service has always been its brand. Now, Fisher admits it might be time to update that business model.""It's definitely something that we're going to be ramping up. It's a sore spot for me because I worry that I should have done it a little sooner.""McIntosh and Watts started out as a coffee and tea emporium, with deliveries made by horse and buggy.  ""We could have been Starbucks,"" jokes the company's fourth-generation president, Peter McIntosh, who's been selling china and tableware for 35 years.His grandfather, Grant McIntosh, was stationed in England during the Second World War and made connections at factories that made fine bone china, which he began exporting to Canada, far away from German bombs.""They adapted. They did everything they could to continue to function,"" McIntosh said. ""That's how you have to survive."" Fast-forward to 2020. The store on Industrial Avenue has been closed since mid-March, the company's online and wholesale business now operating out of McIntosh's home. ""We're adapting. We're working hard on the parts of our business we can continue to develop. We've just scaled everything back,"" McIntosh said.""Frisby the Vulcanizer"" was established by Don Frisby's great-uncle, George Frisby, upon his discharge after the First World War. The company survived the Great Depression, but Don Frisby said he never heard the stories about how they managed. ""They were ... men of very few words. All those guys did was work.""Deemed essential, the business has been allowed to stay open, but retail customers have been staying away and business is down 30 per cent.

We just want to be able to keep functioning as a business,"" Frisby said.Of his 100 employees, just one has had a layoff notice. ""Our on-the-road salesperson, whom nobody wants to see. Poor guy,"" Frisby said.So why not let a few more go until this thing blows over?""Right from my great-uncle and my father and through to me, we've always understood ... that our customers and the people who look after our customers are the most important aspect of the business,"" Frisby said.",0.0,0.38324463118580765

More than two million of those cases are in the United States. There have been nearly 435,000 deaths from COVID-19 around the world, with about 116,000 of them in the U.S.In Europe, Greek airports allowed more international flights as the country sought to salvage its summer season, German tourists flocking to neighbouring Denmark caused an eight-kilometre queue, and Italians popped into France to buy lottery scratch cards.But the continued closure of most of Spain, a patchwork of quarantine rules and remote-working by many who once commuted across borders, means it will not be a return to unfettered travel for 420 million Europeans.Spain is initially allowing in 10,000 holidaymakers from Germany as the Madrid government works out how to handle mass tourism before opening up more fully in the coming weeks.Hundreds of German sun-seekers, the first tourists to visit Spain since borders were closed in March, arrived in Mallorca on Monday on a flight from Düsseldorf.""Holidaymakers can be happy that the beaches in Palma have never been so empty,"" said Aage Duenhaupt, a spokesperson for travel company TUI. ""But there won't be parties in the same way this year.""In Greece, passengers arriving from airports deemed high-risk will be tested and quarantined for up to 14 days, depending on the result. Restrictions remain for passengers from Britain and Turkey. Arrivals from other airports will be randomly tested.WATCH | What it looks like boarding a plane during COVID-19:Spain will allow no foreign tourists until June 21, with exceptions for some islands.Elsewhere, the right to travel will depend on where you live and where you are going. The Czech Republic has a traffic-light system, barring tourists from ""orange"" or ""red"" countries, such as Portugal and Sweden.Denmark will accept tourists from Iceland, Germany and Norway, but not Sweden, if they book at least six nights' accommodation.Britain's two-week quarantine for visitors means Britons will face the same confinement in France.Before the crisis, about 3.5 million people crossed an internal EU border every day, according to a 2019 European Parliament report, some 1.7 million of them commuters.Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced Monday that the federal government will extend the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB), with details to follow in the days ahead.The CERB is due to run out soon for people who have been on the benefit since it was first launched in April, at the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic.People can only claim the benefit for 16 weeks — four eligibility periods — and the end of the program's fourth eligibility period is early July.""We're working on a solution to extend the benefit for people who can't return to work yet,"" Trudeau said. ""We'll have more details this week, but for today, I want you to know that we'll continue to be there for you and your family.""WATCH | Epidemiologist says COVID-19 toll may be higher than official totals:CanadaAs of 3:45 p.m. ET on Monday, there were 99,091 confirmed and presumptive coronavirus cases in Canada, with 61,000 cases considered recovered or resolved. A CBC News tally of deaths based on provincial data, regional health information and CBC's reporting stood at 8,220.India's Health Ministry reported a jump of more than 11,000 new infections nationwide for a third consecutive day on Monday. The country's home minister offered 500 train carriages for use as makeshift coronavirus hospital wards as New Delhi struggles to contain a spike in cases.The Indian capital has about 9,000 beds dedicated to COVID-19 patients in public and private hospitals, but a state government panel of experts has said it will need at least 15,000 beds by the end of June.Long lines stretched along streets across England as shops selling items considered non-essential during the pandemic, such as sneakers and toys, welcomed customers on Monday for the first time since the United Kingdom was put into lockdown in late March.Starved of the retail experience for the better part of three months, shoppers generally appeared to abide by the physical distancing requirement to stay two metres apart as they awaited their turn to enter the stores.Monday's reopening of shops, from department stores to booksellers and electronics retailers, only applies to England. Scotland and Wales are taking a more tentative approach to the easing of the coronavirus restrictions. Northern Ireland's stores reopened last week. England also saw zoos, safari parks and drive-in cinemas reopen on Monday.Russian President Vladimir Putin blamed America's lack of centralized authority for its inability to stem the spread of the virus, while saying Russia was ""working quite steadily and getting out of this situation … with minimal losses.""In the U.S., ""this is not happening,"" Putin said, noting the central and regional governments work more closely in Russia.Russia, nevertheless, has recorded more than half a million infections and nearly 7,000 virus deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins count.Egypt's Health Ministry has confirmed 1,691 new cases of the coronavirus, including 97 deaths, the country's highest toll for one day.There have officially been 46,289 COVID-19 cases and 1,672 deaths recorded since the virus first emerged in Egypt in February. Egypt has the highest death rate in the Arab world and the third highest in the Middle East after Iran and Turkey. The government has resisted a full lockdown in an effort to keep the economy functioning. Even as caseloads multiply in the Arab world's most populous country, authorities have shortened the nightly curfew and plan to reopen airports for tourism to less hard-hit destinations next month.South Korea is also among the countries seeking to prevent a resurgence of the outbreak, reporting 37 new cases of COVID-19 on Monday. The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said 25 of the cases came from the Seoul area, where health authorities are scrambling to trace infections linked to entertainment and leisure activities, church gatherings, warehouse workers and door-to-door sellers.In France, restaurants in the Paris region will be allowed to join those in the rest of the country in opening indoor seating starting Monday. From June 22, all nursery schools, primary schools and junior high schools will be open and mandatory for all students. Authorities in Pakistan said they will reimpose strict lockdowns in selected areas of several cities from Monday night, a day after the federal government said COVID-19 cases could multiply eightfold by the end of July and hit 1.2 million.""A total of 20 cities across Pakistan have been identified as having likely increase in ratio/speed of infection, which needs restrictive measures for containment,"" said a statement Monday by the body that co-ordinates the national response to the virus.Pakistan has reported 144,477 cases of the respiratory illness and 2,729 deaths so far.In Africa, where the virus continues to spread, Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta's office says four people who work at the presidential residence have tested positive for COVID-19, though the president and his family do not appear to be affected.Ghana's Health Minister Kwaku Agyemang-Manu has contracted COVID-19 and is undergoing treatment at a hospital.",0.0,0.39452563013310676

There's still time to do what's necessary to reduce carbon emissions so that we don't cross that threshold into catastrophic climate change.""On Wednesday, the United States officially withdrew from the Paris Agreement, a pact between 197 countries to fight climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to global warming. Countries are aiming to keep global temperature increases below 1.5 C this century.U.S. President Donald Trump announced plans to withdraw from the pact back in 2017, arguing it would undermine the country's economy, but he was unable to do so until now because of requirements under the agreement.Mann told The Current's Matt Galloway that the United States and other countries will have to go ""well beyond"" the Paris deal to achieve the emissions reductions the world needs.And Jessica Green agrees.""The Paris Agreement is not going to save us,"" said the University of Toronto political science professor, who specializes in international climate policy.However, if Democratic candidate Joe Biden wins the presidency, she believes some of his climate plans could be a step in the right direction.If elected, Biden has promised to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, and on Wednesday he tweeted that he would rejoin the Paris Agreement within 77 days.Today, the Trump Administration officially left the Paris Climate Agreement. And in exactly 77 days, a Biden Administration will rejoin it. <a href=""https://t.co/L8UJimS6v2"">https://t.co/L8UJimS6v2</a>""It is in some ways important for the U.S. to send that signal, and especially to repair so much of the damage that the Trump administration has done,"" said Green. ""But at the same time, the design of the Paris Agreement is such that success doesn't necessarily depend on the U.S. ""Every country gets to decide what it is going to do.""Unfortunately, said Mann, the U.S.'s withdrawal has in part, given some countries the green light to backstep on their own commitments under the Paris deal.""China, for example, which had been actually decommissioning coal-fired power plants and was going well beyond its Paris commitments, sort of started to ease off,"" he said. ""That's why leadership here in the United States is so important.""Elan Strait, director of U.S. climate campaigns with the World Wildlife Fund, said that by withdrawing from the Paris Agreement, the U.S. also signalled that it doesn't care about holding other countries like China accountable for their environmental regulations""Also, there's a multi-trillion-dollar market that is being created right now for clean energy, and the U.S. is in danger of being completely left behind,"" Strait added.Strait said the U.S. needs to make climate change a ""complete prioritization"" throughout its foreign policy portfolio if it wants to make inroads.While he doesn't think there is currently the political will to take an aggressive approach on the issue, that could change if the U.S. were to re-enter the Paris Agreement, he said.That aggressive approach is exactly what Green said is needed.Every year, the UN releases a report that highlights the gap between current global temperature increases and the Paris Agreement pledge to keep global warming to less than 1.5 degrees.""And every year that gap gets larger,"" said Green.""This is an existential crisis, and an existential crisis requires existential politics.""Written by Kirsten Fenn, with files from CBC News.

""But with the Executive Order threatening to bring a ban on our U.S. operations ... we simply have no choice.""The White House referred a request for comment to the U.S. Department of Justice, which declined to comment.Amid growing distrust between Washington and Beijing, Trump has for weeks complained that TikTok, owned by Chinese company ByteDance Ltd, was a national security threat and might share information about users with the Chinese government.His Aug. 6 executive order called for banning transactions with the app after 45 days.Trump issued a separate executive order on Aug. 14 giving ByteDance 90 days to divest TikTok's U.S. operations and any data.Reuters reported mid-August that TikTok was preparing to mount a legal challenge as early as Monday to Trump's Aug. 6 order.ByteDance had acquired Shanghai-based video app Musical.ly in a $1 billion transaction in 2017, and relaunched it as TikTok the following year.In its blog post, TikTok said the Trump administration violated its constitutional right to due process by banning the company without notice.It accused Trump of misusing the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which lets the president regulate international commerce during a national emergency.Trump had in May 2019 invoked that law to stop alleged efforts by foreign telecommunications companies to conduct economic and industrial espionage against the United States.The lawsuit filed in Los Angeles federal court names Trump, the U.S. Department of Commerce and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross as defendants.But TikTok said the Aug. 6 executive order was not supported by the emergency Trump declared a year earlier, and that the company did not provide the types of technology and services contemplated at that time.It also said the executive order was not rooted in genuine national security concerns, adding: ""We believe the Administration's decisions were heavily politicized, and industry experts have said the same.""ByteDance has been in talks to sell TikTok's North American, Australian and New Zealand operations to companies including Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Oracle Corp (ORCL.N).Those assets could be worth $25 billion to $30 billion, people familiar with the matter have said.Before buying TikTok, ByteDance had not sought advance approval from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which reviews acquisitions for potential national security risks.CFIUS later opened an investigation and on July 30 found national security risks associated with the purchase.But it ""repeatedly refused"" to engage with ByteDance's proposals to address concerns, including a nonbinding letter of intent to sell to Microsoft presented earlier July 30, according to the lawsuit.",0.0850796493916648,0.3869661640398073

The Calgary Catholic School District, for example, created a whole new virtual elementary school named Saint Isidore, after the seventh-century scholar and bishop whom the late Pope John Paul II dubbed ""the patron saint of the internet.""Days ahead of an Aug. 21 deadline, close to 3,000 of the district's 60,000 students had already registered for the school, said district chief superintendent Bryan Szumlas. In a preliminary survey by the Toronto District School Board, approximately 60,000 of its 250,000 students chose remote learning, said Ryan Bird, TDSB manager of corporate and social media relations. In response, Canada's largest school board is centralizing its virtual operation, which will have a dedicated superintendent, principals, vice-principals and teachers teaching the Ontario curriculum remotely.""There is live online learning throughout the day, every day, trying to, as best we can, to mimic that in-person learning experience,"" Bird said.Though Regina Public Schools hasn't finalized numbers, it is also setting up a centralized virtual school, and in its case, the division will unite dedicated teachers under one roof as well.Working from one location will help ensure ""robust"" internet connectivity on the teachers' side while staff will ""also benefit from working together with their colleagues, so they can share information,"" said Terry Lazarou, supervisor of communications for Regina Public Schools. ""They could share tips and tricks and basically become better at doing this as the year proceeds.""Students won't be allowed to bounce between online and in-class learning. School divisions, districts and boards are generally specifying that families who register for the remote option can change to in-person only at set times, for instance, at the end of a reporting term.Unlike the ad-hoc solutions put in place when the pandemic hit, school boards say they're intentionally creating virtual schools with separate, dedicated staff adhering to the same curriculum as their in-class peers. ""[The last school year] was essentially making do under tremendously difficult circumstances,"" said Bird. ""This is a fully online virtual school.""Lazarou, of Regina Public Schools, echoed that sentiment. ""It's going to involve actual teachers who have a work day. It's going to take place during the school day,"" he said. ""This is going to be real-time during school hours ... [so that] the students participate in the learning.""Looking to the fall, e-learning specialist Marina Milner-Bolotin foresees several challenges, beginning with technological concerns for both students and teachers — everything from familiarity with online tools to reliable internet connections and access to devices.Educators will need to not only learn how to teach students online but also how to engage and assess them online, and evaluate the availability of at-home support.    ""Online education requires parental involvement at a very different level than face-to-face,"" said Milner-Bolotin, a University of British Columbia professor who specializes in STEM education and technology in teaching.Education ministries and school districts should ensure students have the devices and web access they need and lean on the existing e-learning expertise at universities and in other sectors to help K-12 teachers this fall, she said.Also key will be establishing a more direct partnership with caregivers at home.In many provinces, ""the trust between the teachers and the government, the teachers and the parents, is broken,"" Milner-Bolotin said.""Together, we can solve the problem, because it doesn't make sense that we're facing such a huge challenge — how to educate the next generation of students — and each one of us is trying to solve it alone.""Families will have an important role to play in supporting the youngest remote learners or those not used to an online environment, said Terry Lazarou of Regina Public Schools.""We're asking families and parents to ensure that they have good learning spaces in their homes: good, quiet spaces, a good surface to learn on, to work on; that parents or other caregivers in the house can provide support during the day while school is going on,"" he said. Milner-Bolotin agreed, saying that e-learning can be a challenge when adults are not present to support it.The Vancouver-based professor says teachers must also adapt to the medium since ""talking-head mode"" won't translate online.Whether it's online or face-to-face, the younger the student, the shorter the attention span, she said. For students of any age, ""it's very difficult to sit passively in front of a computer and listen to a lecture non-stop,"" she said.""That's the issue with remote teaching: a lot of people believe that they will take teaching practices they had in the classroom, dump it all online — record their lessons — and it will be the same,"" Milner-Bolotin said. ""Good teachers know how much engagement matters. The teachers have to think of how to do it so that the kids can get involved and also produce something.""Inconsistency in direct communication between teachers and students this spring sparked talk about the need for ""live, synchronous delivery."" In general, e-learning can be synchronous or asynchronous: everyone logs in at the same time or lessons are accessed on demand.When teaching a synchronous math class, for instance, the expectation is that all students are there at the same time as the teacher. ""We're all in one virtual classroom,"" said Milner-Bolotin.One benefit is that students can ask teachers questions right away. But there can be challenges, she said. What if someone's internet goes out; or students get pulled away from the computer for whatever reason; or if a large class experiences bandwidth issues because everyone is using video?Asynchronous delivery, on the other hand, allows students to access lessons at a time suited to them. This can be helpful, for instance, in a household juggling devices between siblings or between parents and kids. Milner-Bolotin prefers a blend of the two delivery methods. For instance, a teacher might still record a live lesson and make it available for students to review later if needed.Milner-Bolotin also advocates using discussion boards and other virtual spaces ""where people can meet with the teachers or students can meet amongst themselves, and then they can ask each other questions.""Not all teachers have prior expertise in online learning. During the months of school closures, those teachers who did have e-learning experience supported their colleagues but had to balance that with their own classes, according to Sarah Barrett, an associate professor in the faculty of education at York University in Toronto. Barrett is currently studying the experiences of Ontario teachers during the shift to online instruction early in the pandemic. After surveying more than 760 K-12 educators and interviewing more than four dozen, she's learned teachers aren't as concerned about training on specific platforms, for example. Rather, they want e-learning coaches and facilitators to be available to support them.""They need those teachers that do have the knowledge, that are certified and have knowledge of e-learning, understanding of subject-specific requirements and age-group requirements,"" Barrett said.Teachers would prefer that those experts be dedicated to coaching them and providing assistance specific to their classes and context.The principles behind e-learning aren't drastically different from in-class learning, Barrett said: creating a community, developing relationships and establishing structures and routines so that students can focus on content and collaborating.""That's true in-person or online,"" she said.",0.0,0.38705907817672514

591,"Barring Taiwan from WHO is a serious health concern, Canada and allies say | CBC News","Canada, the United States and six major allies have told the World Health Organization that its ongoing exclusion of Taiwan has created a serious public health concern during the COVID-19 crisis.",2020-05-17T18:11:45.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/barring-taiwan-from-who-is-a-serious-health-concern-canada-u-s-and-allies-say-1.5573865,"Canada, the United States and six major allies have told the World Health Organization (WHO) that its ongoing exclusion of Taiwan has created a serious public health concern during the COVID-19 crisis.That sharp message was delivered in a letter, a draft of which has been viewed by The Canadian Press, that tells WHO director general Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreysus to allow Taiwan to be given observer status at a major meeting of the organization on Monday.Geneva-based diplomats from Canada, Australia, France, Germany, New Zealand, Britain, Japan and the U.S. issued the demand orally in a May 7 meeting with two other senior WHO officials, with the envoys from Washington and Tokyo taking the lead.Canadian health officials also took part Friday in a videoconference that was hosted by Taiwan's Ministry of Health and Welfare, said a senior government official, who was not authorized to speak publicly about the issue due to its sensitivity.Support for Taiwan is controversial because China vigorously opposes granting any such access. It views Taiwan as a breakaway province and wants the world to heed its ""one-China policy.""While Canada does not recognize Taiwan's sovereignty, it does maintain trade and cultural relations, and Foreign Affairs Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne has said the island's presence as a non-state observer at this week's meetings would help the pandemic fight.The draft of the letter delivers a sharp explanation of that point: it says Taiwan's early success at controlling the pandemic qualifies it for a seat at the World Health Assembly meetings, and the letter essentially tells the agency to stop playing politics.""Taiwan's isolation from the global health community not only presents a serious public health concern, but also is an obstacle that hampers ongoing and future efforts,"" letter states.WATCH | Trudeau questioned on China and Taiwan:Politics NewsThe letter also says the international community is ""harmed"" when important health information is not permitted to ""flow freely and easily.""The letter calls Taiwan a capable and responsible player in the world's health community, and says it has scientific and technical expertise ""that could help save lives around the world.""The letter says it was ""regrettable"" that the WHO broke with its guiding principles by excluding Taiwan from the assembly. It defines the WHO's guiding principle as ensuring that ""all people"" have a right to the highest health standards, regardless of political belief, race, religion or economic or social conditions.Prime Minister Justin Trudeau spoke Friday with his British counterpart Boris Johnson and they discussed their work together in ""various international organizations, and committed to continuing to work together on shared priorities such as combating climate change and promoting democratic values,"" according to the Prime Minister's Office.The WHO has faced accusations from U.S. President Donald Trump and Canada's Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer that it is too cozy with China, and that the People's Republic was not forthcoming to the international health agency as the pandemic was breaking out in Wuhan earlier this year.The move is politically sensitive for Canada because it is mired in a dispute with China over what Canada calls the ""arbitrary"" imprisonment of Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor.Despite co-operation on health and trade since the pandemic's outbreak, relations between Canada and China have been severely strained since the RCMP arrested Chinese high-tech scion Meng Wanzhou on an American extradition warrant in December 2018.China arrested Kovrig and Spavor nine days later in what is widely viewed as retaliation and has levelled accusations that the former diplomat and the entrepreneur were engaged in actions undermining China's national security. Canada has marshalled a broad coalition of international support calling for their release and that has angered Chinese leaders.The message in the letter to the WHO is echoed in a new report released this past week by the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, an agency of Congress that advises on the national security implications of trade with China. It says Taiwan's continued exclusion from the WHO is ""jeopardizing global health.""The report noted the WHO ignored Taiwan's early requests for information about the pandemic, which it said created ""critical delays"" in how other countries responded.""The spread of the virus to 185 countries — with more than four million confirmed cases and 286,000 deaths worldwide as of May 12 — demonstrates the deadly ramifications of China's influence over the WHO for the international community's pandemic preparedness,"" says the U.S. report.""Had the WHO allowed Taiwan's health experts to share information and best practices in early January, governments around the world could have had more complete information on which to base their public health policies.""As of Tuesday, Taiwan had 440 confirmed cases of COVID-19, a ""stunningly low"" number in a population of 23.6 million, the report said.Adam Austen, a spokesperson for Champagne, reiterated Canada's support for ""Taiwan's meaningful participation in international multilateral fora where its presence provides important contributions to the public good.""Canada has ""clearly communicated"" to the WHO that Taiwan should be allowed to take part in the upcoming World Health Assembly meetings, said Austin.""We continue to encourage the WHO to engage with experts from Taiwan and to support Taiwan's meaningful inclusion in global discussions on health.""The spokesperson for China's foreign ministry once again registered Beijing's strong objections on Friday to including Taiwan at the WHO, calling it an attempt to ""seek independence under the pretext of the pandemic with the help of some Western countries.""Spokesman Zhao Lijian said the ""few countries"" that are backing Taiwan ""are only aiming to politicize the health issue to seek selfish political gains,"" according to a translation of his remarks on his ministry's website. He said that would only result in ""hijacking"" the organization and ""undermining global anti-pandemic co-operation.""",0.03977272727272727,0.21090909090909093

Investigators believe the shooting was targeted, but so far see no evidence that it's connected to ongoing gang conflicts in the Lower Mainland.Both Zhu and Jin were key figures in the RCMP's failed E-Pirate investigation into money laundering that was launched in 2015.Documents related to E-Pirate alleged that Zhu ran an underground bank that laundered more than $200 million per year.All charges against Zhu, who denied all wrongdoing, were eventually stayed in November 2018.Federal prosecutors have refused to provide the reason why money-laundering charges against Silver International Ltd. and its two directors — Zhu and Caixuan Qin — were stayed in late 2018.Jin was also the subject of subsequent court filings by the B.C. government that claimed he was a high-end loan shark.Jin, who was banned from casinos by the B.C. Lottery Corp., delivered up to $2 million in cash to clients at coffee shops and other spots in Richmond, according to allegations in BCLC and Gaming Policy Enforcement Branch documents.In a forfeiture case filed in February 2020, the government asked that a $25,000 bank draft found in Jin's Mercedes and made out to a casino be forfeited as a proceed of crime.Zhu's alleged underground bank and the methods of moving money came up at the Cullen Commission, which was established in May 2019 to examine and make recommendations on how to combat money laundering in B.C.An expert panel set up by the B.C. government estimated more than $7 billion in dirty money was laundered in the province in 2018.During hearings at the Cullen Commission, criminologist Stephen Schneider described the ""Vancouver model"" used to launder illegal funds from China and revenue from drug trafficking.  The model, which has since been studied worldwide, involves moving large amounts of funds from China through informal value transfer systems to avoid China's limits on money leaving the country. Once in Canada, those funds are mixed with cash from the drug trade, and the cash is then laundered through B.C. casinos and private mortgages.Schneider said Silver International Ltd. was at the centre of this operation.""You wouldn't have the Vancouver model without Silver International and their directors,"" Schneider said.IHIT is asking anyone with information on the shooting to call its information line at 1-877-551-4448, or email ihitinfo@rcmp-grc.gc.ca. Those who want to remain anonymous can contact Crime Stoppers at 1-800-222-8477.Investigators are also asking any drivers with dashcam video from the area of Garden City Road between Capstan Way and Cambie Road between 6:30 p.m. and 8:30 p.m. PT on Friday to contact them. There have been nine shootings in the Lower Mainland since Monday.",0.0,0.3284761904761905

So yeah, it's been one of the highlights of the economy.""The mining industry as a whole contributed $235 million in tax revenue to the province in the 2018-19 fiscal year, while also accounting for about $1.5 billion of the province's nominal gross domestic product for the 2018 calendar year.There could be opportunities for the province to grow those numbers, as governments across the globe start implementing measures to get back to work.China presents a particularly intriguing potential, as the country's National People's Congress will begin its annual session Friday.The country responded to the global financial crisis of 2008 with a $563-billion stimulus package to stave off recession, but has been quiet so far as countries like the United States pledge trillions to COVID-19 measures.Amid the pandemic, China saw its economy in decline for the first time since it began reporting quarterly data in 1992. It remains unclear whether President Xi Jinping will push the country forward like in 2008, or take a more conservative approach.According to Tony Fang, an economics professor at Memorial University and past president of the Chinese Economists Society, stimulus measures would be north of $1 trillion. ""That's a lot of money on investments, mostly actually on new infrastructure projects to prop up economic growth,"" Fang told CBC recently.""Intercity highways, 5G, new technology sources and so on and so forth, which actually the Newfoundland and Labrador mining industry could potentially benefit [from].""Newfoundland and Labrador has a long history of trade with China, mostly in exporting seafood and iron ore.Fang said a Chinese stimulus plan would require plenty of the rich resource, and the Canadian province could find itself in an advantageous position because it has never been a thorn in China's side.The same cannot be said about the two largest exporters of iron ore to China.""Australia and Brazil both have engaged in quite aggressive criticisms against China's handling of the virus containment policies, especially early on,"" Fang said.Escalating tension could lead to changes in trade, which could put a heavier reliance on iron ore from Labrador.Clayton Walker, CEO of the Iron Ore Company of Canada, will be one of the people paying attention to what the nation does in the coming weeks.""China is one of the markets we sell to, so we definitely keep an eye on what China is or isn't doing,"" he told CBC this month.""China is opening back up and we're encouraged. Hopefully, those dollars they're putting into stimulus will continue coming our way.""IOC has managed to keep production going in Labrador West throughout the pandemic by implementing a number of measures to enhance worker safety.The company has staggered work schedules, promoted physical distancing, and done daily temperature checks on employees in order to keep work flowing.""The iron ore price has been relatively steady throughout this process, so we've been quite lucky in that regard,"" Walker said.As the rest of the western world watched the outbreak in Wuhan, China, and saw it as a foreign problem, Walker was worried about how it would affect IOC's business in Labrador and Quebec.""We saw this start to unfold as it kind of travelled around the world and the impacts it had as it went from one market to the next. It gave us some insight into what was going on and also how to prepare ourselves for what might be coming,"" he said.The way the virus spread was bad for business, but not as crushing as it could have been.""As one market opens, another one closes,"" Walker said.""Luckily, not everyone's gone down at the same time and not everyone is going up at the same time, which takes some of that massive volatility out, but it does make for some localized pain, as each market goes through that.""Walker said the company found itself in a position to help out, as most of the province's industries were thrown into disarray.Rio Tinto — the global mining giant and majority owner of IOC — committed $10 million to COVID-19 relief in Canada. The Labrador West region saw about $200,000 of that money, including $30,000 to the local food bank, $20,000 to the hospital, and other donations to a local shelter for women fleeing domestic violence, an Indigenous community centre, and a program to fly cancer patients to St. John's for treatment.""We're trying to make sure we've got real dollars showing up in the local community and we'll continue to invest and make sure our communities can make it through this,"" Walker said.This coverage is part of Changing Course, a series of stories from CBC Newfoundland and Labrador that's taking a closer look at how the COVID-19 pandemic is affecting local industries and businesses, and how they're adapting during these uncertain times to stay afloat.Read more from CBC Newfoundland and Labrador",0.10773809523809523,0.36094720496894406

At the time, the United States had recently escalated the trade war with China, which is still in effect.""If I think it's good for what will be certainly the largest trade deal ever made — which is a very important thing — what's good for national security, I would certainly intervene if I thought it was necessary,"" Trump replied.Meng's lawyers say the actions of the president and U.S. Attorney General William Barr in the cases of both Trump's former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn and his political advisor Roger Stone make clear that his words are not just idle talk.Flynn — who Trump called ""a good guy"" — pleaded guilty twice to lying to the Federal Bureau of Investigation about conversations with Russia's ambassador, yet the case against him was dismissed after the U.S. Justice Department intervened.In February, Trump demanded a new trial for Stone, calling himself ""the chief law enforcement officer of the country."" More recently, he acted to commute Stone's three year prison sentence for witness tampering and lying to Congress.""The two examples show that the (U.S.) president not only thinks he can intervene in prosecutions, but that he will do so when it suits his political agenda,"" Meng's lawyers wrote.They also said that Trump has already said that ""there is MUCH more to come"" when it comes to interventions.The court documents also claim Trudeau contributed to the politicization of the case in statements he made to a French language TV show in December 2019 with regard to former diplomat Michael Kovrig and entrepreneur Michael Spavor.The two were detained in China within days of Meng's arrest and have since been accused of spying. Both men have been held in Chinese prisons for more than a year and a half.Trudeau claimed his government told the U.S. it ""should not sign a final and complete agreement with China that does not settle the question of Meng Wanzhou and the two Canadians.""""As a bargaining chip in a global trade war, (Meng faces) intimidation regarding the ramifications her own decisions may have on others,"" her lawyers claim.They say a reasonable person would believe that how Meng ""defends her extradition could alter the consequences faced by the two Canadians held in China.Her defence strategy could also impact Huawei in its future interests as a globally competitive company, as well as Canada's economy.""The legal arguments are all part of a series of attempts that the defence plans to make to have the case against Meng tossed for alleged abuse of process. The same newly filed batch of court documents include an argument that the U.S. failed to disclose material facts in its record of the case that show Meng's statements to banks had no impact on the financial decisions in question.If necessary, the defence team also plans to argue that Canadian and U.S. authorities conspired to violate Meng's Constitutional rights at the time of her arrest.To that end, her lawyers will be in federal court next week to argue for the release of Canadian Security Intelligence Service documents that they claim prove collusion with the FBI.CSIS has already released a number of heavily redacted documents suggesting that it was aware of Meng's arrest and in contact with the FBI and other agencies.Canada's attorney general claims the redacted information should be kept from public view because of national security concerns. Affidavits filed in the case suggest that the details could inflame tensions with China and alienate intelligence sources.But in federal court documents released Friday, Meng's lawyers claim the information could be crucial to her defence.""If there is additional information hidden under the redactions ... national security privilege should not be used to cover up the abuse,"" the lawyers state.""Additionally, national security privilege should not be used to protect government enforcement officials from being embarrassed.""Meng has been living under house arrest since her release on $10 million bail in the week after her initial arrest.She wears a monitoring bracelet as part of her release conditions and lives in one of two multi-million mansions she owns on Vancouver's west side.She has denied the allegations made against her. ",0.1004666048237477,0.370926097711812

Office of Immigration.""We're trying to pick up individuals through our labour streams that are already here working,"" Aiken said. ""A lot of these individuals have work permits that they're here working underneath, and now they're transitioning to try and apply for permanent residency.""Aiken said those workers are employed in the service industry, in health care, manufacturing and in trucking. He said they come from many countries, but predominantly India, the Philippines, Vietnam and China. In most cases he said their family members are already living here.Compared to the 626 candidates invited from June through August, the province issued a total of just 48 invitations from March through May, according to figures posted on the province's website.In the six months leading up to March, the province was averaging 141 invitations per month.Among the new immigrants the province is offering to sponsor are 77 potential immigrant investors who would be required to operate a business on P.E.I. Aiken said all of those applicants are currently living overseas, but that it would be months before their applications to enter the country are processed by the federal government.""So we may not actually see an applicant for upwards to 12 months who we would invite in the month of August,"" he said.While Canada has closed its borders to many international travellers, there are exceptions which allow provincial nominees to enter the country if they have a work permit and are able to self-isolate for 14 days.Aiken said since the start of the pandemic, approximately 75 people have arrived on P.E.I. from overseas to become permanent residents through the PNP, mostly essential workers employed in health care or the trucking industry.P.E.I.'s Chief Public Health Officer Dr. Heather Morrison has repeatedly warned the primary risk of introducing COVID-19 to the Island comes from those entering from outside the Atlantic bubble. Government says all 57 cases recorded on the Island so far have been travel-related. As of Tuesday, government reported only one active case of the disease in the province.But Morrison has also often referred to the requirement that those coming to P.E.I. from outside the Atlantic bubble self-isolate for 14 days, crediting that requirement for the lack of community spread of COVID-19 in the province.When asked about the potential risks of resuming immigration programs during the pandemic, Morrison said those decisions ""are almost made at a federal level.… It's really, from my perspective, trying to figure out once those decisions are made, how we can do it safely.""The P.E.I. government administers its own provincial nominee program, under the oversight and within parameters approved by the federal government.""As we ease back and learn to live with COVID and those [immigration] streams begin to open up a little bit more broadly in the future, the big question would be just around making sure that we have that self-isolation in place,"" said Premier Dennis King.""As a province we need immigration. We depend on growing our population through many streams, including immigration,"" King said. ""And even though we're in a worldwide health pandemic, that has to remain a focus for the long term, and it will.""",0.0873015873015873,0.46512345679012346

The evacuees went into a two-week quarantine. Indonesia also sent a plane.The virus' rapid spread in two months prompted the World Health Organization on Thursday to declare it a global emergency.That declaration ""flipped the switch"" from a cautious attitude to recommending governments prepare for the possibility the virus might spread, said the WHO representative in Beijing, Gauden Galea. Most cases reported so far have been people who visited China or their family members.The agency acted out of concern for poorer countries that might not be equipped to respond, said Galea. Such a declaration calls for a coordinated international response and can bring more money and resources.WHO said it was especially concerned that some cases abroad involved human-to-human transmission.""Countries need to get ready for possible importation in order to identify cases as early as possible and in order to be ready for a domestic outbreak control, if that happens,"" Galea told The Associated Press.Watch: Construction of two coronavirus hospitals in China nears completionCBC NewsThe United States declared a public health emergency on Friday and President Donald Trump signed an order barring entry to foreign nationals who visited China within the last 14 days, which scientists say is the virus' longest incubation period. The restrictions don't apply to immediate family of American citizens and permanent residents.China criticized the U.S. controls and ""unfriendly comments"" alleging that Beijing was failing to co-operate.""Just as the WHO recommended against travel restrictions, the U.S. rushed to go in the opposite way. Certainly not a gesture of goodwill,"" said foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying.Australia, Germany, Japan, South Korea, the United Arab Emirates, the United States and Vietnam all reported new cases Saturday. Spain confirmed its first case — a German man who had close contact with an infected person in Germany and then traveled to the Canary Islands with friends. Four friends who were hospitalized with him have not shown symptoms.Both the new virus and SARS are from the coronavirus family, which also includes those that cause the common cold.The death rate in China is falling, but the number of confirmed cases will keep growing because thousands of specimens from suspected cases have yet to be tested, WHO's Galea said.""The case fatality ratio is settling out at a much lower level than we were reporting three, now four, weeks ago,"" he said.Although scientists expect to see limited transmission of the virus between people with family or other close contacts, they are concerned about cases of infection spreading to people who might have less exposure.Canada has four confirmed cases of cornavirus. The Public Health Agency of Canada, which is working alongside provinces and territories to monitor the novel coronavirus, says the risk to Canadians is low. Watch: What we actually know about the coronavirusCBC News",0.05099326599326598,0.3817676767676767

642,Economic bounce-back depends on quick resolution of epidemic: Don Pittis | CBC News,"A global recession would likely kill more people than the coronavirus, a Canadian expert says.",2020-02-18T09:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/covid-19-coronavirus-china-canada-1.5464012,"For people who have lost loved ones to COVID-19, the disease that has swept parts of China and may have gained a foothold elsewhere, the global economic impact is likely the least of their concerns.But with the world economy already hovering near what the International Monetary Fund considers to be recessionary levels, a significant global slowdown would be about more than money. And one of the biggest considerations is whether the economic impact of the disease will be ephemeral or lasting.Widely described as the biggest current threat to global growth, the coronavirus, and perhaps more important the things governments are doing to prevent it from spreading, could yet push the world below the recession line.That is one of the reasons why experts like Richard Schabas, Ontario's former chief medical officer, worry that draconian measures that stoke fear in the population do more harm than good.""Recessions kill people, in fact will probably kill more people than this virus does,"" he told CBC News host Michael Serapio last week. Here in the wealth and safety of Canada it may be hard to fathom, but in a globally integrated economy a few dollars less a month can mean life or death to people struggling for food and medicine. That's easier to comprehend when you think that the World Health Organization estimates about six million children a year die preventable deaths, usually associated with poverty.WATCH: Ontario's ex-chief medical officer says a recession could kill more people than the coronavirus:World""Our world has become so interconnected,"" says Jia Wang, deputy director of the University of Alberta's China Institute.Wang suggests that the next few weeks will be critical, showing whether the epidemic, with its global economic impact, is moderating or getting worse. Early reports that the spread of the disease was slowing were cast into doubt last week when China reported 5,000 new cases and global deaths leapt past 1,500.Fear and government restrictions mean people in China have been staying home, slashing the business of retailers and restaurants. Some reports say property sales are down by more than 80 per cent, affecting a business that represents about one-quarter of China's gross domestic product.Wang says that while the country's giant companies are big enough to outlast the crisis, especially with government help, a significant and dynamic part of China's economy is based on much smaller businesses that could disappear, leading to lingering economic effects.""If the quarantines and shutdowns of many cities around China continue for a few more months or even just one month, many of the smaller companies may not survive,"" she said.Wang says there are also worries that the coronavirus and its economic effect will spread outside China. Last Friday, Singapore's president, Lee Hsien Loong. warned the disease could push that country into recession.Putting a figure on the global impact is not easy, and estimates of the damage vary widely. Oxford Economics says global growth will fall to 2.3 per cent in 2020, the lowest level in more than 10 years and below the IMF's global recession level.Last week Canada's Parliamentary Budget Office suggested the epidemic would eat into Canada's growth rate in the first three months of the year chopping off 0.3 percentage points.That worries Brian Kingston from the Business Council of Canada, especially when no one knows when the crisis will end.""And remember that China is our second most important export destination,"" Kingston told Piya Chattopadhyay on CBC Radio's Metro Morning.BMO economist Jennifer Lee says the bank has again downgraded the Chinese economy due to fading optimism that the country can get its factories geared up as soon as it had hoped. ""We've shaved Q1 and Q2 growth,"" said Lee, ""given how long the shutdowns are lasting.""Lee says the bank still expects China to rebound from the economic malaise, though BMO now puts Chinese full-year growth for 2020 at 5.3 per cent. That is far below the previous consensus that China would grow this year at between six and 6.5 per cent.But Lee says it is common for economies to rebound even after the sharpest decline. For example, a month of storms may mean Canadians stay home from the shops, but the money they didn't spend in one month they can spend in the next, causing what looks like a boom.That depends on how much damage is done and whether it can heal. And Lee says the duration of any interruption in business makes all the difference. She says that after the SARS outbreak in 2003, the Canadian economy bounced back with very little overall damage.""I don't think anyone has any idea of whether or not this is going to be resolved any time soon,"" said Lee.Just as in the recent trade war, uncertainty may be having a paralyzing effect on businesses that are waiting to see whether the availability of parts and the demand for copper and Canada Goose coats will bounce back before firms are forced to completely change their strategies. For some businesses, even a speedy recuperation of the global economy may not wash away the business impact of COVID-19. The special deals already being offered by cruise lines for summer packages may not be enough to cleanse the lingering image of people being trapped for days on a plague ship in windowless rooms in what for many became floating prisons.Follow Don on Twitter @don_pittis",0.0,0.33709058591871083

The $2 billion factory is a key part of CEO Elon Musk's plan to make more than half a million automobiles this year. Tesla last week said it expected a delay of up to a week and a half in the ramp-up of Model 3 production at the plant after the government ordered it to shut the factory due to the outbreak. The coronavirus has disrupted business across China, with the government there saying another 65 people had died as of Tuesday, the highest daily total yet.""Given the 3,000 per week China Model 3 production expectations in a country that remains on lockdown, we feel a reset of expectations in Q1 is likely and thus needs to be reflected in the valuation,"" Canaccord analyst Jed Dorsheimer wrote in a report, leaving his price target unchanged at $750 per share. The stock was last down 19 per cnt at $716.39. Tesla's rally of over 300 per cent since early June has been a vindication for Musk, who has transformed a niche car maker with production problems into the global leader in electric vehicles, with U.S. and Chinese factories.Still, many investors remain skeptical that Tesla can consistently deliver profit, cash flow and growth in the face of competition from established rivals including BMW and Volkswagen.Even many Tesla bulls question the stock's valuation following its recent, electrifying surge. Following Canaccord's downgrade, nine analysts recommend buying Tesla's stock, while 11 analysts are neutral and 15 analysts recommend selling, according to Refinitiv.

It also reported 2,641 new cases across mainland China, taking the total number of people infected to 66,492.For context, influenza claims between 290,000 to 650,000 lives annually, and three to five million people experience severe cases of the illness.Watch: How the coronavirus happenedThe NationalOn Thursday, Chinese health authorities shared new case and fatality numbers that reflected a change in how the illness is being diagnosed. Cases rose 15,152 in one day after China widened its net to include cases that are clinically confirmed through chest scans, as opposed to diagnosed only through a lab test.But public health experts wrestled with what exactly could be deduced from the numbers, given the shift in approach.""If you change the way you count cases, that obviously confounds our capacity to draw firm conclusions about the effectiveness of the quarantine,"" said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University in the United States. ""We have to interpret the numbers with great caution.""Dr. Mike Ryan, head of the WHO's health emergencies program, stressed the importance of keeping politics out of discussions about the outbreak.Ryan was asked to respond to a comment by Larry Kudlow, the director of U.S. President Donald Trump's Economic Council, who told reporters Thursday, ""We're a little disappointed in the lack of transparency coming from the Chinese.""Ryan said, ""Please, let our scientists get on. Let our public health officials get on. We should try, all of us, to avoid politicizing this situation right now.""From our perspective, we have a government that's co-operating with us, that's inviting in international experts, that's shared sequences with the world, that continues to engage with the outside community,"" he said of China.A fifth presumptive case of the novel coronavirus has been identified in British Columbia, bringing the total number of cases in Canada to eight.Provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry said Friday a woman in her 30s returned from Shanghai in the past week through Vancouver's airport before travelling by car to her home in the Interior.Henry said the woman wore a mask on the plane and contacted health officials when she had symptoms of an illness. She tested positive for COVID-19 on Tuesday.""We are very grateful and thankful that the people who are coming back from Hubei province and all over China are taking the advice seriously to self-monitor and to connect with us and make sure that they can be tested, assessed and cared for safely,"" she said.The woman is in isolation at home, as are her close contacts, Henry said.In all such cases, she said, a further test will be conducted at a national lab in Winnipeg to confirm the results obtained provincially.Officials will be contacting passengers who sat three rows ahead and behind the woman on the flight that arrived from China, but the risk to them is ""very, very low,"" she said.The first person to be tested for the virus in the province is recovering well and has tested negative in the first of two tests needed to determine the patient no longer has the virus and isolation is no longer required, she said.Foreign Affairs Minister François-Philippe Champagne says Canadian health workers are assisting in Japan after 15 Canadians contracted the novel coronavirus while on a cruise ship.Champagne says three members of the Public Health Agency of Canada and two medical personnel from the Canadian Armed Forces have been sent to Yokohama, the Japanese port city where the Diamond Princess has been docked since last week.Some 3,500 passengers on the ship are under quarantine and 218 people have tested positive for the coronavirus.Champagne says the Japanese government will allow some elderly people to complete the rest of their quarantine period at another facility off the ship.Meanwhile, Champagne says consular officials are assisting in Cambodia where another ship with 279 Canadians on-board was recently allowed to dock after being rejected from multiple other countries over fears of the new coronavirus.There have been no reported case of the illness on board the Westerdam, and Champagne says officials will help Canadians with the process of returning home.China's National Health Commission reported Friday that 1,716 health workers had been infected and six had died as of Tuesday, with the number of infected staff rising.""The duties of medical workers at the front are indeed extremely heavy; their working and resting circumstances are limited, the psychological pressures are great and the risk of infection is high,"" Zeng Yixin, vice-minister of the commission, told a news conference.However, the WHO's Ryan said the numbers of infected health workers is sad but not alarming.""Our understanding is that the cases among health workers peaked in the third or fourth week of January and there's been a rapid fall-off in the number of cases that have occurred in health workers in the last two weeks,"" Ryan said.He noted many of these health workers may have contracted the illness before the risks were known.""Although it's a very tragic situation for those health workers and particularly for those who have lost their lives … it is a lower percentage than has occurred in other coronavirus outbreaks,"" said Ryan.Chinese scientists are testing two antiviral drugs and preliminary results are due in weeks, while the head of a Wuhan hospital said plasma infusions from recovered patients had shown some encouraging preliminary results.Finding the right treatment for a new disease is no small task.Doctors and other health-care workers fighting the coronavirus outbreak in China don't have any specific treatments to use against this new virus. When they try to treat severe cases, they're walking a tightrope aiming to find just the right level of immune response to kill the virus without setting off other problems. The virus causes respiratory symptoms, such as cough and fever.Dr. Jerome Leis and his team treated Canada's first case at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre in Toronto last month. The man in his 50s initially had some X-ray findings that clinicians were concerned might worsen.""After they were admitted, they did gradually improve and eventually their symptoms resolved completely,"" said Leis, referring to the man. ""I think this story highlights, although we have seen poor outcomes related to this infection, including fatalities, those are the exception, not the rule.""Egypt's Health Ministry has confirmed the first case of the new virus in the North African country.In a statement Friday, Health Ministry spokesman Khaled Mugahed said the person was a ""foreigner"" who is carrying the virus but not showing any serious symptoms.Officials were able to confirm the case through a follow-up program the government implemented for travellers arriving from countries where the virus has spread. The ministry statement said the person was hospitalized and in isolation.The statement did not specify the person's nationality or what port of entry he or she arrived at in Egypt.Experts and African leaders have expressed concern that should the virus spread there, it might wreak havoc among less developed countries with fewer health resources.Previously the number of countries affected outside China was steady at 24.",0.1623376623376623,0.26017316017316017

660,The latest on the coronavirus outbreak for Oct. 9 | CBC News,The latest on the coronavirus outbreak for Oct. 9.,2020-10-09T20:08:23.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/coronavirus-newsletter-oct-9-1.5757639,"Health officials urge vigilance this Thanksgiving as COVID-19 modelling shows acceleration of casesPublic health officials are urging Canadians to be extra-vigilant this Thanksgiving weekend as new COVID-19 modelling shows the growth of caseloads continuing to accelerate across the country. During a news conference in Ottawa today, Chief Public Health Officer Dr. Theresa Tam said Thursday saw the highest one-day increase in reported cases since the start of the pandemic. She said it's vital that Canadians limit their contacts and deny the virus opportunities to spread. ""The actions of individual Canadians are needed now to reverse this trend,"" she said.Tam released projections showing that the national caseload could climb to 197,830 by Oct. 17, with up to 9,800 deaths. The virus is spreading most rapidly in Quebec, Ontario and Alberta, and on average each new case in Canada is spreading infection to more than one person. Globally, the World Health Organization announced a new daily record of reported COVID-19 cases, with more than 350,000. Infections in Canada remain highest among younger age groups — especially among those aged 20 to 39 years old. But infections are rising among Canadians over the age of 80, a group which is particularly vulnerable.Tam said the number of hospitalizations is much lower than it was during the first wave partly due to the average age of those infected. She warned, however, that hospitalizations are a ""late indicator"" of the severity of the pandemic because they lag one or more weeks behind changes in the caseload. To slow the spread and prevent new outbreaks, officials are asking Canadians to limit gatherings to their own household contacts, to stay close to home and to celebrate Thanksgiving creatively through virtual gatherings and festive outdoor activities.Last month, Tam presented modelling that showed the epidemic was accelerating nationally. At the time, she warned that if Canadians did not step up preventative measures, the virus could spread out of control and trigger a wave of infections bigger than the first one. Her projections suggested cases could climb to more than 5,000 daily by October. That projection remains in today's modelling. If Canadians increase their current rate of contacts by 20 per cent, the epidemic is forecast to re-surge ""faster and stronger,"" according to the projections.Public health officials say that if Canadians maintain their current rate of contacts, the epidemic is still expected to re-surge — but if they reduce their contacts by 25 to 35 per cent, the epidemic is expected to come under control in most locations. ""We are at an important juncture in the pandemic, where we would very much like to see the voluntary actions of Canadians across the country be sufficient to bend the curve downward,"" Tam said. ""This will require sustained and intentional effort to limit contacts and reduce opportunities for transmission. This will not be easy and will require hard choices between what we need to do and what we would like to do.""Click below to watch more from The National The NationalOntario tightens restrictions in 3 major areas amid record-breaking case numbersOntario is imposing stricter measures in Toronto, Ottawa and Peel Region in a bid to curb the spread of COVID-19 as the province's curve climbs ever-steeper. The measures, which go into effect Saturday for a period of 28 days, include prohibiting indoor dining at restaurants and bars, and closing gyms, movie theatres and casinos. After that, the province's health experts will review the measures. The government is also asking people in those areas to leave their homes only for essential purposes. Schools and child-care centres will remain open as part of the plan, and provincial Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. David Williams said a large-scale shut down of schools is ""not merited at this time.""The new restrictions come as Ontario marked a record 939 new cases of COVID-19 on Friday, most of them in Toronto, Ottawa and Peel Region. Those regions have consistently reported the majority of new cases in recent weeks. ""All trends are going in the wrong direction,"" Premier Doug Ford said at a news conference, saying the pandemic has picked up speed at ""an alarming rate."" Ford also announced $300 million to support businesses amid the closures. Ford added that if current trends continue, hospitals could be overwhelmed with intensive-care unit placements tripling in less than 30 days. ""If we don't take action now, the situation could overtake us,"" said Health Minister Christine Elliott. The government said if current trends continue, the province could experience ""worst-case scenarios"" seen in northern Italy and New York City earlier in the pandemic.Ford said the measures were decided on after the province's top doctors provided ""brand new data"" to justify new restrictions — although critics have been calling for a rollback to stricter measures for several weeks. Asked why the province didn't act sooner despite the calls of many doctors and health professionals, Ford said he took his direction from the province's health table, adding the recent surge was a sudden one. That's despite Ontario's own modelling forecasting 1,000 cases by mid-October more than a week ago. ""I made a decisive decision to act immediately,"" he said. ""If I didn't make this decision now, I would be negligent.""Read more about the situation Ottawa announces new rent relief program for businesses hit by COVID-19 closuresThe federal government said targeted aid is coming for some businesses hit by closures as a second wave of COVID-19 hits parts of the country. Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland, flanked by the prime minister and other cabinet colleagues, announced a combination of new and previously announced measures in Ottawa Friday. ""I want to stress that this is not for everyone. Some businesses are able to work at full capacity despite COVID-19 and they are doing well and that's great,"" she said.Freeland said this support will include an overhauled rent relief program, which the government said will now allow businesses to apply directly for relief through the Canada Revenue Agency until June 2021. The old program, which was meant to ease the pressure on businesses hit by the pandemic by covering a portion of their rent, expired last month. It was roundly criticized by businesses because tapping into the program depended on buy-in from landlords, who were under no obligation to participate. According to a news release from Finance Canada, the new rent subsidy will support businesses, charities and non-profits that have suffered revenue drops by subsidizing a percentage of their expenses on a sliding scale, up to a maximum of 65 per cent of eligible expenses, until Dec. 19.Freeland's department said a ""top-up"" emergency rent subsidy of 25 per cent, in addition to the 65 per cent subsidy, will be available to organizations temporarily shut down by a mandatory public health order. The government announced plans in the throne speech to extend the wage subsidy program — which is meant to keep employees on the payroll to ensure a smooth post-pandemic economic transition — until next summer. Freeland said today the subsidy will freeze at the current rate of up to a maximum of 65 per cent of eligible wages until Dec.19, and will not decrease on a sliding scale as previously planned. Her department said the government plans to introduce legislation to implement the new rent subsidy and the wage subsidy extension ""in the near future.""Read more about the rent relief program China joins WHO-backed vaccine distribution program rejected by TrumpChina announced on Friday it has joined COVAX, a global scheme for the distribution of COVID-19 vaccine backed by the World Health Organization (WHO), giving a major boost to an initiative shunned by U.S. President Donald Trump. Beijing's latest bid to join the global fight against the coronavirus follows criticism over its handling of the pandemic, which has contributed to a growing unfavourable view of China in advanced nations, a recent survey showed.""We are taking this concrete step to ensure equitable distribution of vaccines, especially to developing countries, and hope more capable countries will also join and support COVAX,"" foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said in a statement. The statement did not detail the support Beijing will provide to the COVAX program, which aims to deliver at least two billion doses of vaccine by the end of 2021. In May, President Xi Jinping pledged $2 billion US over the next two years to tackle the pandemic, which has killed more than one million people. China, where the virus was first reported late last year, is also in talks with the WHO to have its domestically made vaccines assessed for international use.As many as 171 nations have joined the program to back equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines for rich and poor countries alike. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced an investment of $440 million to COVAX on Sept. 25, but neither the U.S. nor Russia are participating. COVAX is co-led by the GAVI vaccines alliance, the WHO and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations. China has ample capability to make COVID-19 vaccine and will prioritize supplies to developing countries when they are ready, its foreign ministry said. China has at least four experimental vaccines in final stages of clinical trials. The move also means China ""will be procuring vaccines through the facility for a proportion of their own population, just as with other countries,"" a GAVI spokesperson said.Read more about the vaccine program During COVID-19, there's an environmental case for taking the stairsDuring the pandemic, elevators are a big challenge — they're indoor spaces where physical distancing is often impossible. COVID-19 guidelines limiting the number of people in an elevator have led to long lineups and waits in highrises and office towers, causing problems for workers returning to their offices, prohibiting some from coming back at all and even keeping some children from going to school. In this week's edition of the What on Earth? newsletter, CBC's Emily Chung writes that, in theory, there is a better option: the stairs.They're much bigger spaces and less prone to crowding, where people largely stay apart because they're generally going in the same direction (or only briefly passing someone going the other way). As with other kinds of active transportation that have increased in popularity during the pandemic (such as walking and cycling), there's also an environmental benefit. Using the stairs can reduce the costs and energy use from elevators — which can come from fossil fuel sources — and could even eliminate the need for so many elevators, resulting in even bigger energy savings. Plus, the exercise has health benefits, such as the potential to lower the risk of heart disease and stroke.That's why ""active design"" to encourage stair use has garnered interest from architects such as Gayle Nicoll, a professor at the Ontario College of Art and Design in Toronto. In practice, the stairs in many modern buildings are hard to find, don't necessarily provide access to the floors you want to reach, may trigger an emergency alarm if you exit from them — and, frankly, are often unpleasant (e.g. messy and poorly lit). Nicoll said that has to do with stairs having become specialized for emergency use, as elevators became ""more front and centre"" with the rise of very tall buildings, as well as accessibility laws and a realization on the part of landlords that minimizing stairs could leave them with more space to rent out.But she said there are some things building owners can do to make stairs usable and to take some pressure off elevators. This includes making stairs more visible, possibly with a sign near the elevator to show people where they are, and reminding people to let those with mobility challenges use the elevator first. She also suggests that companies in multi-storey buildings allow employees to use the stairs to visit employees on other floors. That may mean equipping doors with card readers for security.Neighbours tackle 'Trashy Tuesdays' during pandemic CBC News TorontoSince March, a group of neighbours in South Etobicoke, Ont., has been tackling the trash left in their parks and public spaces together during the COVID-19 pandemic. The group, which call their meet-ups every second week ""Trashy Tuesdays"", met through a community Facebook group event organized by Kirsten Krowiak.Krowiak came up with the idea when she noticed more garbage on the ground, notably disposable masks. ""We were kind of all bored staying inside for quarantine forever. So, we just decided that we were going to go out and hit the street. It was just an easy way to not only socialize, but also take care of a problem,"" she said.The ""Trashy Tuesdays"" group attracted members who have since become good friends and see each other outside their community clean-ups. ""When I met these people, I felt so much joy, like, 'Okay, there are people around me,'"" said Dhara Majmundar. ""Now I feel that I have family away from family.""Read more about the groupFind out more about COVID-19Still looking for more information on the pandemic?

When she actually gave birth Friday evening, zoo officials said they had a hard time getting into their own livestream, and they're now working to boost their capabilities.""Everybody is getting bumped off,"" said deputy director Brandie Smith, a former curator of the zoo's giant pandas who has overseen multiple births here. ""When we have a giant panda baby, the whole world celebrates.""On camera, the actual moment of birth at about 6:35 p.m. is obscured, but the results become immediately obvious from the new cub's robust squealing. The massive mother immediately picks up and cradles the infant, which officials say is the size of a stick of butter.❤️🐼 Keepers report that giant panda Mei Xiang and her newborn had a successful first night. Between bouts of good rest, Mei Xiang appeared to nurse her cub and was very attentive to its vocalizations. 👀🎥 TUNE IN: <a href=""https://t.co/99lBTV2w92"">https://t.co/99lBTV2w92</a>. <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/PandaStory?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#PandaStory</a> <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/PandaCubdates?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#PandaCubdates</a> <a href=""https://t.co/QCd2IYv5w4"">pic.twitter.com/QCd2IYv5w4</a>""We can tell the cub is doing well from its vocalizations and the mother's behaviour,"" Smith said. Zoo staff remain ready to intervene if something seems wrong, but Smith said Mei Xiang, who has reared three cubs to adulthood, ""knows exactly what she is doing.""For now, zoo staff are letting the new pair share some private time. Mei Xiang will remain with her baby (gender still unknown) in a small indoor enclosure where she has built a modest nest. For about a week, the new mother will not leave the baby's side even to eat or drink.The cub, who will not be named for its first hundred days in accordance with tradition, will remain in the den for its first few months of life. For now it is pink and hairless; the distinctive black and white fur markings come later.Meanwhile father Tian Tian seems blissfully oblivious, rolling around his outdoor enclosure Saturday morning. Giant pandas are almost entirely solitary, and in the wild it would be normal for Tian Tian to never meet his offspring.""There's no real role for the male to play in the baby's care,"" Monfort said. ""He's probably more interested in what's for breakfast this morning.""Mei Xiang was artificially inseminated in the spring shortly after the entire zoo shut down on March 14 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Normally a combination of frozen sperm and fresh semen extracted from Tian Tian would have been used. But in order to minimize the number of close-quarters medical procedures, zoo officials used only frozen semen.It was the first successful procedure of its kind in the U.S. using only frozen sperm, and Mei Xiang, at 22, is the oldest giant panda to successfully give birth in the country. The oldest in the world gave birth in China at age 23.Mei Xiang has three surviving offspring — Tai Shan, Bao Bao and Bei Bei — which were transported to China at the age of four under an agreement with the Chinese government.With the indoor section of the panda house closed due to COVID-19 restrictions, the panda cam is really the only way to view the newborn. The zoo reopened on a limited basis on July 24 with visitors needing timed passes to keep the crowds down.For now, zoo officials are directing panda-maniacs to the live cam and are expecting unprecedented interest from a global population sheltering under pandemic restrictions and desperate for a bit of good news.""Something like this is kind of a miracle for us,"" Monfort said. ""It lifts the spirits and of my team and the whole world.""Smith said it's also a fresh chance to direct those passions toward fundraising efforts that can help support global conservation initiatives.""Conservation only happens when people care, and people really care about giant pandas"" she said.",0.0,0.5356644041829227

Should it? | CBC News,Seasoned jurists say the Canadian government has every legal right to intervene to free Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou from her extradition trial to the U.S. But some experts say such an action could have significant political ramifications.,2020-06-24T00:25:32.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/meng-extradition-liberal-government-intervene-1.5623991,"While seasoned jurists say the Canadian government has every legal right to intervene to free Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou from her extradition trial to the U.S., some experts warn such an action could have significant political ramifications.""The question isn't whether the [Canadian government] can, the question is whether they should,"" said Toronto-based lawyer Brian Greenspan.In 1999, the Extradition Act was amended to include a specific provision that provides the federal minister of justice the power to intervene in an extradition at any point during the judicial phase.""The minister has the right to withdraw the authority to proceed and to end the extradition proceeding, and it's totally at the discretion of the minister of justice,"" Greenspan said.WATCH | Chinese Foreign Ministry comments on CBC interview with Michael Kovrig's wife  WorldExtradition proceedings continue in the case against Meng, who was arrested in 2018 in Vancouver on behalf of American justice officials. The United States wants to prosecute Meng for fraud, alleging she lied to banks about her company's connections with Iran, which could possibly violate U.S. sanctions.The issue of the Canadian government intervening in the case of Meng, the daughter of the Chinese technology giant's founder, was raised recently by the wife of Michael Kovrig, one of two Canadians being held in China on charges of spying.The Trudeau government has accused China of detaining Kovrig and Michael Spavor in retaliation for the arrest of Meng. Some have suggested Canada could secure their freedom if it put an end to the extradition proceedings against Meng and allowed her to return to China. Trudeau has said his government continues to work behind the scenes to secure the release of the two Canadians but has ruled out a prisoner exchange.The Office of the Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, David Lametti, said in a statement Tuesday they are ""well aware of the laws and processes governing"" the extradition proceedings.""As Ms. Meng's case remains before the courts, and the Minister of Justice has a direct role in the extradition process, it would not be appropriate to comment further on this matter,"" the statement said.WATCH | Canada can stop Meng Wanzhou's extradition, legal experts say. Should it?The NationalFormer Supreme Court of Canada justice John Major said while Lametti can intervene at any time in the extradition process, it would be unusual — especially if after a prolonged court hearing, it concluded in favour of extradition.But Major noted there may be reasons to do it, especially as Kovrig and Spavor languish in Chinese detention. ""I would hope before the attorney general intervenes, [he] would have reasons that convince Canadians he should,"" Major told CBC News.""The attorney general has to be very cautious in overruling a trial judge who has conducted a full hearing … You just want [Lametti] to act judiciously, not politically.""Major said Canada is stuck in a difficult position, because if the attorney general quashes the judge's decision in Meng's case, the U.S. could react. Likewise, if the judge approves extradition, China could retaliate.""It's a delicate situation where you have the U.S. at odds with China and Canada being caught in the middle,"" Major said.Donald Abelson, director of St. Francis Xavier University's Brian Mulroney Institute of Government, said he believes it would be ""a very dangerous game for Canada to play in terms of succumbing to pressure"" to intervene politically in the case.""I don't think that's a game that we want to play,"" said Abelson, who was also a founding director of the Canada-U.S. Institute. ""It puts us in a very, very precarious position because we don't want to be seen by the Americans as succumbing to Chinese political pressure.""Abelson said Canada would be ""tempting fate"" with the U.S, particularly in the current political climate, where the Chinese government has become the focus of Donald Trump's ire in terms of the COVID-19 pandemic and the countries' trade war.Abelson said Canada doesn't want to become a ""punching bag"" for Washington.WATCH | Wife of Michael Kovrig says Canada can choose to end the extradition process:The NationalDavid Carment, a a professor at Carleton University's Norman Paterson School of International Affairs, said he believes Canada's intervention would prompt the Trump administration to use it as a rallying cry to undermine Trudeau's leadership and his pursuit for a majority government when he calls an election.""I think all sort of diplomatic gloves would come off in this case. The United States would come out fighting and work to undermine this current government's mandate,"" he said.Christopher Sands, director of the Centre for Canadian Studies at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, said that the state department officials who brought the case forward against Meng would be unhappy with Canada's decision to intervene.Trump would likely be angry, send off a dismissive tweet or give Trudeau the cold shoulder at the next G7 meeting. But Sands doesn't believe it would result in major policy ramifications against Canada.""Would it be 'Canadians are no longer allowed to cross the border?' No. The relationship between us and Canada is too big and complex for that,"" he said.

677,Details of province's secret agreement with Brightenview emerge as dispute about megamall boils over | CBC News,"The province is threatening to evict Brightenview from its GTH office because it has failed to pay its lease for more than a year. Meanwhile, Brightenview’s CEO says the province has “misled” him, broken its contract and abandoned his company.",2020-10-12T12:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/details-of-sask-secret-agreement-with-brightenview-emerge-1.5756542,"On the eve of the previous Saskatchewan election, Brightenview Development International and the Global Transportation Hub (GTH) celebrated their new land deal and partnership. They agreed to work together as a united team to promote Brightenview's immigration business around the world. Four years later, that partnership has imploded.The province is threatening to evict Brightenview from its GTH office because the company has failed to pay its lease for more than a year. Meanwhile, Brightenview's CEO says the province has ""misled"" him, broken its contract and abandoned his company.He delivered a message to the province in an interview with CBC. ""You don't give a s--t about this live business you literally brought into [the GTH],"" said Joe Zhou. ""There's a contract, right? You're not done yet. You have an obligation."" In Feb. 2016, Brightenview agreed to purchase 30 acres of land at the GTH. Initially it purchased 10 acres and built its 80,000 square foot wholesale mall which was completed in the summer of 2018. The company agreed to temporarily lease a second 10-acre parcel, where it constructed its 4,000 square foot corporate office.  The GTH, a government-owned industrial subdivision, says Brightenview is $538,000 in arrears on that lease.""Brightenview refuses to pay the rent it agreed to in the signed lease agreement and will not offer a suitable alternative,"" wrote GTH CEO Matt Schroeder in an email to CBC. ""Therefore it is within our legal rights to seize the building on the leased premises until a suitable resolution can be found.""Zhou said he's facing financial troubles that stem in part from actions by the provincial government which harmed his business. Zhou said that before the last election the GTH promised to be his partner and help promote his company's megamall to would-be immigrants in China. He said the province did that for a time, even sending former Premier Brad Wall to China to help promote the project.Zhou said the government is now acting like his adversary. Late last year, the province changed the rules and banned any new immigration applications tied to Brightenview's megamall. The province said there was a fundamental flaw with Brightenview's business model that put immigrant investors at ""undue risk."" Zhou said that decision ""threatens and cripples our ability to sustain the project."" He said 75 Chinese nationals have set up shop in the wholesale mall and the government has abandoned them too.   ""You're the one literally in the agreement that attracted these investors. You played this major role, Right? You can't deny that."" Four years ago, the two sides were all handshakes and smiles. On Feb. 3, 2016, weeks before the launch of the election, Brightenview and the GTH signed a multimillion dollar land deal and a co-operation agreement.By May 2017, Brightenview had broken ground on the first of three 120-unit wholesale malls it planned for the property. The Minister Responsible for Immigration and the GTH, Jeremy Harrison, was there.""We're really optimistic. I think this is really going to be a very positive project,"" he said.Called the Global Trade and Exhibition Centre (GTEC), the mall is intimately tied to immigration.The company told Chinese nationals that purchasing and running a storefront in GTEC would qualify them to gain permanent residency in Canada through the entrepreneurial category of Saskatchewan's immigration program.The company also told would-be immigrants that the entire project was supported and promoted by the Saskatchewan government.Zhou said it was the province's promise of support and promotion that lured him into the 30-acre deal at a premium price of $7.6 million.He said he didn't even negotiate the price, because for him this wasn't primarily a land purchase. His priority was to gain the government's endorsement of his project through a formal co-operation agreement.For the past four years, Brightenview and the Saskatchewan government worked together to keep the details of their co-operation agreement secret.The province has waged a two year battle in court against the CBC, arguing that releasing details of the agreement would show prospective tenants at the GTH just how much the organization was willing to do to attract them.Zhou said that in light of the government's recent moves to harm his business, he's been forced to publicly talk about the agreement.He said the GTH promised:To work with Brightenview as ""a united team"" to promote the Brightenview project and Brightenview's business interests.To co-ordinate general public relations activity and the promotion of the ""Brightenview model.""To allocate internal resources to help promote, qualify and prospective clients to Brightenview — including two annual international trade missions.To set up a co-operative governance model with Brightenview, including joint directions, plans, resources and ongoing performance management.To arrange regular meetings between Brightenview and selected senior government officials.To provide Brightenview with strategic advice and help in its dealings with federal, provincial and municipal governments.Zhou said the company never would have done the land deal without this agreement.He said having a western government vouch for the credibility and authenticity of his project is crucial when attempting to do business in China, where potential investors are wary of scams. Zhou said he had been in discussions with the GTH for years, but when the deal finally came together it happened quickly and was approved at the highest level.On Dec. 18, 2015, he and his team were summoned to a meeting they had been seeking for a long time. Then-Minister of the Economy Bill Boyd, who was responsible for immigration and the GTH, had agreed to discuss the terms of a co-operation agreement.Zhou said Boyd's presence and support were crucial, because the GTEC project required the full backing of the provincial government. Zhou said he wanted assurances that the Saskatchewan Immigrant Nominee Program (SINP) would be comfortable with the Brightenview model so he could tell prospective investors that ""this program, the model, what it does, is number one, recognized by the [SINP]. In early February 2016, just before the deal was signed, Boyd confirmed in a letter that the ""GTH is the lead agency empowered by government to work with Brightenview on the proposed projects,"" and he instructed the GTH to ""engage the relevant resources within government and any external agencies to assist as necessary.""On Feb. 3, 2016, Zhou was invited to the GTH office to sign the final agreements.That very morning, CBC broke a story about another series of land agreements at the GTH. The story outlined how politically well-connected businessmen made millions on a series of transactions that saw 204 acres of land at the GTH wind up in taxpayers' hands for far more than it was worth.The government had an appraisal that said the property was worth $30,000 an acre, but they paid a politically well-connected businessman $103,000 an acre.With weeks to go before the provincial campaign, the NDP called for a police investigation and the premier called for a provincial auditor review. Boyd defended the deal but others said they thought it stinks.20 unanswered questions about the GTH land dealThe Brightenview land sale ended up forming the foundation of the Saskatchewan Party's campaign response to the story.On Dec. 16, 2015, a month and a half before the Brightenview deal was signed, Boyd gave CBC his one and only interview about the GTH land deal transactions.Two days later, on Dec. 18, Boyd and other senior government officials met with Zhou to hammer out the details of the co-operation agreement.Zhou said he had no idea CBC was working on a story about the GTH at that time, but that he did notice the government has a new sense of urgency toward his proposal.""They were very eager,"" he said. That suited him just fine, because he wanted to get a deal done quickly too. Zhou said because his priority was to get the co-operation agreement, he just agreed to what the GTH said was the set rate: $256,000 an acre. That's the most anyone has paid for land there.Internal documents obtained by CBC show that before the deal was signed, the premier's office thoroughly evaluated Brightenview and its business. The documents also show that the province knew the Brightenview's business model was tied to Immigration.On March 1, 2016, days before the election call, the province sent out a news release.That $256,000/acre price tag was in the opening sentence and was often mentioned by the premier in the election campaign whenever the GTH land deal controversy was raised. When reporters would ask why the government paid so much more than their own appraisal, Wall said land prices were going crazy.""The GTH had their lower appraisal and they agreed at $103,000 and land is now selling at $256,000,"" Wall said, noting that in the end ""taxpayers are making money.""Not long after Wall won that election, he was in China speaking at a GTEC event.  In September 2016, Wall and an entourage flew to China, where the premier spoke at an event organized by Brightenview and attended by 3,500 Chinese investors.  Zhou said images of that event were so widely publicized that his project had instant credibility. A GTEC brochure features photos of this trip. A caption reads, ""Premier Brad Wall strongly supports and promotes the GTH-GTEC project in person.""That message got through.For example, a Feb. 22, 2017 article on a high-profile China-based finance website says ""GTEC is an immigration project managed by the Saskatchewan government… it provides a fast and efficient way to immigrate to Canada.""Zhou said many Chinese people who invested in his project came here because of that Saskatchewan government endorsement.So far, about 75 Chinese-owned businesses have set up shop inside. They sell a wide range of products from electronics to flooring to furniture.GTEC and Brightenview have been shrouded in some controversy.CBC reported that some Chinese nationals have claimed to have been cheated and filed lawsuits against Brightenview. The provincial government has alleged that Brightenview's advertising of the project was misleading, in that it suggested Brightenview had a special relationship with the province's immigration program.Zhou has argued that the company has followed all the rules and had a written commitment that the Saskatchewan government fully backed his project.He said the media attention on the project has slowed sales of new units. He said it also appears to have attracted the attention of Immigration Canada, which is responsible for evaluating the applications of GTEC investors.""We have found these people have experienced a large amount of rejections seemingly through... an extraordinary scrutiny,"" Zhou said.He said in many of those cases, Ottawa rejected the application for the same reason — the proposed business was not deemed sufficiently beneficial to Canada.About 30 applicants have been stuck in limbo for a couple of years, having purchased a GTEC unit but having been rejected by Ottawa, Zhou said.Some GTEC applicants have asked for refunds because they've been waiting too long and have lost hope. Yet the bills have continued to pour in for Brightenview.""Our losses are in millions,"" Zhou said.Zhou acknowledges he still hasn't paid all the construction bills.In April, Brightenview's electrical contractor placed a $380,000 lien on the megamall and launched a lawsuit.In May, the general contractor that built GTEC placed $1.4 million in mortgages on Brightenview's properties.At the same time, the GTH has been going through struggles of its own.The organization has failed to sell any land since the Brightenview purchase. Every year it goes deeper into debt.In the fall of 2019, the government turned the management and sales of the GTH over to a private sector realtor.""The GTH notified Brightenview in person that our desire for their success hadn't changed, however the GTH would no longer be completing the contemplated actions pursuant to the co-operation agreement,"" said GTH CEO Schroeder.Zhou said that since that time he has been treated like a tenant, not a partner.When the land deal was originally signed, Brightenview committed to purchasing 30 acres. Zhou said that because of the Immigration Canada troubles, the company was unable to purchase the second 10-acre parcel, but it needed some of the land for its corporate office building, so he decided to temporarily lease the parcel and construct his $1-million corporate office there. The leasing fee was steep, $29,000/month, but he figured it would only be for a short period of time and he would need that land for phase two of his project.He was wrong. In early November 2019, the provincial government banned all immigration applications tied to Brightenview, effectively ending plans for phase two.Zhou said that rendered the leased land ""purposeless and useless,"" because 97 per cent of it is vacant ""with no evident opportunity to be put to business use.""The bill keeps going up every month, now totalling $538,000. Zhou said soon it could equal the $1 million he paid for the building.He said he feels trapped, unable to move the office building from the leased land.""My body is shaking."" He said he doesn't want to simply walk away from what he has built or from the entrepreneurs he has attracted to the province.""I'm trying to be a responsible business for the sake of the tenants,"" he said, adding he would still like to make the business work somehow.In a series of letters to the province, Zhou has implored the most recent Minister Responsible for the GTH, Don Morgan, for mercy in light of the cooperation agreement and the COVID-19 crisis.He asked the province to forgive the lease arrears in their entirety and rewrite the lease for just one acre of land instead of the current 10.""This worries me, this lease. Alright? Can you please dissolve that?,"" Zhou said. ""I did not demand or claim. I simply outcry to ask for assistance.""Zhou said he has been met with silence for months.CBC asked the GTH about Zhou's request. In an email, Schroeder said the organization isn't bound by the co-operation agreement because it is not a formal contract. ""While the document signed between Brightenview and the GTH is labelled an agreement, the absence of consideration, termination date, remedies for breach and other standard contract clauses indicate that this is not a formal contract but instead a memorandum of understanding,"" he wrote. He added that the GTH's partnership with Brightenview ""did not absolve Brightenview of meeting their contractual commitments or adapting to changing business climates.""Zhou said Schroeder is wrong about the co-operation agreement.He said that agreement was signed at the same time as the land sale and they were a package deal.""This is a bonafide contract with significant monetary considerations,"" he said, noting that his company invested millions in purchasing land and building the GTEC facility.He said he hopes he and the province can come to some sort of resolution. He said it would not be good for anyone if his company suffered a high-profile failure.""I would be very sorry if after all of this Brightenview and the project mission should end up being a victim, a casualty of the making and shaping of GTH and the government,"" he said.",0.0,0.4115396098154716

He's confused everyone, even his own supporters,"" said Woodward, associate editor of The Washington Post.Such a direct comment is unusual for Woodward, who was part of the team that uncovered the Watergate scandal, leading to the eventual resignation of former U.S. President Richard Nixon. ""Ben Bradlee was the editor of The Post during Watergate. I learned from Ben: report the facts, don't get into name-calling one way or another,"" he said.But he said that after 19 interviews with Trump conducted over 10 months, he felt compelled to write his assessment of the current president in an epilogue to Rage. He then showed the section to his wife and editors.""They said: 'Well, you're writing a book about truth. And that's what you feel is the truth, based on evidence,"" he recalled.""'You can't leave that out of the book. You have an obligation to say that.'""Recordings of Woodward's interviews with Trump were released by The Washington Post and CNN in early September. In the taped conversations, the president indicated he understood the severity of the virus in the early days of the pandemic.In an interview on Feb. 7, Trump told Woodward that the virus ""goes through the air,"" and was ""more deadly than even your strenuous flus.""NewsPublicly that month, Trump repeatedly told the public that the U.S. was in control of the outbreak, at one point telling a Feb. 28 South Carolina rally that the coronavirus is ""[the Democrats'] new hoax.""On March 19, roughly a week after the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic and a state of emergency was declared in the U.S., Trump told Woodward that he ""wanted to always play it down.""""I still like playing it down, because I don't want to create a panic,"" he said.Woodward's new book follows his 2018 book Fear, in which he concluded that there was ""a nervous breakdown of the executive branch in America.""At the time, Trump denounced Fear as ""fiction, pure fiction,"" but he was still willing to talk to Woodward for the follow-up book.""I think he knew I would listen,"" Woodward said. ""I let him have his say; that was my responsibility as a reporter.""He added that he also had a responsibility to put Trump's words and actions in context.""The context is that 200,000 people have died and he could have averted some of it,"" he said. ""The big problem is this is a moving train. The pandemic may get worse.""WorldWoodward has faced criticism for not reporting Trump's remarks sooner, but said he didn't have the full timeline of what Trump knew, and when he knew it.""You can't write about something you don't know about, unfortunately,"" he said.Woodward said it was only in May that he discovered Trump had been briefed about the severity of the approaching pandemic in a classified Jan. 28 meeting. At that briefing, Trump's national security adviser Robert O' Brien warned the virus would be the biggest national security threat to Trump's presidency, Woodward said. But when they spoke in March, he thought Trump was reacting to new information from China. ""I'm in this question of 'Gee, I know what the president has told me — he's talking about China!' because he had just talked to President Xi [Jinping] the night before, and they had talked about the virus,"" Woodward told Galloway.""And I spent months trying to understand what Trump and Xi had talked about."" Bob Woodward had my quotes for many months. If he thought they were so bad or dangerous, why didn’t he immediately report them in an effort to save lives? Didn’t he have an obligation to do so? No, because he knew they were good and proper answers. Calm, no panic!Woodward said he spent weeks trying to figure out ""What did the president know? When did he know it? And how did he know?""""And I kept digging at that, and finally in May got the answer.""On May 6, Woodward asked Trump if he remembered O'Brien's warning.""Trump said: 'No, but I know he said that,'"" Woodward remembers.By then, 75,000 people had died of COVID-19 in the U.S., and ""everyone knew that it was something that could be transmitted through the air, transmitted by people who didn't show symptoms,"" Woodward said.""So there was no story to run. I wanted to make sure I could put all this together in a book,"" he said. The U.S.'s COVID death toll surpassed 200,000 on Tuesday, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.WorldAsked about the comments during a White House press conference on Sept. 9, Trump said he didn't want people to be frightened, but instead wanted to show confidence and strength as a nation.Following the release of the tape, White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said Trump did not intentionally mislead Americans about the severity of the coronavirus epidemic.""The president never downplayed the virus,"" she said. ""The president displayed calm.""Democrat presidential nominee Joe Biden said that Trump had committed ""a life-and-death betrayal of the American people,"" and was ""unfit for this job as a consequence.""Woodward also said Trump displayed a failure ""to understand the people he leads."" ""We know the people in this country, when they're told the truth, rally around together,"" he said, citing the attacks on Pearl Harbour and the World Trade Center on Sept. 11, 2001.""The president at this top secret meeting asked questions, was fully informed, and then instead of telling the public he chose denial and a failure to do his duty as president to protect the country and to tell the truth to the country."" NewsWoodward said the publication of his book shows that free speech is still protected in the U.S.""He has not sent the attorney general or the FBI or people to raid my house and steal my tape recordings and documents and put me in jail, and say I'm guilty of something,"" he said.""The democracy is functioning; the leadership is what's failed.""But he said he fears for his country because Trump has ""launched a full-scale attack on his own election process,"" in effect becoming ""an advocate for chaos.""Recent attacks on mail-in ballots are ""an extension of the self-centredness that he's practised in his presidency,"" he said.Because of the new and unprecedented massive amount of unsolicited ballots which will be sent to “voters”, or wherever, this year, the Nov 3rd Election result may NEVER BE ACCURATELY DETERMINED, which is what some want.

693,Huawei sues U.S. over 'stonewalling' on Meng Wanzhou documents | CBC News,Huawei is suing multiple U.S. government agencies to try to force the release of documents the company believes could reveal political motivations behind the arrest of its chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou.,2020-11-04T09:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/huawei-meng-wanzhou-documents-suing-1.5788329,"Huawei is suing multiple U.S. government agencies to try to force the release of documents the company believes could reveal political motivations behind the arrest of its chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou.In a complaint filed last week in federal district court in Washington, D.C., the telecommunications giant accuses the Trump administration of ""stonewalling"" numerous freedom of information requests to 16 agencies, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the U.S. Department of Justice and the Department of Commerce.Huawei's lawyers say there are ""signs"" the U.S. wants to use criminal charges against the company and Meng ""to advance policy objectives unrelated to the evenhanded administration of criminal justice.""In addition to inter-agency documents, the lawsuit also seeks communications between the Department of Homeland Security, the Justice Department and ""certain Canadian authorities that participated in the investigation or arrest of Ms. Meng.""""These communications are primarily aimed at identifying communications that could indicate improper bases for the prosecution of [Huawei] and Ms. Meng,"" the lawsuit reads.The complaint goes on to list what Huawei claims are the reasons for Meng's extradition, including interfering with Huawei's ""dominance"" in the 5G wireless market and strengthening the U.S. position in trade negotiations with China.Meng was arrested on Dec. 1, 2018, after flying into Vancouver's airport on what was supposed to be a stopover on her way to Mexico City, with an ultimate destination of Argentina.Meng is the daughter of Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei.Both she and Huawei are charged with fraud for allegedly misleading HSBC about the company's control of a subsidiary accused of violating U.S. economic sanctions against Iran.HSBC had allegedly become concerned about the relationship after a series of Reuters articles detailing problems.Prosecutors say HSBC continued financing Huawei because of lies Meng allegedly told one of the bank's executives in a PowerPoint presentation in 2013. As a result, HSBC was allegedly placed at risk of loss and prosecution.The U.S. lawsuit aligns with efforts by Meng's Canadian defence team to have the extradition case tossed because of politicization and alleged violations of the 48-year-old's rights in the time leading up to her arrest.Meng's lawyers have cited comments made by U.S. President Donald Trump suggesting he would be willing to use her as a bargaining chip in a trade war with China.They have also accused Canadian authorities of conspiring to assist the FBI in its investigation by having Canada Border Services Agency officers use their extraordinary powers to question Meng for three hours without a lawyer before the RCMP arrested her.Police and border services officers will continue testimony in B.C. Supreme Court later this month about the details of Meng's customs examination and the seizure of her phones.Last week, a CBSA officer admitted to passing the code that unlocks both of Meng's phones to the RCMP by ""mistake.""Her lawyers have also accused the RCMP of giving detailed technical information from Meng's electronic devices to the FBI.The U.S. lawsuit claims Huawei made 12 requests more than a year ago under the U.S. Freedom of Information Act, but has received almost nothing back, despite an ""express requirement that agencies generally must act within 20 business days.""In addition to communications about Meng's arrest between Canada and the U.S. agencies, the company is also asking for communications about the indictment between the U.S. agencies and the White House.The lawsuit cites the global coverage of the B.C. court proceedings as justification for an expedited need for the documents in question ""on the ground that they involved matters of widespread and exceptional media interest in which there exist possible questions about the government's integrity which affect public confidence.""While it covers much of the same ground, the U.S. lawsuit is a separate matter to the extradition proceedings currently underway in B.C. Supreme Court.Huawei's U.S. lawyers are fighting the U.S. criminal charges against her and the company in New York. The U.S is arguing in B.C. that Meng should be sent to New York to stand trial. Meng's Canadian lawyers will have a chance in February to argue the alleged violations of her rights can only be remedied by staying the extradition proceedings.The CBSA and RCMP officers who have testified so far have denied any complicity and any improper information sharing with the FBI.The U.S. agencies named in the lawsuit have not yet filed any responses to it.Meng is currently living under a form of house arrest after being released on bail of $10 million. She wears a monitoring bracelet on her ankle as part of her bail conditions and is watched by private security guards around the clock.Meng has denied the allegations against her.",0.1432964257964258,0.5168997668997669

Across 24 other countries, there are 270 confirmed cases and one death. There are five confirmed cases in Canada. The WHO declared the outbreak a global health emergency in late January. The Canadian government issued a Level 3 advisory for China, asking Canadians to avoid non-essential travel. There is only one higher level, which advises people to avoid all travel.The government recommends people avoid travelling to Hubei province, where Wuhan city is located. The province has recorded 22,112 of China's 31,211 coronavirus cases, according to the WHO. As soon as the Canadian government declares a Level 3 or 4 travel advisory, a person may cancel their upcoming trip and their insurance should cover any lost expenses, said Weir. ""You'd have to submit receipts,'' she said, but travellers should receive refunds for flights, hotels and other costs.<a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/China?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#China</a>: Most airlines have suspended or reduced flights to and from the country due to the <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/coronavirus?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#coronavirus</a> outbreak.

While 24 countries have confirmed coronavirus cases, Canada's travel advisory applies only to China. That means a person who feels uncomfortable travelling to any of the other countries won't be able to get a refund for cancelling their trip, she said.That is, unless they purchased what's known as cancel-for-any-reason insurance, she said, which does exactly what the name implies.Those who haven't purchased any travel insurance may still be able to secure a refund, Weir noted, as many major credit cards offer some kind of coverage.""But it depends on which credit card you have and what the benefits are,'' she said.

A third case has also been confirmed in B.C.Ontario public health officials have repeatedly stressed that the risk of coronavirus infection in Canada is low. Evidence suggests transmission of the virus from person to person requires close contact, like the kind between immediate family members who live together, said Dr. David Williams, the province's chief medical officer, this week. Further, lessons from the 2003 SARS outbreak suggest many airport screening procedures are ineffective.Beveridge was returning to Canada from Cambodia but changed planes in Hong Kong after flying from Phnom Penh.He said he was anxious, even though he had not been anywhere near Wuhan. Cambodia has so far reported only one case of the coronavirus and it was travel-related. Additionally, given the concerns over the coronavirus in China and other Southeast Asian countries, he figured he'd better do something on his return to make sure he didn't spread whatever he had.""Nobody even took my temperature. And you know if we're really trying to keep this out of Canada, it seems that that was not a very thorough screening process,"" Beveridge said.The outbreak of the new coronavirus began last month in Wuhan, a city of 11 million people. The World Health Organization (WHO) says it has killed at least 213 people, all in China. More than 9,600 people globally have been infected, the vast majority in China, though cases have been confirmed in 19 other countries. Yesterday, WHO declared the emerging situation a public health emergency of international concern.CBC News reached out to the Greater Toronto Airports Authority (GTAA), the body that oversees Pearson, for comment. A spokesperson said the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) is responsible for determining the response to coronavirus.Canada began implementing some enhanced screening measures for passengers on flights from China to Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver on Jan. 22. They include signs urging travellers to report flu-like symptoms, additional health-realted questions at kiosks and pamphlets with information about what people should do if their condition worsens.Watch infectious disease experts discuss why many enhanced screening measures are ineffective:The NationalDr. Theresa Tam, chief public health officer of Canada, said it's likely Beveridge was not screened because he was in Hong Kong only briefly and hadn't been to mainland China.""For the coronavirus, the enhanced border measures, on top of what we have as a foundation, is essentially providing the information on the screen and the kiosk questions and the referral to Canadian border service agents,"" Tam told CBC News.Tam said anyone who is sick should tell a border service agent.Frank Scarpitti, the mayor of Markham, 30 kilometres northeast of Toronto, says while he has great confidence in public health officials at the federal, provincial and local levels, he continues to press for the federal government to put in more enhanced screening at all Canadian airports.""I think it would just give Canadians a greater sense of confidence that that additional step is being taken,"" Scarpitti told CBC News.""It's not going to catch everyone but it's just another layer of screening, rather than just voluntary screening, and indicating where someone may have travelled.""Scarpitti also pointed to measures introduced at other major airports in New York City, San Francisco and Los Angeles that involve passengers from China being screened for symptoms.""You just have to look south of the border, the U.S. airports instituted that,"" he said.""Because of the number of airports that they have, they're actually redirecting passengers to the airports that have that technology,"" Scarpitti said.Global Affairs Canada said there are 196 Canadians currently seeking consular help to leave China, and Canada has secured a charter aircraft to bring home Canadians stranded in the affected region.",0.06588510286963896,0.4309334136653724

Chinese community raising money for doctors dealing with coronavirus outbreak | CBC News,Members of the Chinese community on Prince Edward Island are aiming to get thousands of dollars in medical supplies to the areas of China dealing with the recent coronavirus outbreak.,2020-02-07T23:39:55.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-chinese-community-fundraising-feb-2020-1.5456540,"Members of the Chinese community on Prince Edward Island are aiming to get thousands of dollars in medical supplies to the areas of China dealing with the recent coronavirus outbreak.Fundraising efforts are being organized by the P.E.I. Chinese Canadian Association. There's one Islander who is friends with the head of a hospital in China's Hubei province — where Wuhan is. Another Islander is friends with the head of a group in the U.S. that's already shipped medical supplies to Chinese hospitals.It was through those connections that the P.E.I. Chinese Canadian Association learned about how much of a need there is for more medical supplies at Hubei hospitals and how to help get them there, said Paul Yin, head of the association, through interpreter Ally Guo.""In our Island, we do have friends with friends in Hubei. And they have direct contact with the hospitals. They have an urgent need for help. So that's why we decided to start this fundraiser,"" Yin said.There have been no confirmed cases of coronavirus on Prince Edward Island and seven in Canada.The live map tracking the outbreak on the World Health Organization website said China had 31,424 confirmed cases and 638 deaths as of Friday evening.The association is accepting e-transfers to purchase medical equipment.Even members of the Canadian Chinese community who lived on P.E.I. for a period before moving to another province are chipping in.""It's not just P.E.I., it's residents who were here before and also want to donate,"" Yin said.Yin said in particular, the doctors and nurses are lacking protective gear like suits, masks and glasses and that it's important doctors and nurses stay healthy in order to help other people.""There's a huge demand for the masks and everything.""""The Chinese government, they are doing a lot of purchases and activities to prevent this outbreak, but the numbers are too big,"" Yin said.""They might not be able to do all the things. And it's Chinese New Year festival time and a lot of factories in China that produce this equipment are on holiday.""Yin just returned from another, less affected area of China a few days ago, and while he feels fine he's staying inside his home, away from the public for two weeks as a precaution.However, since Yin has gotten back to the Island he's been busy online putting out the call to P.E.I.'s Chinese community for donations.In an email to CBC, P.E.I.'s Chief Public Health Office said the policy for those returning from China changed Thursday.Those who have travelled to Canada from Hubei province — which includes Wuhan — should voluntarily self-isolate for 14 days, staying at home and not going to school or work. This does not apply to people returning from other parts of China. Those travellers are being asked to monitor themselves and their children for 14 days — and call 811 if they develop symptoms such as fever, coughing or difficulty breathing.Yin is getting help in his fundraising efforts from volunteers like Guo, Yin's interpreter during his interview with CBC.Guo was born in Shanghai, but has lived on P.E.I. for the last five years. She runs a Chinese social media website aimed at bridging the gap between the Chinese community and other Islanders.In just three days, about 140 people have donated more than $15,000 and it will all go to that non-profit group in the U.S. to buy supplies and ship them to three hospitals in Hubei, Guo said.""We have seen their materials, like who do they buy from, who do they deliver to, and with the evidence that they've already delivered equipment to the hospitals with photos and everything, we believe they can do so,"" she said.Guo said the money raised so far is enough to provide a week's worth of protective gear for about 200 doctors and nurses, but she hopes they can at least double that amount.""Every day they need a lot of equipment. They don't have so many supplies just because the population there is so many,"" Guo said.""They have to protect themselves.""Guo said the group will continue to raise money for medical equipment in China for as long as it is needed. This year, P.E.I.'s Chinese New Year's gala was moved from early March to mid-March to give those trying to get back to the Island time to do so, Guo said.That gala is also becoming a charity event this year. Money raised  will go toward helping those dealing with the coronavirus outbreak, Guo said.",0.09435876623376624,0.2879599567099568

The total number of confirmed cases hit 69,176 on Tuesday.But Vò has become a beacon of hope. Doctors there have been able to stop the spread of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19, and their work has become a model for other communities struggling to contain it""We managed to eradicate coronavirus from Vò, achieving a 100 per cent recovery rate for those previously infected while recording no further cases of transmission,"" Italian health officials Antonio Cassone and Andrea Crisanti wrote in the Guardian newspaper. Crisanti, a professor of microbiology at the University of Padua who led the experiment, spoke to As It Happens host Carol Off. Here is part of their conversation.What is the situation in Vò? Is the virus still contained there?Yes. The good news is that we haven't had new cases in Vò since we did the last survey. There was one case, but it was a relative of an infected person that was living in the same household. So that's quite, let's say, expected that these people are at very high risk. You're surrounded by parts of Italy that had a drastic infection. So how did you do it? What is the secret that Vò had that the others didn't?The secret is that, first of all, Vò was the first place where the epidemic started. And on that occasion, the city was locked down, and everybody was tested. So what happened [was] we could identify from the very beginning all those that were in the position to transmit the disease to others. They were isolated. Then nine days after, we did a second survey. We identified another eight people that were all asymptomatic. And then we put them in isolation as well.So what's different between what you're doing and what, say, we're doing here or other places are doing? We're having a lot of ... isolation [and] places are locking down. They are not testing everybody that's in that locked-down place. And so, how important was that testing to the success that you've had?We believe that that was crucial because we could identify all the people with the potential to transmit. They were isolated. And, in principle, they couldn't transmit the disease to others. Now, if you do only the lockdown, [that] can not necessarily lead to complete suppression of the disease. I want to draw a comparison. If you remember the Diamond Princess. They started with few cases. They did the tests only to those [who] were symptomatic. So you develop a symptom, you test positive, you were taken out of the ship. But day by day, cases, if you remember, they increased up to more than 700. So in this way, they couldn't stop the disease. That couldn't stop the disease in spite of the fact that they were isolated, they were kind of quarantined. And the reason why they couldn't stop it is because the ship was full of asymptomatic people that [were] spreading the virus. This is a very interesting comparison, because on one hand, you have a community of 3,000 people living in a small village, which was locked down. On another hand, you have a ship with a community, again, about 3,000 people, which was locked down. [When you started this in February], the protocol was that you tested people only if they … were returning from a foreign place, or from China, or if they had symptoms. ... You ignored that and went to everybody.Yeah, we ignored that because we weren't convinced that the disease was transmitted only by symptomatic individuals. We found this quite implausible. And so this is the reason why we tested everybody.You're talking about a town, Vò, of 3,000 people. Is it possible to turn that model, to do what you did in Vò, to a much larger population? Entire regions of Italy, or regions of Canada? What has been done in Vò, it proved to be extremely effective at the beginning of the infection. So if you have a cluster of cases, then the best thing to do is to lock down the place, stand still, and test everybody. Especially at the beginning of the infection, that's the best thing you can do.Now, when the epidemic is more widespread, then ... you have to combine several measures. Because at that point, you fight on several fronts. You have to deal with people that are healed. You need to have a hospital resuscitation unit. You need to implement quarantine, which unfortunately can never be 100 per cent because people have to go out to buy food, to buy medicines.But if you do active surveillance, let's say, around the people that are present with symptoms, rather than leaving them home and making no tests, I think what you should do [is] go home to their place, make the test, make the test to the relatives, make the test to friends and family, and to the neighborhood. If you do this systematically, you can then beat the disease. If you could give some advice to us in Canada from the mistakes and the learnings that you had in Italy, what would you tell us?I would suggest you do not underestimate. You act aggressively around each single case and cluster. If you have a couple of cases in a condo, you lock down the entire condo and you test everybody. If you have a few cases in a neighborhood, then you lock down the neighborhood, and you test everybody.That's the way to do it. Written by Sheena Goodyear with files from Reuters.

729,The world could face a 2nd wave of COVID-19: Here's what Canada needs to do now to prepare | CBC News,"Countries must prepare for a second wave of the COVID-19 outbreak to emerge once social distancing measures are eased, and they should only lift those measures gradually, infectious disease experts say. Here's what you need to know about a potential second wave and what Canada can do to minimize the impact.",2020-03-24T08:00:38.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/canada-covid-19-second-wave-1.5507522,"Canada and other countries must prepare for a second wave of the COVID-19 outbreak to emerge once social distancing measures are eased, and they should only lift those measures gradually, infectious disease experts say.A second wave of an outbreak is an increase in infections that occurs after a sustained period of time when there are no — or very few — new cases of that illness, said Dr. Isaac Bogoch, a Toronto General Hospital Research Institute clinical investigator, who specializes in infectious diseases.""Essentially, what we have now is physical distancing measures in place as one of a multi-pronged approach to curb the Canadian epidemic,"" said Bogoch. ""Now, of course, we cannot sustain these physical distancing measures for an infinite period of time.… They're tough on the individual level, they're tough for communities, they're tough for businesses, tough for kids.""The good news is that Canada has the opportunity to learn from countries where the epidemic started months earlier by observing how public health measures in those places work to keep the case load from bubbling up again once people start to emerge from their homes and go about business as usual, he said.Places in East Asia are facing a second wave of the virus now. For instance, on Friday, Hong Kong recorded its biggest daily jump in cases since the pandemic started, though mostly connected to infected travellers, who are returning from abroad after being prevented from going home before.Dr. Theresa Tam, Canada's chief public health officer, warned last week that ""this virus is going to be with us for some time. It will not be eradicated from the world in months.""""We will need to be prepared for another wave, potentially.""Like Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan, Canada will also experience its own second wave after seeing initial success containing the virus through the social distancing measures currently in place, Bogoch believes.""When we start to lift those measures in the months down the line, are we going to start to see a rebound of the virus? The answer is most certainly yes. We probably will see, to some extent, a greater number of cases as people mingle again as life slowly returns to normal.""Several modelling studies have been conducted to explore how effective social distancing is at dampening disease spread, said Bogoch, and almost all show that when the reins are eventually loosened, cases will tick up again.But he said there are steps we can take to minimize the extent of a second wave.""The hope is that we can slowly lift these measures, rather than have them completely lifted, and we can control the rebound of the virus such that it does not cause a situation where we overwhelm our health-care system and negate everything that we've done for the past few months.""The key will be to change social distancing policies ""very slowly and carefully,"" he said.Eleanor Fish, a professor of immunology at the University of Toronto whose research group conducted treatment studies during the 2003 outbreak of SARS in Toronto, said a true second wave of an outbreak involves new community transmissions, not just sick returning travellers who are swiftly moved into quarantine.She said countries like China, where new cases are also travel-related, could face a second round of the outbreak but are ""nowhere near"" that territory yet.Fish also said she believes a second wave is ""unlikely to happen here.""""We haven't locked down our borders to Canadians. So any of those who might want to return, are returning. We're asking them to self-isolate for 14 days."" That means Canada is less likely than other countries who shut their borders to citizens to have cases shoot up again upon their return.Fish said she's optimistic that the government is listening to the scientific community and learning from places, like Italy, by preparing for a surge of severe cases by doing things like securing more ventilators. She also said she was buoyed by progress of research groups testing various forms of treatment.""The public needs to be reassured that there's a lot coming up that's going to be very positive.""Jason Kindrachuk, an assistant professor at the University of Manitoba's department of medical microbiology, said that during the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic, there was both a second wave and a small third wave of the outbreak.But he said Canada can prepare now for a second wave of COVID-19 illnesses in a number of different ways.It can improve the supply of personal protective equipment for front-line health-care workers, as well as the materials needed for testing, both of which have already been a challenge in the first phase of the epidemic, said Kindrachuk, who holds a Canada Research Chair in emerging viruses.And although little is known yet about the seasonality of the virus and how much immunity people will have after recovering from the illness, Canada can look to the nations that are months ahead of it in the progression of the pandemic.""We can learn from what those countries do in terms of when they start reducing the requirements for social distancing to help guide our own procedures and time frame for doing that so we don't see spikes in increased transmission.""The true long-term strategy, said Bogoch, is the creation of an effective vaccination, ""which we know is more than a year away.""""But for now, we just have to put up with the physical distancing measures.""",0.14131019639494213,0.38655501748722076

737,Street art festival boosts LGBT visibility in Vancouver's Chinatown | CBC News,Curator Paul Wong and artist Kendall Yan speak about the resistance they've faced in the neighbourhood while promoting the annual celebration since 2018.,2020-08-08T21:27:59.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/street-art-festival-lgbt-chinatown-1.5679091,"Pride in Chinatown is celebrating its third anniversary and, unlike the Vancouver Pride Parade and other major events across the Lower Mainland, the event is not going online because of the COVID-19 pandemic.""The idea of Pride in Chinatown [is] to have a presence,"" said Paul Wong, the artistic director and curator of the month-long street art festival.The festival features eight artists' projects scattered throughout the neighbourhood, meant to promote the inclusion of LGBT people in the community. ""Chinatown has been segregated through discrimination and racism and fear. Chinatown has evolved from being very conservative and being very repressed ... and homophobic,"" Wong said to Stephen Quinn, host of CBC's The Early Edition.Most of the festival's artworks are displayed at a single location. But artist Kendell Yan's creation Quarantine is a bit different — with several locations across Chinatown. The drag performer — whose stage name is Maiden China and who has family ties to Chinatown — turned one of her Instagram self-portraits into a poster and put it up at multiple locations across the neighbourhood.""It's very pleasing for my ego,"" Yan said about seeing her face all over Chinatown.The project began after she uploaded 41 portraits to the photo-sharing platform while stuck at home during the height of the pandemic, one photo per day. But what came after was an unpleasant experience.Yan initially wanted to display all 41 of her self-portraits on a storefront. She approached three businesses near her studio, but said the responses were disappointing.""People are very hesitant to give space that's very visible, in the fear that someone is going to vandalize their business,"" she said.""That is a very homophobic thing in and of itself.""Wong faced similar resistance when he dispatched volunteers asking business associations and community service organizations to put ""Pride in Chinatown"" stickers on their doorways and windows. ""It's been an interesting way to see that kind of embracing or resistance to being queer out loud and proud in Chinatown,"" said Wong.On Saturday, community organization Youth Collaborative for Chinatown had an anonymous artist present a floral installation at the Millennium Gate as a tribute to people of different races and sexualities. Good morning, <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/ChinatownYVR?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#ChinatownYVR</a>!

742,Why health experts advise cancelling cruises amid coronavirus | CBC News,"Experts warn that cruise liners pose special danger as the coronavirus crisis worsens, and call on the industry to rethink ship design.",2020-03-10T08:00:58.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/coronavirus-cruise-warnings-1.5491789,"The coronavirus outbreak on the cruise ship Diamond Princess started with a single passenger who came aboard in late January with a slight cough, and then developed a fever shortly after disembarking, six days later. By the time doctors in Japan started testing the remaining passengers and crew on Feb. 3, there were 10 cases. After a 14-day quarantine, that number ballooned to 619, with seven resulting deaths so far.  A new study modelling the onboard outbreak, published in the Journal of Travel Medicine, reaches some sobering conclusions about how much worse — or better — things might have gone.In the early stages of the shipboard epidemic, the rate of infection on the Diamond Princess was four times higher than in Wuhan, China, the epicentre of what has now become a global outbreak. Left unchecked, the disease would have eventually touched 79 per cent of those on board, some 2,900 people, the Swedish researchers calculate. However, if all passengers and crew had been relocated, assessed and, where necessary, isolated when the first 10 cases were discovered, the outbreak might have been limited to a total of 76 people, they say. The difference was the boat. ""The cruise ship conditions clearly amplified an already highly transmissible disease,"" the epidemiologists write. Doctors have long known that it doesn't take much to turn a pleasure cruise into a ship of sickness. Passengers and crew are regularly laid-low by influenza, food poisoning or gastrointestinal viruses like Norwalk. Over the past decade, cruise companies operating out of U.S. ports alone have reported an average of almost 3,200 such illnesses each year. But the coronavirus outbreaks aboard the Diamond Princess — and now its Carnival Cruises sister ship, the Grand Princess, where 21 people and counting have been diagnosed with COVID-19 — show how the close quarters of onboard life have become potentially life-threatening. The current generation of massive, floating luxury hotels — some of them ferrying more than 6,000 passengers, from all over the world, each voyage — can function like a Petri dish, creating the perfect environment for the spread of a plague.""Cruise ships really provide a fairly unique situation because you take a large group of people and you confine them to a rather limited space, and really you rely on excellent hand hygiene and infection-control measures to be in place to prevent infections from spreading very widely,"" said Dr. Abdu Sharkawy, an infectious disease specialist with the University Health Network and associate professor at the University of Toronto. Unlike airplanes, where a majority of passengers tend to originate from one region or country, cruise ships host travellers from all corners of the world. And while plane passengers share a confined space for a few hours, people aboard ships are in close quarters for days, if not weeks.On Monday, Canada's Chief Public Health Officer Dr. Theresa Tam, asked Canadians to ""think twice about being on cruise ships."" The U.S. Centers for Disease Control has similarly recommended that all travellers — and most particularly those with underlying health issues — ""defer"" cruise vacations for the foreseeable future. Sharkawy says, as March break approaches, vacationers need to ""use common sense"" and look at what has already happened on the high seas. ""If I had a cruise booked, I would frankly cancel it,"" he said. ""You just don't have that degree of control, you don't have that amount of flexibility when you're stuck on a vessel with 3,000, or 4,000, or more, other passengers and you're kind at the mercy of the local authorities.""Ross Klein, a sociologist at Memorial University in St. John's, has been studying the cruise industry for more than two decades, tracking outbreaks and other on-board problems. He says the cruise companies have developed a fairly workable strategy to deal with things like stomach bugs and the flu, with illnesses hitting just a tiny fraction of the 30 million passengers they carried globally in 2019. But that playbook clearly isn't working for COVID-19.""I think the coronavirus caught them by surprise and I think they just weren't sure what to do,"" says Klein. ""It's almost like being caught like deer in the headlights.""Klein says that part of the problem might be that a modest amount of sickness has traditionally been a money-maker for cruise companies. ""There's a revenue stream that comes from illness, not just the cost stream,"" he explains. On-board health care isn't free. ""U.S. physician prices, you know? I mean, $150 for an office visit. And if you need drugs, you've got to pay too … The doctor gets a commission, and the ship makes money, and everybody's happy. Except for the passenger who doesn't have insurance.""Over the weekend, the Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA), an industry body, unveiled a coronavirus action plan, which will deny boarding to people who have visited or travelled from South Korea, Iran or China, or anyone who has come in contact with a COVID-19 patient within the past 14 days. All passengers will also have their temperatures taken as they embark, with those showing a fever above 38 C referred for secondary screening. CBC NewsWhether such measures will be sufficient to protect cruise passengers, who tend to skew older — one-third of all who sail are aged 60 or above, the age group most at risk from COVID-19 — remains to be seen. The CLIA did not respond to a request for an interview. And the three major ocean cruise companies — Carnival, Royal Caribbean and Norwegian — all declined to provide CBC News on-board access to document their cleaning and coronavirus control measures. Some experts say the coronavirus crisis points to a need to reimagine the spaces where we work, play and travel, and to start adapting them for 21st century, global health challenges.""We have to think beyond the everyday experiences. We have to anticipate risks and respond to threats,"" said Lindsay Tan, who studies how pathogens and people intersect as director of the Design Ecology Lab at Auburn University in Alabama. ""So that's both the shape of spaces, how big they are, how many people are going to be in them, how they're going to be used, but also the materials that we're using. Different materials have different properties that carry different loads of virus; properties that are easier to clean.""For cruise companies that may mean challenging consumers' definition of ""high-end"" and moving from fabric finishes to surfaces that can be more easily cleaned. ""If I told you that your cruise ship was going to have a vinyl headboard you might not think that sounds really luxurious, but I assure you there are properties that we can put into vinyl now that allow it to be comfortable, luxurious and safe,"" says Tan. ""We're already doing it in health-care spaces. You can have a seat that is beautiful and comfortable, and it's also able to be washed down with bleach."" The cruise industry is trying its best to weather the storm, by waiving cancellation fees and penalties, and offering full credit for passengers who agree to rebook for future voyages. Klein predicts that major PR campaigns and deep discounts will soon follow, in an effort to quell public fears.That's what has worked with past outbreaks of lesser illnesses. But with lives on the line, convincing people that it is safe to sail, might be a much tougher sell.""It could be years and years before people have confidence,"" said Klein.",0.0,0.4582973620356799

The NBA, in a call with teams earlier Monday, stressed that the move is not to ban reporters but to ensure the safety of players and staff in those areas.The statement, in part, read: ""Given the issues that can be associated with close contact in pre- and post-game settings, all team locker rooms and clubhouses will be open only to players and essential employees of teams and team facilities until further notice. Media access will be maintained in designated locations outside of the locker room and clubhouse setting.""The changes, which the leagues say are temporary, will begin Tuesday — though some NHL teams began putting them into use this past weekend. The NBA said interviews with players would continue in different settings, stressing a gap of some two metres between reporters and interview subjects.For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia.The vast majority of people recover from the new virus. According to the World Health Organization, people with mild illness recover in about two weeks, while those with more severe illness may take three to six weeks to recover. In mainland China, where the virus first exploded, more than 80,000 people have been diagnosed and more than 58,000 have so far recovered.The NBA has calls with team medical staffs scheduled for later Monday night and a call between league officials and team owners scheduled for Wednesday to discuss next steps. The NBA told teams last week to prepare for the possibility of playing games in empty arenas, something the game's biggest star — Los Angeles Lakers forward LeBron James — insists he does not want to see.More than 113,000 people worldwide have tested positive for the disease and over 3,900 people with the virus have died, most of them in China. More than 62,000 people have already recovered. The virus has infected 600 people in the United States — including the director of the agency that runs the airports in New York and New Jersey — and at least 26 have died, most in Washington state.The Pro Basketball Writers Association quickly responded to the leagues' announcement by saying its membership ""believes the safety of fans, players, team employees, arena workers and the media who cover the league must be protected. Our thoughts are with all people who already have been adversely impacted by the virus.""Therefore, we understand the NBA's decision to temporarily close locker rooms to everyone but players and essential team personnel with the NBA's promise that once the coronavirus crisis abates, the league will restore full access to the journalists who cover the league.""",0.1769230769230769,0.4903846153846153

The S&P/TSX composite index was down by almost 400 points, or more than 2.5 per cent, nearing midday, as health-care, energy, mining, banks and even tech sectors were all lower.Losses began in Asia as soon as trading opened for the week, and they accelerated in Europe on worries about the possibility of tougher restrictions there to stem rising coronavirus counts. In New York, the broad S&P 500 was down by 84 points, or 2.5 per cent, while the Dow Jones fared even worse, down almost 1,000 points, or 3.5 per cent. See the most recent numbers here.Bank stocks had sharp losses Monday morning after a report by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists alleged that several of them continue to profit from illicit dealings with criminal networks despite being previously fined for similar actions.Shares in technology companies have been on fire for the past six months, as pandemic lockdowns have caused booming demand for online services, such as Amazon, Netflix, Apple and Facebook. But tech companies have been selling off of late on fears that they have risen too far too fast. ""Stock markets around the world are trading lower to start the week amid mounting uncertainty,"" said Colin Cieszynski, chief market strategist with SIA Wealth Management in Toronto. ""Growing uncertainty and volatility in world markets has sparked a move of capital.""The NationalIN BRIEFPediatricians issue urgent call for help to get flu shot to more people this fallOntario pediatricians say their calls for the financial and logistical support needed to do more flu vaccinations during the COVID-19 pandemic have so far gone unheeded and an ""imminent crisis"" could lie ahead. ""We … would like to express our urgent concerns regarding an imminent crisis in influenza vaccination,"" said an online petition launched on Change.org Saturday by the pediatrics section of the Ontario Medical Association. ""Right now, Public Health seems to expect the status quo from years past, when individual doctor's offices and scattered flu clinics gave flu vaccines.""Public health officials and health-care experts have stressed the importance of getting the flu shot this year to avoid burdening the health-care system even more during the pandemic. Pediatricians say the coronavirus outbreak makes it more critical than ever for children to get flu shots, not only because influenza can make them very ill but also because they can easily spread the virus to vulnerable people, such as the elderly, for whom both flu and COVID-19 can be very dangerous.But health-care providers won't be able to give nearly the normal number of flu vaccinations in their offices and clinics this year, they say, because of COVID-19 safety protocols, such as eliminating crowded waiting rooms, seeing patients by appointment only, and the time needed for rigorous cleaning and disinfecting of exam rooms between each vaccination. The solution, they say, is ""planning large-scale, community-based provincewide flu vaccination clinics,"" which would be held in large venues that allow for physical distancing, as well as outdoor or drive-thru clinics. ""These would ensure that we can safely administer flu vaccine universally throughout the province in large numbers, quickly and efficiently,"" the petition says.People of colour make up 66% of Ottawa's COVID-19 casesRace-based data is confirming what some on the front lines of the COVID-19 pandemic have been saying for months — that the novel coronavirus affects communities of colour at a disproportionate rate. According to early data from Ottawa Public Health (OPH), 66 per cent of people who've tested positive for COVID-19 in Ottawa are ""racialized"" — which OPH defines as those who are Black or of other non-white backgrounds. The term does not include people who identify as Indigenous. Only 25 per cent of Ottawa residents identified as being a visible minority in the 2016 census, according to Statistics Canada.""We know that there are systemic inequities for these communities,"" said Naini Cloutier, executive director of the Somerset West Community Health Centre, in an interview with CBC. ""With COVID, the cracks are becoming bigger, and you're seeing the very negative impact.""Cloutier revealed those numbers at a technical briefing last Wednesday with Ottawa councillors and public health officials. She also laid out the Ottawa Health Team's plan for minimizing the impact of COVID-19 in those communities. The strategy will address the specific health and socioeconomic factors that make people from non-white backgrounds, immigrants and newcomers more likely to catch COVID-19 and experience worse health outcomes. OPH started collecting race-based data in June to get a fuller picture of the impact of COVID-19 and the barriers some residents face accessing health care in Ottawa.Ontario reports highest number of new cases in more than 3 months; Quebec has most new cases since May Ontario reported an additional 425 cases of COVID-19 on Monday, the most on any single day in the past three-and-a-half months. Consistent with recent trends, the majority of new infections were concentrated in three public health units. Toronto saw 175 while Peel confirmed 84 and Ottawa 60.​​Health Minister Christine Elliott said in a series of tweets that about 67 per cent of cases in Monday's update are people under the age of 40. Further, 18 of the newly confirmed cases are what the province classifies as ""school-related."" There have now been a cumulative total of 90 student-related cases reported across Ontario since the new school year began.In Quebec, the province is seeing the start of a ""second wave"" of COVID-19 infections, according to public health director Dr. Horacio Arruda. Quebec reported 586 new cases, the highest daily increase since late May, when the first wave of infections began to taper off.At a news conference in Quebec City, Arruda said the increases in recent days have convinced him that the province has entered dangerous territory. ""The [epidemiological] curve is not like it was in spring, but I think it is the start of a second wave,"" Arruda said. ""If we want to have a normal Christmas, people need to co-operate. It's important.""Stay informed with the latest COVID-19 data from Canada and around the world.THE SCIENCEHospitalizations, deaths will follow Ontario's COVID-19 surge, but how many remains unclear The fresh spike in new COVID-19 cases in Ontario is not yet bringing an equivalent spike in hospitalizations or deaths from the coronavirus, but experts say it's too early to draw conclusions. Over the past week, as Premier Doug Ford and his government slapped new restrictions on private gatherings, Ontario reported an average of 335 new confirmed COVID-19 infections daily, about two-thirds of them in people under 40. That's triple the pace of the last week of August.So far, the rise in hospitalizations is nowhere near as steep. There were 65 patients with confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Ontario hospitals as of Monday. The hospitalization rate hit its low ebb in the third week of August, with a daily average of 38 patients in beds around the province. However, hospitalizations and deaths are what epidemiologists call ""lagging indicators"" of the impact of a pandemic: you don't see those numbers rising until well after the infections were transmitted.But that's no reason to take the current spike in cases casually, according to the experts. ""The issue with this infection is that it's really, really contagious,"" said Dr. Isaac Bogoch, infectious disease physician at Toronto General Hospital.""It doesn't stay restricted to a single age cohort for long,"" he said. ""Unfortunately, I think we're starting to see some early trends of this spreading beyond the 20-year-old age group and into older age groups.""Ontario's surging number of new coronavirus cases is not just a function of increased testing, as some skeptics have claimed. The province completed an average of around 25,600 tests per day in August. Over the past week, that average daily testing number was up by 32 per cent. The average number of confirmed new COVID-19 cases has accelerated far more quickly. On Sept. 1, the daily number of new cases (based on a five-day average) was running at 121. That doubled by Sept. 12. It tripled by Sept. 18.Another sign that has the medical community worried about what's to come is Ontario's rising test positivity rate. That's the percentage of people tested whose results show a confirmed case of COVID-19. Over the past week, the positivity rate was 0.99 per cent. That's double the rate of late August, and triple the rate of early August.AND FINALLY...Struck by loneliness of seniors in pandemic, N.B. student launches program that pairs university students with seniors At 85, Brenda Trafford is well known along the southeastern part of New Brunswick for her colourful outfits, yellow car and bright jewelry. She is a tireless volunteer and a prolific maker of crafts. But even for a self-described ""active senior,"" COVID-19 restrictions have been tough. ""I do have my days when I'm at home and have been there for too long and haven't seen a single soul, and it does get gloomy,"" said Trafford.Enter Hannah Crouse, a third-year student at Mount Allison University in Sackville, whose eyes were opened in the spring to the needs of seniors like Trafford. Crouse was working with community groups, and one of her first assignments was delivering food to seniors in and around Port Elgin. Crouse found loneliness at every stop. ""It was every senior that I visited, and I mean every single senior that I visited,"" she told CBC News.That night, Crouse came up with the idea for her program that pairs university students with seniors. The goal is for the students to visit their seniors once a week and share a meal while remaining physically distanced. Crouse put out a call on social media for student volunteers from Mount Allison, then invited the seniors and students to a garden party earlier this summer. She played the role of matchmaker and paired 18 seniors with 20 students. Crouse said many friendships have blossomed, including her own friendship with Trafford.""We chatted a lot; we compared tattoos,"" Trafford said. ""I was hers, and she was mine, and that was it."" The feeling was mutual. Crouse said she immediately decided, ""Oh my gosh, I'm stealing Brenda.""Find out more about COVID-19Still looking for more information on the pandemic?

But sometimes, we have reason to keep quiet. This week, Piya explores what leads people to silence themselves... and what impact that can have on us all.Here are the stories from this week's episode...'It's just better for me to stay silent': Doctor feels unable to voice abortion views at work, in communityA doctor who we've agreed not to name says she's personally against abortion, partially because of her faith, and chooses not to offer such services as an OBGYN. But she also says abortion services are central to women's health and believes in the right to obtain them. As she tells Piya, she rarely talks about either of these stances - her faith at work or her support of abortion services among her faith community - because of the stigma she feels her beliefs hold in those contexts.Vancouver woman tries to come to grips with losing all communication with her family in ChinaDilnur Kurban came to Vancouver from China as an international student in 2011. Her family is Uighur, a persecuted Muslim minority group in China. They wanted to limit communication with her for a time, fearing that speaking to a foreign family member could lead to them being placed in detention camps. At first, Dilnur agreed and also never spoke of the situation to others. But now that she's lost complete contact with her family, she tells Piya why she's breaking her silence.Why one woman initially chose to tell no one about her plan to donate a kidneyAfter she turned 50, Leah Hager Cohen decided to donate her kidney.

But with travel restrictions limiting entry to Canada, that number is expected to fall to about 90 this fall.The federal government only allows entry to international students who received their study permits prior to March 18, under an order in council.""It's essentially a seventh [of] what we're used to seeing, so it's a pretty significant drop in numbers — financially as well,"" said Megan Stymiest, the director of policy, finance and legal counsel.As a provincial government-owned company, Atlantic Education International operates under the Department of Education and Early Childhood Development. It was created in 1997 to market and sell educational programs abroad, including the New Brunswick International Student Program.The company also sells the New Brunswick school curriculum to private schools in China.International high school students are a big source of revenue for the province. In 2018-19, the program generated about $10.4 million for the New Brunswick economy, including stipends paid to host families.Students come from 22 countries around the world. Those who study for a full school year pay about $20,000 for tuition, housing, health insurance and other fees. After covering Atlantic Education International's operating expenses, revenue flows to New Brunswick public schools and districts. Stymiest could not say what portion ultimately goes to schools.Families house the international students during their studies, but most will not meet until after 14 days of self-isolation. While many students from last semester stayed in the province to avoid travel restrictions, most recent arrivals will complete their quarantine at motels, hotels and other commercial accommodations.Students have recently arrived from Vietnam, China, South Korea and Italy. Under public health requirements, they are transported directly to their isolation accommodations and will be tested on the 10th day in quarantine.Stymiest said that finding hosts has not been a challenge during the pandemic. ""The host family piece of our program is really the pillar of what we do,"" she said. ""And having all of these families in every corner of the province that are really committed and really dedicated to the students is what sets us apart from all of the other programs across Canada.""High schools students will be spending every other day at home doing online learning. It's a change the program is making sure hosts are prepared for — but the reduced classroom time hasn't deterred people from coming. The program has grown exponentially the past few years. This past school year, more than 800 international students were in the province over both semesters.""In the beginning, students would come usually for one semester, and it was just for an experience,"" Symiest said. ""But in recent years we've seen students coming for full years and sometimes coming for Grade 11 and 12.""Some similar programs across Canada were forced to entirely close during the COVID-19 pandemic. ""We're hopeful that perhaps we may see some more students second semester,"" she said.""I think we'll bounce back quite quickly provided that travel restrictions dissipate and families are willing to send their children.""",0.11067084782248714,0.39230203312170525

As many as 373 Canadians have requested evacuation, but the number, according to officials and senior cabinet ministers, is a moving target. The chartered aircraft will fly to the Canadian military air base in Trenton, Ont.Foreign Affairs Minister François-Philippe Champagne revealed late Wednesday that the U.S. had offered up space for a ""handful"" of Canadians on one of its charter evacuation flights, which is due to leave Wuhan Tianhe International Airport shortly after the Canadian aircraft departs.The American plane will stop in Vancouver ""where Canadian passengers will disembark for onward travel to CFB Trenton, where they will be subject to the same processes as those Canadians travelling on the Canadian flight."" Champagne said. The federal government is considering a second chartered flight should more Canadian request repatriation.Health Minister Patty Hajdu has conceded the federal government was initially caught off guard and had ""a slow start in terms of organizing"" the evacuation plane. ""We didn't have an understanding of the number of people that needed assistance,"" she said.  ""As we communicated more [with people in the region] about the need to register and let us know, our numbers shot up rather dramatically.""PoliticsThe government has only a sketchy idea of the number of Canadians in China's Hubei province, which is the epicentre of the outbreak. Collecting information was also apparently hampered by the absence of a consulate in the area, senior government officials said on background. In addition, the Chinese government is apparently only allowing evacuation flights in and out of Wuhan at night because their own relief and quarantine efforts take place during the day. The Canadian government also said Wednesday that bad weather further delayed the flight. The United States, Japan, South Korea, Jordan, Britain, Portugal, Bangladesh, Egypt, Thailand and Indonesia have all gotten at least evacuation flights out of Wuhan.Hajdu said those countries have not faced the same challenges, mostly because ""they had a better sense"" of where and how many of their citizens were in the affected area.Chinese health authorities are set to screen each individual passenger and no one who is sick — or displays symptoms -— will be allowed to board the chartered aircraft. There will be a six-person Canadian military medical team on-board the aircraft who will conduct further screening and monitor the condition of the passengers.CBC NewsMaj.-Gen. Andrew Downes, the surgeon general of the Canadian Forces, told the House of Commons health committee Wednesday that the team will be wearing masks and protection and will offer the same to evacuees. ""Our medical team that deployed last weekend took with them an extensive array of personal protective equipment, including, masks, gowns gloves, face shields, et cetera,"" Downes testified. ""Should one of the passengers manifest symptoms that would be consistent with coronavirus during the flight, they will be isolated, so much as is possible, in the aircraft and they will be required to wear full protective equipment.""He insisted it will be the same level of protection as one sees in a hospital.The evacuees will be quarantined there for two weeks. Maj.-Gen. Trevor Cadieu, who is in charge of the military's strategic joint staff, told the Commons health committee that individuals and families will have their own quarters at the base's Yukon Lodge and will be sequestered from all military personnel and the outside world.During the quarantine period, ""they'll have an opportunity to move about in that very local area but they will not be mingling,"" Cadieau said.Canada Border Service Agency officials will meet the plane at the ramp upon arrival and Ontario health officials will conduct further medical tests, he said.In addition, if the federal government organizes further flights, Cadieu said the military is ""conducting a stocktaking of all infrastructure accommodations at Canadian Forces bases throughout Canada"" in case Trenton becomes full.   ",-0.009935897435897435,0.41346153846153844

He said they were tested prior to being purchased.AHS reiterated its stance in a statement to CBC News on Thursday, almost identical to a statement it released on April 22.""All PPE purchased and provided by AHS is approved for medical use and meets health-care standards,"" the Thursday statement said.""AHS has worked with the suppliers to have the nose pieces adjusted and the length of the mask [from nose to chin] increased for a better fit. These changes will be in place for the next shipment to AHS.""Alberta mask issues a matter of personal preference, official saysIn the meantime, AHS recommends that doctors can compress the entire edge of the mask containing the nose piece in a 'W' shape to help the fit across the nose, and adding a face shield for extra protection.AHS says it is confident it can resolve the issues that have been identified and that it has created a quality control group to field test any new models or products.That's not good enough for Julyan-Gudgeon.""The government, in the form AHS media, has stated that they are meeting a standard,"" he said. ""Then when you challenge them on it they send you links as to how to wear the mask … but they seem to shy away from any discussion of the exact performance standards."" Julyan-Gudgeon believes AHS is only focusing on esthetics.""They're not getting the point that the actual protection performance of these masks are, by an established protocol, already substandard,"" he said.He said he wants the government to be more transparent about understanding the standards and then to follow through on delivering those standards.",0.0,0.3521070075757575

""They worry about getting infected with the coronavirus.""The outbreak originated in Wuhan, China, and has since infected over 74,000 people in that country and another 924 worldwide, according to an update Wednesday from the World Health Organization (WHO).That includes passengers who were aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship in the Japanese port of Yokohama.The decline in cruise ship bookings comes as Canadian airlines have cancelled most flights to China and the government has issued a travel warning for the country, exacerbating the situation for travel agents like Le who focus on Asia.A total of 621 passengers from the Diamond Princess are now infected, including 57 Canadians. It's the largest cluster of cases outside China, the WHO has said.Passengers who tested negative for coronavirus began to disembark Wednesday after a two-week quarantine that infectious disease experts have criticized for doing more harm than good.Le said her customers have expressed fears of being caught in a similar situation.""When you get on a cruise ship that means you get trapped in there, and you cannot leave,"" Le said.In another case, the MS Westerdam sailed from port to port in Asia seeking to offload passengers, only to be denied at each one.Finally, the government of Cambodia allowed it to dock in Sihanoukville.One passenger who disembarked tested positive for the respiratory illness caused by the virus, which is officially known as COVID-19.Wen Jin, sales manager at Midearth Travel, which specializes in all-inclusive packages to China, said anxiety among potential cruise-goers extends beyond those travelling to Asia.Jin also organizes flight and cruise packages to the Caribbean in partnership with Sunwing Airlines. She said she hasn't received any new bookings for cruises since Jan. 15.Instead, Jin said she's been dealing mainly with cancellations and refunds, which has been eating into her commission.""I work double,"" Jin said. ""One time it's to buy the cruise, the other time it's to refund the cruise. So I work two hours, but I get nothing.""Jin said one family who had a cruise booked for Feb. 8 leaving from Miami, Fla., cancelled after they heard about an incident on a New Jersey cruise ship.In that case, the Royal Caribbean's Anthem of the Seas was delayed at its departure port over fears that four people had coronavirus.While the people later tested negative, the scare was enough for the family to decide the risk wasn't worth it, Jin said.""They are afraid off being stopped inside of the ship, so they cancelled the trip,"" she said.Jin said other families were forced to cancel and refund their trips when some cruise lines adopted policies barring people with Chinese, Hong Kong or Macau passports from their ships.The situation is not the same at all agencies.Mohinder Hona, general manager of Honda Travel, said his cruise vacation business has not been impacted so far.""Obviously, that is a concern right now, but it hasn't really stopped people from booking cruises because everyone knows that this is not something that is going to last forever,"" Honda said.Honda pointed out that people often book cruises months, if not years in advance.A spokesperson for the Association of Canadian Travel Agencies said the industry group is in the process of surveying its members to assess trends in light of the coronavirus outbreak, but won't have results until next week.",0.0,0.37472170686456396
826,Chinese students trying to recoup thousands of dollars from Canadian homestay providers they say misled them | CBC News,A group of students from China and their parents say they're trying to recoup thousands of dollars from a family of homestay providers in Canada who promised a level of service they didn't deliver.,2020-01-06T09:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/international-students-china-homestay-toronto-british-columbia-1.5402622,"Several Chinese international students are warning others about a pair of homestay providers thousands of kilometres apart who they allege are taking advantage of young newcomers moving to Canada for high school. CBC News has spoken with seven students from China and their parents who allege the mother-daughter pair lied about the living conditions in their homes in Toronto and Burnaby, B.C., and broke the terms of their room-and-board contracts.The students described similar experiences of moving into a situation that was not as advertised, including seeing their hosts eat steak after feeding the teens hot dogs and leftovers and discovering that what they had been told would be a short walk to and from school would actually take hours each day.Many of the students are now trying to recoup thousands of dollars after moving out early.""I want my money back, and I don't want any other students to go through what my daughter did,"" said Li Limei, the mother of a teenager who lived at the homestay in Toronto. In the summer of 2018, Li started scouring the internet for housing for her 15-year-old daughter, Angel An, who was to start Grade 10 at Loretto Abbey Catholic Secondary School in Toronto that fall. ""I wanted Angel to get a head start at a Canadian high school,"" Li said in Mandarin, during a video interview on the WeChat app from her home in Beijing. She hoped finishing high school in Toronto would boost her child's chances of getting accepted into a Canadian university.Angel was preparing to join the annual influx of tens of thousands of Chinese students to Canada whose parents share that hope.In 2019, there were almost 70,000 Chinese international students of elementary school, high school and university age in Canada — up by about 10,000 from five years ago, according to Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada.The sharp increase has fuelled the business of housing students.Li easily found housing for Angel through WeChat, a popular place for Chinese families, homestay providers and settlement agencies that help people find homestays to make connections. She said a woman named Fiona Liu saw her post to the homestay group and offered to host Angel. Li said she made it clear she did not want her teen daughter sharing a house with male students and the home had to be pet-free because of her daughter's allergies to cats and dogs. ""Fiona promised she only accepts girls, that there were no male students,"" said Li. The contract Li signed stipulated there would be no pets. Li was satisfied when she got a first-hand look inside the detached three-storey house when she helped Angel move in August 2018. CBC News reviewed Li's rental agreement, which showed she paid $20,800 for a year's rent before Angel moved in.Within a month, Angel called her mother to say Liu had a dog and a male student had moved in. Li immediately contacted the homestay provider saying her daughter couldn't live with male students or dogs. She said Liu didn't listen and even brought home a second dog a few months later. Angel's mom said her daughter's asthma flared up and she developed allergic dermatitis.Because of the stress of her living situation, Angel dropped out of school in May and moved back to China, four months before her homestay contract was up.""I regret it so much,"" said Li. ""It really affected my daughter."" Li has since been trying to get about $8,000 in rent and deposit money back because she argues Liu broke the terms of the contract. Despite trying to contact Liu multiple times, Li said the homeowner has not answered her.""To this day, she hasn't returned my money,"" she said. CBC News reached out to Liu through email and phone calls, but she has not responded. On a visit to Liu's Toronto house in October, CBC spoke with several Chinese international students who confirmed she was hosting them.A teenage girl who had been living there for four months said her experience has been positive. However, her male housemate's room does not have a door. She said there's just a carpet hanging over it. On a subsequent visit to the house in December, a man who several students confirmed is Liu's husband, spoke with CBC News outside the house. He refused to identify himself or confirm whether Liu or any international students live there. But, when asked why Liu would allow male students into the house when she had said there would only be females, he said such an arrangement would be nonsensical in the real world. ""Can you segregate men and women on the TTC, for example?"" he said in Mandarin, referring to Toronto's public transit system. The seven families with whom CBC spoke found accommodation for their children either with Liu in Toronto or with her daughter, Tiff Lei, in Burnaby, B.C.All seven have attempted to get refunds — that add up to about $40,000 — but they allege the pair either stall, send cheques that bounce or don't respond at all.CBC News tried to call, email and text Lei about the allegations. The calls went to voice mail each time. A response to a text said it was the wrong number, even though the families verified the number belongs to Lei. Oswald Li, 19, said he's trying to get back his $1,400 damage deposit from Lei. He and another Chinese student lived with her in Burnaby for six months before moving out in February 2019. He described the experience as a ""nightmare."" He said he was promised three nutritious meals a day but was often fed beef jerky, french fries and hot dogs. He said much of the food wasn't fresh. Sometimes, after he finished eating, he would see Lei enjoying a steak for dinner, he said. Photos on a now-defunct website advertising the homestays in Toronto and Burnaby showed photos of chicken, cake and crab.When asked about the quality of the food, the man at the Toronto home told CBC News, ""You can't eat seafood every day.""After he moved out, Oswald Li said Lei gave him a cheque equalling the amount of his damage deposit. He said it bounced.""It was frustrating,"" he said. The parents, children and settlement agencies with whom CBC News spoke found each other by chance on WeChat and soon discovered they'd had similar experiences dealing with the same two people in Canada. They discovered Liu went by different names in her communication with different families. To Li Limei, she was ""Fiona Liu"" or ""Liu Jia."" To others, she was ""Gao Ling Qian."" CBC News confirmed through property records that both properties in Ontario and B.C. are owned by the same family. The director of a Beijing-based agency that helped settle Oswald Li and some other students in Canada told CBC News he feels betrayed by both the mother and daughter, with whom he placed students.""I feel angry, really, really angry. The students are young, and [Liu and Lei] lied to them,"" said Li Peng, director of CAEL Education Consulting, from his office in Beijing. He said Lei gave the families an address of a home closer to the students' school, but when they arrived in Burnaby, the teens were taken to a homestay farther away. In Toronto, Liu told some students their home was a five- to 15-minute walk to their schools. When they arrived, they realized the walk was closer to 90 minutes. All the students CBC News spoke with moved out early but not all have returned to China.Li Peng said his company and another settlement agency based in Shijiazhuang, China, that also worked with Lei in Burnaby, reimbursed the students themselves.He said he got back $9,000 from Liu after suggesting he would send friends of his to her house to collect.Both companies say they are still owed thousands of dollars.""We trusted [them],"" he said. ""It was our mistake.""Some of the parents who spoke with CBC News are considering legal action, but say it's tough because they live in China and are not able to navigate Canada's legal system from there. Li Peng said the family took advantage of young students who are alone in the country and don't have a support network or knowledge of how the legal system works. ""They don't have any other relatives in Canada,"" he said. ""They don't know how to protect themselves."" ",0.02292517006802721,0.37472170686456396
828,Doctors share concerns as ICUs brace for influx of patients due to coronavirus resurgence | CBC News,Intensive care physicians and nurses share their concerns as they brace for an influx of patients that threatens to overwhelm hospitals due to the resurgence of the coronavirus and the flu.,2020-10-29T08:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/covid-19-icu-canada-fall-1.5780468,"Intensive care physicians and nurses share their concerns as they brace for an influx of patients that threatens to overwhelm hospitals due to the resurgence of the coronavirus and the flu.When Canadians successfully flattened epidemic curves during the summer, the goal was to prevent hospitals and intensive care units from facing a crush of too many patients with COVID-19 all at once. Health officials wanted to avoid what happened in hospitals in New York City, where refrigerated trailers were used as temporary morgues.But the recent surge of new coronavirus cases in all provinces beyond Atlantic Canada has already thwarted surgery plans and led to the cancellation of surgeries such as hip replacements at one hospital in Toronto and postponements in Edmonton.Dr. Bram Rochwerg, an associate professor at McMaster University and critical care lead at the Juravinski Hospital in Hamilton, anticipates a surge of patients with COVID-19, and he worries they won't be able to accommodate them all as more surgeries resume.Unlike in the spring, beds and crucial staffing need to be reserved for medical and surgery patients, too. Traditionally, autumn in hospitals means scrambling for health-care workers such as nurses and respiratory therapists to backfill those sick with the cold and flu or who need to stay home to care for sick children.""We're all worried about it,"" Rochwerg said. ""You see the provincial [COVID-19] numbers creep up day by day. We see that critical care numbers [of ICU patients] creep up.""Rochwerg said that fortunately, the number of critically ill patients in Hamilton is currently in the single digits but that the trend is headed in the wrong direction. The challenge, he said, is to find a balance between adding restrictions to protect vulnerable populations such as residents in long-term care homes while preserving crucial aspects of society.Rochwerg also pointed to several lessons physicians worldwide have learned to help take better care of patients critically ill with COVID-19 during the resurgence.""We should treat them like we would any other patient,"" he said. ""Sometimes, you just need [to insert] a breathing tube.""When patients are on a ventilator, it takes the skilled hands of four to six hospital staff, including a respiratory therapist who regularly checks the breathing set up and tubing to ensure the airway is protected, as well as nurses to safely turn or ""prone"" them onto the stomach to improve ventilation.WATCH | Why trend in COVID-19 resurgence is concerning:NewsThe importance of getting patients up and out of bed, including those on ventilators when possible, as well as excellent nursing care and other day-to-day supportive care can't be minimized.""Supportive care is not the sexy part of it, but it's so crucial,"" Rochwerg said.It gives patients' bodies time to heal themselves, he said.Patty Tamlin, a registered nurse working in critical care at a hospital in Toronto's east end, said she's also concerned about the coming cold-and-flu season.""One of the biggest concerns is you may be overrun by patients,"" Tamlin said.Her message to Canadians? ""Tell everyone to get their flu shot.""In the spring, the Ontario government created more beds for patients needing long-term ventilated care at a rehabilitation hospital. Even if administrators find more space for more beds, adding temp agency nurses can only go so far, she said.""It's going to be a long time,"" Tamlin said. ""It's fatiguing … to have this constantly on our head all the time about COVID on top of our regular work.""Experience, though, has helped ICU staff to prepare for a resurgence of COVID-19 patients.""The more you do something, the more comfortable you are with going in and out of a room,"" for example, to perform CPR during a ""protected code blue"" for cardiac arrest when wearing full personal protective equipment, which can be exhausting. The masks, gowns and gloves need to be donned and removed carefully to avoid health-care workers contaminating themselves.Dr. Eddy Fan, medical director of the Extracorporeal Life Support (ECLS) program at Toronto's University Health Network, said the increase in COVID-19 cases so far is ""manageable.""Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is like an artificial heart and lung machine to support the sickest patients. People with COVID-19 who were intubated at hospitals across Ontario and didn't improve with conventional therapy were transported to Toronto General for ECMO. Still, Fan said, ""We're going to need to brace ourselves for another potential flood of very sick patients.""During the spring, patients were transferred to Toronto General, but family members could not visit. Fan said cutting off patients from their relatives harmed morale not only among loved ones, but it pained people working in the hospital, too.But influenza season also typically brings patients with lung failure who may need ECMO.""Their families ask questions like 'they're dying of the flu?'"" Fan said. ""COVID is no different as a viral infection. We see even young patients come with very severe lung failure requiring ECMO.""During Toronto's first wave of COVID-19, the team successfully treated a 22-year-old with ECMO.While respiratory failure from COVID-19 can resemble that of the flu, doctors say the scale is much larger.Dr. Gregory Haljan, head of Surrey Memorial Hospital's critical care department in British Columbia, said influenza has vaccines and medical treatments to shorten symptoms and improve death rates. COVID-19 doesn't, aside from corticosteroids for severe cases.When Haljan and his co-authors across the Lower Mainland looked at 117 people with COVID-19 who were admitted to ICU between Feb. 20 and April 17, they found the mortality rate ranged from one in six to one in 10.In comparison, the first studies from China and Italy showed mortality rates as high as one in two or one in three.Haljan credited having time to prepare, Dr. Bonnie Henry's ""outstanding"" leadership as the provincial health officer, the support of British Columbians, hard work and luck.""We never got overwhelmed,"" he said.To prevent being overwhelmed, Haljan said the hospital and its health region focused on basics, including:""It can be a challenge in that things change very, very slowly because safety is our primary focus,"" said Haljan, who works at one of the hospitals caring for among the highest volume of patients in the emergency department, according to the Canadian Institute for Health Information.""Research is how we keep change safe.""Haljan said that includes research not only on vaccines and drugs but also measuring patterns and assessing them in areas such as delivering health services.",0.0,0.5736735959076383

846,Four swimmers with Artistic Swimming Canada break silence about allegedly toxic environment | CBC News,Four members of Canada's artistic swimming team say there is a toxic environment at the Montreal training centre.,2020-10-19T22:23:25.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/swimmers-break-silence-artistic-swimming-canada-allegations-1.5768537,"Four members of Canada's artistic swimming team, training in Montreal, are speaking out about what they call a toxic environment.Last month, allegations of abuse and harassment from swimmers and people outside the program led to the shutdown of the senior national artistic swimming team's training centre, pending a review by an external firm.Due to their fear of reprisals, Radio-Canada has agreed to protect the swimmers' identities and to refer to them as Caroline, Sarah, Patricia and Rose.""It's been going on for too long within that organization,"" said Caroline. ""There is a toxic environment in artistic swimming.""According to the swimmers, the alleged incident that sparked last month's shutdown was troubling to several athletes.During a conversation with team members, head coach Gabor Szauder is said to have made what were qualified as racist and hateful remarks.""He was talking about what's happening in China, the Black Lives Matter movement and Muslim people,"" said Rose.""He said all Muslims were extremists,"" said Patricia. ""And then he added: 'When is the last time you saw a white person crash a plane?'""When one of the swimmers confronted him about the comment, Szauder allegedly became verbally aggressive.""He answered: 'This is a free country. I can say whatever I want. Who are you to tell me what hate speech is? Are you God?'""Another swimmer, Sion Ormond, isn't surprised by these events. She says she retired two months ago because, amongst other reasons, the atmosphere at the training centre had become unbearable.""The abuse that I witnessed regularly at the pool — It was just something that I did not want to be a part of anymore,"" she said.Ormond claims she and some of her teammates were victims of verbal abuse last year in China, during a competition.""He said that if we kept swimming like that, he would hit us so hard, we wouldn't know what happened,"" she added.Those comments were allegedly addressed to substitutes with the entire team present after a pre-competition warm-up deemed inadequate by the head coach.""Maybe it was like ten minutes before our competition swim,"" said Rose. ""And there were various adults who were there that witnessed what was said.""The coach apparently explained his comments after the fact, but the swimmers say they were not satisfied.""He just said that we all misunderstood what he had said and that he was going to hit us really hard with a hard workout,"" explained Patricia.According to the swimmers, Szauder would often zero in on one athlete to pick on.Patricia recalls one incident in Hawaii during training camp.""There was a girl that was publicly shamed for her weight, in front of the whole team. The staff was there. It was made clear to us that she was being publicly shamed. He verbalized that to us,"" said Patricia.""I felt sick listening to the conversation,"" Rose said. ""It was a really inappropriate way to handle that type of subject.""Ultimately, the swimmers say these types of incidents became a burden, affecting the mood at the centre. They say Szauder is prone to mood swings and can get carried away, causing tears and anxiety.""There's been times when he's yelled at girls to the point that they have panic attacks in the pool, in the gym,"" Patricia said.""And then he will continue to yell at them and harass them and swear at them. He will call them babies and tell them to stop crying, to compose themselves.""The coach is also alleged to have made sexist comments on more than one occasion.""He told us that girls should learn how to cook and clean, to take care of our men, or else they won't want us,"" Sarah said. ""And that was all men looked for in a woman.""They also say Szauder made comments of a sexual nature.Ormond recalls one incident that took place in Prince George, B.C..""He said: 'Sion, zip up your hoodie before I get too excited,"" Ormond said. ""It was in front of multiple athletes. This is a 47-year-old man.""Ormond is emotional as she recounts what happened. She claims she only found the courage to tell her parents about it after her retirement.""I knew how inappropriate that comment was, that it never should've been said and I was scared,"" she said. ""I was afraid of what my dad would either say or do. I was afraid he would get involved and I would be perceived as a troublemaker.""The four swimmers are critical of Canada Artistic Swimming for not taking the situation seriously enough, when incidents were reported.Caroline says she often heard the same thing.""We were constantly told: 'You know, he comes from Eastern Europe.'""""They would often meet with us after the fact to tell us we weren't resilient enough and could not deal with anxiety and stress in training situations,"" said Patricia. ""It only made us more and more fearful to report it.""Canada Artistic Swimming declined Radio-Canada Sports' interview requests, citing the ongoing review that is being carried out by an outside firm.In a written statement, coach Szauder denied the allegations. He says he is confident that the report will ultimately negate any sort of misconduct on his part.The four swimmers say if nothing changes, they will seriously consider following Ormond's lead and retiring — with the next Olympic Games less than a year away.",0.0,0.5092961800104656

""It wasn't a huge concern.''Another spectator, Ethan Donnelly, said he works at the University of British Columbia and a coworker who is from China skipped this year's celebrations for fear of the virus.""We want to celebrate, but better safe than sorry,'' he said, gesturing to the mask he wore during the parade.Though some donned the surgical masks at the event, experts advise against them, saying the ones widely available at drug stores aren't particularly effective and noting that repeatedly adjusting them with unwashed hands can actually exacerbate risk of infection.Ella Lewis-Vass, who also works and studies at the university, said she believed those who were most concerned about contracting the virus likely stayed home.The illness has sickened at least 1,975 people and killed 56 in China, but it remains to be seen whether it's as dangerous as the common flu, which kills 3,500 people every year in Canada alone.",0.0,0.48233901515151517

Iran maintains the IAEA inspectors have no legal basis to inspect the sites.""My objective is that my meetings in Tehran will lead to concrete progress in addressing the outstanding questions that the agency has related to safeguards in Iran and, in particular, to resolve the issue of access,"" Grossi said in a statement.""I also hope to establish a fruitful and co-operative channel of direct dialogue with the Iranian government which will be valuable now and in the future.""The Iranian delegation to international organizations in Vienna tweeted that ""we hope this visit will lead to reinforced mutual co-operation.""Since President Donald Trump unilaterally pulled the U.S. out of the nuclear deal with Iran in 2018, the other countries involved — France, Britain, Germany, Russia and China — have been struggling to keep it alive.The deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, promises Iran economic incentives in exchange for curbs on its nuclear program. But with the reinstatement of some American sanctions, Iran's economy has been steadily deteriorating, and Tehran has begun violating provisions of the agreement to try to pressure the other countries to do more to offset those sanctions.At the same time, Iran has continued to provide IAEA inspectors with access to its nuclear facilities — one of the major reasons the countries still party to the agreement stress that it's important to keep it alive.Last week, the U.S. ratcheted up the pressure, officially informing the United Nations it was demanding the restoration of all UN sanctions on Iran, arguing that Iran is in non-compliance and invoking a provision of the nuclear deal to ""snap back"" even more sanctions.Russia, China, Britain, France and Germany, who often disagree, all declared the U.S. action illegal, arguing it is impossible to withdraw from a deal and then use the resolution that endorsed it to reimpose sanctions.Iran has also rejected the move, but the U.S. has stuck to its guns, declaring that a 30-day countdown for the snapback of penalties eased after the 2015 agreement was signed had begun.The five nations and Iran are due to meet in Vienna on Sept. 1.",0.0,0.3465686274509804

891,OPEC faces 'make-or-break' decision on oil production | CBC News,Members of OPEC meet this week to discuss oil production cuts as the spread of COVID-19 has eroded crude prices worldwide.,2020-03-03T23:30:26.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/opec-oil-caronavirus-1.5483779,"OPEC and its allies meet regularly to assess the supply and demand for oil around the globe, but few gatherings have happened under such volatile and trying circumstances.COVID-19's spread has weighed mightily on stock markets and oil prices in recent weeks, with experts still trying to assess the risk the virus poses worldwide.For OPEC, the situation is another big test of the cartel's ability to stabilize oil prices when struck with unexpected turbulence.""It's very important,"" said Judith Dwarkin, chief economist of RS Energy Group in Calgary.""They're facing a make-or-break decision about how to respond to COVID-19 disease, which has now spread beyond China and does pose a threat to global public health and the global economy.""While the impact of the illness on citizens' welfare is a paramount concern, markets are growing increasingly troubled about the blow it will have on world economies.Global oil prices have fallen 20 per cent since the start of the year as the novel coronavirus has spread. In Canada, a downturn in oil prices might not only have an impact on the revenues of oil companies but government coffers, too.Last week, Alberta revealed a provincial budget built in part on oil prices averaging $58 US a barrel in North America. On Monday, oil prices closed a little above $47 US a barrel.Members of OPEC and their allies are meeting this week at the group's headquarters in Vienna, Austria.OPEC, Russia and other producers already have a deal in place to cut output from Jan. 1 by 2.1 million barrels per day (bpd), a figure that includes additional voluntary cuts by Saudi Arabia.But that has not been enough to counter the impact of the virus on China, the world's biggest oil importer, and on the  global economy, as factories are disrupted, fewer people travel and other business slows, curbing oil demand.""China is the front line for impact in the first quarter [of the year],"" Dwarkin said. ""We estimate roughly 900,000 barrels per day has probably been sliced out of China's oil demand. So the need to make a decision to deepen cuts is important."" On Tuesday, officials indicated they were considering deeper cuts in a bid to lift crude prices.Reuters reported a panel of OPEC and its allies recommended cutting oil output by an extra one million bpd on Tuesday signalling that Russia and Saudi Arabia were moving closer to a deal to prop up prices.Leading into this week's meetings, some experts anticipated the cartel's cut might amount to only 600,000 bpd — a figure that might have underwhelmed the market given current uncertainty.Indeed, things are moving quickly and analysts are trying to understand just how the virus' spread will impact economic activity, especially consumer activity.Denton Cinquegrana, chief oil analyst at the Oil Price Information Service by IHS Markit, said it seems like China may be turning a corner, but the virus is only beginning to impact people in the U.S.""Here, in the United States, you're starting to see a little bit of the panic and spread of the virus start to take place and have an impact on demand,"" he said. ""The demand impact we may not know for really a couple months down the road.""Cinquegrana said if OPEC agreed to just the 600,000 bpd cut, Saudi Arabia may go ""a little bit on their own"" to bring the number closer to one million bpd.""That may be enough to get it back close to the $50-a-barrel level,"" he said. ""But, again, there's some real concerns about demand going forward."" A cut in U.S. interest rates on Tuesday offered only limited support for crude ahead of the OPEC meetings on Thursday and Friday.The price of West Texas Intermediate crude, the North American benchmark, closed up 43 cents at $47.18 US per barrel on Tuesday. Brent crude, the global benchmark, fell four cents a barrel to settle at $51.86 US a barrel.Dwarkin said COVID-19 has made OPEC's work an even heavier lift this week.""But as one former Saudi oil minister said, OPEC is like a teabag,"" Dwarkin added.""It works best when it's plunged into hot water. Well, it's definitely in hot water right now.""  ",-0.008341416813639032,0.4804515443404333
893,'Stark differences': how Derek Sloan's words could test Erin O'Toole's leadership skills | CBC News,"On Tuesday morning, shortly before O'Toole's first official news conference as leader of the Official Opposition, the Liberals tossed out their first challenge: the new Conservative leader, they said, should move forthwith to remove inflammatory backbencher Derek Sloan from the Conservative caucus.",2020-08-25T20:42:59.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/erin-otoole-derek-sloan-conservative-leadership-abortion-lgbtq-1.5699489,"The Liberals were at least gracious enough to give Erin O'Toole a full 24 hours before openly trying to cause him trouble. But on Tuesday morning, shortly before O'Toole's first official news conference as leader of the Official Opposition, the Liberals tossed out their first challenge: the new Conservative leader, they said, should move forthwith to remove inflammatory backbencher Derek Sloan from the Conservative caucus.""Mr. O'Toole has an important decision to make, which will help Canadians understand his vision for the future of our country,"" Liberal MP Pam Damoff said in a written statement laying out just some of the things Sloan said while pursuing his own campaign for the Conservative leadership.Derek Sloan's status as a Conservative MP is not quite the most pressing issue facing the nation at this moment and the politics of it are not subtle. But it's a rite of passage for Conservative leaders to be faced with this sort of thing — so Sloan becomes the first test of O'Toole's ability to both lead his party and explain himself.The Liberals' challenge is somewhat unfair. Under the rules adopted by the Conservatives, the leader of the party cannot unilaterally expel an MP from the parliamentary caucus. Even if O'Toole wanted to be rid of Sloan, he would still have to convince a majority of Conservative MPs to vote to expel him.Some Conservative MPs reportedly pushed for Sloan's ouster in May, after he publicly questioned whether Canada's chief public health officer, Dr. Theresa Tam — who was born in Hong Kong — was working for China. Ultimately, a backbencher put forward a motion calling on him to retract his comments. Sloan insisted that his question had been ""rhetorical.""The only Conservative MP to join Sloan in opposing that motion was O'Toole. A few months later, Sloan's supporters helped push O'Toole past Peter MacKay for the Conservative leadership.His comments about Tam may have crossed a line for a significant number of Conservative MPs but Sloan has made multiple statements that O'Toole might not want to be associated with now.In January, Sloan said that the ""the cause of sexual orientation"" was ""scientifically unclear."" He later said that Liberal legislation to ban conversion therapy — the discredited practice of trying to change someone's sexual orientation with counselling — was tantamount to legalized ""child abuse.""Sloan has said he believes Canada should pull out of the UN's Paris agreement on climate change and withdraw all funding from the World Health Organization. He opposes both mandatory vaccination for COVID-19 and any rule requiring Canadians to wear face masks to curb the spread of the virus. Echoing Donald Trump, Sloan has said that ""antifa"" should be officially listed as a terrorist organization.Watch: Erin O'Toole courts social conservatives and broader baseThe NationalO'Toole is apparently of the view that Sloan has not yet said enough to justify expulsion.""During a leadership race, there's always some pressure, there's a contrast of ideas, and that's finished,"" O'Toole said today when a reporter asked him whether Sloan would remain in caucus. ""I received a clear mandate and I'm very excited to meet with my caucus and talk with all of them about uniting and going forward together.""Asked whether his fellow leadership candidates would have prominent roles on his team, O'Toole expanded on his answer only slightly.""Derek and I had some very stark differences. We had some areas of overlap, with our concern about the Communist Party of China and some issues. I didn't agree with some of the ways he characterized those concerns,"" he said. ""But certainly within a pandemic, within the race we were in, a lot of things are said. We're united now. We're going to talk together as a caucus soon.""The ""hey, people say a lot of things during a leadership race"" defence is candid, at least. O'Toole might have even been referring subconsciously to himself. But there is no rule stating that everything said during a leadership race becomes null and void once the ballots are counted.For as long as the Conservative Party of Canada has existed, its leaders have struggled to account for the opinions held within its caucus. After being repeatedly tripped up by his backbenchers' public statements, Stephen Harper came to insist on tight message control and discipline. Andrew Scheer declined to put Kellie Leitch in his shadow cabinet after the former cabinet minister proposed a ""values test"" for people immigrating to Canada. But then he struggled to explain his own views on abortion and homosexuality.Perhaps the most democratically altruistic thing for any leader to say is that they are not responsible for all of the opinions held by every member of their caucus, nor is every member of their caucus obligated to share the leader's opinions. But that explanation only goes so far — it might cover a difference over public policy but it isn't enough to completely sidestep something truly objectionable or even merely unpopular.Sloan is staunchly anti-abortion and if that viewpoint or any of his other opinions speaks to some substantial segment of the Conservative base (Sloan won 15.6 per cent of the popular vote on the first ballot Sunday night) then Conservatives might be reluctant to banish him. The flipside of that would be the question of whether Sloan's presence already threatens to undermine the idea of conservatism that O'Toole wants to present.If Conservatives are not convinced that Sloan is already more trouble than he is worth, then excluding Sloan from the official list of critics might at least allow O'Toole to put some space between himself and his most notorious backbencher. But it won't stop the Liberals from pointing in Sloan's direction.At that point, if Conservatives are willing to stick with him for now, it might become a question of whether Sloan is content to fade into quiet obscurity or will continue to say things that O'Toole will be asked to explain later.",0.0,0.48615227909345554
895,Raptors' Gasol says frustration from hamstring injury fuelled transformation | CBC Sports,"Coming off a heady few months of an NBA title and a FIBA World Cup win, Marc Gasol couldn't replicate that success with the Toronto Raptors this season. The frustration gnawed at him.",2020-07-15T19:58:06.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/sports/basketball/nba/toronto-raptors-marc-gasol-transformation-1.5650983,"Coming off a heady few months of an NBA title and a FIBA World Cup win, Marc Gasol couldn't replicate that success with the Toronto Raptors this season.The frustration gnawed at him.And so when COVID-19 shut down the NBA on March 11, the Raptors veteran forward reached out to his personal training staff and vowed to make good use of the down time.While Gasol wouldn't divulge how much weight he'd shed from his six-foot-11 frame — he said it ""wasn't relevant"" — his trimmed-down physique is obvious.""It was a frustrating season for me personally because I could never get a rhythm and help the team the way that I should be helping the team,"" Gasol said Wednesday, in his first comments to the media since the league shuttered four months ago.""As soon as... we got informed the [Toronto training] facility was closing down, I got together with my team on a phone call and got going on a plan to resolve these ongoing issues.""Those issues kept Gasol on the bench for 28 of the Raptors' 64 games with a nagging hamstring injury.The 35-year-old credited consistency with part of the weight loss — eating and sleeping with more regularity at home in Spain, removed from the rigours of NBA travel.""[Consistency] goes with training regimen, goals, sleeping habits, everything,"" he said. ""Obviously when you're at home, everything is a lot easier than when you're on the road and travelling and trying to make everything work and winning games, which at the end of the day, that's what you're judged for.""Soon after Toronto's historic championship run, Gasol punched in with Spain's national team, which won the World Cup in China in August. He figures his hamstring troubles were a product of those gruelling few months.""You have to put in the time, you have to put in the work if you're going to use that much energy,"" he said. ""If you only take money out of the bank and never put money in the bank, you're going to go broke.""Gasol's teammates have raved about his transformation.Gasol isn't the only Raptor who showed up in Florida for the NBA's restart in terrific shape. Coach Nick Nurse has praised the hard work of team leader Kyle Lowry, who looks fit and trim. And Chris Boucher put a much-needed 15 pounds of muscle on his long-limbed frame.Gasol said beyond the fitness component, he and his teammates are itching to play. He can see it in the competitiveness on the court and off.""We compete amongst each other every single day and try to go at each other's neck a little bit. I think that's always positive,"" he said. ""That is one of the things we missed the most during confinement — the competition. Some guys like to compete at computer games. Some of us are not really into those things. We missed competing against other human beings in real life.""Gasol said there's been some cutthroat video games between players.""You don't want to play me in video games, I'll tell you that much,"" Gasol said.Pascal Siakam then jumped into the frame on the Zoom call and told reporters ""FIFA king right here. Make sure you get that on camera.""Let’s do this! 👊🏽<br>It’s the little details that are vital 🤙🏽<br>Step by step ✍🏽 <a href=""https://t.co/4IgJbNhsga"">pic.twitter.com/4IgJbNhsga</a>The 22 teams in the NBA restart are being housed at Walt Disney World in Orlando under strict health and safety protocols. While there are social activities such as a players lounge, boat trips, fishing, and water parks, the Raptors know one of the toughest challenges over what could stretch into three months on the campus will be loneliness.Gasol appreciated the photos of his family Raptors staff had placed in his room before he checked in.""Obviously it's not ideal to be separated from your family but once you know they are well, also understanding and explaining to them the risk and make sure they follow all the protocols that they have to follow,"" said Gasol, whose wife and two kids are in Spain.""[The photos] were a great gesture.""While there've been complaints from players about the food and accommodations, and a couple of players have been quarantined for inadvertently straying outside the campus bubble, Gasol said they're all in the same boat, and ""trying to make the best out of it.""I'm sure if you want to you can find millions of excuses of why this is not a good idea, you just have to find a good reason to stick with it and try to win another championship,"" he said.""So, whatever that is for, for each player, I hope that they can really hold it strong and lean on one another when the tough time comes, because they will come and things will get a little bit tougher on the mental aspect, and just knowing that you have your teammates, always next to you to support you.""Gasol lived under full lockdown in Spain, which was one of the hardest hit countries in the pandemic's early days.Now, the NBA sits virtually in one of the epicentres of the coronavirus. Florida reported more than 10,000 new cases Wednesday, surpassing 300,000 cases.The Raptors play the Houston Rockets on July 24 in their first of three scrimmages. They play the Los Angeles Lakers on Aug. 1 in the first of eight seeding games.Gasol spent part of the summer of 2018 on a rescue ship in the Mediterranean Sea, helping pluck terrified people from the water, migrants fleeing Libya for the shores of Europe.Gasol was vocal about his anger and frustration at the time at an Italian government that was trying to halt the influx of refugees.The Toronto Raptors centre has seen the stain of racism in Europe, including his home country of Spain.And so while the U.S. has erupted in anti-racism Black Lives Matter protests, and social and racial justice will be a theme of the NBA's restart at Walt Disney World, Gasol knows racism extends far beyond America's borders.""We can see how we treat a lot of immigrants that come from Africa to Europe, the way we deal with it — not 'we,' but a lot of people do, sadly in Spain or Italy or other countries around Europe.""We look at them as immigrants, not only as human beings. So that tag that you put on [them] already tells you a lot of stuff about the way you view them. All those things needs to needs to change, and if it doesn't come from the top and from the government, it has to come from the people.""",0.0,0.4335497835497835

925,"Investing in conservation generates huge returns for economy, study finds | CBC News","With Earth's wildlife now facing an extinction crisis, a group of economists and scientists is hoping to persuade governments that it pays to protect nature.",2020-07-08T19:05:19.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/conservation-economy-1.5642220,"With Earth's wildlife now facing an extinction crisis, a group of economists and scientists is hoping to persuade governments that it pays to protect nature.Specifically, expanding areas under conservation could yield a return of at least $5 for every $1 spent just by giving nature more room to thrive.That in turn would boost agricultural and forestry yields, improve freshwater supplies, preserve wildlife and help fight climate change — all of which would boost global economic output on average by about $337 billion ($250 billion US) annually, the group of more than 100 researchers argues in a paper published online Wednesday by The Campaign for Nature, a coalition of conservation organizations from around the world.The work represents one of the most comprehensive studies of the potential economic benefits from protecting nature — a research area fraught with best-guess estimates on the monetary value of animals, plants and ecosystems left intact.Released as the United Nations lobbies governments to set aside 30 per cent of their land and sea by 2030, the report aims to challenge the notion that conservation is costly.""You cannot put a price tag on nature, but the economic numbers point to its protection,"" said Anthony Waldron, an ecologist at the University of Cambridge who lead the group examining the economic implications of designating a third of the Earth as a nature reserve.Others question how precise accounting for nature's economic contribution is even possible, said Bram Büscher, a political scientist at Wageningen University & Research in the Netherlands.""What are two ducks worth? And would these ducks in the U.S. be the same as in Latin America? And how would you compare those things, and what would be their role?"" Büscher told Reuters.Leaning too heavily on economic arguments could also backfire, if governments end up opening areas deemed valuable to the highest bidders, warned Julia Steinberger, an environmental economist at the University of Leeds.""All it takes is one lobbyist to come along and say, 'This program is no longer economically viable,'"" Steinberger said. ""That's the risk we see when we tie environmental protection to economic performance.""But even a rough estimate of nature's economic value is better than nothing, given the scale of what is at stake, the report's authors argue. Scientists estimate that at least a million species are facing extinction in the next few decades, largely due to human-driven activities including habitat loss, pollution and climate change.Hoping to halt the global die-off, 30 countries are already backing a draft document pledging to conserve 30 per cent of the Earth's surface by 2030, which will be discussed at the UN Biodiversity Convention postponed to next year in Kunming, China.Currently, about 15 per cent of the Earth's land and 7 per cent of the ocean has some degree of protection.A 30 per cent conservation goal, aside from producing natural resources like fish stocks and timber, would also help to guarantee healthy ecosystems that provide an additional $472 billion ($350 billion US) a year in services that are essential to life, including filtering water, clearing air pollutants or preventing coastal erosion, the report said.Such a goal would require an average annual investment of roughly $189 billion ($140 billion US) by 2030, the researchers estimated. Currently, about $32 billion ($24 billion US) is spent globally per year on protecting natural areas, they said.""The well-being of humanity and global economic prosperity depends on us fixing our broken relationship with nature,"" said report co-author Enric Sala, an ocean explorer in residence at National Geographic Society.The report said that a major expansion in protected areas would have to be managed carefully to ensure that the economic benefits were spread evenly throughout populations.But first, countries have to join the effort. And even then, compliance is not guaranteed. Despite having more than 190 countries pledge to fight climate change under the 2015 Paris Agreement, emissions of heat-trapping gases continue to rise.Nevertheless, with some U.S. states pledging to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, there is growing interest in finding ways to account for the economic benefits provided by forests and other ecosystems, said economist John Talberth at the Center For Sustainable Economy in Portland, Oregon.Understanding these economic benefits can also help policymakers decide, for example, whether a forest can be felled for timber or better left untouched to absorb carbon dioxide and support wildlife or water cycles. ""The climate crisis has put a foot on the accelerator of getting this done,"" Talberth said.",0.12663419913419915,0.4521158008658009

""A sporting boycott only punishes the athletes of the boycotting country and deprives their people of sharing in the success, pride and joy of their Olympic team.""Asked at a later news conference if the IOC recently discussed the Uighur issue with Chinese authorities, Bach limited the focus of its role — to ""whatever is related to the Olympic Games"" rather than society as a whole.""This is our remit. And we are fully confident that, there, China will deliver on this commitment,"" he said.The boycott issue is personal for Bach, who won a gold medal in team fencing at the 1976 Montreal Olympics but could not defend the title when West Germany joined the United States and others in refusing to send teams to the 1980 Moscow Games.""The Soviet army stayed nine long more years in Afghanistan after the boycott,"" said Bach, who as an athlete spokesman in 1980 failed to change the minds of German political leaders. ""It appears that today, some just do not want to learn anything from history.""The only political effect the boycott of 1980 had, was to trigger the revenge boycott of the following [Los Angeles] Olympic Games,"" he said.If Bach is re-elected unopposed as expected, a big challenge of his next term is likely to be the economic and social recovery of sports from the global health crisis.In March, the IOC postponed this year's Tokyo Olympics for one year. Organizers confirmed Friday they had secured all the venues and the Athletes Village for next year. IOC members on Friday also ratified postponing the 2022 Dakar Youth Olympics in Senegal to 2026.""Unfortunately, we are already seeing clear signs in some parts of the world that ΓÇª society and nations are driven by even more egoism and self-interest,"" Bach said. ""This leads to more confrontation and to the politicization of all aspects of life: Culture, economy, health, science, humanitarian aid. Even the fight against doping is already being targeted.""That comment appeared to criticize the United States after a government-funded study last month raised the possibility of withholding money from the World Anti-Doping Agency.The IOC said its presidential election will be in ""spring 2021,"" possibly in Athens, as members agreed to have two full meetings next year. The second is due to be in Tokyo on the sidelines of the Olympics.Also on Friday, the IOC elected five new members, including two-time Olympic champion Sebastian Coe of Britain, the president of World Athletics. The others are: Former Olympic champion Maria Colon of Cuba; Princess Reema Bandar Al-Saud, Saudi Arabia's ambassador to the United States; Kolinda Grabar-Kitarovic, the former president of Croatia; and Battushig Batbold of Mongolia.Two members, John Coates of Australia and Ser Miang Ng of Singapore, were elevated to IOC vice-president status, with seats on the executive board.Two vacant seats on the 15-member board were won in elections by Mikaela Cojuangco Jaworski of the Philippines and Gerardo Werthein of Argentina, one of Bach's main allies.",0.05773438163144046,0.29324548001018585

989,"Egypt arrests doctors, silences critics over virus outbreak | CBC News",Egyptian security agencies have tried to stifle criticism about the handling of the coronavirus health crisis by the government of President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi.,2020-07-06T07:28:23.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/egypt-critics-coronavirus-1.5638627,"A doctor arrested after writing an article about Egypt's fragile health system. A pharmacist picked up from work after posting online about a shortage of protective gear. An editor taken from his home after questioning official coronavirus figures. A pregnant doctor arrested after a colleague used her phone to report a suspected coronavirus case.As Egyptian authorities fight the swelling coronavirus outbreak, security agencies have tried to stifle criticism about the government of President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi's handling of the health crisis.At least 10 doctors and six journalists have been arrested since the virus hit Egypt in February, according to rights groups. Other health workers say they have been warned by administrators to keep quiet or face punishment. One foreign correspondent has fled the country, fearing arrest, and another two have been reprimanded over ""professional violations.""The coronavirus is surging in the country of 100 million, threatening to overwhelm hospitals. As of Monday, the Health Ministry recorded 76,253 infections, including 3,343 deaths — the highest death toll in the Arab world.""Every day I go to work, I sacrifice myself and my whole family,"" said a doctor in greater Cairo, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals, like all doctors interviewed for this story. ""Then they arrest my colleagues to send us a message. I see no light on the horizon.""In 2013, el-Sissi, as defence minister, led the military's removal of Egypt's first democratically elected president, Mohamed Morsi, after his brief rule sparked nationwide protests. Since then, el-Sissi has stamped out dissent, jailing Islamist political opponents, secular activists, journalists, even belly dancers.Now the clampdown has extended to doctors who speak out about their working conditions.A government press officer did not respond to requests for comment on the arrests of doctors and journalists.In recent weeks, authorities have marshalled medical supplies to prepare for more patients. The military has set up field hospitals with 4,000 beds, scaled up testing and ordered companies to churn out face masks and other supplies.But health workers are sounding the alarm on social media. Doctors say they are forced to purchase surgical masks with their meagre salaries. Families plead for intensive care beds.The pandemic has pushed the Egyptian Medical Syndicate, a non-political professional group, into a new role as the sole advocate for doctors' rights.Last month, the union released a letter to the public prosecutor demanding the release of five doctors detained for expressing opinions about the virus response.Another syndicate member, Mohamed el-Fawal, landed in jail last week, after demanding online that the prime minister apologize for comments that appeared to blame health workers for a spike in deaths.Incensed doctors hit back, saying they're under-trained, underpaid and under-resourced, struggling to save patients. So far, 117 doctors, 39 nurses and 32 pharmacists have died from COVID-19, according to syndicate members' counts. Thousands have fallen ill.Security forces shut down a syndicate press conference that was to respond to the prime minister's comments and discuss supply shortages, according to former leader Mona Mina.""These doctors have no history of activism. They were arrested because they offered criticism of their very specific professional circumstances,"" said Amr Magdi of Human Rights Watch, which has confirmed the arrests of eight doctors and two pharmacists. Two have been released, he said, while the rest remain in pretrial detention.In one case, security agents burst into the home of Hany Bakr, an ophthalmologist north of Cairo, according to his lawyer and Amnesty International, over his Facebook post that criticized the government for sending aid to Italy and China while Egypt's doctors were short of equipment.In March, public prosecutors accused 26-year-old Alaa Shaaban Hamida of terrorism charges after she let a colleague call the government coronavirus hotline from her phone instead of first reporting the case to her managers, according to Amnesty International. Three months pregnant, she remains in pretrial detention.Doctors in three provinces say administrators threatened to report them if they publicly expressed frustration toward authorities or failed to show up for work.In one voice recording obtained by The Associated Press, a health deputy in a Nile Delta province can be heard saying, ""Even if a doctor is dying, he must keep working or be subjected to the most severe punishment.""A doctor in Cairo shared WhatsApp messages with the AP from his manager, alerting staff that their attendance was monitored by state security. In two other hospitals in the capital, workers retracted letters of collective resignation over working conditions for fear of reprisals.The suppression of criticism in Egypt is hardly unusual, analysts say, but the government has become more jittery as the pandemic tests its capabilities and economy.With borders shut and planes idled, Egypt's critical tourism revenue has vanished. Last week, fearing further economic fallout, the government reopened much of society and welcomed hundreds of international tourists to resorts, even as daily reported deaths exceeded 80.""Because of Egypt's constant attention to its image as a place open for tourism, open for business, open for investment, authorities appear particularly sensitive to divergent perspectives during the pandemic,"" said Amy Hawthorne, an Egypt expert at the Project on Middle East Democracy.At least 15 individuals have been arrested for broadcasting ""false news"" about the pandemic, said the UN human rights office. Four Egyptian journalists who reported on the outbreak remain in prison, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, which has labelled Egypt among the world's worst jailers of journalists, along with Turkey and China.In March, Egypt expelled a reporter for The Guardian who cited a report disputing the official virus count. Egypt's state information body summoned The Washington Post and New York Times correspondents over their critical coverage during the pandemic.Despite growing human rights abuses, the international community counts on Egypt as a bulwark against regional instability, said a Middle East-focused rights advocate at the UN, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss policy matters.""There is no appetite,"" the advocate said, ""to address what is going on in Egypt let alone sanction them in any way for what the government is doing to their own people.""",0.0,0.312015704995157

0,"As Canadians sour on China, an ambassador changes his tone | CBC News","Dominic Barton, Canada's ambassador to China, made his first appearance at the China committee this week since before the pandemic hit Canada. He was noticeably less forgiving of Beijing and less bullish on business opportunities than last time — perhaps reflecting a turn against China in public opinion.",2020-12-10T09:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/china-kovrig-spavor-dominic-barton-1.5835036,"Today marks two years since the two Michaels were detained by China.It's also been ten long pandemic months since Canada's ambassador to Beijing, Dominic Barton, made his previous appearance before the Commons subcommittee on Canada-China relations. Tuesday's second round of that hearing showed how much the mood around China has changed during 2020. Barton appeared conscious of the need to make some repairs to the impression he left in February, when his testimony drew unusually direct criticism from former diplomats with experience working in China.Back then, Barton suggested that it was incumbent upon Canadians to recognize that ""China values unity and the needs of society at large, rather than freedom of individual choice ... we just have to understand that.""Former diplomat and China expert Charles Burton told the subcommittee that Barton's words parroted Communist Party propaganda asserting that Chinese culture is inherently averse to liberty and democracy — when in fact the aversion comes from Xi Jinping's Politburo.Watch: Trudeau says government will examine all options to bring Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig.:Politics NewsIn his Tuesday appearance, however, Barton opened with remarks on ""our efforts to promote rights and freedoms in China.""""We are concerned by the decline of civil and political rights in China,"" he told MPs.Barton began his appearance with a lengthy description of a recent visit to the Tibet Autonomous Region, which he toured in a party of foreign diplomats. It was one of two closely-supervised Tibetan tours put on for mostly western diplomats this year, a sign that the Communist Party — bravado notwithstanding — still cares about what western countries say regarding its human rights record.It may also have been an attempt to switch foreign attention to Tibet from the even more problematic neighbouring region of Xinjiang, where China's heavy-handed persecution of the Muslim Uighur people is opening new fronts for confrontation with the West.Barton said that he had consulted with pro-Tibet groups and academics in Canada before accepting the trip, which he said he undertook partly to show Tibetans the world was still concerned about their plight.In addition to discussing what he'd seen on the tour — which took in a school, a monastery and greenhouses — Barton also talked about the motives of the Communist Party in allowing the trip. He said he understood that ""what I saw was not the complete picture on any issue"" and described one effort to escape his minders — when he left his hotel at 5 a.m. for an unaccompanied stroll through the streets of Lhasa.Barton once famously described himself as ""a bull on China"" and his entire pre-diplomatic career was built on viewing China primarily as a business opportunity.During his last committee appearance, Barton told members he ""would love to talk more about promoting trade and investment. I probably should shut up and move on, but I'm very excited by the opportunity we have on many fronts.""This time, he took his own advice and left out the economic boosterism — suggesting that the ambassador had not only learned to read the room but perhaps understood how the ground had shifted under him.""Countries all around the world are evolving their approach to China,"" he told the subcommittee Tuesday night. That's certainly true in Europe, where both public attitudes and government approaches to China have become considerably tougher over the course of 2020. Shachi Kurl of the Angus Reid Institute said Barton's changed tone also reflects new realities at home.""This isn't just about Canada and Ambassador Barton aligning with the Western consensus,"" she told CBC's Power and Politics. ""It really is about aligning with the Canadian consensus, because for several years we have seen a deterioration, and then a deterioration, and then a further deterioration in Canadian views of the Beijing regime.""Opinion polls do show a crashing decline in China's standing in Canadian public opinion, reaching what Kurl calls ""an all-time low"" as 2020 draws to a close.""You now find among the Canadian population a bloody-mindedness that says, 'You know what? This is not OK,'"" she said. ""This is about more than the human rights situation, this is about more than events in Hong Kong. What has really viscerally affected Canadians is the kidnapping of the two Michaels.""Obviously, the detention of Kovrig and Spavor was always intended by Beijing to be a pressure tactic — not a play for hearts and minds. But it hasn't worked as a pressure tactic and has instead backfired disastrously upon China's public image.Would the CCP judge the strategy wise in hindsight, or consider it a failure? Either way, the need to save face makes it hard for the Communist Party — famously averse to backing down on anything — to alter its course now.During his committee appearance, Barton praised the two Canadians for their resilience, which he said was an inspiration to him.Barton was eager to mend fences when asked about another Canadian detainee: Huseyin Celil, a Uighur rights activist from Burlington, Ont. who was snatched on behalf of Chinese authorities while visiting Uzbekistan 14 years ago, whisked across the border and given a life sentence.When asked about the case in February, Barton said he had not been able to visit Celil because Celil was not a Canadian citizen. Once again, he was echoing a view espoused by the government of China, which has refused to recognize the fact that Celil has been a Canadian citizen since 2001. Foreign Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne was forced to correct the record in the House of Commons a few days after Barton's misstatement.Two former ambassadors to China condemned Barton's mischaracterization of Celil. ""China doesn't get to determine who is or becomes a Canadian citizen,"" said David Mulroney, who represented Canada in Beijing from 2009 to 2012.This time, Barton described the steps he had taken to reach out to the Celil family in the wake of that embarrassing incident.There is still no sign of progress in Celil's case, however. His detention differs from that of Kovrig and Spavor in that Celil was not seized as a bargaining chip to pressure Canada, and his case predates the Huawei dispute.Instead, Celil's detention intersects with another issue that has raised tensions between China and Canada — one that also came up in one of the tenser moments in this week's meeting between Barton and MPs.Conservative MP Garnett Genuis pressed Barton to make a clear statement on China's suppression of its Uighur minority, who are concentrated in the far western Xinjiang region.He read out the recent words of the Trudeau government's newish ambassador to the UN, Bob Rae, who told CBC News ""there's no question that there's aspects of what the Chinese are doing that fits into the definition of genocide in the genocide convention."" Did Barton agree with that statement? The ambassador refused to be pinned down, saying that while the situation was ""very, very concerning,"" more reports from the area were needed.Rights activists are particularly suspicious of Barton on this file because the company he headed, McKinsey, earned a reputation for indifference to Uighur suffering while eagerly promoting the Chinese government's economic plans for their homeland.The company defended itself but faced harsh criticism — even from the traditional business press.""I think we need to see the reports,"" Barton said. ""I haven't talked to Ambassador Rae about the particular evidence he has on that side.""""We need to have independent people on the ground who can go wherever they want"" in Xinjiang in order to determine what's happening, he added. Genuis was skeptical. ""We'd love to get access,"" he said. ""I think there's realities in terms of whether that's ever going to be given.""""Is Mr. Rae's statement consistent with the government's policy, or is yours?"" Genuis asked.Barton minimized the gap between the two, arguing that Rae was also seeking more investigation. A noticeable difference remained, however, in how the two men described the situation.",0.0875765364685819,0.342675455857274

While questions remain about the Sinopharm shot, already at least one country outside China plans to roll it out in a mass-vaccination campaign.The U.A.E., home to Dubai and Abu Dhabi, conducted a trial beginning in September of the vaccine by Chinese state-owned pharmaceutical giant Sinopharm involving 31,000 volunteers from 125 nations. Volunteers between 18 and 60 years old received two doses of the vaccine over 28 days.The U.A.E.'s Health and Prevention Ministry announced the results via a statement on the state-run WAM news agency, saying it has ""reviewed Sinopharm CNBG's interim analysis of the Phase III trials.""""The analysis shows no serious safety concerns,"" the statement said, without detailing whether any participant suffered side effects.It wasn't immediately clear if the announced results included only those taking part in the testing in the UAE or if they also include results from China and elsewhere. The statement described the vaccine as receiving ""official registration"" without elaborating on what that meant.Emirati officials and Sinopharm did not respond to questions from The Associated Press.However, calls Wednesday to SEHA, the Abu Dhabi health authority, included an option for individuals to schedule an appointment to receive a ""COVID-19 vaccine."" The centre was swamped with calls following the announcement on the vaccine's efficacy.The Sinopharm vaccine has been approved for emergency use in a few countries and the company is still conducting late-stage clinical trials in 10 countries. Morocco is gearing up for an ambitious COVID-19 vaccination program, aiming to vaccinate 80 per cent of its adults in an operation starting this month that's relying initially on the Sinopharm vaccine.Sinopharm's shot relies on a tested technology, using a killed virus to deliver the vaccine, similar to how polio immunizations are made. Leading Western competitors, like the shot made by Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech, use newer, less-proven technology to target the coronavirus's spike protein using RNA. The United Kingdom already has begun vaccinating people with the Pfizer shot.WATCH | Inside the scramble to mass produce a COVID-19 vaccine:The NationalTop officials in the UAE, including Dubai's ruler, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, have publicly received the shots as part of the vaccine testing.Already, Pfizer reports its shot as being 95 per cent effective, while another RNA candidate from Moderna appears to be 94.5 per cent effective. Results suggest a third vaccine from Oxford University and AstraZeneca is safe and about 70 per cent effective, but questions remain about how well it may help protect those over 55.In transport, Pfizer says its vaccine must be stored in a freezer at –80 C to –60 C or in a thermal container at –90 C to –60 C. The Moderna vaccine must remain at a temperature of –20 C.The Sinopharm vaccine is believed to be able to travel at a temperature of 2 C to 8 C, a major draw for areas of the world where nearly three billion people live without stable electricity and refrigeration. In November, the Communist Party secretary for Sinopharm said almost one million people in China had received its vaccine.Since the pandemic began, the UAE has detected over 178,000 cases of the virus, with 160,000 recoveries and nearly 600 deaths. Its aggressive testing policy has seen over 17 million tests conducted in a country home to just over nine million people.",0.12404250841750843,0.36782407407407414

Hong Kong police later said they had arrested nine men and one woman for suspected offences including ""collusion with a foreign country/external elements to endanger national security, conspiracy to defraud"" and others.The tycoon had been a frequent visitor to Washington, where he has met officials, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, to rally support for Hong Kong democracy, prompting Beijing to label him a ""traitor.""",0.016143048128342243,0.274520944741533

Washington considers it an important democratic outpost and is required by law to provide it with the means to defend itself.Responding to the U.S. approval of a potential $1.8 billion US arms sale to Taiwan, China's Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said during a daily news briefing that such sales should stop.The sales ""seriously interfere with China's internal affairs, seriously damage China's sovereignty and security interests, send a seriously wrong signal to Taiwan independence forces and severely damage China-U.S. relations and peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait,"" he said.""China will make a legitimate and necessary response according to how the situation develops,"" Zhao added.He did not give details, but China has sanctioned U.S. companies in the past for selling weapons to Taiwan, though it is unclear what form they have taken.In Taipei, Taiwan Defence Minister Yen De-fa thanked the United States and said the weapons were to help Taiwan improve their defensive capabilities to deal with the ""enemy threat and new situation.""""This includes a credible combat capability and asymmetric warfare capabilities to strengthen our determination to defend ourselves,"" he added.""This shows the importance attached by the United States to security in the Indo-Pacific and Taiwan Strait. We will continue to consolidate our security partnership with the United States.""Yen said they were not looking for confrontation.""We will not engage in an arms race with the Chinese Communists. We will put forward requirements and build fully in accordance with the strategic concept of heavy deterrence, defending our position and defensive needs.""Taiwan's armed forces are dwarfed by China's, which are expanding their capability with new weapons like aircraft carriers and stealth fighters.Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen has made defence modernization a priority in the face of a rising Chinese threat, particularly ""asymmetric warfare"" capabilities, which refers to making any Chinese attack difficult and costly, for example with smart mines and portable missiles.Like most countries, Washington has no formal diplomatic ties with Taipei, though it is its strongest global backer. The U.S. has been pushing Taiwan to modernize its military so it can become a ""porcupine"" — that is, hard for China to attack.Among other weapons systems, Wednesday's formal notifications to Congress by the State Department were for 11 truck-based rocket launchers made by Lockheed Martin called a High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS), for an estimated cost of $436.1 million.The notifications also covered 135 AGM-84H Standoff Land Attack Missile Expanded Response (SLAM-ER) Missiles and related equipment made by Boeing for an estimated $1.008 billion, and six MS-110 Recce external sensor pods made by Collins Aerospace for jets, at an estimated cost of $367.2 million.Further congressional notifications are expected to follow, including drones made by General Atomics and land-based Harpoon anti-ship missiles made by Boeing to serve as coastal defence cruise missiles.The U.S. administration has stepped up pressure on Beijing in the run-up to the Nov. 3 U.S. presidential election, in which President Donald Trump has made a tough approach to China a key foreign policy theme.Last week, the U.S. national security adviser, Robert O'Brien, said that while China probably was not ready to invade Taiwan for now, the island needed to ""fortify itself"" against a future attack or any bid to isolate it through non-military means, such as an embargo.Taiwan has been testing new surface-to-surface missiles, which its media says have the ability to strike deep inside China, potentially giving the island the ability to attack far-off Chinese air bases and command centres.",-0.009177802873455048,0.4812643515904384

Both men were detained in China in December 2018 following Canada's arrest of Meng Wanzhou, a senior executive with the Chinese telecom giant Huawei. Meng is also the daughter of the company's founder.Canadian police detained Meng in Vancouver on a U.S. extradition request nine days before Kovrig and Spavor were arrested. The U.S. is seeking Meng's extradition on fraud charges and her extradition case is before the Canadian courts. Her arrest severely damaged relations between China and Canada.One month after Kovrig and Spavor were arrested, China sentenced Canadian Robert Lloyd Schellenberg to death in a sudden retrial. Schellenberg already had been sentenced to a 15-year jail term for drug smuggling.All three moves were widely seen as punishment for Canada's arrest of Meng Wanzhou.Today, Canadian Ambassador to China Dominic Barton was granted virtual consular access to Schellenberg; because of the provisions in the Privacy Act, the government disclosed no further information.Podcast - Sanctioned: The Arrest of a Telecom GiantSchellenberg was first detained on Dec. 2, 2014. Canadian officials were granted regular consular access to him until January 22, 2020.""I continue to call for the immediate release of Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, and for clemency for Robert Schellenberg, as we do for all Canadians facing the death penalty,"" said Foreign Affairs Minister François-Philippe Champagne in a statement.",0.023,0.3024102564102564

Greenpeace executive director Jennifer Morgan called it ""an important signal"" that showed climate change is ""top of agenda for China.""""A big shift for curbing emissions and a significant step forward in international cooperation"" U.N. climate chief Patricia Espinosa said.The goal will be a challenge for China, which relies heavily for its electricity on coal, one of the most carbon-intensive fossil fuels.China released the equivalent of 10 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide, or CO2, into the atmosphere in 2018, according to the Global Carbon Project that tracks emissions worldwide. That was almost twice as much as the United States and three times as much as the European Union.Several other major emitters have set earlier deadlines, with the EU aiming to be carbon neutral by 2050. Frans Timmermans, who leads the EU executive's efforts on climate change, welcomed Xi's announcement.""We need decisive action from every country to keep temperatures under control, tackle climate change and keep our planet inhabitable,"" he said.The United States has so far not set such a goal. President Donald Trump, who once described climate change as a hoax invented by China, has started the process of pulling the U.S. out of the Paris accord.If China fulfills Xi's goal, it could prevent 0.2 to 0.4 C further warming for the world, according to ""very rough estimates"" by MIT management professor John Sterman, who models and tracks emission reductions and pledges with Climate Interactive.But much depends on how they do their emissions reduction and how soon they cut them, he said, adding he has to do a more thorough analysis.""That's a lot,"" Sterman said. ""China's by far the world's big emitter. They're emitting more than the EU and US together.""""It puts a lot more pressure on the United States,"" Sterman said.Perhaps even more important than the carbon neutrality pledge is the effort to peak carbon dioxide emissions before 2030 instead of by 2030, Sterman said. Carbon dioxide's more than 100-year lifetime in the air makes earlier emission cuts more effective than promises in the future, he said.""Emissions that don't happen between now and 2030 are going to reduce warming a lot more than the same emission reductions after 2060,"" Sterman said.However, pledges are not the same as actions. What's needed is signs of action, such as eliminating plans to build new coal-fired power plants, cutting subsidies for coal power and getting off coal entirely, Sterman said. Coal is the biggest carbon dioxide emitter of power sources.Twenty-nine nations before China have pledged to achieve climate neutrality in different years, according to the Carbon Neutrality Coalition. They include Canada.With China, the 30 countries that have some kind of carbon neutrality pledges, account for about 43 per cent of the world's carbon dioxide emissions from the burning of fossil fuels. The largest polluting countries not on the list are the United States, India, Russia, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, South Africa, Turkey, Brazil and Australia.",0.14487727272727274,0.42899090909090903

I don't believe that this will be repeated again,"" said Hagerman.Barges bring critical fuel and other dry goods to Arctic coastal and Mackenzie River communities every summer in both the N.W.T. and Nunavut.Hagermen said these four barges from China Merchants Jinling Shipyard are part of a new series that are made specifically to handle large volumes of fuel products. With the increased capacity, it will allow MTS to decrease the number of deliveries into some communities.An Infrastructure spokesperson said the total budget to design, build and deliver the four barges is $20.7 million; the federal government paid for 75 per cent, and the territorial government covered the other 25 per cent.Hagerman said, so far, organizing the delivery has been going better than he anticipated — despite the shipyard in China shutting down ""for well over a month"" since the height of the pandemic in March.Another concern has been that, like the N.W.T., China has been seeing high water levels, and the country is dealing with severe flooding.""We were really concerned, of course, that we wouldn't be able to get the barges at all this year,"" he said. ""I don't know how they did it, but they fast-tracked and put us right back on schedule.""With the ships coming in during the COVID-19 pandemic, there will be restrictions in place, said an Infrastructure spokesperson in an email Tuesday. Interactions between crew and residents are already restricted for regular community cargo deliveries, with designated drop-off zones. ""For the delivery of the barges from China, the barges will be unloaded by another vessel between 30 and 60 kilometres offshore, depending on weather. There will be no physical interactions or contact between vessels or vessel crews,"" the email said.The crew from China will not leave their vessel, with communication between crews only by radio. The email said MTS staff who are physically involved with attaching the new barges have gone through 14 days of self-isolation, as have the Chinese crew members.Nunakput MLA Jackie Jacobson said the new barges are going to be a big deal for his riding and other Arctic coastal communities.""It just reassures, having new barges in place that are able to carry as much fuel as we need for these communities. Instead of doing two trips a year, they are able to do it all in one,"" said Jacobson.""I'm looking forward to making sure that all my coastal communities are being serviced and I think this is a big step for our government working with the coastal communities.""""We haven't seen any big boats since last year, so it will be good to see,"" said Jacobson.Hagerman, with MTS, said the heavy-lift ship is slated to head overseas with the barges on July 28.It should arrive about 14 days later, depending on the weather.Hagerman said the new vessels won't be replacing any current barges, and although these vessels are generally used on the ocean, they can also be used on rivers.",0.1316830808080808,0.42580186480186477

42,China sentences 4th Canadian to death on drug charges in 2 years | CBC News,China has sentenced a fourth Canadian citizen to death on drug charges in less than two years following a sharp downturn in ties over the arrest of an executive of Chinese tech giant Huawei.,2020-08-07T08:07:28.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/canadian-death-sentence-china-1.5677675,"China has sentenced a fourth Canadian citizen to death on drug charges in less than two years following a sharp downturn in relations over the arrest of an executive of Chinese tech giant Huawei.Ye Jianhui was sentenced Friday by the Foshan Municipal Intermediate Court in the southern province of Guangdong. Ye had been found guilty of manufacturing and transporting drugs, the court said in a brief statement.Another suspect in the case was also given the death penalty and four others sentenced to between seven years and life in prison. Death sentences are automatically referred to China's highest court for review.Ties between Canada and China have soured over Canada's late 2018 arrest of Meng Wanzhou, a company executive and the daughter of Huawei's founder, at Vancouver's airport in at the request of the U.S., which wants her extradited to face fraud charges over the company's dealings with Iran.Her arrest angered Beijing, which calls it a political move aimed at constraining China's rise as a global technology power.Ye's sentencing comes a day after fellow Canadian Xu Weihong was given the death penalty by the Guangzhou Municipal Intermediate Court, also in Guandong province. Convicted Canadian drug smuggler Robert Schellenberg was sentenced to death in a sudden retrial shortly after Meng's arrest, and a Canadian citizen identified as Fan Wei was given the death penalty in April 2019 for his role in a multinational drug smuggling case.In apparent retaliation, China also detained former Canadian diplomat Michael Kovrig and Canadian entrepreneur Michael Spavor weeks after Meng's arrest, accusing them of vague national security crimes.Foreign Affairs Minister François-Philippe Champagne, reacting Thursday to news of Xu's sentence, said Ottawa was profoundly concerned.""We oppose the death penalty at every step of the way,"" Champagne said in an interview on CBC's Power and Politics. ""We have said it time and time and time again to the Chinese government and will continue to do that.""Champagne said Canada is trying to build an international coalition of nations to advocate against the arbitrary detention of foreign nationals and for consular access when they are detained.",-0.09277777777777778,0.2791666666666667
45,Canada building its own PPE network in China | CBC News,When Cargojet flight 1392 touched down in Hamilton on Saturday it brought with it millions of badly needed N95 respirator masks to help in the fight against COVID-19.,2020-04-13T08:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canada-building-own-ppe-supply-chain-in-china-1.5530259,"Note: This story was updated with new information on April 16, 2020.When Cargojet flight 1392 touched down in Hamilton on Saturday it brought with it millions of badly needed N95 respirator masks to help in the fight against COVID-19.The Boeing 767 was the third delivery of critical supplies arriving under a made-for-Canada plan set up with the help of diplomats and consultants in China, a warehouse in Shanghai, and two of Canada's airlines.The plan was born out of urgency. With the global market for medical supplies overwhelmed by chaos and acts of piracy, Canada needed to take some of the risk out of securing everything from badly needed medical masks to gowns to gloves. Federal bureaucrats and political staff handling procurement of medical supplies were frustrated by deliveries showing up late. Unreliable and profiteering brokers were driving prices through the roof. Rival countries were buying shipments out from under each other.Yesterday, we received our third shipment of supplies needed to help our front-line healthcare workers protect themselves and continue caring for Canadians. The shipment contained millions of N95 respirators.There are even stories circulating of unnamed countries sending government planes to China — ferrying suitcases stuffed with cash — to buy supplies right on the tarmac or at the factory door.""It is really a Wild West when it comes to buying medical supplies right now,"" Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland told reporters on April 6.That intense global competition comes as health professionals in Canada warn of extreme shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE) that they say is putting the lives of front-line workers at risk. Some staff have even walked off the job because of a lack of protective gear.What Canada hopes will be a partial solution got its start in the embassy in Beijing.Dominic Barton, Canada's ambassador to China, may be new to the world of diplomacy, but the former managing director of the management consulting firm McKinsey brings a deep understanding of the Chinese economy to his role. Prior to his ambassadorship, Barton also sat on the advisory board of the state-run China Development Bank. His experience is being put to use in the global bidding wars for medical supplies. ""We're lucky we have Barton,"" said a federal official working directly on the procurement efforts. ""He's a business person first. He has good links into China, gets China, gets Chinese business.""Barton redeployed much of the staff at Canada's embassy, consulates and trade offices all over China. The diplomatic staff flipped their role from selling Canada to the Chinese, to buying Chinese medical supplies for Canada.""We have engaged our embassy on the ground in efforts to ensure that our orders are delivered on schedule and those parties are also identifying new opportunities for us,"" Public Services and Procurement Minister Anita Anand said on April 7.  But Canada's diplomats lacked an intimate knowledge of China's medical manufacturing sector and supply chains. So Canada hired a multi-national management consulting firm to help officials navigate what had suddenly become the world's most competitive industry. Federal officials would not initially confirm the name of the consulting firm because of the sensitive nature of these operations, but a source with direct knowledge of the arrangement said it was not Barton's old firm McKinsey. The unnamed consulting firm is helping Canada identify which factories are more reliable in terms of delivering quality goods that will meet Canadian standards. Stories have been surfacing around the world of sub-par masks and other defective supplies arriving from China only to be sent back or thrown out.Public Services and Procurement Minister Anita confirmed April 16 that Deloitte Canada will provide assistance on transportation, receiving, storage services and customs clearances.Members of the Chinese diaspora in Canada are also using their business connections to help federal and provincial governments secure reliable supplies. Canada's plan helps. But it isn't foolproof. The Toronto Star reported that Canada recently received a shipment of badly needed testing swabs only to find they were contaminated with what is believed to be mould. ""Cutting deals and securing quality supplies quickly is probably the biggest challenge in this entire thing,"" said the official working on procurement. There is also the challenge of ensuring that what Canada orders actually arrives. Barton may know business and the consultants may know the supply chains, but none of that guarantees medical supplies actually make it to Canada. ""Ordering of course does not guarantee a delivery,"" Anand said recently. ""In order to make sure that goods find their way back to Canada, we are taking very serious steps on the ground.""Those steps include hiring France-based Bolloré Logistics — a global transportation and logistics firm that has operated in Shanghai since 1994 — to help with on-the-ground support, including the transportation and receiving of goods, to ensure the Canadian orders are delivered in as timely a fashion as possible and are not diverted to a higher bidder. Bolloré Logistics helps get the supplies from the factory to a secure warehouse in Shanghai near the airport where they can be stored while the company works on customs clearance. This is where the near shut-down of international travel that is crippling global airlines actually helps Canada. There is a sudden glut of planes and pilots available to fly and maintain a critical air bridge for medical supplies. The first two flights organized as part of this effort arrived in Toronto on April 1 and April 6, delivering a resupply of personal protective equipment. The April 6 flight arrived with about eight million surgical masks ordered by the federal government, and other orders made directly by the governments of Nova Scotia and Quebec. The federal government has secured an arrangement with Air Canada and Cargojet to run more supply flights from China once Bolloré Logistics has enough supplies in the warehouse ready to go. The Cargojet flight that landed in Hamilton was the most recent delivery. Air Canada is due to send planes to Shanghai this week to deliver additional shipments. Touchdown in Hamilton from Shanghai today <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/CJT1392?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#CJT1392</a> 75,000 pounds of Personal Protection Equipment for Canadian front line workers &amp; <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/GovtOfCanada?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#GovtOfCanada</a> Proud of our entire <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/Cargojet?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#Cargojet</a> team for all their hard work &amp; sacrifice. 🇨🇦✈️ <a href=""https://t.co/nakmWoxJNk"">pic.twitter.com/nakmWoxJNk</a>The plan is for the number of flights to grow as the supply chain in China is able to deliver more supplies. Airlines are working to be ready to meet the demand.On April 7, Air Canada's Vice President of Flight Operations Murray Strom issued an internal call for pilots to volunteer for special flight assignments to support this effort.""The government of Canada has requested Air Canada provide emergency airlift capabilities to operate cargo-only flights"" from Shanghai to Canada, Strom wrote to his pilots in a memo obtained by CBC News. Strom specifically asked pilots trained to fly Boeing 777s and 787s to step up — suggesting there could be as many as four daily flights travelling to Shanghai via Japan. ""This operation will require a lot of pilots over the next seven to 10 days to assist both Canada and our airline to make this happen,"" Strom wrote. ""These are truly unique times we are going through, but we all need to be willing to do our part to assist our fellow Canadians who are going through some very tough times.""On Saturday Air Canada publicly announced that it was boosting its cargo capacity by stripping the seats out of three of its enormous Boeing 777 aircraft to double their cargo capacity.""Bringing critical medical and other vital supplies rapidly to Canada and helping distribute them across the country is imperative to combating the COVID-19 crisis,"" Tim Strauss, vice-president of cargo at Air Canada, said in a statement. We’re transforming three of our <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/B777s?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#B777s</a> to transport goods in the cabin, thereby doubling their cargo capacity to help fly critical medical and vital supplies to and across Canada.

But it's backstopping a still-fragile supply chain in a time of great stress. To further reduce risk, Canada is buying from as many Chinese factories as possible so it doesn't become reliant on a single operator. The idea is to reduce the exposure from having a manufacturing line bought out by a rival country or being left vulnerable due to a sudden drop in quality from a specific supplier. ""These supply chains are complex,"" Anand said on April 7. ""But we are taking every effort to make sure that we get those goods back to Canada and in the hands of front-line health-care workers.""The global procurements are part of what Public Services and Procurement Canada calls an ""aggressive approach"" to getting PPE for front-line workers, including bulk-buying for the provinces and scaling up domestic manufacturing capacity. Provinces and territories are also taking steps to build their own inventory of supplies.""We are exploring all options for securing the necessary equipment and supplies to fight COVID-19, through both domestic and international supply chains, to ensure that front-line health-care workers across the country are equipped and protected in the fight against COVID-19,"" spokesperson Michèle LaRose said in an email.",0.06809925719321691,0.3972871088642899

She's got a ticket booked for Sept. 15, but isn't sure how she'll be allowed to board the flight unless she's able to get tested for COVID-19 within three days of the trip. Speaking through Guo, the new grandmother told CBC that she worries for her husband, who is in poor health and lives alone in China. She also said she brought only enough medication for a few months, and has been using less of it to stretch out what she's got. That supply is quickly running out. Guo said those wishing to travel internationally and require a negative COVID-19 test for travel are willing to pay the costs of being tested.They can't get them done privately, even if that were an available option, because the Chinese government specifies that for travel from Canada, the tests need to be administered by institutions designated or recognized by the Chinese embassy or consulates in Canada.In P.E.I., the only acceptable tests would be administered by the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Charlottetown or the Prince County Hospital in Summerside. Officials with the Chief Public Health Office say they are working on the possibility of a testing option for travel purposes, but don't have any additional details at this time. They say more countries are requesting this as a prerequisite for entry for travel so they do plan to address this.No timelines have been provided, however.",0.06605826605826605,0.36719121719121717

The United States is responsible for all this,"" Wang said.

The notice gave no indication of what prompted the warning.On Tuesday, the Trump administration ordered the Houston consulate closed within 72 hours. It alleged Chinese agents tried to steal data from facilities including the Texas A&M medical system.The ministry on Thursday rejected the allegations as ""malicious slander"" and warned the Houston consulate's closure was ""breaking down the bridge of friendship"" between the two countries.The United States has an embassy in Beijing and consulates in five other mainland cities — Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu, Shenyang and Wuhan. It also has a consulate in Hong Kong, a Chinese territory.The Chengdu consulate was in the news in 2012 when Wang Lijun, the police chief of the major city of Chongqing, visited and told American officials his concerns about the death of a British business associate of the wife of Chongqing's Communist Party secretary, Bo Xilai.That prompted the British Embassy to ask for a new investigation, which led to the arrest and conviction of Bo's wife. Bo was later dismissed and sentenced to prison.The consulate was surrounded by police while Wang was inside. He later emerged and was arrested and sentenced to 15 years on charges of corruption and defection. The U.S. government has refused to confirm whether Wang asked for asylum.Also Thursday, the U.S. Justice Department said it believes the Chinese Consulate in San Francisco is harbouring a Chinese researcher, Tang Juan, who is accused of lying about her background in the Communist Party's military wing on a visa application.The department announced criminal charges of visa fraud against Tang and three other Chinese researchers.U.S. authorities this week announced criminal charges against two Chinese computer hackers who are accused of targeting companies that are working on vaccines for the coronavirus.WATCH | Pompeo takes aim at China in Nixon Library speech:NewsThe Justice Department said Tang lied on a visa application last October as she made plans to work at the University of California, Davis, and again during an FBI interview months later.U.S. officials including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have stepped up accusations of technology theft.

He was ordered to not take ""negative"" images, but he secretly snapped thousands of illegal pictures that displayed the harsh truth of the decade.In May 1966, Chairman Mao Zedong announced the start of the Cultural Revolution, which effectively purged the Communist Party ranks and consolidated power for Mao. It resulted in economic stagnation, hunger, persecution, and bloodshed that left at least half a million people dead. Li's job with the newspaper Heilongjiang Daily allowed him to document a period of massive upheaval in China. He hid thousands of negatives under the floorboards in his apartment. Years later, he published some of them in his book Red-Color News Soldier. The images have also been displayed in exhibits around the world.  The New York Times has called his pictures, ""perhaps the most complete and nuanced pictorial account of the decade of turmoil ignited by Mao Zedong.""Robert Pledge is the director of the photographic agency Contact Press Images and editor of Red-Color News Soldier. Here is part of his conversation with As It Happens host Carol Off. I just want to say just for people who don't know the Cultural Revolution or don't remember, this was an extraordinary period of time ... from 1966 to 1976. It's believed that maybe a million and a half people were killed during that time. Tens of millions were persecuted for ""revisionism."" And he was able to get some very candid photos. How did he do that? How is he able to get access to these moments?Because he was a newspaper photographer, and therefore allowed to carry a camera, which most people were not allowed to do during that very turbulent period. It was a very violent period of time where parents were denounced by children. People were publicly humiliated. Hundreds of thousands, possibly millions of people were killed [or] committed suicide. He worked for a newspaper. And therefore, he was part of the propaganda machine, if you will. And that gave him some protection. Unlike most of his colleagues, he realized that this event would be very profound and long lasting. And he sensed that this was an event that was so huge that he had to record it and go beyond being part of the propaganda purpose.Did he set out to do that? At the beginning did ... he know that he was going to be exposing the dark side of the Cultural Revolution when he set out?No, of course not.I think in May 1966 … Chairman Mao declared that China would undergo Cultural Revolution and that would happen every seven years in China. Li Zhensheng was ... a young photographer [who] thought that was terrific for his career. The only problem is that very quickly he realized that this Cultural Revolution had everything but ... culture. Temples and churches were being destroyed, statues were being broken down. People were being mistreated. There was nothing cultural about it. That's when he realized that he had to record what he was seeing, what he was experiencing for history. So there's something very interesting and unique in his situation because he was, on the one hand, the propaganda photographer, and on the other hand, the undercover photographer who was recording the reality — the things that were really happening — and taking great risks doing that.Just for an example, can you give us some of the most striking images. There's so many of them, but what are the ones that really do expose that dark side?In the early stages of the movement, '66, '67, there were these massive rallies of young Red Guards. Teenagers ... would publicly humiliate members of the establishment — political establishment, if you will — the governor, the general secretary of the party, the professors, the teachers, even the parents. And they would bring them out in the stadium … to publicly humiliate them. [They] had them stand on a chair with their hands tied behind their backs [to] be shouted at and whipped and mistreated in public. I mean, it was devastating. So many people committed suicide as a result. They weren't necessarily killed right there on the spot. For instance, the governor of Heilongjiang Province, Li Fanwu, was brought up and stood on a chair. And young kids 12, 13, 14 years of age would shave his hair off — tear his hair off to humiliate him because they accuse him of wanting to look like Chairman Mao with his hairstyle. And that they noted [the governor's] ambition, political ambition.And Li Zhensheng photographed these moments. He photographed them and he realized that they would never be published.How did he conceal the photos?He would then process the film [and] he would edit the film. [He would] choose the pictures and all the images on his negatives that he knew were politically incorrect, if you will, all those negatives that were negative, he would cut them out and then he would bundle them. And he ended up burying them under the floorboard of his very small apartment.We know that Li Zhensheng's photos have been seen around the world, that they are famous images. But he had only limited access ... to mainland China. How important was it that people in China should see his work of the Cultural Revolution? His main objective in life since he retired was to have his images be seen by the younger generation of Chinese who were never told much by their parents or grandparents who felt embarrassed or ashamed [or] traumatized by the events.You had to remember that some families were torn between those who supported the Cultural Revolution and those who now opposed it.

So, be careful. There's a lot of fake news,"" he said  As for the concentration camps, as you call it ... actually it was used to be vocational training centres.""PoliticsHe stuck to Beijing's often-repeated position that the camps were necessary to quell the unrest from a few years ago.""So, that's why the government had to take preventative measures when it comes to counter-terrorism,"" he said.Cong also faced questions about the detention of two Canadians, Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig, who have been held for over year, an action widely seen as retaliation for the arrest of Chinese telecommunication executive Meng Wanzhou by federal authorities.She is wanted in the U.S. in connection with the alleged violation of Iranian sanctions by her company, Huawei.Cong insisted Spavor and Kovrig are being treated fairly according to Chinese law, although he would not say when the country will present evidence to back up the claims of security officials that the two men are spies and a threat to national security. He faced several questions about the case during the panel discussion and afterward when speaking with journalists. The ambassador did suggest the frosty relationship between Canada and China has thawed a bit because of the Liberal government's measured response to the outbreak of the novel coronavirus. ""I would like to commend and appreciate what the Canadian side has done so far in the fight against the outbreak,"" Cong said. ""I think, first, it has adopted a cool-headed approach and an evidence-based manner.""Expressions of ""support, solidarity and sympathy"" by Canada have been also appreciated, he added.Politics",0.06666666666666668,0.32905982905982906

He lives with his girlfriend, who is Chinese. Wuhan is where the virus that has brought the world to its knees was first detected, and the city has been on lockdown every since. That is now easing, with people allowed out of their homes. ""We left our apartment a little bit at the beginning to go grocery shopping, when it wasn't so strict, but then about a week into that they said you can't go out at all. Now we have our groceries brought to us,"" Henshaw said. It's been 62 days since people have been told to stay indoors, and Henshaw said that like here in Canada, people have been getting together using social media, with entire neighbourhoods arranging for large grocery delivery orders that get dropped off at doorsteps. ""Someone from the community will say, 'Hey, I need vegetables, does anyone else need vegetables?' and then 50 people get together, and one person contacts the grocery store and send a city bus filled with food,"" Henshaw said. ""The bags get dropped off and the individuals pick up their bags and go back home."" Henshaw has help from his girlfriend, with whom he lives, so he can order food and navigate other parts of life in China without knowing the language very well. He's been spending his time like many Canadians are now — reading, watching movies and television (he's partial to Schitt's Creek) and working out from home, as well as learning to make Chinese dumplings.

He and four others who worked for the same Hong Kong publishing company all went missing around the same time, only to turn up months later in police custody in mainland China.The Ningbo Intermediate People's Court announced Tuesday that it gave Gui, a naturalized Swedish citizen, a 10-year prison sentence. Gui admitted to his crime, agreed with the sentence and will not appeal, the court said.For years, Gui sold gossipy books about Chinese leaders in the semi-autonomous Chinese region of Hong Kong. His was among a spate of high-profile disappearances that stirred unease over the central government's growing reach in Hong Kong, a former British colony that has been promised greater democratic rights than are afforded the mainland.China maintains tight control over all information and brooks no criticism of its ruling Communist Party. It has detained scores of lawyers, writers and public intellectuals. In recent months, police have reprimanded medical workers who warned about the ongoing outbreak of a new virus that originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan.Amnesty International's China researcher Patrick Poon said the verdict demonstrated that ""the Chinese authorities are not letting the coronavirus crisis distract them from repressing dissidents.""""Despite the authorities' claim that Gui has somehow handed over `intelligence' while in their custody, the reason for his targeting almost certainly relates to his attempted trip to Beijing with two Swedish diplomats in 2018,"" Poon said in an emailed statement.The court claims that Gui, who was born in Ningbo, applied to reinstate his Chinese citizenship in 2018. That would mean renouncing his Swedish citizenship, as China does not officially allow dual citizenship.He was initially released into house arrest in Ningbo, then police detained him once again while he and two Swedish diplomats were on a train together bound for Beijing.""We have noted the reports and are now seeking official confirmation about the case,"" the Swedish foreign ministry said in an email to The Associated Press. ""We have consistently made it clear that we demand Gui Minhai be released so that he can be reunited with his daughter and family.""The foreign ministry said that Sweden was not given access to the trial, and that officials there were unable to review the indictment or offer Gui access to legal counsel.""We demand — once again — that we immediately be given consular access,"" the ministry said.Gui's arrest has been a source of friction between Beijing and Stockholm. In November, Sweden's culture minister awarded the bookseller the annual Tucholsky literary prize despite a threat from the Chinese ambassador to ban her from entering the country.Standing next to Gui's empty seat at a ceremony in Stockholm, Culture Minister Amanda Lind said it was ""crucial for culture and democracy that artists and authors can work freely.""Human rights groups have repeatedly accused China of extracting forced confessions from individuals it perceives to be opponents of the Communist Party's rule.""We demand Gui Minhai's release,"" Swedish Foreign Minister Ann Linde told Sweden's public broadcaster SVT.She stressed that Sweden was not informed about the trial and that the country will use ""all diplomatic tools"" to protest.""We got no information that this was going on and had not had access to either the trial or been allowed to see the charges,"" Linde told SVT. ""This is not at all in line with how diplomatic consular work is going. We have the right to gain access to Swedish citizens. We have demanded it, but didn't get it.""Repeating an assertion often made by Beijing when its judicial system faces scrutiny, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said at a daily briefing, ""China is a country ruled by law.""""Gui Minhai's legal rights and interests have been fully protected,"" Zhao said, adding that China opposes outside interference into its internal affairs.",-0.023516499224046396,0.21370885403904266

But China has pledged to buy $32 billion worth of American agricultural products over the next two years, including lobster and other seafood products.Rahaman says the Chinese government has the clout to compel its companies to switch back to lobster from the United States.He calls it ""pseudo-capitalism.""""They have private corporations who are heavily indebted to state-owned banks and, through that channel, China can actually direct trade and commerce,"" he said.""I understand there is a lot of skepticism on whether they will actually follow through on the promises they have made.

Of the new deaths, all were in central Hubei province, the epicentre of the virus outbreak. In the provincial capital of Wuhan, 48 people died.Across China, there were 3,235 new confirmed infections on Monday, bringing the total number so far to 20,438.Meanwhile, Hong Kong reported its first coronavirus death Tuesday, according to local news broadcaster TVB, the second fatality outside mainland China.The 39-year-old male had previously been reported by local authorities as having an underlying illness. Hong Kong has had 15 confirmed cases including one that was transmitted locally. With Wuhan and some other Chinese cities in virtual lockdown, travel severely restricted, and China facing increasing international isolation, fears of wider economic disruption are growing.Earlier Monday, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported the number of confirmed cases outside China had reached 153. WHO said the number of cases will keep growing because tests are pending on thousands of suspected cases.Reopening of schools was also delayed to keep the virus from spreading further in Hubei, where the 1,000-bed hospital in the provincial capital Wuhan was completed in just 10 days. A second hospital with 1,500 beds will open within days. Restrictions were tightened still further in one city by allowing only one family member to venture out to buy supplies every other day.Separately, a Chinese woman suspected of spreading the virus asymptomatically while in Germany for a business meeting on Jan. 20, was determined, in fact, to be exhibiting symptoms. The German government's public health agency wrote to the New England Journal of Medicine, which first falsely reported the case on Thursday, to correct the mistake. The report had stoked fears that the outbreak could be much harder to control if people could spread the virus before they appeared sick. Medical teams from the People's Liberation Army were arriving in Wuhan to relieve overwhelmed health workers and to work at the new hospital, located in the countryside far from the city centre. Its prefabricated wards, where patients began arriving by late morning, are equipped with state-of-the-art medical equipment and ventilation systems.Leading Chinese epidemiologist Zhong Nanshan said additional hospital space was crucial to stopping the spread of new infections.""The lack of hospital rooms forced sick people to return home, which is extremely dangerous. So having additional [beds] available is a great improvement,"" Zhong told state broadcaster CCTV.Zhong played a major role in overcoming China's 2002-2003 outbreak of SARS, a coronavirus from the same family as the current pathogen.WATCH | What we actually know about the coronavirus:CBC NewsIn a sign of the economic toll of the outbreak, China's Shanghai Composite index plunged 8.7 per cent when it reopened Monday following the Lunar New Year holiday. It steadied later on the central bank's moves to inject cash.""We are fully confident in and capable of minimizing the epidemic's impact on economy,"" Lian Weiliang, deputy chief of the National Development and Reform Commission, said at a news conference in Beijing.Meanwhile, health ministers from the Group of Seven (G7), which includes Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the U.K., the U.S., and the EU, agreed to co-ordinate their response to dealing with coronavirus on Monday, the German health ministry said.The ministers agreed to co-ordinate their approach on travel regulations and precautions, research into the new virus and co-operation with WHO and China.""An appropriate response to the virus can only be co-ordinated internationally and at European level. Because a virus knows neither borders nor nationalities,"" German Health Minister Jens Spahn said in a statement.Canada's public health agency says there have been four confirmed coronavirus cases here — three in Ontario and one in B.C. The overall risk to Canadians from the disease is low, the Public Health Agency of Canada says. The first two confirmed cases were reported in Toronto after a couple returned from a trip to China that officials said included travel to the Wuhan area. One patient was treated in hospital and then released. The other was in self-isolation in their home.The next case was confirmed in B.C., and the most recent case was in London, Ont. Both of these patients had travelled to the Wuhan area in China.In Canada, efforts continued Monday to get Canadians who want to leave out of the affected area.Ottawa is currently working with China to arrange flights out of Wuhan for more than 300 Canadians. It's not yet clear when the flight will happen, but Foreign Affairs Minister François-Philippe Champagne said planning is well underway and a second plane will be available if needed.Canada's Health Minister Patty Hajdu said Monday there's no indication that any of the Canadians who have asked for help getting out of Wuhan have the coronavirus. Hajdu also noted that officials don't expect that anybody with symptoms of the virus would be allowed by Chinese authorities to get on the flight.Even without signs of the virus, Canadians who are on the flight out of Wuhan will be quarantined at a military base for two weeks to prevent the spread of the virus, Global Affairs Canada said over the weekend.Brazil will join Canada and a number of other nations by repatriating their citizens from Wuhan, said Brazilian Health Minister Luiz Henrique Mandetta on Monday, adding the country will declare a national health emergency later in the week. On Monday, the CDC confirmed that there had been a second case of person-to-person transfer of the coronavirus. The first such case in the U.S. had been reported last week. The U.S. said Sunday that Americans who had travelled in China within the last 14 days would be routed to designated airports for enhanced health screenings and most non-Americans who recently were in China would be denied entry.Carrie Lam announced Monday that Hong Kong will shut almost all land and sea border control points to the mainland from midnight to stem the spread of the virus. She said only two border checkpoints — at Shenzhen Bay and the bridge to Macao and Zhuhai — will remain open.Lam denied that the move was due to pressure from medical workers. Some hospital workers went on strike Monday and more threatened to walk out on Tuesday unless the government agrees to talks.Hong Kong has recorded 15 cases of the virus and has cut flights and train and bus connections to the mainland, but a push is growing for it to close the border completely.Strike organizers say about 6,000 medical staff were prepared to participate. Hong Kong was severely impacted by the SARS outbreak, which many believe was intensified by official Chinese secrecy and obfuscation.This, on same day Beijing denounces foreign governments (esp US) who have moved to close borders to travelers from China, calling the moves ‘unnecessary’ and ‘excessive’.

Vietnam's confirmed cases increased to eight, including a Vietnamese American man who had a two-hour layover in Wuhan on his way from the U.S. to Ho Chi Minh City.Amid accusations of a slow official response to the outbreak, six officials in the city of Huanggang, next to Wuhan in Hubei province, were fired over ""poor performance"" in handling the outbreak, the official Xinhua News Agency reported. It cited the mayor as saying the city's ""capabilities to treat the patients remained inadequate and there is a severe shortage in medical supplies such as protective suits and medical masks.""The trading and manufacturing centre of Wenzhou, with nearly 10 million people in coastal Zhejiang province, confined people to their homes, allowing only one family member to venture out every other day to buy necessary supplies.

Ghebreyesus said at a media briefing Monday. ""An advanced team of WHO experts has just arrived in China, led by Dr. Bruce Aylward, to lay the groundwork for the larger international team.""I’ve just been at the airport seeing off members of an advance team for the <a href=""https://twitter.com/WHO?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">@WHO</a>-led <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/2019nCoV?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#2019nCoV</a> international expert mission to <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/China?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#China</a>, led by Dr Bruce Aylward, veteran of past public health emergencies.Tedros said Aylward will be working with between 10 and 15 colleagues, who have yet to be named, and their Chinese counterparts to get the ""right expertise on the team to answer the right questions"" about the outbreak.Limited information has been provided publicly about the team's mission or where specifically it will be operating — and it has taken them two weeks to get into China at a critical time during the outbreak. A native of St. John's, N.L., Aylward joined WHO in 1992 after completing his medical training at Memorial University, the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine and the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health.CBC News was unable to reach Aylward for an interview, but a spokesperson for WHO said they would provide more information about the mission as it becomes available.""Bruce has always been adventuresome. He chose a career that was cutting edge in terms of world health,"" said Dr. Ian Bowmer, the president of the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada and a former Memorial University professor who Aylward credited for his interest in infectious diseases. ""I think he's incredibly well positioned to take the lead for the World Health Organization.""Aylward is highly experienced in infectious disease control, having led WHO's response to the Ebola outbreak in West Africa and mass immunization programs throughout Asia, and has been instrumental in the ongoing efforts to eradicate polio worldwide.In 1998, he headed up WHO's collaboration with the Global Polio Eradication Initiative, a public-private partnership with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.""He was essentially the person who led the initiative related to the eradication of polio for WHO,"" said former Ontario Chief Medical of Health Dr. Arlene King. ""He's very familiar with the landscape in China and some of the sensitivities that he will need to navigate in order to be ... successful there."" With more than 50 million people in quarantine near the epicentre of the outbreak in the central Chinese province of Hubei, Aylward is entering a ""complex and difficult situation"" but he is a ""trusted voice,"" said senior WHO adviser Dr. Chris Maher.""China has really pulled out all the stops in trying to respond to [the outbreak], so it's not an easy situation to be operating in,"" Maher said. ""But I think this is right up Bruce's alley, it's the sort of thing that he enjoys and does well, so he's a good choice to go in.""From 2014 to 2016, Aylward helped develop WHO's Health Emergencies Programme and directed more than 2,000 people in WHO's on-the-ground response to the Ebola outbreak in West Africa.Aylward also led WHO's response to the Zika virus outbreak in Latin America and Caribbean nations in 2016, declaring a global public health emergency and investigating the link between the virus and microcephaly.""He has had to deal with governments at the highest levels in all regions of the world, and all of those experiences have to be very important for him in China,"" said former U.S. ambassador John Lange, the UN Foundation Senior Fellow for Global Health Diplomacy.""It's hard to imagine that there are many people in the world with such varied experiences directly relevant to the kind of work that he's doing."" Aylward's career is not without criticism, however. He faced backlash for WHO's handling of the effort to fight the Ebola epidemic in 2014. An investigation by the Associated Press in 2015 found a string of avoidable errors badly undermined the work of international aid workers, including a lack of resources, expired supplies and a delay in declaring an international emergency.Aylward, who was then WHO's top Ebola official, said it was common for Ebola treatment centres to be caught up in political wrangling. ""Undoubtedly in some cases there was bureaucracy,"" he said at the time, adding it was wrong to lay the blame at WHO's door. ""These were government decisions at the end of the day.""But a quicker and more effective response to the epidemic from WHO would have resulted in far fewer deaths, said Dr. Irwin Redlener, director of the National Center for Disaster Preparedness at Columbia University in New York, at the time. ""I personally would have no confidence that the same team at WHO would be able to handle the next international outbreak,"" Redlener told the Associated Press. ""We've already seen what the old leadership at WHO has been able to do, so I don't know why we would expect them to be able to right themselves.""",0.12537351902483482,0.3974438938254728
156,Tense times for Newfoundlander in China as fears of coronavirus rise | CBC News,Chris Walsh has seen his city of 12 million people turn into a ghost town. Masks have become mandatory and police in hazmat suits are sweeping the streets.,2020-01-30T11:30:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/coronavirus-chris-walsh-xi-an-1.5444300,"Chris Walsh has seen his city of 12 million people turn into a ghost town, as surgical masks have become mandatory and police in hazmat suits are sweeping the streets.Originally from St. John's, Walsh lives in the Chinese city of Xi'an. Situated one province to the south is Hubei, whose capital city, Wuhan, is considered the epicentre of the recent coronavirus outbreak.""It's a bit tense,"" Walsh told The St. John's Morning Show. ""There's a lot of people who are afraid. Everybody is staying inside, staying at home, trying to be safe.""Walsh, who is married to a Chinese woman, moved to Xi'an eight months ago with their two-year-old son.They've found themselves in a state of fear around a potentially deadly virus. As of Wednesday, 6,000 people had been infected, and 132 people are confirmed dead.Coronaviruses are a broad group of viruses that can include the common cold but also more severe respiratory illnesses like SARS. The recent outbreak involves a specific strain known as 2019-nCoV.Millions of people fled Wuhan before the city was locked down. Authorities are now stopping people on buses and at checkpoints around Xi'an, looking for people who may have left.""They're looking for Wuhan people, or from the province of Hubei,"" Walsh said. The last time they attempted to take the highway, Walsh and his family were stuck at a checkpoint for two hours as authorities checked the temperatures of each person passing through. He watched as they took a person out of the car behind them, alleging he was from Wuhan.Walsh's temperature had a high reading on the first test, but registered as normal on a second test. They were allowed to pass through.He drew comparisons to the state of emergency in Newfoundland last week, saying all stores are closed except for essential retailers, like grocery stores and gas stations.While only 56 people have been infected in his entire province, Walsh said the concerns are still rising as they watch the numbers increase day after day in the neighbouring province of Hubei.""You don't know how quickly this is going to spread and you don't know how deadly it can be.""The family has an important decision to make this week. They had planned a vacation to Japan for the first week of February, but are now considering whether it's safer to leave the country, or if going to the busy airport will only put them at a greater risk.""We have to make a big decision on what is safest for our family,"" he said.In Canada, the risk remains low. A husband and wife in Ontario are the only two confirmed cases in Canada, while there is one presumptive case in British Columbia.On Wednesday afternoon, Air Canada announced it was suspending flights to Beijing and Shanghai.Read more from CBC Newfoundland and Labrador",0.04553523035230352,0.44125338753387544

North Korean leader Kim Jong-un's outbursts gave him plenty to work on.But it has been hard for the demure, precise professor of political science to ignore an increasingly assertive Beijing, its provocative actions and the amount of time and political energy being expended by Japan's leaders on the China relationship.While acknowledging China is an ""indispensable"" economic power for his country and Western nations, Nishino said the policy of engagement based solely on trade and business interests has failed.""We have to keep in mind that China is a very different regime,"" he told CBC News in a recent interview. ""China is not a democratic country. China is an authoritarian system. So we always need to pay close attention.""Since the 1990s, Western countries — with Canada in the vanguard — have pursued a policy of helping Beijing build up an affluent middle class through liberalized trade and investment, in the long-term hope that it would lead to a more democratic country.Over the last several years, however, it has become apparent, in a variety of ways, that the Chinese leadership has no interest in moving in that direction.China's President Xi Jinping, with the full support of his party, rewrote the country's constitution in March 2018 and scrapped term limits, essentially allowing him to stay in office for life.The surprise move came as Beijing pressed claims over the South China Sea, built up its military and launched a global infrastructure plan known as the Belt and Road Initiative.The country also drastically enhanced domestic security and enforced ideological purity standards in schools and the media.At the same conference that extended his grip on power, Xi told Chinese lawmakers and political advisers that his country's brand of authoritarian capitalism is a ""new type of political party system"" that would benefit the rest of the world.""From the Japanese perspective, clearly, China is trying to create its own new order, not only in East Asia, but the world,"" said Nishino.A year ago, writing in the Qiushi Journal, the Chinese Communist Party's (CCP) main theoretical magazine, Xi insisted that his country ""must never copy the models or practices of other countries.""Western-style separation of powers — the bedrock of democratic institutions — held no appeal for China, Xi wrote, arguing that the party must remain supreme.""We must never follow the path of Western 'constitutionalism,' 'separation of powers' or 'judicial independence,''' Xi wrote.Those sentiments made Nishino and other China-watchers sit up and take notice.""We and China have very different values and we need to keep this in mind,"" said Nishino, who has been speaking to Canadian officials and audiences over the past week.After an initial flurry of interest among Europeans in the Belt and Road Initiative, he said, there now seems to be a wariness among Western countries — and they'd do well to avoid the plan.During President Barack Obama's second term, the U.S. recognized that China had changed and began to take a harder line. Such an approach is more difficult for Japan to take because of geography.Relations between Tokyo and Beijing run hot and cold, thanks in large part to tension over eight uninhabited islands — little more than hunks of rock — in the East China Sea.Both countries lay claim to the islands, which are known as the Diaoyu islands in China and as the Senkaku islands in Japan.But China remains Japan's most important trading and economic partner and the business communities in both countries have tried to keep a positive and constructive relationship going.The challenge of keeping that constructive relationship alive is more intense in Japan than it is in Canada, but the problems facing both countries are not dissimilar. China is deeply embedded in the supply chains of Western democracies.And there lies the problem shared by Canada and Japan, Nishino said. Japan has been trying to strike a balance between a tough security policy and a healthy trading relationship. The Trump administration can afford to be bellicose and fight a trade war with China. Canada and Japan cannot.Japan has been working hard to find a way to ""co-exist"" with China without being pushed around, Nishino said.What's left unanswered — especially in light of Beijing's hostage diplomacy over Canada's detention and possible extradition of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou — is how difficult co-existence will be going forward.",0.07737134798823112,0.38752375330297406

455,What's it like being a nurse during the pandemic? These are some of their stories | CBC News,"The work nurses have done during the COVID-19 outbreak has been arduous, as well as a risk to their personal health, but they have persevered - here are some of their stories.",2020-12-09T09:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/nurses-pandemic-the-national-1.5821815,"(WARNING: This story contains graphic descriptions that may disturb or offend some readers.)There are close to 450,000 nurses in Canada. Some work in hospitals, some in long-term care homes, some are privately hired, but they all share one commonality. Since the beginning of COVID-19, they have been on the front lines of an international pandemic that has taken more than 1.4 million lives worldwide, including 12,000 in this country.The work they've done has been arduous and a risk to their personal safety and health, but they have persevered. The National talked to three nurses in three different provinces about their experiences, and these are their stories.Clarice Shen, 25, is an acute care nurse at Toronto's Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre. In January, just a year out of nursing school, she was caring for a patient who was exhibiting symptoms of a virus that didn't even have a name yet.He turned out to be the first patient to test positive with COVID-19 in Canada.""There was a lot of uncertainty, but as a team, we kind of came together and supported ourselves,"" Shen said.When it became clear the hospital needed to expand the intensive care unit, Shen volunteered to work in the ICU to support the staff there. She's been on 12-hour shifts in the ICU ever since.A number of the things she has experienced when dealing with COVID-19 patients were new to her.""From a nursing standpoint, the fact that a lot of patients with the virus get sick really, really fast — they can present to the hospital with very mild symptoms, and they can progress very, very quickly to the point where mechanical ventilation is needed — I was really taken aback. Because it is really traumatic to be put on a ventilator,"" Shen said.In her time in the ICU, Shen has helped care for dozens of COVID-19 patients and says most people don't realize how hard it is to be intubated.""I was caring for a patient on a ventilator and he had this thing where his body just on and off twitched, where his teeth would bite down on the ventilator. And his teeth were actually coming out, like, he bit off part of his tongue and his teeth were coming out, and there was blood everywhere,"" Shen said.As hospital rules changed, Shen has had to tell the families of seriously ill patients that they could no longer visit, or that they must cut visits short. She says she's tried to address the frustration she deals with daily by maintaining compassion.""I never imagined that I'd be in a position to tell someone 'you can't visit your loved one in the hospital,'"" Shen said.""I try to help them understand what it is that we're trying to do … helping them feel that I'm on their side, even though the situation might be really challenging.""And Shen has held the hands of many patients in the ICU while they passed. Too many times, she says, a patient's condition has worsened and they've succumbed to COVID-19 so quickly that their families couldn't get there in time.CBC NewsOne recent instance sticks in her mind, when she was at the bedside of a woman who died before her two daughters could get to the hospital. Shen was covering a break for the nurse who was the patient's primary care provider, so she didn't know the patient very well.""All I could really tell her is that I loved the colour of her nails, and that her hair was beautiful, and that her daughters loved her. So I eventually just told her over and over again that her daughters wished that they could be here,"" Shen said.""It's important she didn't feel alone. I mean, it's an honour and a privilege that I can be there for patients in their final moments.""As cases reach record highs in Toronto and the city finds itself in a second lockdown, Shen says she wishes people could see what she sees in one shift in the ICU. She thinks it would scare them as much as it does her, and help keep them vigilant against contracting or spreading the virus.""You know, last week you had two COVID patients in the hospital. And this week you have 15, and two waiting in the ER, and you have no beds in the ICU. And then you're trying to get people out of the ICU who would benefit, potentially, from a few more days of staying there, because you need that bed. So, that is scary for me,"" Shen said.Meaghan Thumath is a registered nurse who wears many hats.She works with homeless and marginalized communities in Vancouver's notorious downtown East side. She also teaches nursing, does clinical research, and participates in international deployments with The World Health Organization that have included work on Ebola and other outbreaks overseas.Since the outbreak of COVID-19, Thumath has been harnessing her experience to care for patients in Vancouver who are largely without other options.""Sometimes that can look like a homeless camp. Sometimes it's a single-room occupancy building that's owned by a private owner. Sometimes it's a homeless shelter, and sometimes it's a supported-housing facility,"" Thumath said. ""We find people where they are.""Thumath's patients are often dealing with many more issues than just possible exposure to COVID-19.""So we are seeing a sort of twinning of the overdose crisis as well as COVID-19. And then on top of that, people are still struggling with HIV, and Hepatitis C, and other infections,"" Thumath said.She points out that asking homeless people to self-isolate or quarantine when they are exposed to COVID-19 presents added challenges that most Canadians with a place to live can't begin to understand.Part of her job is also training shelter workers in best practices for when people with symptoms show up on their doorsteps.Thumath says she does the work, and takes the personal risks associated with it, because of how rewarding it is.""It's a huge honour, because people are so grateful for your help. I think if you can treat people with dignity, and be trauma-informed and understand sometimes people might be scared, generally people are extremely grateful,"" she said.CBC NewsThe personal risks she takes are significant. Thumath recently returned from a trip with the World Health Organization to South Africa, assisting with the pandemic response there.She was also part of the team that helped repatriate people from Wuhan, China, to Canadian Forces Base Trenton in the spring this year. It was on that assignment that Thumath contracted the virus herself.She says that experience helps her better understand what her patients are facing.The toll her work has had on her family is something that weighs on her as well. Thumath is married and has two children. She writes goodbye letters to them every time she is deployed somewhere in case she doesn't return.""I'm grateful to my husband for being supportive, but it does weigh on me,"" she says. ""That's the hardest thing — a drawer full of letters to them just in case I don't come back.""Shaye Fleming has been off work since September. That's when the 29-year-old caught COVID-19 while on a regular shift as a cardiac nurse at Calgary's Foothills Medical Centre.""It's been over two months now, and I'm just starting to feel a little bit back to normal,"" she said.""I still get quite short of breath, and this isn't like me, you know? I usually can run, walk, like, usually I'm quite active.""The ongoing impact of the virus has left Fleming frustrated, and feeling another emotion she says she wasn't expecting.""I've been experiencing a lot of anxiety with it as well. When you're young you think you'll be fine, and I was one of those people that wasn't worried about getting it. And so the fact that it has been a prolonged recovery period, and I'm lacking a lot of that stamina that I once had, yeah, it's been hard for sure,"" she said.Fleming has tried to return to work twice, but was unable to both times. Her symptoms have continued to be too debilitating.She hopes to try again this week. Not being able to go back to work has only added to her stress, she said.""I haven't been able to be there, and be a support for my co-workers and my colleagues,"" Fleming said. ""So, you know, that shame of not being able to go back to work when I felt like I should have been OK, that makes you feel pretty shameful as well.""As cases spike in Alberta and around the country, Fleming says she hopes people heed social distancing requirements and listen to public health officials. But she adds that regardless of how people approach the pandemic, nurses will always be there to care for them if they fall ill, even though providing that care means a risk to their own health.""We will care for your loved ones and for you, regardless of what you believe in and what you value at the moment during this pandemic,"" she said. ""Nurses will always be there for you.""CBC News",0.14864933741080533,0.49314601046252415

Sadly, as you all know, Canadian efforts in this area have so far been unsuccessful."" The committee has been examining Canada's relations with China, which have plummeted to an all-time low since December 2018.Earlier Tuesday, Conservative MP Michael Chong urged Foreign Affairs Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne to adopt a more consistent approach to getting tough with China. The Conservative foreign affairs critic told Champagne during a House of Commons committee meeting Tuesday that the government needs to show Canadians how it will deal with growing Chinese intimidation of Canadians within Canada. Chong said it is inconsistent for the government to be talking tougher on China, while Canada's current ambassador, Dominic Barton, is making speeches about the need to broaden trade with the People's Republic. ""I think it needs to be a lot clearer, a lot more consistent if Canada is going to have a clear, consistent voice with respect to China on the world stage,"" said Chong. Chong sponsored a motion that won approval in the Commons last week that calls on the government to decide within 30 days whether to allow China's Huawei Technologies to supply equipment for its next generation 5G internet network. Meng is a chief executive of Huawei. Champagne replied that Canada has taken a smart and firm approach with China lately that includes speaking out against its ill treatment of pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong and of ethnic Muslim Uighurs. ""Whether it comes to the Uighurs or whether it comes to Hong Kong, I've outlined places where we're going to challenge China, places where we're going to, for example, coexist with China,"" Champagne said.",0.04164578111946533,0.36879699248120307
471,"U.S. Congresswoman calls out Nike, Apple and Coca-Cola for lobbying against Uighur labour bill | CBC Radio",U.S. Democratic Congresswoman Jennifer Wexton says the onus should be on companies to prove their products weren't made using forced labour.,2020-12-02T22:55:13.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/radio/asithappens/as-it-happens-wednesday-edition-1.5825235/u-s-congresswoman-calls-out-nike-apple-and-coca-cola-for-lobbying-against-uighur-labour-bill-1.5825242,"Read Story TranscriptU.S. Democratic congresswoman Jennifer Wexton says the onus should be on companies to prove their products weren't made using forced labour. That's why she co-sponsored the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act and authored the Uyghur Forced Labor Disclosure Act, which aim to crack down on companies that profit off the persecution of Uighur Muslims in China.The UN estimates there are at least one million Uighurs in mass detention camps in the country's Xinjiang region, where they are forced into labour and so-called re-education programs. The Prevention Act would ban the use of products tied to the forced labour of Uighurs, while the Disclosure Act would force companies to report their ties to the Xinjiang region to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Both bills have passed through U.S. House of Representatives with bipartisan support and are now in the Senate.But some of the companies whose supply chains have ties to Xinjiang — including Apple, Nike, and Coca-Cola — are paying big money to lobbying firms to water down the bill, according to the New York Times.Coca-Cola told the Times it ""strictly prohibits any type of forced labour"" in its supply chain. Nike said it wasn't lobbying against the bill, but rather having ""constructive discussions"" with congressional staff about how to eliminate forced labour. Apple also denied trying to weaken the bill, stating that ""looking for the presence of forced labour is part of every supplier assessment we conduct and any violations of our policies carry immediate consequences, including business termination."" But Wexton says if these companies truly had nothing to hide, they would leave the bills alone. Here is part of her conversation with As It Happens host Carol Off. Just remind people what's going on in Xinjiang.Well, the Chinese government has been rounding up Uighur Muslims for years and putting them in camps and forcing them to work in factories, not just in Xinjiang but in other parts of China as well, solely for the crime of being Uighur. And it's horrifying and it needs to stop.There is evidence that they are being used in labour camps or in labour situations to manufacture, isn't [there]?Yes. And in fact, the Chinese Communist Party is building more and more of these camps and accelerating the use of them.The companies principally who are lobbying ... to have changes to your bills, are Apple, Nike, Coca-Cola [and] the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. What are they trying to do? What changes do they want to make to your laws? Well, I don't know, because they haven't come to me to try to make changes to my piece of legislation, but the word is that they're trying to water down some of the enforcement provisions while publicly proclaiming that they are very much against and condemning forced labour. They're going behind the scenes and trying to change the law.If they're against it, if they say that this is not in their interest, then why would they want to change your bills?Because it's going to impact their supply chains and make it harder for them to profit off of this forced labour. Which means that they're using the forced labour? If they're not using it, it wouldn't be a problem. But, you know, it appears that they are using it. And if they are auditing their supply chains the way they're supposed to, this legislation wouldn't be an issue. Is it also the case, though, that they just want more time ... to implement it, to change their supply chains in order to accommodate this?If they wanted more time, they can come to us and see about getting an extension of time to implement these rules and regulation. But, you know, as I said, they haven't approached me about it. How powerful are the lobbyists for these companies?They're quite powerful. I'm not particularly optimistic, but I know that we have a new administration coming in, in January. And I know that the incoming [Joe] Biden administration takes human rights very seriously. But we do know that the New York Times is reporting that there are millions of dollars being spent on the lobbying of Congress in order to alter these bills. Yes, and that means that there's a lot of money at stake for their profits... But, you know, it's hypocritical for them to, on the one hand, proclaim publicly that they are against the use of forced labour and then to profit from it and go behind the scenes to try to change this legislation.Coca-Cola told, in the statements to the New York Times, that they strictly prohibit the use of forced labour, that they have independent third-party audits to make sure that they have no forced labour in their supply chains. Nike says its suppliers are not using material from the Xinjiang region or from people from Xinjiang. And Apple says it has conducted an investigation of its suppliers in China and says they found no evidence of forced labour.What do you make of that?The Forced Labor Prevention Act would create a rebuttable presumption that any products coming from that region were produced with forced labour. So if, in fact, their auditing firms and the auditing processes have shown that it's not, then they would have nothing to fear from this legislation.Is it incumbent on the companies to prove that their supply chains do not include forced labour, or does the law have to come up with the evidence?I believe that it should be incumbent on the companies to provide this evidence and to prove that it's not.But, you know, if they aren't able to make those assertions and prove that affirmatively, then my legislation would just require that they make disclosures as a part of their [Securities and Exchange Commission] filing so that investors and consumers are aware that the goods that they purchase from these companies could be tainted by forced or slave labour.There's a Supreme Court case right now in Washington [in which] chocolate companies are claiming that it's not their fault if their suppliers are using child labour. That's a story we just did last night.Is it possible that companies just have no way of knowing what's in their supply chains?I think that companies have an affirmative duty to to ensure that their supply chains are not tainted with slave labour, and there are companies that ensure that they're not, and that [they] use fair practices and fair trade.And if these companies don't want to do that, they should just have to disclose it.Written by Sheena Goodyear.

It was designed to kill the American economy.""""To protect American workers, I withdrew the United States from the unfair and one-sided Paris climate accord, a very unfair act for the United States,"" Trump said in a video statement from the White House to the Group of 20 virtual summit hosted by Saudi Arabia. His comments came during a discussion among the world's largest economies on safeguarding the Earth.Trump, who has worked to undo most of Barack Obama's efforts to fight climate change when he was U.S. president, said that since withdrawing from the climate agreement, the U.S. has reduced carbon emissions more than any nation.That is true, but not that remarkable. With its giant economy, the U.S. has far more raw emissions of climate-damaging carbon dioxide to cut than any other country except China.A more telling measure of progress in various countries is to look at what percentage of emissions a country has cut. Since 2005, the U.S. hasn't been even in the top 10 in percentage of greenhouse gas emission reductions.More than 180 nations have ratified the accord, which aims to keep the increase in average temperatures worldwide ""well below"" 2 C and ideally no more than 1.5 C, compared with pre-industrial levels. Scientists say that any rise beyond 2 C could have a devastating impact on large parts of the world, raising sea levels, stoking tropical storms and worsening droughts and floods.The U.S. formally exited the Paris pact on Nov. 4. On Saturday, it formally left the Open Skies Treaty, which permits 30-plus nations to conduct unarmed observation flights over each other's territory. Those overflights were set up decades ago to promote trust and avert conflict.The administration said it wanted out of the treaty because Russia was violating the pact, and imagery collected during the flights can be obtained quickly at less cost from U.S. or commercial satellites.During the discussions at the climate session, President Xi Jinping of China, the world's largest emitter, said the G20 should continue to take the lead in tackling climate change and push for the full implementation of the Paris accord.""Not long ago, I announced China's initiative to scale up its nationally determined contributions and strive to peak carbon dioxide emissions by 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2060,"" he said. ""China will honour its commitment and see the implementation through.""India's prime minister, Narendra Modi, said that ""climate change must be fought not in silos, but in an integrated, comprehensive and holistic way.""",0.036394993894993885,0.4485592185592186

Gilbert Gapay said in a meeting with disaster-response officials.""We'll continue to look for the missing, help in damage assessment,"" Gapay said.The national police reported that the death toll had risen to at least 42 with 20 missing. The government's main disaster-response agency, which waits for provincial reports and follows a laborious process of verifying casualties, reported a much lower death count, causing confusion.Among the dead were at least 12 villagers who were dug out from mud and rockslides in the northern provinces of Cagayan and Nueva Vizcaya, police said.After slamming into northeastern Quezon province, Vamco gained strength with sustained winds of 155 km/h and gusts of up to 255 km/h. It blew north of metropolitan Manila overnight Wednesday, toppling trees and power poles, swelling rivers, flooding residential communities and setting off landslides and storm surges.In hard-hit Marikina city in the capital region and the towns of Rodriguez and Cainta in nearby Rizal province, several villages were inundated by water that reached the second and third floors of many houses, prompting hundreds of residents to flee to their roofs and call TV and radio networks or post desperate messages on social media. The panic was exacerbated by widespread power outages and loss of internet access.Videos of Marikina showed a thick coat of muddy water covering roads and staining houses and cars. Residents carried appliances and furniture from their homes and used pails and shovels to remove the mud after the water receded.In a televised meeting of Cabinet and disaster-response officials Friday, a reporter asked where President Rodrigo Duterte was, prompting an annoyed response from his spokesperson.""The president's whereabouts should not be asked. That's foolishness coming from the opposition. The president is not missing. He is always with us,"" Harry Roque said, without offering any further details.<a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/RedCross?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#RedCross</a> Laguna Chapter helping residents of flooded areas in Sta.

MacMillan argues that war — fighting and killing — is so intimately bound up with what it means to be human that viewing it as an aberration misses the point,"" said the New York Times.""MacMillan writes with impressive ease.

But human rights and pro-democracy advocates say Beijing's new national security law is undermining freedom in what is known as the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.""So if the Canadian side really cares about the stability and the prosperity in Hong Kong, and really cares about the good health and safety of those 300,000 Canadian passport holders in Hong Kong, and the large number of Canadian companies operating in Hong Kong SAR, you should support those efforts to fight violent crimes,"" Cong said.Cong also flatly rejected Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's assertion that China is engaging in coercive diplomacy by imprisoning two Canadian men in retaliation for the arrest of a Chinese high-tech executive on an American extradition warrant. Meng Wanzhou is living under house arrest in Vancouver while her case wends through a British Columbia court.In December 2018, China imprisoned Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor and charged them with undermining the country's national security.

516,Government quietly made 'back door' agreement with U.S. that could undermine treaty on plastic waste | CBC News,The Trudeau government quietly signed a protocol with the U.S. on October 26 that will allow Canada to continue to ship plastic waste to American waste brokers — opening a 'back door' that will allow it to evade the plastic waste shipping restrictions the federal government committed to under the Basel Treaty plastic ban.,2020-12-03T22:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canada-us-plastic-waste-basel-1.5827340,"Environmental groups are accusing the Trudeau government of acting in bad faith after it quietly signed a bilateral agreement with the U.S. that could allow it to evade some of its obligations to stop shipping plastic waste to poor countries around the world.The agreement — which was never publicly announced or gazetted — was signed on Oct. 26, 2020, the U.S. State Department told CBC News. Environment Canada declined CBC's requests to see the text. But experts on plastic waste say it runs counter to the spirit of the Basel Convention on plastic waste and appears to be designed to allow Canada to evade its obligations.""This is, in effect, a backdoor for Canada to offload its waste problems to the U.S., who will offload to the very countries potentially that the Basel Convention amendment is meant to stop,"" said Myra Hird of Queens University, a fellow of the Royal Society of Canada who represented Canada at the G7's microplastics summit last year.""It was not the spirit of the amendment and what we were proclaiming to sign on to.""The plastic waste amendments to the Basel Convention, which take effect on January 1, 2021, effectively limit nations to shipping plastic recyclables only to other signatory countries that are bound by the same rules.They also require prior informed consent from the receiving country.Canada accepted those amendments after a flood of negative publicity about Canadian plastic waste — much of it mislabelled as recyclable — being dumped in developing countries such as the Philippines and Cambodia.A dispute with the Philippines over the issue led to Manila recalling its ambassador to Ottawa, and only ended in May when the Canadian government paid to ship 69 containers of garbage back to Vancouver.Canada informed the UN on March 9 of this year that it ""supports and fully intends to comply"" with the ban.But the Trudeau government also sought to ensure it could use a loophole that allows countries to ship plastic waste to non-signatory nations if they do so under an existing bilateral agreement. The United States is one of only two countries never to ratify the Basel Convention; Haiti is the other. As such, the U.S. is not bound by the new rules on plastic waste. By signing the deal with the U.S. prior to ratifying the Basel plastic amendments, Canada keeps open the option of sending its waste to brokers south of the border.Once Canadian plastic waste enters the States, it can change hands several times. There is no reliable mechanism to track it and no way to ensure it is not re-exported to developing countries, where it often ends up in landfills or in the ocean.Environment and Climate Change Canada discussed the proposed agreement in a webinar with two environmental groups in September — the Canadian Environmental Law Association and Health and Environment Justice Support (HEJ Support) — thereby technically meeting its duty to consult. But most environmental groups that have consulted with the government on plastics say they were blindsided when they learned of the agreement at a U.S. State Department briefing three weeks after it was signed.""This was signed about five weeks ago now and it still is secret and no one has seen it, apart from those who signed it,"" said Kathleen Ruff, former head of the B.C. Human Rights Commission. She now heads Right On Canada, a group that campaigns against plastic pollution.Moira Kelly of Environment Canada confirmed the existence of the agreement to CBC News. ""In accordance with its obligations under the Basel Convention, Canada concluded an arrangement with the United States affirming that the waste subject to the arrangement and circulating between Canada and the U.S. is managed in an environmentally sound manner,"" she said.""This arrangement balances the need to manage the traded plastic waste in an environmentally sound manner in both Canada and the U.S. while reducing barriers to recycling, developing secondary markets and meeting domestic goals, such as recycled content. Maintaining circulation of these materials between Canada and the U.S. can also disincentivize exports overseas.""The Basel treaty amendments require any such bilateral agreement to meet standards as high as, or higher than, those in the treaty, which is legally binding.Kelly said the U.S.-Canada deal ""affirms"" that ""waste moving between Canada and the U.S. is managed in an environmentally sound manner."" When pressed on the meaning of the word ""affirms,"" however, Environment Canada conceded that the agreement with the U.S. is not legally binding.Hird said that makes all the difference.""If this bilateral agreement allows us to get around that in any way, then we're taking a step backwards, we're not taking a step forward,"" she said.""It's more of a pretence of complying, a gesture of complying,"" said Ruff. ""According to the legal experts we've talked to who are experts on the convention, it's a violation of the convention.""Although the Trudeau government has portrayed itself as a global leader in the struggle to control plastic waste, Canada is one of just three countries among the 188 Basel signatory nations that have yet to ratify the plastic ban amendments. The other two are China and Turkey.The government tabled the amendments in Parliament on Oct. 28. Kelly said ""the Government of Canada is working to complete the ratification process as soon as possible and we continue to aim for ratification on or before January 1.""People who work in the field question why Canada is the only developed country in the Basel Treaty not to ratify the plastic accords.""It's difficult to see that in any kind of good faith,"" said Hird. ""It's difficult to see this ratification, this delay in ratification as being justified at all, in terms of bureaucratic necessity. So I think, really, this will be seen by Canadians as stalling.""Ruff said the situation is an example of the yawning gap between government words and actions when it comes to protecting the environment.""I think one of the huge issues in the world is that environmental laws have not been taken seriously,"" she told CBC News. ""Everyone pays lip service to them, but when the rubber hits the road, too often we see governments not complying.""And this is exactly what seems to be happening right here, right now, with this arrangement with the United States.""WATCH: Plastic waste and supermarket shopping — a Marketplace reportMarketplace",0.01382700632700632,0.3696797646797646

519,Leaked recordings reveal WHO's private analysis of pandemic | CBC News,"As the coronavirus exploded around the globe, scientists at the World Health Organization were sometimes privately frustrated by the mistakes made by some of their top donor countries but reluctant to say so publicly, leaked recordings of internal meetings show.",2020-11-11T21:41:22.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/who-pandemic-private-recordings-1.5798561,"As the coronavirus exploded around the globe, scientists at the World Health Organization (WHO) were sometimes privately frustrated by the mistakes made by some of their top donor countries but reluctant to say so publicly, leaked recordings of internal meetings show.After sharp criticism for not taking a stronger role in curbing the pandemic, the UN health agency holds its annual meeting this week under intense pressure to reform. WHO is also hoping that U.S. president-elect Joe Biden will reverse a decision by Washington to leave the organization made by the Trump administration in June.One of WHO's central dilemmas is that it has no enforcement powers or authority to independently investigate epidemics. Instead, the agency relies on behind-the-scenes talks and countries' co-operation.As the pandemic gained pace, WHO often shied away from calling out some of its biggest donors, including Japan, France and Britain. WHO scientists labelled some of their approaches ""macabre"" and ""an unfortunate laboratory to study the virus,"" according to dozens of leaked recordings of internal WHO meetings and documents from January to April obtained by The Associated Press.""By not speaking up when countries are doing questionable things, WHO is undermining its own authority while the planet burns,"" said Sophie Harman, a professor of international politics at Queen Mary University in London.Others said it would be politically unwise for WHO to be too outspoken unless countries give the agency more power.""If Tedros was to take a very aggressive stance toward member countries, there would be repercussions,"" said Suerie Moon, co-director of the Global Health Centre at the Graduate Institute of Geneva, referring to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.WHO spokesperson Farah Dakhlallah said that since the beginning of the coronavirus outbreak, ""WHO officials have had and continue to have, frank and open discussions with government counterparts. ""We are proud of an organizational culture that fosters candid discussions.""It's not unprecedented for WHO to publicly question its member states. It threatened to close its China office when the country was hiding cases during the SARS outbreak and loudly called for Nigeria to reverse its boycott of the polio vaccine in 2003.WHO's reticence to call out countries started with China, as the AP earlier reported. Despite a January meeting between Tedros and Chinese President Xi Jinping, information from Beijing was still sparse throughout February. Maria Van Kerkhove, WHO's technical lead for COVID-19, noted that the agency lacked ""enough detail to say what has worked and what hasn't.""WHO scientists soon grew concerned about Japan. On Feb. 1, a passenger who disembarked the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Hong Kong tested positive for the coronavirus. At the ship's next stop in Yokohama, authorities put all 3,711 people aboard under lockdown.WHO emergencies chief Michael Ryan told reporters at the time: ""Let's be careful here not to overreact."" But on Feb. 10, the case count nearly doubled overnight.""[That's] not surprising given the nature of the response of the investigation,"" Ryan said at an internal meeting, noting Japan had only assigned a small number of epidemiologists to investigate.Dr. Thomas Grein, WHO's chief of acute events management team, said they had failed to glean much information from their Japanese counterparts, calling it a ""very, very sensitive issue.""Although WHO was keenly aware the situation was deteriorating, scientists said the outbreak could help in understanding COVID-19 transmission.""[It's] unfortunate but a useful opportunity to study the natural history of the virus,"" Ryan said.In late February, the virus also gained a foothold in Italy, turning Europe into the epicentre of the pandemic.At WHO, Grein told his colleagues that WHO's efforts to get more detail about the spiralling outbreaks in Italy and elsewhere had ""spectacularly failed"" as officials worried about the lack of action taken across Europe.Yet on March 8, Tedros tweeted that ""the government & the people of Italy are taking bold, courageous steps aimed at slowing the spread of the coronavirus.""Lawrence Gostin, director of the WHO Collaborating Center on Public Health Law and Human Rights at Georgetown University, said WHO should be obligated to report when countries are not sharing data, saying it was dangerous for the agency to be ""flying blind.""WHO also complained in private about Western countries hoarding scarce pandemic supplies.""We had the terrible situation yesterday with [protective personal equipment] where all the supplies were requisitioned in France, and we lost access,"" Ryan told his colleagues.As countries across Europe adopted physical distancing measures and cancelled mass gatherings in early March, Ryan noticed one country did not: Britain.""There isn't a single sports event in Europe, and yet all of the Premier League matches in the U.K. are to go ahead,"" he said.Ryan described Britain's pandemic strategy as ""problematic"" after hearing the U.K.'s chief scientific officer say the country was aiming for herd immunity.""For that to happen, hundreds of thousands and millions of older people are going to become infected, and there is just going to be so much death,"" Ryan said.Still, he said the different approaches to tackling COVID-19 globally could prove to be ""a massive ecological study"" that would allow WHO to document what worked.""It's macabre in some ways, but it's reality,"" he said.Going forward, WHO's role trying to stop the pandemic will depend in part on the independent panel review. Harman, the expert from Queen Mary University, sympathized that WHO had enormous responsibility in the early months of COVID-19 but said even greater challenges loom now.""With the next wave of the pandemic, I think the time for quiet diplomacy has passed,"" she said.",0.00825465075465076,0.4226702351702352

They know my job description.""  MarketplaceBased on the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, an international treaty Canada ratified in 1966, ""consul general"" is reserved for top envoys from countries with full diplomatic ties with Canada stationed in cities other than Ottawa. Top envoys assigned to Ottawa bear the title ""ambassador.""Taiwan lost its diplomatic recognition with many countries along with its seat at the United Nations when the People's Republic of China joined the UN in 1971.For decades, Taiwanese across the globe — including around 40,000 in B.C. — have been pushing for the island to be recognized as a sovereign state and to once again be represented in the UN. Many hope the country's impressive management of the COVID-19 pandemic will help its bid for recognition.The island has kept the number of infections at around 500 out of its 24 million population, while China, where COVID-19 originated, has had more than 90,000 positive tests so far.Along with Chen's comments on how he's viewed by consuls general, Taiwan's search for recognition was given another surprising boost last week when Hsiao Bi-khim, the island's top envoy to Washington, D.C., changed her Twitter bio to ""Taiwan Ambassador to the US."" Sorry to disappoint so many supporters, but Taiwan Ambassador is what many call me and also my job description. My title remains Representative, Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office, when engaging with the US government.Taiwan's identity has always been a sensitive topic in China's foreign relations. Although Hsiao later tweeted that her official title is the Representative of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office, her new online ID triggered a fresh round of debates between Beijing and Taipei. In a statement to CBC News, the People's Republic of China's consulate in Vancouver says Taiwan is an ""inalienable part"" of China that is solely represented by its central government in Beijing. This doesn't reverberate with Taiwanese Canadians like Carol Pan, who lives in Vancouver and volunteers with Overseas Community Affairs Council, an organization affiliated with the Taiwanese government to arrange social activities for its citizens living in other countries. ""Taiwan has always been an independent country,"" Pan said. ""After the Second World War, the People's Republic of China never set foot on Taiwan.""Pan said Hsiao's self-identification as ambassador is ""wonderful"" and gives thumbs-up to Chen's being called ""consul general.""""We are hoping eventually some democratic countries can support Taiwan going to be recognized at first and then going to the United Nations,"" she said.In a statement to CBC, Global Affairs said Canada will continue to build people-to-people ties based on shared democratic values and respect for human rights.",0.17540684624017963,0.3915123456790123

The collection is too much for her to move alone, and she doesn't know how to use a computer to sell her valuables online.So she decided to donate her collection.She said heard on the news that Royal Canadian Legion branches in the province were struggling to keep their doors open, so she called Branch 1 in St. John's.""And I said, 'Oh my God, he probably won't take me seriously. Who got 500 Barbie dolls?'"" said Porter.Executives from the legion's branch visited Porter the next day. ""I don't think they knew what to say,"" she said, adding she loves to see the expression on people's faces when they first see her collection.Porter said an antique dealer estimates her collection is worth about $250,000.People have approached Porter in the past about buying some of her items, but she wasn't ready to sell. ""I wouldn't give you the hair off a Barbie doll over there, right?"" laughed Porter.Greg Grenning, president of Branch 1, says the donation will be a big help to the legion.""We're just struggling right now to keep our doors open,"" he said.Grenning said the legion relies on gatherings like weddings, dances and other social events to make money, which are limited now because of the COVID-19 pandemic.""This gesture has been fantastic, and whatever money we can raise will go toward our operating,"" he said.Grenning said they will also start an annual scholarship or bursary honouring Porter and her daughter.But for now, legion members will spend their time carefully packing Porter's collection into boxes, and numbering and itemizing each piece.Grenning said they will auction items on sites like eBay.""There's a lot of collectors out there who would like to have some of this stuff,"" said Grenning.""Whether we get $10,000 or we get $100,000, it's all it's something we don't have right now.… Whatever money we do get, it's so much appreciated, and [we] can't thank her enough for what she's doing.""While Porter finds it stressful to give away her collection, she said it was meant to be.""I prayed to God to bring someone to me so it could make my dream come true.""Read more from CBC Newfoundland and Labrador",0.08095238095238094,0.4148629148629148

Her story does not end there, though. She landed in Canada only to learn that Chinese immigration was not allowed at the time because of the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1923 legislation, which banned Chinese people from entering the country.If you want to know how the tale ends, Toronto-based professional storyteller Bernice Hune can tell you. She knows the story intimately and can tell it a lot better than I can — because that opera singer was her mother.For the past 35 years, Hune has been telling early migration tales to anyone lucky enough to hear them. As a multidisciplinary artist, even when she has reflected on her paintings, she has realized she would often include stories and language on her canvases.Born in Chinatown, Hune has seen a wealth of change in Toronto. While facilitating arts education workshops in schools, she noticed cultural shifts in the demographics during the 1970s and beyond. Suddenly, more diverse groups were attending schools in the city, but the teaching staff remained predominantly white.In this video, musician and regular CBC Arts correspondent April Aliermo catches up with Hune to listen and learn from some of her richest stories.Good storytelling is an underappreciated art form and can be especially compelling when delivered from the perspective of our elders. Hune has crafted her narratives from what she refers to as ""community oral history"" and enhances them with personal objects connected to her own family. She tells historical stories about the Canadian National Railway being built using Chinese labour, the Chinese head tax, and the struggle for full citizenship, all of which have had lasting effects on Canadian society.During the current pandemic, which has often isolated us from our elders, she is a living reminder of why the best stories live in those who have experienced them.",0.194988344988345,0.37347140039447735

545,How Ottawa's oldest businesses are toughing it out through COVID-19 | CBC News,"They survived such catastrophic events as the Spanish flu, two world wars and the Great Depression. How are some of Ottawa's most venerable businesses coping through the coronavirus pandemic?",2020-04-29T08:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/covid-19-small-businesses-survive-century-war-depression-but-virus-hard-blow-1.5546516,"They survived such catastrophic events as the Spanish flu, two world wars and the Great Depression.How are some of Ottawa's most venerable businesses coping through the coronavirus pandemic?CBC reached out to ask how they're doing.General manager Deek Labelle gave birth in mid-March and is safe at home with little Nathan while her ByWard Market baby, the Château Lafayette, remains closed.""The Laff,"" billed as Ottawa's oldest tavern, dates back to 1849, and is very much still alive and kicking.""It's hard to believe. The fact that it's still here and still surviving and thriving speaks volumes,"" Labelle said. ""I don't want to jinx it.""There have been hard times, she said, but nothing quite like this.""This is the hardest one we've ever endured. The smoking bylaw would be the closest second to it, for the severity of an overnight change."" To survive Ottawa's smoking crackdown, the venerable watering hole was severed in two, with half becoming a Quiznos franchise so the remaining bar could sustain itself.Unlike other establishments, The Laff hasn't stayed open for takeout or delivery during the pandemic.""The bar is the experience. You can't take that out,"" Labelle observed.Labelle hopes to reopen this summer and is considering applying for a larger patio so customers, when they return, can spread out and enjoy themselves like old times.""We just want to see our regulars again, our friends. These are people we see weekly, if not daily.""Jacques Marchand can trace his family's lighting and electrical business back three generations. ""My father's father's father,"" Marchand noted proudly. He's the fourth.Founded just 14 years after Thomas Edison unveiled the first practical incandescent light bulb, Marchand Electric has seen its share of history. Now, the company is trying to survive COVID-19.""We have experience with slowdowns before, and the trick … is to react quickly. You have to look at your costs and your staff. We had to lay some people off, unfortunately,"" Marchand said.A skeleton staff continues to work at the Algoma Road location. Retail sales have been limited to online purchases, but the store has been deemed an essential service because they supply to hospitals.There are already signs things are picking up: Marchand has recalled three of the six people he laid off. ""So we got the guys back working in the warehouse. They're also working on inventories and painting floors. Make-work projects. You have to retain these employees,"" he said.Marchand is also trying to convince clients to plan —  and order — ahead.""You've got a project coming up? Why don't we talk about it now instead of freaking out at the last minute, two months from now?""Sonia Fisher is a fourth-generation purveyor of quality men's clothing, a retail business established by her great-grandfather, Emerson Ralph Fisher, 115 years ago. It was ER Fisher who got the company through the Depression years. Part of company lore is that ""he did not lay off a single person,"" Sonia Fisher noted. Back then, the company reduced its hours, but stayed open.With COVID-19, things are different. Forced to close the Westboro store, Fisher has had to lay off 12 employees.""I didn't want to get the business in a situation where we were worse off five to six months down the road,"" she said.Most spring merchandise had already been delivered, but ""anything that hadn't arrived, we cancelled,"" Fisher said. They're already trimming back on their fall orders.""It'll take time for people to develop confidence again in the economy,"" Fisher said, ""so we are predicting a drop in sales over the next year.""Unlike other retailers, ER Fisher doesn't sell online. Personalized service has always been its brand. Now, Fisher admits it might be time to update that business model.""It's definitely something that we're going to be ramping up. It's a sore spot for me because I worry that I should have done it a little sooner.""McIntosh and Watts started out as a coffee and tea emporium, with deliveries made by horse and buggy.  ""We could have been Starbucks,"" jokes the company's fourth-generation president, Peter McIntosh, who's been selling china and tableware for 35 years.His grandfather, Grant McIntosh, was stationed in England during the Second World War and made connections at factories that made fine bone china, which he began exporting to Canada, far away from German bombs.""They adapted. They did everything they could to continue to function,"" McIntosh said. ""That's how you have to survive."" Fast-forward to 2020. The store on Industrial Avenue has been closed since mid-March, the company's online and wholesale business now operating out of McIntosh's home. ""We're adapting. We're working hard on the parts of our business we can continue to develop. We've just scaled everything back,"" McIntosh said.""Frisby the Vulcanizer"" was established by Don Frisby's great-uncle, George Frisby, upon his discharge after the First World War. The company survived the Great Depression, but Don Frisby said he never heard the stories about how they managed. ""They were ... men of very few words. All those guys did was work.""Deemed essential, the business has been allowed to stay open, but retail customers have been staying away and business is down 30 per cent. It's been a ""double whammy,"" Frisby said, arriving at what's normally one of his busiest seasons.He's responded by resetting his expectations.""My goal all along has been to keep as many people working as possible and to stay open and forget about being profitable. We just want to be able to keep functioning as a business,"" Frisby said.Of his 100 employees, just one has had a layoff notice. ""Our on-the-road salesperson, whom nobody wants to see. Poor guy,"" Frisby said.So why not let a few more go until this thing blows over?""Right from my great-uncle and my father and through to me, we've always understood ... that our customers and the people who look after our customers are the most important aspect of the business,"" Frisby said.",0.0752217553688142,0.38324463118580765

And then six years ago, we had another movie, The Pawn's Sacrifice … but nothing like this. Nothing like this since 1972,"" Steve Sklenka, president of the Calgary Chess Club, told the Calgary Eyeopener on Monday.Sklenka said calls and emails have been flooding in from parents who want their kids to take up chess.""They want to enrol kids into some chess lessons, tutors, and that sort of thing.

We have players from Grade 1 and right up to people into their 80s. So it's a very versatile game.""Sklenka said child prodigies are rare.""There's two or three from India right now. They're not even teenagers, and they're world-class players,"" he said.""There's a few around the world, but it just happens periodically that you have some real youngsters that are extremely good, and they will become top world-class players. Potentially one of them will be a world champion.""Sklenka said he hopes The Queen's Gambit is inspiring more girls and women to take up the male-dominated game.""There's a lot of women playing chess, there's more and more. And, you know, we've got to be realistic. It's still a male-dominated game, but there's a lot of good female players from around the country and the world,"" he said.Sklenka said there's a reason eastern European players, like the toughest opponents in The Queen's Gambit, do so well at chess. ""Russia, you know, the eastern European countries are supported by the government. And so it's easier for their talents to be developed,"" he said, adding that India, China and the United States, are coming up in the ranks.""Whereas in the Western world, yeah, we don't have as much support, if you will. But yeah, that would be one reason why maybe Russia is — Russia is doing so well in chess, because they do get the support from the government."" Sklenka is originally from the Czech Republic and grew up playing chess. But he said he's not one of the players who can close his eyes and see the next moves.""I certainly can't. And very, very, very few people can actually play chess blindfolded. But there are people that can … Timur Gareyev, whom I know, is a very good friend and a very good person. He's a world champion and he's played 48 games blindfolded, at the same time.

Cancer doesn't wait for global pandemics, and we know that early detection can save lives.""Six people die of lung cancer in B.C. every day. It's the most common cause of death from cancer in Canada and around the world, yet 70 per cent of lung cancers are only diagnosed when they reach advanced stages, Horgan said. Lung cancer kills more people than colon, breast and prostate cancers combined, according to Benoit Morin, president and chief executive officer of the Provincial Health Services Authority.The new screening program will use existing CT scanning technology and will mean more treatment options, faster recovery and better outcomes for patients, Horgan said. It's estimated that 300 people will be diagnosed each year through the screening program. ""These changes give people hope, give people opportunity to get early treatment because they got early diagnosis,"" Horgan said.The program will target adults between the ages of 55 and 74 who smoke or have a heavy smoking history. Lung cancer primarily affects people over the age of 50. The news conference came on a day two-thirds of B.C. is blanketed in thick smoke from wildfires burning out of control in Washington state, Oregon and California.Dr. Kim Chi, vice-president and chief medical officer of B.C.

The two men previously held face-to-face talks in Japan in November 2019.Ties between the two countries deteriorated in December 2018 after Canadian police detained Meng Wanzhou, chief financial officer of Huawei Technologies, on a U.S. extradition warrant.Soon after, China arrested Canadians Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig, and in June charged them with spying. It also blocked imports of some canola seed.""Minister Champagne again reiterated that the cases of Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor remain a top priority … and that Canada continues to call on China to immediately release both men,"" Foreign Affairs said in a statement.Speaking Wednesday to CBC's Megan Williams in Rome, Champagne said the two sides ""obviously have a number of things where we disagree profoundly. But to the extent that we can talk, I think it's a positive sign of progress."" ""We're going to continue to engage and hopefully improve consular access [to Kovrig and Spavor]. This has been key in our discussions, to make sure that detainees would have access to their loved ones.""The Chinese Foreign Ministry said Wang told Champagne that Canada's unprovoked detention of Chinese citizens led to ""serious difficulties"" in the bilateral relationship. It added in a statement that Wang urged Ottawa to take action as soon as possible to remove impediments to the further development of China-Canada ties.Beijing's account of the meeting did not mention Huawei's Meng or Champagne's call for China to release Kovrig and Spavor.""Obviously, COVID is complicating access [to Kovrig and Spavor], but I did say that there's different ways you can go at it. I had offered before that one could even imagine virtual access,"" Champange told CBC News.WATCH | Champagne meets with Chinese foreign minister in Rome:CanadaThe meeting comes on the heels of a Federal Court decision denying Meng access to sensitive information contained in reports about her arrest produced by Canada's spy agency.The Huawei executive was seeking the documents in an effort to prove that she was the victim of a conspiracy between Canadian and American law enforcement.In a 35-page ruling released Tuesday, Judge Catherine Kane said Meng's lawyers had argued that they were looking for information about the planning of her arrest, interagency co-operation, the execution of the arrest and evidence gathering— but that none of that was contained in the blacked-out portions of the documents CSIS provided.""The information does not provide the 'missing pieces of the puzzle' that Meng seeks,"" Kane wrote.""The redacted information does not respond to or illuminate the allegations of abuse of process and is not the type of information that counsel for Ms. Meng noted would be relevant.""And even if it had been relevant, the judge said, she wouldn't have been inclined to release it anyway.""If any of the redacted information were marginally relevant — which it is not — the court would find that its disclosure would be injurious,"" Kane said.Canada's Foreign Affairs said Wang and Champagne also ""discussed the importance of global collaboration in the face of COVID-19, including the search for a vaccine,"" it said.Champagne also raised Canada's opposition to China over its treatment of Hong Kong, said a Canadian government official who requested anonymity given the sensitivity of the situation.Last month, Canada suspended its extradition treaty with Hong Kong following new Chinese national security legislation and said it could boost immigration from the former British colony. ",0.04992424242424241,0.3411805555555556

More than two million of those cases are in the United States. There have been nearly 435,000 deaths from COVID-19 around the world, with about 116,000 of them in the U.S.In Europe, Greek airports allowed more international flights as the country sought to salvage its summer season, German tourists flocking to neighbouring Denmark caused an eight-kilometre queue, and Italians popped into France to buy lottery scratch cards.But the continued closure of most of Spain, a patchwork of quarantine rules and remote-working by many who once commuted across borders, means it will not be a return to unfettered travel for 420 million Europeans.Spain is initially allowing in 10,000 holidaymakers from Germany as the Madrid government works out how to handle mass tourism before opening up more fully in the coming weeks.Hundreds of German sun-seekers, the first tourists to visit Spain since borders were closed in March, arrived in Mallorca on Monday on a flight from Düsseldorf.""Holidaymakers can be happy that the beaches in Palma have never been so empty,"" said Aage Duenhaupt, a spokesperson for travel company TUI.

The Czech Republic has a traffic-light system, barring tourists from ""orange"" or ""red"" countries, such as Portugal and Sweden.Denmark will accept tourists from Iceland, Germany and Norway, but not Sweden, if they book at least six nights' accommodation.Britain's two-week quarantine for visitors means Britons will face the same confinement in France.Before the crisis, about 3.5 million people crossed an internal EU border every day, according to a 2019 European Parliament report, some 1.7 million of them commuters.Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced Monday that the federal government will extend the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB), with details to follow in the days ahead.The CERB is due to run out soon for people who have been on the benefit since it was first launched in April, at the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic.People can only claim the benefit for 16 weeks — four eligibility periods — and the end of the program's fourth eligibility period is early July.""We're working on a solution to extend the benefit for people who can't return to work yet,"" Trudeau said. ""We'll have more details this week, but for today, I want you to know that we'll continue to be there for you and your family.""WATCH | Epidemiologist says COVID-19 toll may be higher than official totals:CanadaAs of 3:45 p.m. ET on Monday, there were 99,091 confirmed and presumptive coronavirus cases in Canada, with 61,000 cases considered recovered or resolved. A CBC News tally of deaths based on provincial data, regional health information and CBC's reporting stood at 8,220.India's Health Ministry reported a jump of more than 11,000 new infections nationwide for a third consecutive day on Monday.

Scotland and Wales are taking a more tentative approach to the easing of the coronavirus restrictions. Northern Ireland's stores reopened last week. England also saw zoos, safari parks and drive-in cinemas reopen on Monday.Russian President Vladimir Putin blamed America's lack of centralized authority for its inability to stem the spread of the virus, while saying Russia was ""working quite steadily and getting out of this situation … with minimal losses.""In the U.S., ""this is not happening,"" Putin said, noting the central and regional governments work more closely in Russia.Russia, nevertheless, has recorded more than half a million infections and nearly 7,000 virus deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins count.Egypt's Health Ministry has confirmed 1,691 new cases of the coronavirus, including 97 deaths, the country's highest toll for one day.There have officially been 46,289 COVID-19 cases and 1,672 deaths recorded since the virus first emerged in Egypt in February. Egypt has the highest death rate in the Arab world and the third highest in the Middle East after Iran and Turkey. The government has resisted a full lockdown in an effort to keep the economy functioning. Even as caseloads multiply in the Arab world's most populous country, authorities have shortened the nightly curfew and plan to reopen airports for tourism to less hard-hit destinations next month.South Korea is also among the countries seeking to prevent a resurgence of the outbreak, reporting 37 new cases of COVID-19 on Monday. The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said 25 of the cases came from the Seoul area, where health authorities are scrambling to trace infections linked to entertainment and leisure activities, church gatherings, warehouse workers and door-to-door sellers.In France, restaurants in the Paris region will be allowed to join those in the rest of the country in opening indoor seating starting Monday. From June 22, all nursery schools, primary schools and junior high schools will be open and mandatory for all students. Authorities in Pakistan said they will reimpose strict lockdowns in selected areas of several cities from Monday night, a day after the federal government said COVID-19 cases could multiply eightfold by the end of July and hit 1.2 million.""A total of 20 cities across Pakistan have been identified as having likely increase in ratio/speed of infection, which needs restrictive measures for containment,"" said a statement Monday by the body that co-ordinates the national response to the virus.Pakistan has reported 144,477 cases of the respiratory illness and 2,729 deaths so far.In Africa, where the virus continues to spread, Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta's office says four people who work at the presidential residence have tested positive for COVID-19, though the president and his family do not appear to be affected.Ghana's Health Minister Kwaku Agyemang-Manu has contracted COVID-19 and is undergoing treatment at a hospital.",0.13702502326334104,0.39452563013310676

583,TRANSCRIPT: SANCTIONED - EPISODE 7 | CBC Radio,Full-text transcript for Sanctioned episode seven,2020-07-24T17:34:01.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/radio/podcastnews/transcript-sanctioned-episode-7-1.5662080," Sanctioned - The Arrest Warrant Host: Stephen Quinn Announcer: This is a CBC Podcast. [music: somber] Stephen: Previously, on Sanctioned. Huawei Chief Financial Officer, Meng Wanzhou is arrested at Vancouver International Airport in December 2018. She's accused of fraud in the United States, and later released on $10 million bail, meanwhile, two Canadians are accused of spying on China and a third is sentenced to death. Politicians in Canada, China, and the U.S. are drawn into a war of words and actions and Huawei's role in the next generation of wireless technology is questioned. [music: somber] [sound: outdoor din] Stephen: On the afternoon of the first nice day of spring, a black SUV pulls into a quiet street in the tony Vancouver neighbourhood of Shaughnessy. Another black SUV is already parked on the road. Two suited men are inside, they watch as the first vehicle pulls in front of a gated, twenty-year-old house. A slight Chinese woman steps out of the SUV. Across the street, another woman, a journalist, holds a camera.  [sound: camera clicks] Stephen: She's been standing there for hours. Her interest perks up as the vehicle pulls in front of her, blocking a view of the gate and the house beyond. [music: somber] Stephen: The female passenger from the SUV stands on the sidewalk, surveying the property. It's May 11th, 2019, and Meng Wanzhou is moving house and the two men keeping watch for Meng aren't the only security in the area. The home of the American consul is nearby and it's also guarded around the clock. It is an interesting situation that a woman the U.S. wants to incarcerate, and the official representative of the United States, are polite neighbours in Vancouver, a city that has become an unlikely battleground in a fight between global superpowers. Teeth aren't bared, weapons aren't drawn between enemies in a place like this. After all, we're in Shaughnessy, a stately clutch of mansions and old money located in the heart of the city's west side, where streets like Matthews, Angus and Marguerite are named for Canadian Pacific Railway executives who built the neighbourhood a century ago, but it's a fight all the same.  [music: somber] Stephen: And as the chief financial officer of the world's largest telecommunications equipment maker eyes her new home, Meng Wanzhou's address isn't the only thing that's about to change. Her lawyers are preparing to attack, her company will face a threat that could shake the order of the digital universe. Canada's economy will feel China's wrath and the order of the political world, or at least the lines between east and west will be tested by unrest in Meng's other home, Hong Kong. [music: somber] Stephen: I'm Stephen Quinn and you're listening to Sanctioned: The Arrest of a Telecom Giant, a CBC Vancouver original podcast about Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou, and her fight against possible extradition and jailing in the United States for allegedly violating economic sanctions against Iran. It's a journey deep into the world of global business and politics, up front deals and allegations of back room skullduggery in the battle to dominate the economies of the future, not to mention the extraordinary wealth and power of a few of the world's most influential players. Stephen: We launched in April 2019 with six episodes that covered the time from Meng's arrest in Vancouver on December 1st 2018 to the growing fallout from her situation a few months later, including the arrest of two Canadians in China for allegations of spying and the sentencing of a third Canadian to death for drug trafficking. We promised we'd be back, and that time is now, as Meng prepares for court proceedings ahead of an extradition hearing set to begin in January of 2020. A lot has changed since Sanctioned first dropped, and if you haven't listened to those first six episodes, now might be a good time to go back and add them to your feed, but since we last spoke, relations between Canada and China have hit an all-time low. The trade battle between the United States and China has only intensified and a flood of new details about Meng's arrest have emerged. Stephen: Over the next two episodes, we'll examine the ever expanding ripple effects of Meng's arrest as President Donald Trump announces new measures to keep Huawei out of the U.S. technological supply stream, and we'll zoom in on three crucial hours in this story, the hours immediately after Meng stepped off her flight from Hong Kong and before she was arrested by the RCMP in Vancouver. Hours in which her lawyers claim Canadian and U.S. authorities colluded to violate Meng's rights so badly that they want the case against her tossed, but we'll begin where so much of the case has played out in the legal arena where Meng Wanzhou emerges with a new look, a new strategy, and a bid to reshape the narrative. This is Sanctioned, Episode 7: The Arrest Warrant. [music: somber] Stephen: The pose of the woman in this grainy video would be familiar to anyone who has ever been called aside for secondary inspection at an airport. Tired after a long flight, Meng Wanzhou is seen standing with her hands in the pockets of a dark tracksuit, comfortable wear for the long flight from Hong Kong. She's at a counter in an area of YVR that, if they're lucky, most travellers never see. Eight pieces of luggage are piled on a trolley nearby. [sound: The goings-on of a luggage search] Stephen: Two men in dark uniforms sift through Meng's bags, as they ask her questions. They are Canada Border Services Agents, and they can seize and examine the items of anyone trying to enter the country. They don't need warrants and they're not required to warn anyone about the legal consequences of volunteering information. It's those powers and the use of them that will come into question as Meng Wanzhou's extradition hearing nears, because her lawyers, who filed this video with the court, claim that the Royal Canadian Mounted Police conspired with the border agency to detain Meng for more than three hours before officially arresting her. Stephen: The reason? According to the defence, it's so the RCMP could mount a covert criminal investigation against Meng using the CBSA to detain and question her,  all allegedly, at the direction of the American FBI.  [music: somber] Stephen: CBC reporter Jason Proctor has been following the court proceedings. He's with me now. Hello, Jason. Jason Proctor: Hello, Stephen.  Stephen: So, this video was actually released by B.C. Supreme Court Associate Chief Justice Heather Holmes in mid August. What happened in court that day? Jason: Well, yes, so the video was actually released nearly half a year after surveillance cameras captured those first, very tense moments that Meng spent on Canadian soil and months after she made her last in-person court appearance before Holmes, So this was actually the first time that we got a look at Meng Wanzhou for quite a few months, and to be honest, her appearance was quite different from the way it had been previously, when she'd sort of been wearing what looked like that same tracksuit that you see her in, in this video. Stephen: Right, and how is she different then? Jason:  Well, she kind of traded those floppy hats and casual wear of these previous court dates for a look that many people thought was much more fitting for a woman who is the chief financial officer of a multi billion dollar company so she wore a designer dress, you know, hair kind of flowing over her shoulders, held back by this stylish silver headband. I checked the logo, she was clutching a small Chanel bag, kind of gold chain on black material and and she, you know, with all of this, makes her way into the court at the side of one of the guards that she's still paying, if you recall, to maintain this kind of virtual jail around her that she's agreed to live in 24/7 as part of a ten million dollar bail agreement. Stephen: And an ankle monitoring bracelet to complete the ensemble. Jason:  Exactly. This was actually one of, the kind of fascinating things, is she's wearing this dress and just below the, kind of hem of the dress, which is just above her ankle, and these kind of low heeled sandals, you see this very solid ankle monitor which is, you know, cemented onto her leg to basically make sure that she maintains this boundary and a limitation of her movements around Vancouver, while she's under the direction of the court. Stephen: Alright. Now, this court appearance that you attended, this would, I guess begin the process that would culminate with the release of the video, but there were also other notes and documents that were gathered by Meng's lawyers to support the claim that authorities had violated her rights from the outset. What are Meng's lawyers basing that claim on? Jason: Well, so they say it was an abuse of process, what happened to her at the airport in those crucial first three hours and Scott Fenton, a top tier defender who flew out from Toronto to join Meng's legal team, told Justice Holmes he believed it was serious enough to warrant a stay of proceedings, in other words to toss the case  and set Meng free. I should say Scott Fenton is renowned for his knowledge of fraud and of cases dealing with the corruption of public officials and with Meng's case, he claimed the CBSA, that's Canada Border Services Agency, the RCMP, and the FBI weren't the only ones at fault here. He also pointed a finger at U.S. President Donald Trump.  [music: somber] Stephen: Donald Trump's shadow has loomed over Meng's case from almost the beginning, ever since he suggested she could be used as a bargaining chip if it would get the U.S. a better trade deal with China. [news clips play] Reporter: Here's what the president said in an interview late yesterday with Reuters about the Huawei CFO, Meng Wanzhou. He said, if I think it's good for the country, if I think it's good for what will be, certainly, the largest trade deal ever made, which is a very important thing, what's good for national security, I would certainly intervene if I thought it was necessary. Reporter 2: He also said that he, that, ah, he would,  the release of Meng could be part of a broader trade deal with China. So, President Trump really throwing a bit of a wrench into this case, essentially confirming that Meng Wanzhou is a bargaining chip. Reporter 3:  Meng's lawyer says she's being held hostage as part of a U.S. trade spat with China, but U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin in a Tuesday interview on Fox News said the pursuit against Huawei had nothing to do with trade negotiations. The Chinese government however doesn't agree. Stephen: But as the months following Meng's arrest begin to add up, so did the weight of U.S. pressure on Huawei. The company had already been excluded from bidding on American government contracts, a move that would effectively freeze them from the U.S. 5G grid, but in May, Donald Trump took another extraordinary step. [news clips play] Reporter: The Trump administration is cracking down on Chinese telecom giant Huawei.There are two specific actions that were taken yesterday. The first one came from the White House, that executive order essentially enabling the U.S. to ban telecommunications equipment from quote, ""foreign adversaries"". They didn't specifically single out China or Huawei, but this more significant movement yesterday came from the Department of Commerce, adding Huawei to a so-called entity list. Reporter 2:  That effectively prevents it from buying American parts, unless it has U.S. government approval, they say. So, they are definitely targeting Huawei with the Commerce Department action, the commerce secretary is gonna have a lot of discretion in how to approve and process all of this. Stephen: Now, if the phrase, ""Entity List"" sounds bland and bureaucratic, the names on the list are anything but. There are 300 pages worth of firms and people accused of being at risk of funding ""activities contrary to U.S. interests"" and list spans ""entities"" range from Afghanistan, to Vietnam, to China. [clip of Paul Evans speaking] Paul Evans: See, Huawei is, in some ways, corporate enemy number 1 in the context of American thinking. I am Paul Evans, a professor of Asian international affairs and the school of public policy and global affairs at the University of British Columbia. I just returned from Washington, where I met with think tanks and government agencies on the matter of the U.S. China relationship, which I think many of us see in a spiral downwards, at this stage. Five years ago, Americans who were looking at the rise of China, it's important, they had some criticisms they had some worries on the military side, but five years ago the view was, China can't innovate, because of its political system and because of its state led economic system, it could imitate, it could steal, but it could not innovate. Paul: Viewed now, it's exactly the reverse. United States is afraid of a China that can innovate and that it can innovate at world class levels. 5G technology is just one example of artificial intelligence, quantum computing robotics. Suddenly, this is a China that can innovate and the kicker is that it can innovate because it has an authoritarian political system and state led economy. Stephen:  Well, now that Huawei and 68 of its affiliates are on the entity list and deemed a potential threat to U.S. national security, the Chinese telecom giant will be banned from even buying parts and components from American companies without U.S. approval. Huawei responded by shrugging the problem off. [Huawei representative and affiliates speaking in Mandarin] Voicer: Our business in the United States is not that big. Due to our global operations, any change in one country has little impact on our global business.  Voicer 2: The U.S. is using its national power to constantly and deliberately smear and suppress certain Chinese companies by all means. This is not honorable nor is it just. People can clearly see their intentions. [somber music] Stephen: But the implications are far reaching, Huawei is the world's second largest producer of Android phones. Being cut off from U.S. technology would mean running without American operating systems. On a basic level that means a phone or mobile device without Google, of course, Huawei has the ability to design its own operating systems with China's own version of Google, but experts began warning that, if taken to its natural conclusion, Huawei's place on the entity list could signal the beginning of a world divided into East and West when it comes to digital devices and instead of the increased globalization that has marked the past few decades of technological growth, the world could be moving towards a new kind of cold war, one that would be played out through smartphones and tablets. Stephen: Trump almost immediately suspended the designation, opting instead to re-consider Huawei's place as a pariah, every three months. Now, bear in mind that at this point, China and the United States were already locked in a trade war and if anything, the tensions in that spat didn't appear to be decreasing, instead, they were ramping up. [news clips play] Reporter: There is heightened tension tonight between the world's two largest economies. President Trump is now threatening more tariffs on China. Donald Trump: We had a deal with China. It was 95 percent there and then my representatives, as you know, Secretary Mnuchin and  Robert Lighthizer our ambassador, Lighthizer, they went to China and they were told the things that were fully agreed to, we're not going to get anymore. They're going to un-agree to them. That's not acceptable. I said good, that's fine, put on the tariffs. Reporter 2: It looks like they've gone ahead and done it and increased the tariffs to 25 percent. How will China retaliate? Woman:  Just after the tariffs went into effect, the Chinese MOFCOM published a post on its website, saying that China deeply regrets for U.S. decision to increase tariffs and China will have to take a necessary counter measures. Stephen: So, as experts began fretting about the possibility of greater damage to both economies. Any bargaining chip in the trade battle would be a big deal for the U.S. Meng's lawyer, Scott Fenton, knew all this when he stood up in court in August to call Trump's original comments about his client ""intimidating and corrosive""  Stephen: And so Meng's legal team worked to draw up a narrative that would place the actions of those border guards who searched her bags on December 1st within that greater context of a global economic battle, a battle where a meddling U.S. president is determined to humble the Chinese economic giant and its unsuspecting chief financial officer. [music: somber] [sound: pages flipping]  Stephen: The notes of the RCMP officers tasked with arresting Meng Wanzhou indicate that they knew the case would be complicated from the outset. ""Female never flies to USA,'' wrote one officer. ""Do not want to alert online for flight manifest"", wrote another. ""No trust."" Stephen: Those notes were released at the same time as the airport video, fleshing out the details of the defence team's allegations. They also show that the plan had originally been to enter Meng's plane after it landed and to arrest her at that time. After all, a judge had given them a warrant that justified her immediate arrest, but instead, Meng was led by border guards to that secondary inspection area in the airport. In the video footage, Meng is flicking her hair away from her shoulders as a female guard trails. She's questioned about her business activities by Acting CBSA Superintendent Surjit Dhillon. According to his notes, the questioning went like this: [clip of Dhillon speaking]  Surjit Dhillon: I asked the subject if her company sold products in the United States.The subject stated, ""no we do not."" The subject was then asked if her company sold products in countries that they should not. The subject appeared confused by the questions. I rephrased the question and asked the subject if her company sold products or did business in Iran. The subject initially stated, ""I don't know.""  I reminded the subject that she is the CFO of a multibillion dollar company and that it would be hard for me to believe that she wouldn't know these details about her company. The subject stated that her company does have an office in Iran. Stephen: So, was this the smoking gun that RCMP were hoping to secure at the direction of the FBI? An admission that Huawei had an office in Iran? Jason Proctor is back with us and certainly a lot of American news outlets treated it that way. Jason: Yes, you saw that is a headline coming out of this trove of documents, you know, hundreds of pages worth of notes of border guards transcripts of interviews, all kinds of things and remember this all goes back to-- and  the reason why the possible admission of anything with regards to Iran is so important, because it was Huawei's activities in Iran that were the basis for Meng's arrest and the allegation that she had lied to banks about Huawei's alleged relationship with Skycom, a firm that was said to be a hidden subsidiary for the company doing business in Iran that violated U.S. sanctions.  Jason: So, Meng's lawyers claim that during the three hours before she was arrested, Canadian authorities were actually in constant contact with their American counterparts and they were ordered to seize Meng's mobile devices because you know they were allegedly told to obtain Meng's passwords, again all according to the defense and to question her, all in the aid of trying to get the information that could help send her to jail. Stephen: And Meng's lawyers also released a transcript of an interview with an RCMP officer. Jason: Exactly, and this is one of the documents I found most fascinating, just because it reveals more than we ever knew about these first moments where she's told, you are under arrest and this is what's going on. This was a transcript of an interview with RCMP Constable Winston Yep. He's the officer who obtained the provisional warrant to arrest  Meng at the behest of the United States, and again, this is the record of the moment at which Meng is officially taken into police custody and these wheels of justice begin turning. [music: somber] Stephen: It was twelve minutes past two on December 1st, 2018. Constable Winston Yep and Meng sat in an office at the airport with another officer, Constable Dawn But. In a halting speech full of ums and ahs, Constable Yep tells Meng why she has been arrested. Constable But translates into Mandarin. [clip of Dawn But's voicer speaking] Winston Yep: [speaking: English] Dawn But: [translating into Mandarin] Because in the United States, uh, you have committed fraud, uh, we're arresting you and then you will be sent back to the United States.  Stephen: The conversation switches back and forth between English and Mandarin, as the two officers read the warrant to Meng. Yep asks if she has any questions. Meng responds in Mandarin. [clip of Meng's voicer speaking] Meng Wanzhou: [speaking: Mandarin] Translator: I'm not clear on what has happened. Why would I have an arrest warrant, and I have got involved in fraud? Stephen: The officers attempt to explain, but Meng is slow to understand. Finally, she says...  [clip of Meng's voicer speaking] Meng: [speaking: Mandarin]  Translator: You're saying, because of my company, you're arresting me, you're saying, you're going to arrest me? And then send me to the United States? Stephen: This is Meng Wanzhou before she has a lawyer, so the two constables begin explaining how she can go about getting one, either through her company or through legal aid. Fast forward to May 2019, and Meng now has not one lawyer, but four, and all of them are present in the courtroom. David Martin, Scott Fenton, Richard Peck, and Eric Gottardi, all jointly sign their legal briefs with the kind of flourish you'd be more likely to see on a communique from the G7, rather than a memorandum in support of an application. But they've come up with a strategy to match Meng's more business-like look, and her move to her multi-million dollar mansion. It's matched by the more aggressive pose struck by Huawei's media spokesman as well. Stephen: Benjamin Howes stands on the steps of the courthouse after the proceedings are done for the day, and echoes the arguments that the lawyers inside the court have just made. [clip of Benjamin Howes speaking] Benjamin Howes: From the beginning, Huawei has expressed extreme confidence in Ms. Meng's innocence. We have maintained that her U.S. ordered arrest was an unlawful abuse of process, one guided by political considerations and tactics, not by the rule of law. Canadians value the rule of law, and the Charter of Rights. Law enforcement officials are expected to follow the rules at all times, in all cases and for all people, citizens and visitors alike. We have trust in the Canadian judicial process and we look forward to seeing Ms. Meng's freedom restored. Stephen: And so the stage is set for the battle to come, and like so many Canadian legal fights, the Charter of Rights and Freedoms appears likely to play a central role.It's the document that underpins much of modern Canadian life, from the right to live a life free of persecution or discrimination, to the right to end one's own life. The Charter is part of the legacy of former Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, coming into effect in 1982. Pierre Trudeau, of course, was the father of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who now has to deal with the growing economic and political repercussions of his government's decision to arrest Meng Wanzhou on behalf of the United States and away from the courtroom, those pressures are mounting. [advertisement for canola plays] Man: Thinking about canola, 50 years ago, even 20 years ago, it was that close to being considered as a weed. Woman: It's the most profitable crop for us producers to grow. Stephen: Canada is the world's number one exporter of canola, a crop described as the country's greatest agricultural success story. The vast prairie fields of Saskatchewan and Manitoba are ablaze with yellow flowers of the plant, whose name is literally a combination of the worlds Canada and oil. It produces one of the world's healthiest vegetable oils, high-protein animal feed, and biofuel, and as China looked for new ways to show its displeasure with Canada's role in the arrest of a Chinese business icon, canola must have made a very tempting target. Stephen: Canola seed exports to China were worth $2.8 billion in 2018, but then suddenly, China announced that it had concerns with pests in the products of two of Canada's main seed exporters, placing a ban on imports to China. [clip of conference] Woman: Speaker, we've just learned that China will stop purchasing Canadian canola wheat, peas, linseed, and canola meal. This is devastating news for our farmers. More than 40 percent of Canadian canola alone is currently sold to China. The loss of this market is catastrophic and it will cost billions of dollars to our economy. Man: We're really puzzled by the problem in the first place, we are very confident of the quality of Canadian canola on international markets. Man 2: We've heard very clearly that there is a significant interest in sending a high level delegation to China and to talk about the extraordinary work that we do in termsof oversight inspection and the science around ensuring the safety of, and the quality of everything Canada exports. We're very much looking at the possibility of sending a high level delegation to China. Stephen: China claimed the situation had nothing to do with Meng Wanzhou, but a pattern began to emerge. China also moved to suspend imports of Canadian pork, and then all Canadian meat, business worth hundreds of millions of dollars each year and that's to say nothing of the human lives at stake. Canadians Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig were still jailed in China, accused of spying. [news clips play] Reporter: Very little information is trickling out on the condition of two Canadians being held by authorities in China. Reporter 2: In China, there's no coincidence, if they want to send you a message, they will send you a message. Woman: I was able to have a formal bilateral meeting with Minister Wang Yi, the Chinese foreign minister. In that meeting, I expressed Canada's very grave concern about the arbitrary detentions of Michael Kovrig and of Michael Spavor. These are two very brave Canadians who are showing remarkable grace and resilience in difficult circumstances. Stephen: But it's not just Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig, there's also Robert Schellenberg, sentenced to death for drug trafficking and then one more Canadian, Fan Wei, also sentenced to death in China in a separate drug trafficking case that emerged in April. China claimed it had legitimate reasons for all its actions, an additive found in the pork, or the actions of judges and juries beyond its control, but a foreign ministry spokesman warned Canada to take his country's concerns seriously. As Meng's lawyers point out, their allegations about abuse of process are one thing, but the very crime that their client is accused of violating sanctions against Iran, would not even be considered a crime in Canada because Canada does not have those same sanctions imposed by the United States as part of Trump's quest to isolate Iran further from the global community. Stephen: It is just one more case of Canada, a relatively small country of 37 million people, trying to establish its own identity in the presence and under the pressure of much bigger countries. As the Huawei spokesman pointed out, Canadians do value the Charter of Rights, just like they value independence, the rule of law, and the friendship of much bigger nations, and Canadians are about to ask themselves a crucial question in relation to the many things they cherish: what cost are they willing to pay to defend and uphold those values? Stephen: Coming up, on the next episode of Sanctioned: the words of a former Canadian prime minister come to haunt the current leader.  China pressures Canada to release Meng Wanzhou, while trying to stifle the protests of opponents in Hong Kong. [clip from Red Dragon plays]  Man: Whatever the Americans are claiming is a lie. Stephen: Art imitates life, as plans are announced for a movie, based on Meng Wanzhou's story.[music: somber] Stephen: I'm Stephen Quinn.

That's the primary source of the radiation,"" he said.Wimmer-Schweingruber said the radiation levels are close to what models had predicted. The levels measured by Chang'e 4, in fact, ""agree nearly exactly"" with measurements by a detector on a NASA orbiter that has been circling the moon for more than a decade, said Kerry Lee, a space radiation expert at Johnson Space Center in Houston.""It is nice to see confirmation of what we think and our understanding of how radiation interacts with the moon is as expected,"" said Lee, who was not involved in the Chinese-led study.In a detailed outline released this week, NASA said the first pair of astronauts to land on the moon under the new Artemis program would spend about a week on the lunar surface, more than twice as long as the Apollo crews did a half-century ago. Expeditions would last one to two months once a base camp is established.NASA is looking to put astronauts on the moon by the end of 2024, an accelerated pace ordered by the White House, and on Mars sometime in the 2030s.The space agency said it will have radiation detectors and a safe shelter aboard all Orion crew capsules flying to the moon. As for the actual landers, three separate corporate teams are developing their own craft with NASA oversight. For the first Artemis moon landing, at least, the astronauts will live in the ascent portion of their lander.The German researchers suggest shelters built of moon dirt — readily available material — for stays of more than a few days. The walls should be 80 centimetres thick, they said. Any thicker and the dirt will emit its own secondary radiation, created when galactic cosmic rays interact with the lunar soil.""So in this sense — I think the walls of European Castles would be too thick!""

608,"Canadians to help develop, test potential COVID-19 vaccine from Chinese company | CBC News",The National Research Council of Canada said Tuesday it will work with a Chinese company to try to develop its potential vaccine for COVID-19 more quickly.,2020-05-12T17:51:41.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/vaccine-cansino-1.5566216,"The National Research Council of Canada said Tuesday it will work with a Chinese company to try to develop its potential vaccine for COVID-19 more quickly.The Chinese company, CanSino Biologics, is already conducting human clinical trials for its vaccine.Federal governments the world over have said vaccines are urgently needed to allow mass gatherings to resume. But that's only if clinical trials in thousands of human volunteers show safety and efficacy before shots go into the arms of vast swaths of the general public.As of April, five vaccine candidates have moved into clinical development in early stage human trials, including CanSino's, called Ad5-nCoV.The collaboration announced on Tuesday will allow Canada's publicly funded research council to try to scale up the technology needed to produce enough of the candidate vaccine to protect Canadians.Matthew Herder, director of the Health Law Institute at Dalhousie University's law school in Halifax, evaluated contracts for the Canadian Ebola vaccine. That vaccine followed a similar path from the lab bench to mass production. Herder welcomed the NRC announcement and awaits the details.""I think it showcases the power of the public sector … to play a key role in the development of vaccines,"" he said.There could also be strings attached on pricing, how much manufacturing can be done in Canada to meet both domestic and international needs, and equity of access, he said.The NRC plans to use a cell line its scientists developed during Ebola vaccine research.WATCH | Steps to vaccine safety and efficacy:Lakshmi Krishnan, director general of the NRC's Human Health Therapeutics Research Centre, said the trials in Canada will complement and expand on what's been done in China.""We're bringing back home a Canadian technology, and we're able to have the most advanced vaccine candidate in the world potentially available for Canadians in short order,"" Krishnan said. A Phase 1 trial for the Ebola vaccine took place at the Canadian Centre for Vaccinology in Halifax. The coronavirus vaccine will initially also be tested on healthy human volunteers there, subject to Health Canada's approval.If successful, then Phase 2 trials could start in the fall at hospitals in other provinces with a vaccine available for non-commercial use produced on Canadian soil for front line workers and those at risk in late 2020 or early 2021, she said.Dr. Ross Upshur of the University of Toronto's Dalla Lana School of Public Health studies global health ethics. He isn't involved in the vaccine trials.""You can't really tell how effective something is until you've got a large number of people and it's out in the field,"" Upshur said. The federal government's previously announced $44 million for upgrades to the NRC's facility in Montreal also aims to allow for domestic production if the vaccine candidate pans out.Separately on Tuesday, the federal government pledged $600 million over five years to support Gavi, a partnership between governments and the private sector. The group aims to vaccinate children around the world with routine immunizations and supports efforts to stamp out the pandemic globally.Successful vaccines normally take five to 15 years to develop and mass produce.",0.10773809523809523,0.36094720496894406

617,TRANSCRIPT SANCTIONED EPISODE 8 | CBC Radio,Full-text transcript for Sanctioned episode eight,2020-07-24T17:35:47.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/radio/podcastnews/transcript-sanctioned-episode-8-1.5662097," Sanctioned - The Rule of LawHost: Stephen Quinn  Announcer: This is a CBC Podcast. [music: somber] Stephen Quinn: Previously on Sanctioned.  [music: somber] Stephen: Meng Wanzhou moves house and launches a new legal strategy in her battle against extradition, her lawyers question the actions of Canadian and American authorities at the time of her arrest. Meng claims her rights were violated the moment she stepped off a plane from Hong Kong and a videotape and transcripts, flesh out her first crucial hours in Canada. [somber music] [clip from Red Dragon plays]  [suspenseful music from film] Man: Whatever the Americans are claiming is a lie. Stephen: The movie trailer opens with a shot of a Chinese woman descending an escalator with two law enforcement officials in tow. The words, ""Canada Arrests a Chinese Executive"" fill the screen. Then the trailer cuts to the woman resting her head against the bars of a jail cell. [clip from Red Dragon plays]  Man: We are in an uncomfortable position because we have an extradition treaty with the Americans. [suspenseful music from film] Stephen: Words fill the screen again, ""The Chinese government retaliates."" [clip from Red Dragon plays]  Man: They just arbitrarily sentenced a Canadian to death, there's no telling where this retaliation will end. [suspenseful music from film] Stephen: The trailer is for the upcoming movie, ""Claws of the Red Dragon.""Supposedly, inspired by the dramatic situation surrounding Huawei chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou, the film stars a Canadian cast, most notably Eric Peterson, the award-winning actor perhaps best known for his role on one of the country's best-loved sitcoms, ""Corner Gas"". But there won't be a lot of laughs in this 54-minute thriller and it's really the name of the producer which is making headlines, not the names in the cast. It's Steve Bannon, right-wing American agitator and media mogul credited with engineering the political campaign that put U.S. President Donald Trump into office. Bannon says the fictional movie will expose ties between Huawei, known as Hua Xing in the film, and the Chinese communist government, and its military. [clip of Bannon speaking] Stephen: The backbone of the future of technology is 5G. It will be a dominant technology. Right now, the path that Huawei's taken as a front for the PLA is to basically take over the networks and the components throughout the world. If we allow this to happen, even for a couple more years, Huawei is going to control, basically, the communications systems of the west. Stephen: Huawei has repeatedly refuted such allegations. [clip from Red Dragon plays]  Man: This is a crazy accusation by countries who are jealous of our success. Stephen: ""Claws of the Red Dragon"" is set to be released in September,  as Meng Wanzhou, Ms. Fung in the film, prepares for two weeks of court dates ahead of her extradition hearing in January. So, is it art imitating life or is it politics imitating art and looking to influence the outcome of an ongoing drama? [clip from Red Dragon plays]  [phone rings] Woman: [speaking: Mandarin] Hello?  Stephen: Whatever the truth is, a real-life ending to Meng Wanzhou's story has yet to be written and competing storylines are about to collide. [music: Somber] Stephen: I'm Stephen Quinn and you're listening to Sanctioned: the Arrest of a Telecom Giant, a CBC Vancouver original podcast about Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou and her fight against possible extradition and jailing in the United States for allegedly violating economic sanctions against Iran. It is a journey deep into the world of global business and politics, up front deals and allegations of back room skullduggery in the battle to dominate the economies of the future, not to mention the extraordinary wealth and power of a few of the world's most influential players. Stephen: In this episode, entertaining though ""Claws of the Red Dragon"" promises to be, we'll look beyond fiction to the facts which led to the Chinese conflict with Canada. We'll also look beyond Vancouver to the streets of Hong Kong, Meng's other home, and the scene of her alleged crime, where China is facing pressure from its own citizens, even as it is placing pressure on Canadians. And tensions in Canada will reach a boiling point as a former Prime Minister weighs in.This is Sanctioned, Episode 8: The Rule of Law. [music: somber] Stephen: Jean Chretien was the Prime Minister of Canada on July 1st, 1997. On that day, the stroke of midnight marked the historic handover of what had been the British colony of Hong Kong back to the Chinese. [news clips play] [music: regal] Reporter: A century and a half of British rule in Hong Kong is simply history tonight. Man: I am the 28the. Governor. The last governor, my wife, my children and myself will take Hong Kong home in our hearts. Reporter 2: They left us to the call of trumpets echoing across the Pearl River. A long goodbye that ended with a wave. Stephen: And July 1st also happened to be Canada Day, so there were fireworks on both sides of the globe. Chretien is known to friends and foes alike as the self-styled little guy from Shawinigan, a scrappy fighter and perennial underdog who always seems to come out on top. In his youth, Chretien suffered from an attack of Bell's palsy, permanently leaving the left side of his face paralyzed. Stephen: As veteran foreign correspondent Jonathan Manthorpe says, it's a condition that, along with his strong Quebec accent, Chretien has used to endear himself to the public and to obscure sharp political skills with an everyman veneer.  [clip Jonathan Manthorpe speaking] Jonathan Manthorpe: He was a very eminent lawyer. He was Minister of Justice. He was actually, initially made his parliamentary name in the Pierre Trudeau cabinet as Minister of what was then called Indian Affairs. So, as you say, the sort of scrappy street fighter from the boonies of Quebec was the image he'd like to cultivate, but he was actually a very sophisticated and accomplished man. Stephen: By 1993, Chretien had risen to the post of Prime Minister himself. He would be the last Liberal to form a majority government, until Justin Trudeau took office in 2015.Chretien resigned more than a decade earlier, in the midst of allegations that later became known as ""the Sponsorship Scandal"", a uniquely Canadian morass of corruption,  payoffs, and misuse of public funds, centred around the actions of the Liberals in Chretien's home province. But back to 1997, when Chretien, along with the rest of the world, watched the birth of a new day in Kong Kong and what became known in China as the era of ""One country, two systems"".    [news clips play] [music: regal] [man speaks in Mandarin] Stephen: In his first term as Prime Minister, Jean Chretien led the largest foreign trade delegation to China in the years following the Tiananmen Square massacre. [news clips play] Reporter: Scattered protests continue to sputter and there are new reports of skirmishes and violence in the wake of this weekend's massive military assault aimed at smashing China's pro-democracy demonstrations. [sounds: protesting ] Reporter 2: The troops have been firing indiscriminately, but still, there are thousands of  people on the streets who will not move back. Reporter 3:  As the army units approached the centre of the city, they were firing into side streets, killing and injuring scores of comprehending and unarmed men women and children. Stephen: Although China has never acknowledged the slaughter of hundreds, possibly thousands, of student protesters by its army in 1989, Jonathan Manthorpe says Chretien's overtures helped reboot Canada's relationship with the Chinese government. [clip of Jonathan Manthorpe speaking]  Jonathan: China, Chinese Communist Party was still in international purgatory of sanctions because of that incident. In fact, it was a national uprising. There were similar massacres in about a hundred or so cities around China. It wasn't just in Tiananmen Square, it was much more significant than that and I think the Chinese Communist Party at that point looked to Chretien to help them out of the international doldrums in which they'd been thrust because of the massacre. Stephen: The relationship between Canada and the Chinese communist government dates back more than 50 years, to a point when Pierre Trudeau began negotiations with the People's Republic of China in order to open diplomatic relations with the communist giant and at its core, the relationship relies on a belief that is embraced by politicians of all stripes, Canadian and otherwise, politicians who seek to take advantage of China's great economic possibilities, even as they cast a wary eye to the human rights abuses of a dictatorship. It's the idea that you could embrace the light of the communist country without sacrificing anything to its darkness. Stephen: In his post-political life, Chretien continued to make frequent visits to China as part of his work with an elite law firm. He had earned the respect of Chinese governments, past and present, so it made sense that in early June 2019, another former Canadian Prime Minister, a rival even, Brian Mulroney suggested Jean Chretien might be just the man to sweeten Canada's suddenly poisoned relationship with China. Stephen: The idea is to win the release of Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, the two Canadians who had been imprisoned in China and accused of spying, and to rebuild Canada's trade relationship with China, which had banned Canadian canola and meat, all implemented in the wake of Meng Wanzhou's arrest.  As it turned out, Jean Chretien was more than willing to step into the fray once again, but perhaps not in the way that current Prime Minister Justin Trudeau might have hoped. [music: somber] Stephen: On June 12th, just as the Globe and Mail newspaper was putting the finishing touches on a bombshell of a story about Jean Chretien and Meng Wanzhou, riot police hit the streets of Hong Kong. [news clips play] Reporter: It's absolute chaos here on the streets of Hong Kong.  As you can see behind me, there were literally tens of thousands of pro-democracy supporters out here tonight, rallying against the Government's proposal to change extradition laws. Woman: [speaking: in an alternate language] Translator: I think the most important thing is to oppose this evil law.  Reporter 2: The police are also adopting more aggressive tactics, moving in faster and for the first time firing rubber bullets and beanbag rounds. Methods, Amnesty International has criticised as excessive force. Stephen: Police were sent out to quell growing protests against proposed legislation that would have further blurred the lines of the so-called 'One country, two systems' relationship between the Chinese mainland and the Hong Kong special administrative region.Ironically enough, given Meng's current predicament, the subject of the legislation was extradition. If enacted, the law would allow authorities in Hong Kong to detain and extradite suspects to mainland China and Taiwan to face trial. Critics complained that the rule would expose a population that was promised relative autonomy back in 1997 to the arbitrary and unjust realities of the Chinese legal system. [clip of Ivy Li speaking]   Ivy Li: Everyone in Hong Kong knows that China or anybody in China that can corrupt the officials and use any charges to try and get at people that they don't like or don't want. So, that is where the Hong Kong people are saying, if this amendment bill will pass, it means that everyone in Hong Kong will be at risk. Doesn't matter, you're a businessman or you are just an ordinary citizen or you are dissident. Stephen: Ivy Li, with the group Canadian Friends of Hong Kong, says erosion of the rights and freedoms of Hong Kongers started long before this extradition bill was proposed, and so the bill is really just the tip of the iceberg, there are much, much deeper political and socio-economic grievances. So in the days that followed the initial protests, the crowds grew and Hong Kong chief executive Carrie Lam, eventually announced the suspension of the bill and then later, even a withdrawal, but despite grave warnings from the Chinese government and increasingly violent police crackdowns, the protests in Hong Kong continued and civilians fought fire with fire.  Stephen: Lawyers, students, professors, waiters, housewives, grandparents, a sea of opponents eventually drew up a list of five core demands: complete withdrawal of the extradition bill,  the release of protesters, an independent commission into police conduct, the resignation of Carrie Lam, and universal suffrage. [clip of Ivy Li speaking]   Ivy: Because people start to realize that all these things they're seeing is only a symptom. The real solution to it, is to have to fight for universal suffrage so they can actually elect their own government. Doesn't matter how many times that the chief executives resign, step down. It will only be replaced by another puppet. So, even if the extradition bill is being withdrawn, Hong Kong will not be safe anymore because the police are behaving like the citizens are their enemies. So, people are saying that no, it's too late, too little. Stephen: Ivy, what was it like for you, or what is it like for you because those protests continue. What is it like for you to be watching what's going on there now from this far away? What do you think of what you've been seeing? Ivy: Um, it is very sad because it is a very beautiful, vibrant city and even though I left it for so many years, I still have family and friends back there. I know that Hong Kong would not be the same. Stephen: If unrest in Hong Kong, troubling though it may be, seems like a long way from the plight of Meng Wanzhou, remember, her story and the dilemma Canada is facing are both very much wrapped up in the tensions of that city.CBC reporter Jason Proctor's here to explain. Hello Jason. Jason Proctor: Hi, Stephen. Stephen: What does all this political unrest in Hong Kong have to do with Meng Wanzhou? Jason: Well, you want to think about Hong Kong in this whole story as almost this kind of third background character to all of this drama. Meng Wanzhou had actually flown from Hong Kong to Vancouver on the day she was arrested. According to the notes of the Canada Border Services agent who detained Meng in the hours after she stepped off the plane in December, she said she had traveled on a Hong Kong passport because she'd relinquished her People's Republic of China passport. Jason: So, in addition to the two Vancouver properties she owns in Canada, she has three apartments in London. Interestingly Monk said she also owned four more homes, two in Hong Kong, and two just across the border with mainland China in Shenzhen. You know, those properties reflect the realities of a life for a woman like Meng Wanzhou who does billionaire business in both the East and the West, in Hong Kong and in mainland China. Stephen: And Huawei's headquarters are actually based in Shenzhen. Yeah, Shenzhen is the first special economic zone that was established by China in 1980 for citizens to experiment with market capitalism it was in the back room of a restaurant in Hong Kong though that Meng travelled when she wanted, you know, allegedly to reassure an HSBC executive that the company was not breaking U.S. sanctions in the sort of action that gave rise to this whole case. Stephen: As Meng's father Ren Zhengfei had proven, China's ""experiment"" with capitalism, at this point, was beyond successful, but now, with the world watching, the Chinese military was beginning to amass in  Meng's other home in Shenzhen, which was a message, you know, an implied threat, you might say to the protesters on the other side of the border in Hong Kong and, you know, it was that kind of threat, veiled or naked, that figured into the thinking of the thousands of people who fled Hong Kong before the handover to China in 1997, landing in British Columbia, Canada, and now people in Canada and particularly in British Columbia were keeping a keen eye on this growing conflict. [music: somber] Stephen: Protesters and counter protesters in Vancouver would mirror the battles on Hong Kong's streets in much the same way that Meng's supporters would face off against her detractors on the steps of the courthouse where she fought for bail and in every case,  allegations were hurled back and forth about the potential influence of the Chinese state. Stephen: The front page headline in the Globe and Mail on June 13th caught the eye of the Canadian government almost immediately.""Chretien proposes cancelling Meng's extradition case to unfreeze relations with China.""The story went on to say that former Prime Minister, Jean Chretien, in private conversations with business executives, had been floating the idea that Canada's Justice Minister should exert his authority to end the extradition process against Meng. Stephen: The story said the proposal had not yet been formally presented to the Trudeau government, but that it would meet Chinese president Xi Jinping's demand that Meng be freed to return home to Beijing, as a means to ramp down reprisals that extended beyond the Canadians marking time in a Chinese prison, to the thousands of farmers whose livelihoods were being threatened by the Chinese bans on Canadian agricultural products. Now, it's true that Justice Minister David Lametti could intervene in Meng's extradition proceeding at any time, it is, after all, within the legislation, but as Paul Evans with the School of Public Policy and Global Affairs at UBC told me, this provision has never been acted upon by a Canadian justice minister.  [clip of Paul Evans speaking]  Paul Evans: Some lawyers would make the case that it shouldn't be acted upon, but nevertheless, it is not undue interference in a legal proceeding. It is something that has been anticipated in the legislation from the outset. Secondly, I think that if a current justice minister or a future justice minister, we don't know the outcome of the election, but that a future minister and government would have to start preparing the ground for the Canadian public and preparing the ground for the United States. Stephen: And that would be a huge issue with the United States, if the Minister stepped in to end the extradition proceedings. Paul: It would be. It would be unprecedented and particularly in the context of the major U.S. confrontation with China, which, there may be some magic, but at the moment, it looks like this is building towards a multidimensional confrontation, that for Canada to make a decision to release Madam Meng, that would need a lot of explaining and a lot of courage by any government that wished to do it. Stephen: Canada's Foreign Affairs Minister, Chrystia Freeland almost immediately rejected Chretien's suggestion. [clip of Chrystia Freeland speaking] Chrystia Freeland: When it comes to the extradition request around Ms. Meng, Canada has very carefully and intentionally abided by our extradition treaty commitments and, I think, when we reflect on it, it would be clear to all of us that it would be a very dangerous precedent indeed for Canada to alter its behaviour when it comes to honouring an extradition treaty in response to external pressure. Stephen:  But Chretien's proposal had raised a point that in some ways,  touched the heart of Canada's conflict with China, and the many underlying tensions. [music: somber] Stephen: What is the value of one individual, as measured against the interests of the wider population or the desires of the state? It's the kind of question Chretien himself had faced in 1997, when RCMP pepper sprayed protesters at an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit meeting at the University of British Columbia, a stone's throw from Meng's mansion. Chretien was accused of sacrificing the Canadian right to free speech  to save an Indonesian dictator from embarrassment. At the time, Chretien even joked about the effects of pepper spray. [clip of Chretien speaking] Jean Chretien: For me, I put pepper on my plate. [crowd laughs] Jean: Next. Stephen: And now, nearly a quarter century later, Chretien was suggesting that the rule of extradition law take a back seat to Canada's economic interests with China, a country that is allegedly holding Canadians hostage to get its way, a country that, even as the Meng Wanzhou drama was playing out, was threatening to crack down on peaceful protesters who were marching in Hong Kong in the millions, demanding their rights. Stephen: This was an awkward time for Canada to be having this conversation. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's government was facing a rule of law scandal of its own, grounded in an allegation that he had attempted to force his attorney general into giving Canadian engineering giant SNC Lavalin, a break on a criminal case that could have killed the company. Trudeau claimed he was putting Canadian jobs first. Chretien was suggesting he do just that, by freeing Meng Wanzhou and Meng's lawyers were listening. [music: somber] Stephen: The statement came out as a blast email, jointly signed by all four of Meng Wanzhou's lawyers. Canada, they said, was at a crossroads, and Canadian values were at stake. Jason Proctor's back with me now. So Jason, what exactly were Meng's lawyers trying to say here?  Jason: They cited former Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien's comments as the impetus for what they claimed was an appeal to Canada's Minister of Justice to drop the extradition proceedings against their client Meng Wanzhou, and I'll read from their statement, because it was fairly extraordinary. Quote, ""from time to time, Canadian governments have had to make difficult decisions, sometimes at odds with the foreign policy initiatives of its allies, including the United States, in order to assert essential Canadian values of human decency, fairness, tolerance and respect for human rights and the rule of law,"" end quote, and that was from this statement. Stephen: Except that tolerance and respect for human rights were not the only factors at play here. Jason: No, certainly not. And they weren't front and centre in the argument being put forward through, you know, the Globe Mail story on Chretien. Meng's lawyers claimed the cessation of the proceedings would be in the best interests of Canada's national interests and they went on to underscore a point that would become central to their argument for Meng's freedom because, well, only the United States has sanctions prohibiting foreign banks from entering into U.S. dollar transactions with foreign companies selling commercial goods in Iran.  Jason: So, what they say is man's alleged crime wouldn't be a crime in Canada, and again this is quoting from the statement, ""Canada does not police the conduct of foreign persons in foreign lands that have nothing to do with Canada"". That's from the statement and Meng's lawyers backed up their argument with another page from Chretien's book. [music: somber] Stephen: On February 15th, 2003, crowds began streaming into downtown Vancouver. Their destination? The art gallery. Once a provincial courthouse, the hundred-year-old building that houses the gallery was renovated in the 1980s by Arthur Erickson, part of the same complex of buildings where Meng Wanzhou would later face trial. Stephen: The gallery has served as a locus for protest for decades and in 2003, with a U.S. led war against Iraq imminent, more than 40,000 people gathered in the streets, joining millions around the world to oppose the invasion. [clips from Iraq war protests] Man: We are here to send a message of hope and solidarity for the people of Iraq. Woman: We are here today because we want to say to the Canadian government, have the courage to stand up and speak out and stop this war. Do not be complicit in the war on Iraq. Stephen: Just a few months earlier, Prime Minister Jean Chretien announced that Canada would not be part of the American coalition. It was a controversial move at the time, one that spurred debate, but it proved that Canada can go it alone when national interest was at stake. So now, years later,  Meng Wanzhou's lawyers are pointing to that decision as evidence that Canada can stand up to the pressures of its allies. [music: somber] Stephen: Ironically, David Lametti, the justice minister who was the target of Meng's appeal, had just taking over for Jody Wilson-Raybould, the Liberal politician who claimed she had stood up to her own government in order to defend the rule of law when it came to the prosecution of the engineering giant SNC Lavalin. As foreign affairs minister Chrystia Freeland acknowledged to the CBC, if Meng was committed for extradition, there would come a point when Lametti would have to make a decision, no matter what, as to whether Meng should be sent to the United States. Saying you're a rule of law country doesn't mean political decisions don't get taken, Freeland said. And in fact, Jason, the political element of the extradition process is actually baked right into the law. Jason: Well, yeah, it is. You know, in 2001, Canada's top court, Supreme Court of Canada decided not to extradite four men wanted in the United States for a 22 million dollar telemarketing scam. So, the reason in that case, which has precedent with regards to, you know, the situation Meng Wanzhou is in, it was from comments that American prosecutors made to a CBC show, The Fifth Estate, implying that one of the accused would be ""the boyfriend of a very bad man"", if he waited out his extradition hearing and wound up in a U.S. jail. Jason: So, the men involved at the center of that case, argued that they were being threatened with rape in prison, and that would be a violation of the very same Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms that  Meng Wanzhou was arguing, should act as a shield for her against the actions of authorities determined to put her behind bars. So this was a case when the courts essentially said, the Minister of Justice should have refused a request from the United States or should have at least stepped in and overruled the court. Meng's lawyers claimed this was another one of those times, they urged the Canadian government to stand up for Canadian values.  [somber music] Stephen: But what exactly would that mean? Should the Canadian government support the legal request of an ally, or give into the bullying tactics of a valued trading partner?It was a conundrum Lametti would have to ponder, even as tanks gathered in Shenzhen, thousands of protesters linked arms in Hong Kong and the world watched. It was to be a summer of discontent in Hong Kong, Vancouver, and in Washington, where rumours of a recession began dogging U.S. President Donald Trump. [news clips play] Donald Trump: I don't see a recession. I mean, the world is in a recession right now. Woman: Over the next 12 months the recession probability is above 80 percent. Reporter: Democrats pin the blame on the White House's trade war with China. Presidential candidate, Pete Buttigieg. Pete Buttigieg:  But it's also a fool's errand to think you're gonna be able to get China to change the fundamentals of their economic model by poking them in the eye with some tariffs. Stephen: The trade battle between the U.S. and China had become tit for tat and with Christmas looming, American consumers were starting to feel the pain of billions of dollars worth of tariffs and American farmers began to grumble about the impact of Chinese retaliation, which was beginning to hurt their pocketbooks.Trump's Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, tried to walk back the president's suggestion that Meng Wanzhou might be used as a bargaining chip.  [clip of Mike Pompeo speaking] Mike Pompeo: We've been pretty clear, with respect to the way we process and ask other countries with respect to extradition. I expect this case will be no different from that attorney general bar and the Justice Department team have a process by which they evaluate anytime they ask for this extradition which is a big lift oftentimes, certainly in this case, it is as well. They were thoughtful in the request and they'll continue to accord with American law and international law in the way that they proceed. I'm very confident of that.  Stephen: Movie audiences braced themselves for the release of ""Claws of the Red Dragon""  [clip from Red Dragon plays]  Woman: This is a democracy, reporters write the truth, editors allow that truth to be published, the legal system operates without interference, full stop. Stephen: And court watchers prepared for the next episode of the legal drama, when Meng's lawyers would face prosecutors in court for the first real legal skirmish in the fight, a fight ahead of the extradition hearing itself, a battle for disclosure of notes, documents, and correspondence between Canadian and U.S. authorities in the leadup to Meng's arrest. It would likely be the next time the world got a glimpse of the embattled Huawei CFO, a court appearance taking place weeks before a Canadian election, where the rule of law, the relationship with China, and the future of 5G would all be on the table. Meng Wanzhou would still face extradition after the election, but would her situation come to haunt a new Canadian government? [music: somber] Stephen: This is our last episode for now,  but we expect to be back with more as events warrant in the coming months. One big date to keep an eye out for is January of 2020, that's when Meng Wanzhou's actual extradition hearing will begin. In the meantime, stay tuned to CBC for all the latest developments in the story. [music: somber] Stephen: I'm Stephen Quinn.

The virus that leads to COVID-19 is known as SARS-CoV-2​​​​.Dr. Allison McGeer, a clinical scientist with Sinai Health System in Toronto, said SARS-CoV-2 probably started showing up in China in November 2019.The World Health Organization says Chinese officials first reported cases of pneumonia with an unknown cause to the WHO Country Office on Dec. 31, 2019. What we know (and don't know) about the coronavirus outbreakOverall, 80 per cent of those who get infected will have mild symptoms, said Dr. Isaac Bogoch, an infectious disease expert at University Health Network in Toronto. Severe COVID-19 cases are more common for those who are ""older, immunocompromised and/or have underlying health issues,"" said McGeer. In February, China's centre for disease control and prevention (China CDC), published a study outlining the age and gender of 72,314 people infected with COVID-19.  The findings show that about 80 per cent of those who died from COVID-19 in China were 60 or older. In Italy, the National Health Institute says the average age of patients who have died is 81, with the majority suffering from underlying health problems.""The disease in children appears to be mild,"" said McGeer. China CDC found that only 0.9 per cent of infections were children under the age of 10.Canada's first COVID-19 death is not cause for panic — but shows need to protect most vulnerableAccording to the World Health Organization:Proper hand hygiene, said McGeer, can greatly reduce your risk of contracting the illness.  Although using soap to thoroughly cleanse your hands is best, ""if hand sanitizer is all you have, use that,"" said Bogoch. ""Go for the hand sanitizer that has about 70 per cent alcohol,"" he said. The World Health Organization says the virus is spread from person-to-person through small droplets from an infected person's mouth or nose. ""If you get the virus on your hands, this virus does not infect you through your skin,"" said McGeer. ""It has to then be transmitted to your eyes, mouth or nose.""  That's why it's so important to keep your hands away from your face, said Bogoch. ""It's actually hard to do that in practice, but if people are mindful and don't touch their faces… they'll come into less contact with this virus,"" said Bogoch.COVID-19 isn't a gastrointestinal virus, said McGeer. ""We've seen quarantines in China and Italy … but there's not been a circumstance in which there has been shortages of food or or basic supplies or life saving medication.,"" she said. If you do get sick, you will need to stay home for two weeks. Having enough food for 14 days is key, said McGeer. You should also refill your prescriptions so you have enough medication to last through a quarantine.  Though many people infected with COVID-19 may have few or no symptoms, the government of Canada's website says those symptoms include: Stay home, say both McGeer and Bogoch. The government of Canada website also outlines that if you need to see a doctor or go to the hospital because your illness is severe, call ahead or tell officials that you have a respiratory illness right when you arrive.  Canadians being urged to help 'flatten the curve' of COVID-19WHO is coordinating efforts to develop vaccines and some drug treatments are currently under investigation. But Bogoch said a vaccine is at least a year away. He said the infectious disease community believes that there are three scenarios for the future of COVID-19: ""We need to develop an effective vaccine to protect communities from this infection, because it's unlikely to go away anytime soon,"" said Bogoch.",0.1428814725326353,0.4884408872780966

He moved to Yellowknife 15 years ago to take the job. So while he wants to avoid travelling on any routes where he could be exposed to the illness, or carrying the illness himself, there's also another reason he's choosing to stay put.""I want to set an example for other people.""Shen's wife, Nancy Lin, says she's OK with that decision. She and the couple's daughter have been in Yellowknife the whole time, checking in with Steve by phone. ""He is having a good time,"" Lin said. But Lin has faced her own COVID-19 battles at home. She usually travels to China over the holidays, visiting family for two weeks at a time. This year, she changed that plan in order to prepare for an exam. One afternoon in January, she was in the downtown grocery store when she saw one of her co-workers, who knows her usual pattern. ""He passed by,"" she said, ""and then realized it was me. And then he stepped two steps far away from me, which is kind of about two metres away from me, and then he stopped and turned and said, 'Hey, Nancy! Have you just come back from China?'""Obviously I can feel that two-metres distance."" In China, Shen says he's already seen concern about the COVID-19 virus calm down. He spoke to the CBC from a street side tea shop and said people were smiling and out walking around.""That was not the situation one month ago. People were very worried."" Shen said he's also hoping to get some more information as an international traveller returning to the N.W.T., ""such as guidance on isolation and prevention.""So far, the territorial government has not issued any general warnings or advice on whether or not to travel — inside or outside of the country. The World Health Organization has not yet advised against any international travel.The federal government issued a travel advisory on Jan. 7 advising Canadians ""to consider avoiding non-essential travel to China"" and other countries affected by the COVID-19 virus. That advisory recommends travellers who do go to China avoid spending time in large crowds, avoid sick people and animals, and follow local public health advice. Travellers returning from China are asked to monitor their health for fever, cough and difficulty breathing for 14 days, and ""avoid places where you cannot easily separate from others if you become ill.""People who do develop symptoms are asked to isolate themselves from others as quickly as possible and contact a health-care professional.Those who have travelled to China's Hubei Province (of which Wuhan is the capital) are asked to contact the public health authority in the area where they live within 24 hours of arriving in Canada. ",0.11581289081289078,0.43630007558579

At the time, the United States had recently escalated the trade war with China, which is still in effect.""If I think it's good for what will be certainly the largest trade deal ever made — which is a very important thing — what's good for national security, I would certainly intervene if I thought it was necessary,"" Trump replied.Meng's lawyers say the actions of the president and U.S. Attorney General William Barr in the cases of both Trump's former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn and his political advisor Roger Stone make clear that his words are not just idle talk.Flynn — who Trump called ""a good guy"" — pleaded guilty twice to lying to the Federal Bureau of Investigation about conversations with Russia's ambassador, yet the case against him was dismissed after the U.S. Justice Department intervened.In February, Trump demanded a new trial for Stone, calling himself ""the chief law enforcement officer of the country."" More recently, he acted to commute Stone's three year prison sentence for witness tampering and lying to Congress.""The two examples show that the (U.S.) president not only thinks he can intervene in prosecutions, but that he will do so when it suits his political agenda,"" Meng's lawyers wrote.They also said that Trump has already said that ""there is MUCH more to come"" when it comes to interventions.The court documents also claim Trudeau contributed to the politicization of the case in statements he made to a French language TV show in December 2019 with regard to former diplomat Michael Kovrig and entrepreneur Michael Spavor.The two were detained in China within days of Meng's arrest and have since been accused of spying. Both men have been held in Chinese prisons for more than a year and a half.Trudeau claimed his government told the U.S. it ""should not sign a final and complete agreement with China that does not settle the question of Meng Wanzhou and the two Canadians.""""As a bargaining chip in a global trade war, (Meng faces) intimidation regarding the ramifications her own decisions may have on others,"" her lawyers claim.They say a reasonable person would believe that how Meng ""defends her extradition could alter the consequences faced by the two Canadians held in China.Her defence strategy could also impact Huawei in its future interests as a globally competitive company, as well as Canada's economy.""The legal arguments are all part of a series of attempts that the defence plans to make to have the case against Meng tossed for alleged abuse of process. The same newly filed batch of court documents include an argument that the U.S. failed to disclose material facts in its record of the case that show Meng's statements to banks had no impact on the financial decisions in question.If necessary, the defence team also plans to argue that Canadian and U.S. authorities conspired to violate Meng's Constitutional rights at the time of her arrest.To that end, her lawyers will be in federal court next week to argue for the release of Canadian Security Intelligence Service documents that they claim prove collusion with the FBI.CSIS has already released a number of heavily redacted documents suggesting that it was aware of Meng's arrest and in contact with the FBI and other agencies.Canada's attorney general claims the redacted information should be kept from public view because of national security concerns. Affidavits filed in the case suggest that the details could inflame tensions with China and alienate intelligence sources.But in federal court documents released Friday, Meng's lawyers claim the information could be crucial to her defence.""If there is additional information hidden under the redactions ... national security privilege should not be used to cover up the abuse,"" the lawyers state.""Additionally, national security privilege should not be used to protect government enforcement officials from being embarrassed.""Meng has been living under house arrest since her release on $10 million bail in the week after her initial arrest.She wears a monitoring bracelet as part of her release conditions and lives in one of two multi-million mansions she owns on Vancouver's west side.She has denied the allegations made against her. ",0.1004666048237477,0.370926097711812

Sign up here to get this delivered to your inbox every morning.Canadians are shopping online in record numbers during the pandemic — sales almost doubled from $1.6 billion in February to $2.8 billion in August, according to Statistics Canada.  But what happens when those items don't arrive? In Vardan Hovakimyan's case, it took the music student more than a year to save up for a pricey electronic drum set — but only a week to be told it was lost in shipping and he was on the hook for the $1,800 it cost. The 40003 Speedlight Electronic Drum Kit was shipped in two boxes. Only one arrived at the Purolator outlet on Sept. 16, missing key pieces and rendering the set useless.  Things got complicated when Hovakimyan asked for a refund. He spent weeks going back and forth between the shipping company and the retailer, trying to get them to track down the missing box or give him his money back.  Purolator said it would look for the package, but he'd have to deal with the seller if he wanted a refund. The seller, Acclaim Sound and Lighting in North Bay, Ont., would only offer a replacement if the set was back in stock sometime in the future — or give him the $100 it got from shipping insurance.WATCH | A look at two shoppers whose online orders never arrived:The National  Consumer laws are on the side of online shoppers when deliveries go missing, but experts say taking advantage of those laws is harder than it should be, made more complicated when companies try to shift the cost of lost parcels onto buyers in their policies.  ""It's certainly not unusual that companies will write policies that are one-sided and intended to make consumers feel they have fewer rights than they do,"" said Ken Whitehurst, executive director of the Consumers Council of Canada. He said some company policies indicate the buyer is responsible for merchandise that's lost in shipping, even though consumer laws clearly say the retailer is responsible.  He said buyers often think they are at the mercy of those store policies.

Supreme Court. But Supt. Bryce McRae will take the stand in a world that has changed in at least one fundamental way in the past two weeks: the country seeking to extradite Meng has elected a new president. Observers are anxious to see what U.S. president-elect Joe Biden might mean for a case in which the actions of current President Donald Trump have featured so prominently. Paul Evans, a professor in the University of British Columbia's school of public policy and global affairs, said there is little doubt Biden will ""continue the concept of China as a rival and a strategic competitor."" But Evans believes the incoming administration may take a less confrontational approach — while also being more willing to consider the interests of an ally like Canada in dealing with China's anger over Meng's arrest. Read more on this story here.  Transport Canada has suspended six employees without pay for spreading a racist email at work more than a decade ago, following a CBC News story last year that triggered an internal investigation. The department's probe found 10 workers shared an offensive parody song called Strangers on my Flight, set to the tune of a Frank Sinatra number, between 2006 and 2010. The spoof song features derogatory lyrics based on racial stereotypes about travellers wearing turbans and mentions harming travellers with baseball bats. In a memo sent to all staff on Tuesday, the department's deputy minister Michael Keenan and associate deputy minister Arun Thangaraj said that while the email was sent years ago, its distribution amounted to an act of ""systemic racism that had a negative impact on our workplace and the public's confidence in Transport Canada's ability to operate without bias."" Of the 10 employees who shared the email, only six still work for the department. Read more on the suspensions here.   As the number of high-profile online consumer security breaches continues to grow, the federal government is expected to introduce a bill to shake up Canada's privacy laws — possibly as soon as today. Innovation Minister Navdeep Bains signalled plans to introduce the legislation late last week on the House of Commons notice paper. The bill would be the first major attempt to change Canada's privacy law in decades. Details of the bill won't be available until the legislation is tabled, but a spokesperson for Bains pointed to the promises outlined in the minister's mandate letter — which tasked him with drafting a ""digital charter"" that would include legislation to give Canadians ""appropriate compensation"" when their personal data is breached. Read more here about the pending bill.  Shell Canada will plant more than 800,000 trees in the interior of British Columbia next year, a project that the company hopes will create valuable carbon offsets in the future. Shell is one of the companies pushing the federal government to create a national greenhouse gas offset program, which Ottawa announced last year with no specific timeline for when it might start. Carbon offsets allow companies and individuals to invest in environmental projects in order to balance out their own greenhouse gas emissions. Increasingly, energy companies are setting climate goals to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. While the firms expect technological innovation will play a big role in achieving those targets, in addition to sequestering emissions underground, purchasing offsets are a way to make sure there is at least a pathway to reaching ambitious environmental targets. While innovation will likely occur, the technology under development may not prove to be as effective as hoped. Read more here on the push for a carbon offset program.  Donald Trump shows no sign of ever admitting he lost the U.S. presidential election fairly. The closest he came was a tweet Sunday that suggested Joe Biden won through treachery — and after some media interpreted that as a grudging concession, Trump pulled it back with other tweets like: ""I concede NOTHING! We have a long way to go. This was a RIGGED ELECTION!"" Trump's words are legally irrelevant to the outcome, but some of his supporters say they're waiting to hear him concede before they'll accept his loss and move on. Read more on why Trump's non-admission of defeat could have a slow-burning effect for years.WATCH | Donald Trump refuses to concede in ongoing presidential transition saga:  Now for some good news to start your Monday: There are all sorts of ways to make the world a brighter place.

627,Alberta unconcerned about OPEC prediction for slower growth in oil demand over next 25 years | CBC News,Alberta’s energy minister is unconcerned about a new report by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) that suggests demand for oil will plateau in a decade.,2020-10-09T01:00:25.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/alberta-unconcerned-about-opec-prediction-for-slower-growth-in-oil-demand-over-next-25-years-1.5756345,"Alberta's energy minister is unconcerned about a new report by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) that suggests demand for oil will plateau in a decade.""As we all know, plateau does not mean end of demand — it means end of continuous growth in demand,"" Sonya Savage said in a written statement to CBC News on Thursday. ""Oil and gas will still be required as demand gradually declines. OPEC itself believes that oil will remain the largest contributor to the energy mix through 2045.""The OPEC's World Oil Outlook covers the period from 2020 to 2045. According to the report, demand for oil in 2020 is 90.7 million barrels a day. It will grow to 107 million barrels a day in 2030 and 109 million barrels a day in 2045.""Global oil demand will grow at relatively healthy rates during the first part of the forecast period before demand begins to plateau over a relatively long period during the second half,"" the report said. It also acknowledges a gradual shift away from oil, noting that oil will make up 27.5 per cent of the energy mix in 2045, down from the 31.5 per cent in 2020.Solar, wind and geothermal power will jump from 2.1 per cent of fuel sources in 2020 to 8.7 per cent over that same period, said the OPEC report. Natural gas will also see an increase from 23.1 per cent in 2020 to 25.3 per cent in 2045.While demand for oil is expected to drop in OECD (Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development) countries, it will increase in places like India and China, due to ""a growing middle class, high population growth rates and stronger economic growth potential.""""The largest contributor to this incremental demand is anticipated to be India, adding some 6.3 [million barrels per day] between 2019 and 2045.""The report reflects uncertainty about how long the current pandemic will last and whether changes prompted by COVID-19, like working from home and avoiding international travel, will persist. Oil demand will also be impacted by the move to vehicles powered by electricity, natural gas and hydrogen, as well as measures to reduce climate change, the report said. Richard Masson, an executive fellow with the school of public policy at the University of Calgary and chair of the Canadian chapter of the World Petroleum Council, said the OPEC report sees strong markets for oil over the next 25 years and noted that Canada is one of four non-OPEC countries that can increase production. . ""This scenario is good for Alberta,"" Masson said. ""The challenge, of course, is OPEC notes that the commitments made under the Paris agreement are not being met and there needs to be further work by countries around the world to come up with solutions.""Last month, a forecast from British Petroleum suggested demand for fossil fuels has already peaked due to lasting effects of the pandemic and a switch to renewable energy. The report looked at three scenarios — two suggested oil has already peaked, the third has demand reaching a peak around 2030. Masson said COVID-19 may not have as big of an impact when viewed over a span of 25 years. ""The long-term demand has been driven primarily by more people in the world and more people moving into the middle class, especially in Asia. China and India [are] the two big drivers,"" he said. ""And so COVID has changed our behaviour a little bit in the short term but the long-term outlook is fundamentally driven by that. And COVID will turn out to be probably just a blip on that long-term trend.""Alberta, which has traditionally relied on oil and gas revenues to fund government services, has struggled to keep its deficit and debt in check in light of this year's drop in oil prices. Savage said the government is trying to diversify the economy by moving into mineral production, geothermal energy and small modular nuclear reactors.",0.07105056244260789,0.3302106290174472

""It is not transmitting person to person in Canada or in Saskatchewan.""The Health Ministry has updated its rules around people returning from China.Anyone entering the province who has recently been in Hubei province, the epicentre of the disease, is asked to isolate themselves for two weeks and to call the provincial Healthline.As well, anyone coming into Saskatchewan who has travelled to anywhere in China recently and is showing flu-like symptoms are also asked to isolate themselves for two weeks and to call provincial officials for more instructions.""That includes mild symptoms like a cough, fatigue, fever,"" said Shahab. ""The reason why we want to make these two recommendations is we obviously want to limit the importation of the spread of the novel coronavirus.""So far, there have been five confirmed cases of coronavirus across the country, two in Vancouver and three in Toronto.People without symptoms are less infectious; if a person is very sick they are more infectious. The province had a previous protocol for viruses like this but it has now refocused to make sure that people declare their travel history, Shahab said. ",0.0873015873015873,0.46512345679012346
632,Canada endangered health-care workers by failing to learn lessons from SARS: report | CBC News,"Canada put health-care workers at risk of contracting COVID-19 and taking it home to their families because it failed to learn lessons from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome in 2003, a new report says.",2020-10-05T14:10:38.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/covid19-health-workers-sars-1.5750439,"Canada put health-care workers at risk of contracting COVID-19 and taking it home to their families because it failed to learn lessons from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome in 2003, a new report says.Mario Possamai, who authored the report and was senior adviser to a two-year commission on SARS, outlines multiple shortcomings by the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC).The agency was established to respond to emerging infectious diseases after an early recommendation by the commission investigating how the SARS epidemic that killed 44 people arrived in Canada and spread, mostly in Ontario.Hundreds of people died of SARS elsewhere, including in China and Taiwan. However, Possamai says in the report released Monday that unlike Canada, those countries heeded the warnings from SARS, which he calls ""a dress rehearsal for COVID-19.""""In COVID-19, Canada is witnessing a systemic, preventable failure to learn from the 2003 SARS outbreak,"" he said. ""It is a failure to both adequately prepare and to urgently respond in a manner that is commensurate with the gravest public health emergency in a century.""Possamai says in the report, titled A Time of Fear: How Canada Failed Our Health-Care Workers and Mismanaged COVID-19, that the safety of workers, from those in long-term care homes to respiratory technicians and nurses and doctors in hospitals, has been ignored.It says union sources suggest 16 workers died in the pandemic, though official reports put the number at 12 deaths.Canada's infection rate among health-care workers is four times that of China, the report says.While other countries, including the United States, have fared worse than Canada in containing COVID-19, they managed to escape SARS and did not have the opportunity to learn from it, Possamai says in the report, which was commissioned by the Canadian Federation of Nurses' Unions to evaluate the first wave of the pandemic.WATCH | Calls for more accountability in long-term care homes:The National""A significant systemic problem during COVID-19, as it was during SARS, is that health-care workers and unions were not seen by governments and public health agencies as collaborative partners in setting safety guidelines and procedures,"" Possamai says, adding that is still the case as parts of Canada enter a second wave of the disease.Corinna Heieie is a nurse who works in a long-term care home in Winnipeg. She fears what another wave of COVID-19 could bring for herself and those under her care. ""The truth is, is that if I go out into the community and I get COVID, I'm going to go to work and I'm going to kill people that I love,"" Heieie said. ""The stress is real and it is heartbreaking.""Dr. Theresa Tam, Canada's chief public health officer, says while both the PHAC and her position were created because of SARS, she agrees pandemic preparedness needs to encompass more. ""We need to broaden pandemic preparedness going forward so it's not just public health and maybe hospitals,"" Tam said. ""It has to extend to long-term care,"" as well as home care workers and those employed in seniors' residences.Possamai says precious time was wasted as infections among health-care workers rose and the so-called precautionary principle, which aims to reduce risk of infection without waiting for scientific certainty, was not adopted as a lesson from the SARS commission.WATCH | What to keep in mind about communicating with a mask on:CBC News Nova ScotiaQuestions about whether COVID-19 was airborne resulted in some health-care workers being denied N95 respirators in place of surgical masks, and other personal protective equipment has also been lacking. The report says that was not the case in China, Hong Kong and Taiwan, which also endured SARS.Possamai makes several recommendations, including that:Linda Silas, president of the Canadian Federation of Nurses Unions, said it was only after pressure from nurses and doctors and ultimately from federal Health Minister Patti Hadju in February that the public health agency began weekly calls with the health sector, including psychologists and dentists, on guidelines.However, she said unions are still not involved in developing those guidelines and how they should be used in practice. ""That's the gist of the mistake,"" Silas said.""It is always a joint responsibility between the employer and the union,"" she said of occupational health and safety issues.Dr. Sandy Buchman, past president of the Canadian Medical Association who finished his one-year term in August, said he worked as a family doctor in Mississauga, Ont., during the SARS outbreak and remembers lining up to get into a hospital before being screened and wearing personal protective equipment when seeing patients.The level of anxiety among health-care workers now is no comparison to that outbreak, Buchman said, adding he was shocked to learn Canada did not have enough personal protective equipment for a pandemic after the SARS commission recommended to stockpile it.""What can I say? It's still kind of incomprehensible to me that we weren't prepared for a pandemic when it was ... such a thorough report,"" he said of the commission's findings, which were released in 2007.""My sense was, and it still is, that somehow the government expected front-line workers to put themselves in harm's way, without having adequate PPE. It's like expecting a firefighter to go into a burning building without the proper equipment to protect them.""",0.05099326599326598,0.3817676767676767

The evacuees went into a two-week quarantine. Indonesia also sent a plane.The virus' rapid spread in two months prompted the World Health Organization on Thursday to declare it a global emergency.That declaration ""flipped the switch"" from a cautious attitude to recommending governments prepare for the possibility the virus might spread, said the WHO representative in Beijing, Gauden Galea. Most cases reported so far have been people who visited China or their family members.The agency acted out of concern for poorer countries that might not be equipped to respond, said Galea. Such a declaration calls for a coordinated international response and can bring more money and resources.WHO said it was especially concerned that some cases abroad involved human-to-human transmission.""Countries need to get ready for possible importation in order to identify cases as early as possible and in order to be ready for a domestic outbreak control, if that happens,"" Galea told The Associated Press.Watch: Construction of two coronavirus hospitals in China nears completionCBC NewsThe United States declared a public health emergency on Friday and President Donald Trump signed an order barring entry to foreign nationals who visited China within the last 14 days, which scientists say is the virus' longest incubation period.

Spain confirmed its first case — a German man who had close contact with an infected person in Germany and then traveled to the Canary Islands with friends. Four friends who were hospitalized with him have not shown symptoms.Both the new virus and SARS are from the coronavirus family, which also includes those that cause the common cold.The death rate in China is falling, but the number of confirmed cases will keep growing because thousands of specimens from suspected cases have yet to be tested, WHO's Galea said.""The case fatality ratio is settling out at a much lower level than we were reporting three, now four, weeks ago,"" he said.Although scientists expect to see limited transmission of the virus between people with family or other close contacts, they are concerned about cases of infection spreading to people who might have less exposure.Canada has four confirmed cases of cornavirus. The Public Health Agency of Canada, which is working alongside provinces and territories to monitor the novel coronavirus, says the risk to Canadians is low. Watch: What we actually know about the coronavirusCBC News",0.05677705627705627,0.37805844155844165

640,Economic bounce-back depends on quick resolution of epidemic: Don Pittis | CBC News,"A global recession would likely kill more people than the coronavirus, a Canadian expert says.",2020-02-18T09:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/covid-19-coronavirus-china-canada-1.5464012,"For people who have lost loved ones to COVID-19, the disease that has swept parts of China and may have gained a foothold elsewhere, the global economic impact is likely the least of their concerns.But with the world economy already hovering near what the International Monetary Fund considers to be recessionary levels, a significant global slowdown would be about more than money. And one of the biggest considerations is whether the economic impact of the disease will be ephemeral or lasting.Widely described as the biggest current threat to global growth, the coronavirus, and perhaps more important the things governments are doing to prevent it from spreading, could yet push the world below the recession line.That is one of the reasons why experts like Richard Schabas, Ontario's former chief medical officer, worry that draconian measures that stoke fear in the population do more harm than good.""Recessions kill people, in fact will probably kill more people than this virus does,"" he told CBC News host Michael Serapio last week. Here in the wealth and safety of Canada it may be hard to fathom, but in a globally integrated economy a few dollars less a month can mean life or death to people struggling for food and medicine. That's easier to comprehend when you think that the World Health Organization estimates about six million children a year die preventable deaths, usually associated with poverty.WATCH: Ontario's ex-chief medical officer says a recession could kill more people than the coronavirus:World""Our world has become so interconnected,"" says Jia Wang, deputy director of the University of Alberta's China Institute.Wang suggests that the next few weeks will be critical, showing whether the epidemic, with its global economic impact, is moderating or getting worse. Early reports that the spread of the disease was slowing were cast into doubt last week when China reported 5,000 new cases and global deaths leapt past 1,500.Fear and government restrictions mean people in China have been staying home, slashing the business of retailers and restaurants. Some reports say property sales are down by more than 80 per cent, affecting a business that represents about one-quarter of China's gross domestic product.Wang says that while the country's giant companies are big enough to outlast the crisis, especially with government help, a significant and dynamic part of China's economy is based on much smaller businesses that could disappear, leading to lingering economic effects.""If the quarantines and shutdowns of many cities around China continue for a few more months or even just one month, many of the smaller companies may not survive,"" she said.Wang says there are also worries that the coronavirus and its economic effect will spread outside China. Last Friday, Singapore's president, Lee Hsien Loong. warned the disease could push that country into recession.Putting a figure on the global impact is not easy, and estimates of the damage vary widely. Oxford Economics says global growth will fall to 2.3 per cent in 2020, the lowest level in more than 10 years and below the IMF's global recession level.Last week Canada's Parliamentary Budget Office suggested the epidemic would eat into Canada's growth rate in the first three months of the year chopping off 0.3 percentage points.That worries Brian Kingston from the Business Council of Canada, especially when no one knows when the crisis will end.""And remember that China is our second most important export destination,"" Kingston told Piya Chattopadhyay on CBC Radio's Metro Morning.BMO economist Jennifer Lee says the bank has again downgraded the Chinese economy due to fading optimism that the country can get its factories geared up as soon as it had hoped. ""We've shaved Q1 and Q2 growth,"" said Lee, ""given how long the shutdowns are lasting.""Lee says the bank still expects China to rebound from the economic malaise, though BMO now puts Chinese full-year growth for 2020 at 5.3 per cent. That is far below the previous consensus that China would grow this year at between six and 6.5 per cent.But Lee says it is common for economies to rebound even after the sharpest decline. For example, a month of storms may mean Canadians stay home from the shops, but the money they didn't spend in one month they can spend in the next, causing what looks like a boom.That depends on how much damage is done and whether it can heal. And Lee says the duration of any interruption in business makes all the difference. She says that after the SARS outbreak in 2003, the Canadian economy bounced back with very little overall damage.""I don't think anyone has any idea of whether or not this is going to be resolved any time soon,"" said Lee.Just as in the recent trade war, uncertainty may be having a paralyzing effect on businesses that are waiting to see whether the availability of parts and the demand for copper and Canada Goose coats will bounce back before firms are forced to completely change their strategies. For some businesses, even a speedy recuperation of the global economy may not wash away the business impact of COVID-19. The special deals already being offered by cruise lines for summer packages may not be enough to cleanse the lingering image of people being trapped for days on a plague ship in windowless rooms in what for many became floating prisons.Follow Don on Twitter @don_pittis",0.06708369032587781,0.33709058591871083

Both words using the same two radicals (parts that form a character), just rearranged differently. The choice of my child's name is just one way I am trying to instill a sense of pride in her Chinese heritage. I want her to embrace it, even though anti-Chinese racism has been on the rise since COVID-19.My partner, Nathan, is white. He grew up on a tobacco farm in southwestern Ontario. Our baby is biracial. Throughout the pregnancy, we often talked about how she would look, how I'll manage to get her to speak Mandarin (as I am just a basic speaker myself), and the responsibility of choosing a name that would inevitably play a role in shaping her identity. But although we went ahead and named her Minmin, the current social and political climate has wedged some fear into my mind. It's not treatment from kids on the playground that worries me. It's the recent resurgence of racism that is different to the kind of intolerance I experienced as a child. Trump calls COVID-19 the ""China virus."" And since the coronavirus outbreak, there has been widespread racism against Chinese people, since the virus originated in Wuhan, China. I hate to say it, but in this context, something as superficial as looking more ""white"" or having an English name could spare my daughter a lot of pain. While I know she could get by easier by blending in, this hate also stirred up a defiance in me that made me want to instill that pride in being Chinese even more, so she can have a bulletproof attitude, as Nathan says, and so that none of it will bother her the way it bothered me. I wasn't always called ""Lisa."" My Chinese name is Yaxi (pronounced Ya-shee). That's what I went by as a child growing up in Hamilton, Ont. Everyone butchered it, intentionally or otherwise. Some called me ""Taxi"" or ""Yucky"". So the summer before high school, my best friend – who also had a difficult-for-North-Americans-to-pronounce name, Yiqing – and I decided to change our names. After fighting with my parents to let me change mine to ""Melanie,"" a cringe-worthy homage to Mel B of the Spice Girls, I finally relented and we went with ""Lisa,"" the English name my dad had chosen for me when I first came to Canada. Yiqing chose ""Myra."" The name change took some getting used to, though ultimately, it made life easier. But some time after university, I started realizing just how unique my Chinese name was: Ya, the last part of my mom's name, and Xi, which means ""dawn."" After my own experiences, and the ensuing struggle with my parents over my daughter's name, I hope Minmin will embrace it. I want her to be defiant and proud and confident. And I hope she won't take as long as I did to get there.  ",0.14950354609929078,0.43276595744680846

He said the U.S. would be reviewing the WHO's actions to stop the virus before making any decision on resuming aid.There was no immediate comment from the Geneva-based organization, but when asked about possible U.S. funding cuts during a regular UN briefing earlier Tuesday, WHO spokeswoman Margaret Harris responded, ""Regardless of any issues, our work will go on.""Trump said the U.S. will continue to engage with the WHO in pursuit of ""meaningful reforms.""""We're doing a very thorough investigation as we speak,"" he told reporters, saying it would take about 60 to 90 days.""[The WHO] is very China-centric,"" he said, adding, it's ""not right."" The United States contributed nearly $900 million US to the WHO's budget for 2018-19, according to information on the agency's website. That represents one-fifth of its total $4.4 billion budget for those years. The U.S. gave nearly three-fourths of the funds in ""specified voluntary contributions"" and the rest in ""assessed"" funding as part of Washington's commitment to UN institutions.A more detailed WHO budget document provided by the U.S. mission in Geneva showed that in 2019, the U.S. provided $452 million, including nearly $119 million in assessed funding. In its most recent budget proposal from February, the Trump administration called for slashing the U.S. assessed funding contribution to the WHO to $57.9 million.Last week, the head of the WHO gave a strident defence of his agency's handling of the pandemic after Trump threatened to halt WHO funding. Director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus repeatedly called for unity and a halt to ""politicization"" of the global health crisis.Tedros, a former foreign minister of Ethiopia, also rejected Trump's suggestion that the WHO was ""China-centric,"" saying: ""We are close to every nation, we are colour-blind.""Trump himself showed deference to China at the beginning stages of the outbreak.""China has been working very hard to contain the Coronavirus,"" he tweeted on Jan. 24. ""The United States greatly appreciates their efforts and transparency. It will all work out well.

Two people have died. The Strangs arrived at CFB Trenton on a government chartered plane Friday at 8 a.m.""We're supposed to be cruising the coast of Australia right now,"" said David Strang. CBC News OttawaInstead, the couple, along about 129 other Canadian passengers, are at the NAV Canada Training Institute in Cornwall, Ont., a 2½-hour drive from Trenton, under another another 14-day quarantine and adjusting to another time zone.""We've never felt sick through this whole period. No, we're fine. You're confined to what you can do and that kind of thing.""   David said they are anxious to get back home, though. He said once they do get back to Fredericton they plan to stay put for a few weeks to enjoy some freedom and a normal life. While under quarantine on the cruise ship, passengers were confined to their rooms. Staff would deliver meals.David said they are permitted to go outside for walks at the training institute but they have to stay two metres away from other people. ""It's pretty much the same quarantine we had on the ship only we're on land now."" The couple even joked they haven't irritated each other despite spending so much time together. Patricia said they travel together about 150 days per year so they are used to being together.""This wasn't terrible or anything [because] when we go away for a long period of time it's just us."" While the couple expressed frustration at how some things have been handled, David said he knows governments in various countries were dealing with a situation that was changing daily and new things were being learned all the time. ""I think the cruise line was good to us overall."" Patricia said she wished they would have been put under quarantine as soon as it was discovered that the first passenger had coronavirus. ""The whole time that we were quarantined I was scared. I mean I was really scared even though I kept that to myself most of the time."" Patricia said she was scared they'd get sick and end up in a Japanese hospital, where there might be a language barrier.Then, when the crew on the cruise ship started getting sick, Strang became more worried. ""The crews were the ones bringing us our trays of food, making our food and everything else.""She said it wasn't until the last two days of the quarantine that they started to get their food from an outside source. While spending a month in quarantine is a first, the couple have had a few other close calls and adventures during their travels. There was Norovirus found on cruise ships they've been on but neither got infected. On a trip in 2010 they had to spend an extra nine days in Prague after a volcano erupted in Iceland and disrupted air travel. Patricia said being able to stay in touch with their family and friends through social media has helped immensely. ""There's been so many of my friends and David's friends that have been praying for us and I think it's been working.""The total number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in China surpassed 76,000 Saturday, according to China's National Health Commission. More than 2,300 have died. ",0.07851255138990988,0.45637881510523026

Major U.S. airlines such as Delta and American have cancelled all flights to mainland China until the end of March. Air Canada already has suspended its flights to Beijing and Shanghai until the end of February.Asked why Canada is taking a different approach, Hajdu said she ""can't speculate"" about why the U.S. chose this route.She said she's ""extremely comfortable"" with the leadership of Chief Public Health Officer Theresa Tam and the other officials leading Canada's response.Foreign Affairs Minister François-Philippe Champagne spoke with his Chinese counterpart last night as Canada pursues a plan to bring home Canadians from the ​coronavirus-affected region in China.""Minister Champagne expressed his solidarity with the people of China suffering from the outbreak and offered Canada's assistance. He commended the Chinese government's fact-based response to this difficult situation,"" says a readout from his office, a day after the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the coronavirus outbreak a global health emergency.""He also asked for the collaboration of the Chinese government in helping those Canadian citizens who want to depart the region to which State Councillor and Foreign Minister Wang [Yi] responded positively.""On Thursday, Champagne told CBC News that the government is negotiating with China about the logistics of a planned airlift, which include sharing passenger and passport information with Chinese authorities and securing permits to land the flight and clear various checkpoints in the lockdown zone so people can get to the airport in Wuhan.Global Affairs Canada (GAC) has cautioned families that China has told Ottawa that only Canadian citizens who entered the country with Canadian passports will be allowed to board the plane, something Champagne said the government will challenge.""We're going to be pushing, definitely, because we want to be able to offer consular assistance to everyone,"" he said in an interview Thursday.Champagne said there's no confirmed time frame for the airlift yet, but noted that it could be several days, based on other countries' experience.The Canadian Embassy in China posted a statement overnight saying some of its diplomats have been authorized to leave, including employees with existing medical conditions, mental health concerns, the elderly and all school-aged and younger children. On top of that, some staff are being allowed to work from home.The embassy said that full consular services remain available to Canadians in China.Watch: Justin Trudeau says the threat to Canadians from the coronavirus outbreak remains low in CanadaPoliticsHajdu said that no Canadian patients who have contracted the coronavirus will be permitted to board the government-chartered plane. She said ""there's no indication"" that any of the 196 people asking to return to Canada are sick.Hajdu would not say if Canadians who are not experiencing any symptoms will be required to go into quarantine upon their arrival in Canada.Speaking in question period Friday, Hajdu said Chinese officials working alongside Canadian medical professionals will subject all would-be passengers on this chartered jet to a ""comprehensive screening process"" before they board.In a panel discussion about coronavirus on CTV News Thursday, rookie Liberal MP Lenore Zann said passengers travelling through an airport ""should buy masks and buy gloves and try and make sure you don't touch anything"" to avoid illness.The Opposition Conservatives pounced on that statement Friday, asking Hajdu if that is the official policy of the government.""We're working diligently to make sure that all members of the House have accurate information, including members on our side and members of the public. We'll continue to do that and correct misinformation as it arises,"" Hajdu said when asked about Zann's advice.As for WHO's declaration, Hajdu said Canada is following the organization's recommendations already and does not see the declaration changing the domestic response.""The risk remains low. Obviously, it is low because travel to and from the affected region is becoming more difficult.

Two Canadians — Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor — were arbitrarily detained in China; they've been held for more than 500 days. Beijing took trade action as well, halting large purchases of Canadian canola and, for a time, Canadian pork.Ortagus condemned China's imprisonment of the two Canadians. She said U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has brought this issue up regularly during high-profile meetings with his Chinese counterparts.   ""The United States, we're taking a lot of actions, doing everything we can behind the scenes with the Canadian government,"" she said.

673,"Fed stands pat, keeps benchmark U.S. interest rate steady | CBC News",The Federal Reserve kept its benchmark interest rate unchanged at a low level Wednesday amid an economy that looks solid but faces potential global threats.,2020-01-29T19:14:41.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/federal-reserve-interest-rate-1.5444744,"The Federal Reserve kept its benchmark interest rate unchanged at a low level Wednesday amid an economy that looks solid but faces potential global threats.The Fed sketched a mostly positive picture of the U.S. economy in the statement it released after its latest policy meeting. It also repeated its pledge to ""monitor"" the world economy, which may be held back in the coming months by China's viral outbreak. Stock and bond markets have gyrated in the past week over fears about the virus.The central bank said it would hold short-term rates in a range of 1.5 to 1.75 per cent, far below levels that have been typical during previous expansions. Chairman Jerome Powell and other Fed officials have indicated that they see that range as low enough to support faster growth and hiring.Stock prices rose modestly after the Fed issued its statement at 2 p.m. Eastern time. The Fed's statement was nearly identical to the one it issued after its December meeting, though it described consumer spending as rising at only a ""moderate"" rather than at a ""strong"" pace. That change likely reflects relatively modest spending by Americans over the winter holidays.Last year, the Fed cut its benchmark interest rate three times after having raised it four times in 2018. Powell and other Fed officials credit those rate cuts with revitalizing the housing market, which had stumbled early last year, and offsetting some of the drag from President Donald Trump's trade war with China.Many economists and investors had hoped that U.S. and global growth would pick up this year, now that the U.S. and China have signed a preliminary trade deal that removed some tariffs on Chinese goods. Indeed, the International Monetary Fund said last week that low interest rates and reduced trade tensions would likely buoy the global economy over the next two years and help nurture steady if modest growth.But China's viral outbreak has injected fresh doubts into that outlook. The coronavirus has in effect shut down much of that nation and seems sure to slow the Chinese economy — the world's second-largest — which had already been decelerating. The virus has now infected more people in China than were sickened in the country by the SARS outbreak in 2002-2003.Major companies across the world have responded by suspending some operations in China. Starbucks said it plans to close half its stores in China, its second-largest market. British Airways has halted all flights to China, and American Airlines suspended Los Angeles flights to and from Shanghai and Beijing.Hotels, airlines, casinos and cruise operators are among the industries that have suffered the most immediate repercussions, especially in countries close to China. Apple CEO Tim Cook said the company's suppliers in China have been forced to delay the re-opening of factories that have closed for the Chinese New Year holiday until Feb. 10.Investors seem increasingly to believe that the Fed will feel compelled to cut rates again later this year. The chances of a cut by September's Fed meeting have risen to about 56 per cent, according to the Chicago Mercantile Exchange's FedWatch tool, up from 37 per cent just a month ago.Still, the Fed will likely wait to see how last year's rate cuts play out. Among other benefits, the cuts have helped drive down mortgage rates and led home buyers to bid up prices on a dwindling number of available properties. Home sales jumped in December and were nearly 11% higher than a year earlier.Since they last met in December, Fed officials have presented a nearly unified front in support of keeping rates unchanged, possibly for the rest of this year. That contrasts with last year, when both ""hawks,"" who tend to favour higher rates, and ""doves,"" who typically lean toward lower rates, occasionally dissented from the Fed's rate decisions.The Fed's decision came a day after President Donald Trump urged Fed chair Jerome Powell to cut rates in a tweet, arguing it would make U.S. interest rates ""competitive with other Countries."" Yet the Fed hopes to avoid the ultra-low and negative interest rates that exist in much of Europe and Japan, which they — and most analysts — see as evidence of weak economies.Most analysts think the Fed would be more willing to cut rates if there were clear signs of a sharp economic slowdown. Still, some Fed watchers say they foresee a rate cut by the summer or after November's elections.One reason for a potential future cut is that inflation remains chronically low. According to the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, prices rose just 1.5 per cent in November from a year earlier, below the central bank's 2 per cent annual target. Since the Fed adopted that target in 2012, inflation has failed to consistently reach that high, to the surprise of the Fed and most economists.",0.05904384756657485,0.41631628787878766

The goal is to stop people from refilling prescriptions early and to ensure life-saving drugs don't run short when supply chains are vulnerable.Mina Tadrous is a pharmacist and researcher in Toronto who monitors pharmaceutical supplies.He is worried Canadians will start stockpiling drugs after watching what has been unfolding in the U.S. and other regions as the virus spreads. He said pharmacists are concerned about drugs such as life-saving inhalers that people might stockpile based on misinformation circulating about potential treatments for COVID-19.""It's that relationship of how people are reacting rather than the actual supply of medications,"" he said. Tadrous said pharmacies get their medications and supplies from wholesalers, who get theirs from distributors who source them from manufacturers. Outside of wholesalers, most of that supply chain is outside of Canada. Dr. Jacalyn Duffin of Queen's University in Kingston, Ont., has long warned about the increasing frequency of drug shortages, including nearly 2,000 ongoing shortages, none of which she attributes to coronavirus.Given that China and India produce 80 per cent of the active ingredients of prescription drugs sold in North America, supply disruptions are expected eventually, Duffin said.""I think that the coronavirus outbreak is a big wake-up call for us to pay attention to our drug shortages that exist already and to pay attention to where our drugs come from,"" she said.India, a major supplier of generic drugs to Europe, has already shut down the export of some antibiotics and drugs for hypertension, blood pressure and acetaminophen, Duffin said.As a precaution, the federal government has enacted sweeping legislation that gives it the right to force patented drugmakers to make more medicine if necessary and remove patents as part of the response to the public health emergency. ",0.06203968253968254,0.3706507936507936

A third case has also been confirmed in B.C.Ontario public health officials have repeatedly stressed that the risk of coronavirus infection in Canada is low. Evidence suggests transmission of the virus from person to person requires close contact, like the kind between immediate family members who live together, said Dr. David Williams, the province's chief medical officer, this week. Further, lessons from the 2003 SARS outbreak suggest many airport screening procedures are ineffective.Beveridge was returning to Canada from Cambodia but changed planes in Hong Kong after flying from Phnom Penh.He said he was anxious, even though he had not been anywhere near Wuhan. Cambodia has so far reported only one case of the coronavirus and it was travel-related. Additionally, given the concerns over the coronavirus in China and other Southeast Asian countries, he figured he'd better do something on his return to make sure he didn't spread whatever he had.""Nobody even took my temperature. And you know if we're really trying to keep this out of Canada, it seems that that was not a very thorough screening process,"" Beveridge said.The outbreak of the new coronavirus began last month in Wuhan, a city of 11 million people. The World Health Organization (WHO) says it has killed at least 213 people, all in China. More than 9,600 people globally have been infected, the vast majority in China, though cases have been confirmed in 19 other countries. Yesterday, WHO declared the emerging situation a public health emergency of international concern.CBC News reached out to the Greater Toronto Airports Authority (GTAA), the body that oversees Pearson, for comment. A spokesperson said the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) is responsible for determining the response to coronavirus.Canada began implementing some enhanced screening measures for passengers on flights from China to Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver on Jan. 22. They include signs urging travellers to report flu-like symptoms, additional health-realted questions at kiosks and pamphlets with information about what people should do if their condition worsens.Watch infectious disease experts discuss why many enhanced screening measures are ineffective:The NationalDr. Theresa Tam, chief public health officer of Canada, said it's likely Beveridge was not screened because he was in Hong Kong only briefly and hadn't been to mainland China.""For the coronavirus, the enhanced border measures, on top of what we have as a foundation, is essentially providing the information on the screen and the kiosk questions and the referral to Canadian border service agents,"" Tam told CBC News.Tam said anyone who is sick should tell a border service agent.Frank Scarpitti, the mayor of Markham, 30 kilometres northeast of Toronto, says while he has great confidence in public health officials at the federal, provincial and local levels, he continues to press for the federal government to put in more enhanced screening at all Canadian airports.""I think it would just give Canadians a greater sense of confidence that that additional step is being taken,"" Scarpitti told CBC News.""It's not going to catch everyone but it's just another layer of screening, rather than just voluntary screening, and indicating where someone may have travelled.""Scarpitti also pointed to measures introduced at other major airports in New York City, San Francisco and Los Angeles that involve passengers from China being screened for symptoms.""You just have to look south of the border, the U.S. airports instituted that,"" he said.""Because of the number of airports that they have, they're actually redirecting passengers to the airports that have that technology,"" Scarpitti said.Global Affairs Canada said there are 196 Canadians currently seeking consular help to leave China, and Canada has secured a charter aircraft to bring home Canadians stranded in the affected region.",0.07008291953144895,0.4489723919870978

Across 24 other countries, there are 270 confirmed cases and one death. There are five confirmed cases in Canada. The WHO declared the outbreak a global health emergency in late January. The Canadian government issued a Level 3 advisory for China, asking Canadians to avoid non-essential travel. There is only one higher level, which advises people to avoid all travel.The government recommends people avoid travelling to Hubei province, where Wuhan city is located. The province has recorded 22,112 of China's 31,211 coronavirus cases, according to the WHO. As soon as the Canadian government declares a Level 3 or 4 travel advisory, a person may cancel their upcoming trip and their insurance should cover any lost expenses, said Weir. ""You'd have to submit receipts,'' she said, but travellers should receive refunds for flights, hotels and other costs.<a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/China?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#China</a>: Most airlines have suspended or reduced flights to and from the country due to the <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/coronavirus?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#coronavirus</a> outbreak.

While 24 countries have confirmed coronavirus cases, Canada's travel advisory applies only to China. That means a person who feels uncomfortable travelling to any of the other countries won't be able to get a refund for cancelling their trip, she said.That is, unless they purchased what's known as cancel-for-any-reason insurance, she said, which does exactly what the name implies.Those who haven't purchased any travel insurance may still be able to secure a refund, Weir noted, as many major credit cards offer some kind of coverage.""But it depends on which credit card you have and what the benefits are,'' she said.

A pandemic, a trade-skeptical U.S. president, and simmering frustration with China have collided to test the durability of the system.",2020-04-30T08:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/wto-unravelling-panetta-covid-19-united-states-china-1.5548511,"The modern history of global trade is being written at warp speed, with a dizzying series of developments now testing the international trading system.What the rules-based order looks like after this is anyone's guess.Credit a collision of conditions: a pandemic, a trade-skeptical U.S. president, simmering frustration with China, and a growing great-power rivalry.In the past few days alone, the U.S. has dismissed the World Trade Organization's top dispute-resolution body as illegitimate.The Trump administration said it would ignore WTO appellate body rulings, after years of complaints from successive American administrations.Then the U.S. slapped several new regulatory controls on high-tech exports to China that could be used by the military.The U.S. has also placed its closest allies on notice: it is studying similar export controls for friendly nations that sell sensitive U.S. technology to rivals.Then there's the pandemic.Protectionist measures have not only sprouted all over the globe as countries cling to desperately needed medical equipment, such as masks and medicines.A few countries have also limited food exports, in a sign of nervousness about potential hunger. There's a Canadian-led push at the WTO, supported by dozens of countries, including the U.S., to maintain free trade in food.One of Washington's best-known trade-policy experts wrote a paper 18 years ago predicting a Cold War II between the U.S. and China, which would strain international institutions.Gary Hufbauer fears the moment has arrived. ""Oh, yes,"" said Hufbauer, now semi-retired at 81 after a long career as a trade analyst and U.S. trade official. ""We're in it. We're in the Cold War II. You see how it's being fought. Trade, technology.""Hufbauer sees cracks not only at the World Trade Organization, but also in the current pandemic-related scuffle at the World Health Organization, and in ongoing paralysis at the United Nations Security Council.Depending on who you ask, this is either the end of the postwar order, or a minor, perhaps even welcome, hiccup.Hufbauer foresees a return to the era of great-power diplomacy where large countries make their own rules, regardless of whether smaller countries agree.And it saddens him.""This was the best 60 years in human history,"" Hufbauer said.""There's no doubt [about that], in terms of improving the average standard of living around the world. … This new world doesn't have the same power."" He fears greater protectionism will harm both rich and poor countries, reducing competition, productivity and international investment.Other trade analysts are more optimistic.While it's true trade has grown more slowly in recent years, and that 2019 featured the most new tariffs in a long time, the long-term trend line still points in one clear direction: lower tariffs. In addition, Canada has new trade agreements with the U.S., Mexico, Europe, and the Asia-Pacific Rim. Most of the world still supports the WTO appeals body. And even the U.S. has, to date, continued to support lower-level WTO decisions. Count Mona Pinchis-Paulsen among the cautious optimists.""I don't think all is lost,"" she said.A trade historian and lawyer, she's a Canadian who teaches at Stanford University and has extensively researched the roots of the global trading system.One lesson of history, she said, is that institutions work as long as there's a will to co-operate. She's heartened by the support for Canada's WTO statement against food protectionism.But what about the pandemic-induced torrent of protectionism — all the corporate subsidies, buy-local initiatives and export controls? She says the system is flexible enough to accommodate temporary measures in a crisis.She cites Willard Thorp, a U.S. official who championed the push for a global trading system after the Second World War, who said international institutions should be responsible, not overly legalistic.The rules, she says, allow exceptions now, too.For example, it's true that export restrictions are generally forbidden under Article 11 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. But right beneath that admonition, there's fine print: exceptions are allowed for critical shortages of food and essential products.Article 20 also allows exceptions to protect human health. Simon Lester shares her view. A former official at the WTO's appellate body, and current trade-policy expert at the Cato Institute, a Washington, D.C.-based think-tank, Lester says countries are behaving responsibly.""You see blaring headlines: 'Export bans on medical supplies!' 'The system can't handle it!' 'Everything's falling apart!' What I've seen so far is that the measures taken so far are generally reasonable,"" Lester said. ""I think we'll say [someday] that the trading system dealt with this just fine.""But he'll be watching two upcoming cases at the WTO. While Lester personally regrets the erosion of the appeals body, he said the system can still function if the U.S. accepts negative findings by lower-level WTO panels.That's why he'll be paying attention over the coming months as the U.S. squares off against Canada on softwood lumber, and against Vietnam on fish fillets.A U.S. refusal to respect any findings, by any WTO panel, would render the international trade body mostly useless, he said.That would leave middle-power countries in a tough spot, he said. In Canada's case, that would leave it reliant, in future disputes with the U.S., on the panels in the new NAFTA — Lester still isn't sure how well those new panels will work.One Canadian trade lawyer says Canada's actions have sometimes been self-defeating. That includes last week's milestone case where the U.S. declared the WTO appellate body illegitimate.""Idiocy,"" is how the Toronto-based lawyer Mark Warner described the Canadian government's actions in the case. The dispute involved U.S. duties on Canadian glossy paper.The U.S. had already dropped its duties two years ago, after being found mostly in the wrong by a lower-level WTO panel.Yet the Canadian government appealed anyway, to contest the methodology the U.S. uses in calculating duties against subsidized goods.The U.S. was furious. President Donald Trump's trade representative, Robert Lighthizer, said Canada's pointless fight would undermine the U.S.'s ability to defend itself against a bigger economic threat: illegally subsidized, state-sponsored businesses in China.All this was happening as the U.S. was already working to paralyze the appeals body, created with the formation of the WTO in 1995.American administrations have been complaining about the appellate body for years — that it overstepped its original mandate, that it shouldn't be applying precedents from unrelated cases, that it constantly misses legal deadlines.The Trump administration began blocking the appointment of new panellists.Finally, last week, the U.S. said the body no longer had the required three members to be legitimate. It said two panellists' mandates had expired, and alleged the third worked directly for a Chinese government department.WTO rules say panellists should be recognized trade experts unaffiliated with any government.Despite it all, Warner says the international trading system will be OK.He says gloomy predictions about the collapse of the post-Second World War order are off — by approximately 50 years.We're more likely seeing a return to the world before the creation of the WTO appellate body in the 1990s, he says.""I don't think this is the return to the law of the jungle…. It's a return to 1995.""",0.06228831441095593,0.4136275150426095
698,Did the WHO mishandle the global coronavirus pandemic? | CBC News,"The World Health Organization has come under fire for its response to the global coronavirus pandemic, but experts say it's only as powerful as its weakest link.",2020-04-30T08:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/coronavirus-who-china-canada-pandemic-1.5549836,"The World Health Organization has come under fire for its response to the global coronavirus pandemic, with threats of funding cuts and investigations into its conduct.But experts say that while the WHO may have made some missteps in its handling of the crisis, the organization is only as powerful as its weakest link.The United Nations agency was founded in 1948 with a mandate to act as an authority on international health. Its 194 member states fund the agency and set Its policies, and it is accountable to them. Conversely, it has discretionary power to investigate members' handling of public health crises, but it relies on their co-operation and information sharing.""An organization like the World Health Organization can only be as strong and as effective as its member states want it to be,"" said Steven Hoffman, director of the Global Strategy Lab and a global health law professor at York University in Toronto. ""So, one of the challenges that the World Health Organization has faced over the last decades is that it keeps on getting new responsibilities and no new resources.""In 2005, its responsibilities increased with the adoption of the International Health Regulations (IHR), a legal agreement signed by all members that requires countries to report emerging disease outbreaks that are at risk of spreading worldwide. WATCH | WHO defends its record on COVID-19NewsIn doing so, experts say the WHO took on a more political role in juggling the domestic interests of its individual members with the interests of the rest of the world.""They have never performed well in that function — not once,"" said Amir Attaran, a professor in the Faculties of Law and School of Epidemiology and Public Health at the University of Ottawa, who told CBC's Sunday Edition the WHO should never again preside over a pandemic. ""They cave to diplomatic pressure. Or even if there is not diplomatic pressure, they self-censor."" Attaran said an agency entrusted with ensuring compliance with an agreement like the IHR cannot also operate with the ""attitude of a diplomat."" ""It cannot simultaneously be constantly begging countries for co-operation in certain areas where it's expected at the next moment to turn on them severely and possibly fault them for hiding an epidemic."" Hoffman says the agency is ""doomed by its institutional design.""""The criticisms that WHO has faced are not fair in the sense that WHO is not an independent entity, it's essentially acting on behalf of its member states, who control it,"" he said. ""So, the criticism is really a criticism of those national governments' inability to create the kind of strong public health agency that the world needs in this globalized era."" On Dec. 31, China alerted the WHO to a mysterious outbreak of pneumonia in the city of Wuhan, in the central Chinese province of Hubei. But it would be weeks before the WHO declared the situation a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on Jan. 30, a key designation that determines whether a country's response to an outbreak has been effective and if more resources are needed. The timing of that emergency declaration is critical at the beginning of an epidemic and can have ripple effects on how quickly countries around the world respond. ""I think that happened probably a week too late,"" said Hoffman, adding that the organization was ""hung"" over whether the outbreak constituted an emergency. While the WHO considered the emergency declaration, Chinese officials acted swiftly to silence early informal releases of information from health care workers sounding the alarm in Wuhan, opting instead to carefully manage the release of information in the weeks before the WHO would be allowed on the ground. Former Canadian ambassador to China David Mulroney said that information was put through a ""political prism"" in China and delayed as local officials determined how to put the best possible face on the crisis before sending it up the line to Beijing. ""You never want to give bad news to your boss in China,"" he said. Mulroney said that problem highlights an inherent issue within the WHO: it can be ""stonewalled"" by a member country on the release of information — posing a ""significant risk"" at a critical time in an outbreak.Lynette Ong, an associate professor of political science at the University of Toronto and a China specialist, said the WHO needed to maintain a diplomatic relationship with China in order to encourage the conducting of investigations and the sharing of key data. When Chinese health officials quickly genetically sequenced the virus from an infected patient, the WHO lauded the effort, calling it a ""notable achievement"" that ""demonstrates China's increased capacity to manage new outbreaks.""""But you do not also want to overdo it, to be too deferential and too friendly to the extent that you cannot take a step back and then question the things that they share with you,"" she said. ""WHO is being criticized, rightly so, and a lot of the criticism is justified to my mind because they have probably gone a little too far to the other side of being too deferential."" Ong said that while the WHO was ""outwardly praising"" China for its capacity to build hospitals and put in place strict lockdown of millions of its citizens that helped flatten their epidemic curve, the country did so by casting aside privacy and human rights with Draconian restrictions on citizens.""The other side of the criticism, which I also think is justified, is the cover-up at the beginning, which I don't think the WHO has actually addressed at all,"" she said, adding the world lost two to three weeks at a ""very crucial time"" in tackling the outbreak.""Had there not been any cover-up, I think the world probably, we would be in a different position."" Calls for the WHO to be held accountable for its response to the global coronavirus have been been growing. Australia says it will call for an international investigation into the origin of the pandemic at next month's annual meeting of the World Health Assembly, the decision-making body of the WHO. And U.S. President Donald Trump has already cut funding to the organization, saying it ""failed"" in its duty. Still, the U.S. is working with the agency. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has, since late January, had a member on the WHO's emergency committee, which also includes Canada's Chief Public Health Officer Dr. Theresa Tam as an adviser. Tam said that while she would welcome a review of the pandemic advice provided by the WHO, she does not fault it for its initial response because health experts all over the world ""underestimated where this could go."" WATCH | Dr. Theresa Tam says it would be 'worthwhile to examine' the WHO's response to COVID-19Politics NewsPrime Minister Justin Trudeau said Canada would continue to work with the WHO because the virus ""demands a global, co-ordinated response.""He added there will be ""plenty of time to reflect on challenges"" in the future.Former interim Liberal leader Bob Rae and Canada's special envoy on humanitarian and refugee issues said that while the WHO does act as a source of information, alert and guidance for countries in a pandemic, that doesn't take away the responsibility of governments to take the steps they feel necessary. ""You could never say, 'Well, you know, [the WHO] didn't tell us how serious it was.' Of course they did,"" Rae said. ""The question as to how each country should respond to the information is entirely up to each country. It's not up to the WHO.""The WHO doesn't issue directives ""to say you should carry out a lockdown, you should limit transportation, you should cut off all flights.""Rae said that while it can be difficult for the WHO to navigate the challenges of the Chinese political system, there's no evidence to suggest the organization actively suppressed the release of any information on the pandemic.He says the criticism of the WHO is ""completely misguided"" and that cutting funding to the organization at a critical time is a strategic ""mistake."" ""I think every crisis such as this one will prompt every governmental agency, both domestic and international, to reflect on what happened and to see how it can be improved,"" he said.""That is an issue that is going to be quite legitimately placed at the doorstep of the WHO.""",0.06588510286963896,0.4309334136653724

The maximum fine for a first offence is $100,000.Federal Crown prosecutor Mark Stares told provincial court Judge Tim Landry the case was a deliberate act of greed that was clearly against the law.""This was an ongoing commercial scheme that was, in reality, a ruse to cover up black market dealings,"" Stares told Landry.The fine and industry ban, he said, is needed to deter others and conserve lobster stocks.In an October 2017 sting operation, federal fisheries officers pulled Sipekne'katik traps fished by Robert Syliboy from St. Marys Bay, placed microchips on 73 lobsters, returned the traps and then traced the tagged lobster to the nearby Guang Da pound in Belliveaus Cove.Three days later, officers followed a shipment from the plant containing 15 of those lobsters to the Halifax Stanfield International Airport. The shipment was stopped and seized before being loaded onto a flight for China. The shipment was valued at $50,000 and carried the necessary paperwork from the Canadian Food Inspection Agency.""The international export of black market fish can jeopardize Canadians ability to legally do so,"" Stares said.Speaking through a Mandarin translator, Zheng repeated a claim Thursday rejected by the judge at his trial. He said this was an accident where his workers inexplicably mixed commercial lobster at his pound with lobster harvested by First Nations.""During the time I did business over here I did not break any rules,"" Zheng said over the phone from Ontario, where he is living.He said it was wrong to mix lobster harvested commercially with those under a communal licence by First Nations.He claimed the 15 lobsters bearing microchips in the shipment of 5,000 pounds seized at the airport were the only lobster caught by First Nations that were attributable to him.The Crown disagreed, saying pound holding books and invoices seized by DFO indicated Sipekne'katik lobster was supplying a commercial operation.There was no evidence during the trial that money changed hands, but pound security video showed Sipekne'katik lobster being commercially graded and sorted at the plant. Zheng says he has declared personal bankruptcy and a bank is auctioning off the company after charges were laid in the caseHe told the court he has been on federal employment assistance since the pandemic.""If it is possible I would like to resume work in the fishing industry,"" he said. ""I would like to ask Your Honour's help to sustain myself and to continue living in Canada.""Landry asked for proof of his financial situation and will hand down a sentence next month.",0.0065079365079365155,0.3315873015873017

Chinese Canadian Association. There's one Islander who is friends with the head of a hospital in China's Hubei province — where Wuhan is. Another Islander is friends with the head of a group in the U.S. that's already shipped medical supplies to Chinese hospitals.It was through those connections that the P.E.I. Chinese Canadian Association learned about how much of a need there is for more medical supplies at Hubei hospitals and how to help get them there, said Paul Yin, head of the association, through interpreter Ally Guo.""In our Island, we do have friends with friends in Hubei. And they have direct contact with the hospitals. They have an urgent need for help. So that's why we decided to start this fundraiser,"" Yin said.There have been no confirmed cases of coronavirus on Prince Edward Island and seven in Canada.The live map tracking the outbreak on the World Health Organization website said China had 31,424 confirmed cases and 638 deaths as of Friday evening.The association is accepting e-transfers to purchase medical equipment.Even members of the Canadian Chinese community who lived on P.E.I. for a period before moving to another province are chipping in.""It's not just P.E.I., it's residents who were here before and also want to donate,"" Yin said.Yin said in particular, the doctors and nurses are lacking protective gear like suits, masks and glasses and that it's important doctors and nurses stay healthy in order to help other people.""There's a huge demand for the masks and everything.""""The Chinese government, they are doing a lot of purchases and activities to prevent this outbreak, but the numbers are too big,"" Yin said.""They might not be able to do all the things. And it's Chinese New Year festival time and a lot of factories in China that produce this equipment are on holiday.""Yin just returned from another, less affected area of China a few days ago, and while he feels fine he's staying inside his home, away from the public for two weeks as a precaution.However, since Yin has gotten back to the Island he's been busy online putting out the call to P.E.I.'s Chinese community for donations.In an email to CBC, P.E.I.'s Chief Public Health Office said the policy for those returning from China changed Thursday.Those who have travelled to Canada from Hubei province — which includes Wuhan — should voluntarily self-isolate for 14 days, staying at home and not going to school or work. This does not apply to people returning from other parts of China. Those travellers are being asked to monitor themselves and their children for 14 days — and call 811 if they develop symptoms such as fever, coughing or difficulty breathing.Yin is getting help in his fundraising efforts from volunteers like Guo, Yin's interpreter during his interview with CBC.Guo was born in Shanghai, but has lived on P.E.I. for the last five years. She runs a Chinese social media website aimed at bridging the gap between the Chinese community and other Islanders.In just three days, about 140 people have donated more than $15,000 and it will all go to that non-profit group in the U.S. to buy supplies and ship them to three hospitals in Hubei, Guo said.""We have seen their materials, like who do they buy from, who do they deliver to, and with the evidence that they've already delivered equipment to the hospitals with photos and everything, we believe they can do so,"" she said.Guo said the money raised so far is enough to provide a week's worth of protective gear for about 200 doctors and nurses, but she hopes they can at least double that amount.""Every day they need a lot of equipment. They don't have so many supplies just because the population there is so many,"" Guo said.""They have to protect themselves.""Guo said the group will continue to raise money for medical equipment in China for as long as it is needed. This year, P.E.I.'s Chinese New Year's gala was moved from early March to mid-March to give those trying to get back to the Island time to do so, Guo said.That gala is also becoming a charity event this year. Money raised  will go toward helping those dealing with the coronavirus outbreak, Guo said.",0.09435876623376624,0.2879599567099568

Henry said the sick woman has several underlying conditions that put her at risk of serious illness. All of the previous 12 patients were able to stay in isolation at home and four have recovered completely. Three other patients are currently asymptomatic and are awaiting test results to clear them to return to normal life. All COVID-19 patients must test negative for the virus twice before they can leave isolation, said Henry.Of the previous 12 cases, seven have been connected to an outbreak in Iran and five have been connected to China.Watch: ""Wash your hands like you've been chopping jalapenos and you need to change your contacts,"" says Dr. Bonnie Henry. CBC News BCHenry said that while B.C. has experience dealing with disease pandemics, each outbreak is different, and it takes some time after the initial chaos to work out an effective response.""I am confident that it will never be easy,"" she said.

""Now, of course, we cannot sustain these physical distancing measures for an infinite period of time.… They're tough on the individual level, they're tough for communities, they're tough for businesses, tough for kids.""The good news is that Canada has the opportunity to learn from countries where the epidemic started months earlier by observing how public health measures in those places work to keep the case load from bubbling up again once people start to emerge from their homes and go about business as usual, he said.Places in East Asia are facing a second wave of the virus now. For instance, on Friday, Hong Kong recorded its biggest daily jump in cases since the pandemic started, though mostly connected to infected travellers, who are returning from abroad after being prevented from going home before.Dr. Theresa Tam, Canada's chief public health officer, warned last week that ""this virus is going to be with us for some time. It will not be eradicated from the world in months.""""We will need to be prepared for another wave, potentially.""Like Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan, Canada will also experience its own second wave after seeing initial success containing the virus through the social distancing measures currently in place, Bogoch believes.""When we start to lift those measures in the months down the line, are we going to start to see a rebound of the virus? The answer is most certainly yes. We probably will see, to some extent, a greater number of cases as people mingle again as life slowly returns to normal.""Several modelling studies have been conducted to explore how effective social distancing is at dampening disease spread, said Bogoch, and almost all show that when the reins are eventually loosened, cases will tick up again.But he said there are steps we can take to minimize the extent of a second wave.""The hope is that we can slowly lift these measures, rather than have them completely lifted, and we can control the rebound of the virus such that it does not cause a situation where we overwhelm our health-care system and negate everything that we've done for the past few months.""The key will be to change social distancing policies ""very slowly and carefully,"" he said.Eleanor Fish, a professor of immunology at the University of Toronto whose research group conducted treatment studies during the 2003 outbreak of SARS in Toronto, said a true second wave of an outbreak involves new community transmissions, not just sick returning travellers who are swiftly moved into quarantine.She said countries like China, where new cases are also travel-related, could face a second round of the outbreak but are ""nowhere near"" that territory yet.Fish also said she believes a second wave is ""unlikely to happen here.""""We haven't locked down our borders to Canadians. So any of those who might want to return, are returning. We're asking them to self-isolate for 14 days."" That means Canada is less likely than other countries who shut their borders to citizens to have cases shoot up again upon their return.Fish said she's optimistic that the government is listening to the scientific community and learning from places, like Italy, by preparing for a surge of severe cases by doing things like securing more ventilators. She also said she was buoyed by progress of research groups testing various forms of treatment.""The public needs to be reassured that there's a lot coming up that's going to be very positive.""Jason Kindrachuk, an assistant professor at the University of Manitoba's department of medical microbiology, said that during the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic, there was both a second wave and a small third wave of the outbreak.But he said Canada can prepare now for a second wave of COVID-19 illnesses in a number of different ways.It can improve the supply of personal protective equipment for front-line health-care workers, as well as the materials needed for testing, both of which have already been a challenge in the first phase of the epidemic, said Kindrachuk, who holds a Canada Research Chair in emerging viruses.And although little is known yet about the seasonality of the virus and how much immunity people will have after recovering from the illness, Canada can look to the nations that are months ahead of it in the progression of the pandemic.""We can learn from what those countries do in terms of when they start reducing the requirements for social distancing to help guide our own procedures and time frame for doing that so we don't see spikes in increased transmission.""The true long-term strategy, said Bogoch, is the creation of an effective vaccination, ""which we know is more than a year away.""""But for now, we just have to put up with the physical distancing measures.""",0.027329985905567292,0.37315094466257254
729,Chinese company makes agreement to buy Nunavut gold mine | CBC News,"China's Shandong Gold Mining has entered a 'definitive agreement' to buy Canadian mining company TMAC Resources, which operates the Hope Bay mine in Nunavut.",2020-05-20T16:04:06.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/tmac-resources-purchase-agreement-1.5576240,"The company behind an ongoing gold project in Nunavut's Kitikmeot region, is all set to be sold to a Chinese mining company.TMAC Resources owns the Hope Bay gold mine project, located 125 kilometres southwest of Cambridge Bay.On May 8, the company announced a ""definitive agreement"" to sell to Shandong Gold Mining, a state-owned Chinese mining company, for around $230 million.The deal values TMAC at $1.75 per share — a 52 per cent premium on the share's average price, according to the announcement, and about 30 cents more per share than its listed price before the announcement.The sale must be approved by two-thirds of the company's shareholders. TMAC is also hoping to get the approval of the Kitikmeot Inuit Association (KIA), the land claim organization representing the region's Inuit, which owns one per cent of shares.Though a statement accompanying the announcement voiced tentative support for the agreement, it also made clear the organization hasn't decided yet if it will support the sale.TMAC would not comment on the sale until it was complete. Shandong Gold did not respond to requests for comment.""We have been impressed by TMAC's strong relationships with its local stakeholders and responsible management … and intend on demonstrating the same commitment,"" reads a statement attributed to Chen Yumin, chairman of Shandong Gold, accompanying the announcement of the sale.That release says the company will maintain targets for Inuit employment and royalty payments to the territorial and regional Inuit organizations, established in an impact benefit agreement between TMAC and KIA.They also pledged to continue contracting with local and Inuit-owned firms. Those contracts were valued at more than $68 million last year, according to filings from TMAC.The sale would bring to an end TMAC's eight years in charge of the Hope Bay property.The area's gold deposits, which could eventually produce nearly 150,000 kilograms of gold, have been owned by three different mining companies since they were first identified more than 30 years ago.In 2012, TMAC acquired it from Canadian mining giant Newmont Mining and, three years later, signed a 20-year land tenure agreement with the KIA and the territorial Inuit land claim organization Nunavut Tunngavik Inc.The property produced no gold for commercial sale until 2017, and in the time since its purchase, TMAC has poured more than $450 million into developing the deposits.It's likely to need a lot more investment. A ""pre-feasibility study"" published last March explored the possibility of more than doubling its output of ore, estimating the cost of expanding operations at more than $683 million.""Hope Bay … requires substantial investment to optimize production and extend mine life,"" Chen's statement acknowledges.But Shendong Gold ""has the financial strength, technical capability and long-term vision to maximize the value of the Hope Bay camp,"" a statement from Jason Neal, the president and chief executive officer of TMAC, reads.That value could extend beyond shareholders' pockets. Gold, which generated nearly $900 million in revenues in Nunavut last year, is the single biggest contributor to mining revenues and royalties for Inuit associations.The mine at Hope Bay is expected to produce as much as $400 million in royalties alone over its lifetime for KIA and Nunavut Tunngavik Inc.Those benefits have not always trickled down to communities. In 2018, TMAC fell short of modest goals for Inuit employment, failing to fill the equivalent of 70 full time positions, and was forced to pay a $90,700 fine as a result, filings with the Nunavut Impact Review Board show.Shandong Gold Mining is a state-owned Chinese gold mining company, centred in the eastern province of Shandong. It's the second-largest producer of gold in China by output, and the latest of several to expand its operations overseas.That expansion has been far from simple.In its sole international venture to date, Shandong Gold purchased a 50 per cent interest in Canadian company Barrick Gold's Veladero Mine in Argentina, to the tune of more than $1.3 billion.The mine is proving to be the most expensive per ounce of gold produced in Barrick's large portfolio.It's also been the site of several controversial spills, including the biggest mining accident in Argentinian history, when one million litres of cyanide solution was spilled in 2015, two years before Shandong Gold came on board.The day after Shandong Gold's purchase, the Argentine government threatened to rescind its license over a third cyanide spill inside 18 months, and workers at the camp went on strike over safety.Argentinian regulators have since been satisfied that the safety situation has improved — but workers at the camp continue to describe conditions there as ""intolerable.""Those early difficulties haven't dented the company's ambition. At the opening of their Toronto office in 2019, amid rising diplomatic tensions between China and Canada, Shandong Gold chairman Chen Yumin said he hoped the company would become one of the top 10 gold producers in the world.That would have benefits for Toronto's employment numbers, at least — the May 8 announcement also pledged to make the city the headquarters for its North and South American operations.",0.14131019639494213,0.38655501748722076

""He had planned to leave. This virus thing just messed it up. He's afraid because he has a little kid."" ""Right now [my son Felix] is fine,"" Michael said over WeChat, a Chinese messaging app, Thursday night. ""We're not even worried about this virus, but babies do get sick. We worry that if he does catch a cold or something like that, that we won't be able to take him to a hospital."" Michael said the initial response from Canada was slow but he has been more impressed in recent days. He said the Canadian government is attempting to find a way to allow his wife, who isn't a Canadian citizen, to come with him. His son, who is currently breastfeeding, is a Canadian citizen. The federal government announced Wednesday it's preparing a charter aircraft to bring trapped Canadians home. It's estimated nearly 200 Canadians are trapped in the lockdown.""We're not in Wuhan, but we just got an email saying that we have to somehow make it to Wuhan to make it on that flight,"" Michael said late Thursday night.""That's something we won't be able to do without some help.""When asked Thursday, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said there is no timeline for when that flight is scheduled to leave.So far, three cases of the coronavirus have been reported inside Canada, including a Toronto man in his 50s, his wife, and a B.C. man in his 40s. While one person in Ottawa was tested for the virus, Ottawa Public Health has confirmed the results were negative.  According to China's National Health Commission, the country's total number of deaths from the coronavirus has climbed to 213, with the number of those infected rising to 9,692.That's up nearly 2,000 cases and 43 deaths from the previous day.The virus — declared a public health emergency by a World Health Organization panel Thursday afternoon — has spread to at least 18 other countries. Still, Kate said she's not too concerned about her brother, who she says is taking precautions to ensure his family stays safe.""We're not going outside,"" Michael said. ""We're not taking any chances.""  And the Schellenbergs are anxious to meet Michael's wife and newborn baby for the first time.  ""Felix is so cute,"" Kate said. ""I think my parents are just desperate to meet him."" ",-0.017551344004832378,0.4454822309473473

732,Rise of the robots: automation and tech becoming more popular as pandemic restricts human contact | CBC Radio,"Humans have long been fascinated by the idea of automatons. But increasingly, robots are also just reality as more work is automated. Automation that's exploded thanks to pandemic health concerns. This week, a look at the new rules we need to prepare for a world of automation. And, if we're going to work and live alongside robots, how do we design them so they don't creep us out?",2020-10-23T21:10:13.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/radio/spark/rise-of-the-robots-automation-and-tech-becoming-more-popular-as-pandemic-restricts-human-contact-1.5774901,"For years, the rapid advance of technology has stoked fears that robots are coming for humans' jobs.But when the COVID-19 pandemic shut everything down across the world in the spring, robots have come to the rescue — and public perception of them has become more positive as a result.""I've noticed headlines have changed regarding robots,"" Julie Carpenter, a research fellow with the ethics and emerging sciences group at California State Polytechnic, told Spark host Nora Young.""It's definitely pivoted from 'The robots are coming for your jobs' headlines to, 'Robots in the pandemic, and they'll save us all by shining UV light on everything,' and that sort of thing.""Headlines — and novel photographs — have depicted machines of all levels of sophistication bridging the gap between physically-distanced humans.In Toronto, the Tiny Mile AI robot is making food deliveries instead of couriers — at a discounted rate for restaurants compared to third-party delivery apps.Robots with powerful UV lights are being used to disinfect everything from hospitals in China to a wildlife rehabilitation centre in Manitoba.And in a Boston hospital, a doglike robot named Spot takes COVID patients' vital signs, reducing health-care workers' risk of contracting the coronavirus.TorontoFor all that robots and technology have done to help keep us safe during the pandemic, it hasn't completely assuaged fear of its effect on the job market.A Statistics Canada study released in June estimated that office support workers, salespeople and employees in industrial or construction trades were far more likely to lose their jobs to automation than people in careers like law, education and government.The study noted, however, that COVID-19 may affect those projections in ways that are ""largely unknown and dependent on several factors,"" the study authors wrote.""The closure of workplaces during the pandemic and efforts to minimize physical contact between people may motivate employers to 'virus-proof' their production practices by adopting technological solutions. Additionally, many businesses have moved much of their sales and customer services online, increasing their reliance on digital technologies,"" they explained.In the U.S., Time's Alana Semeuls explained that in the late 1800s and 1900s, companies retrained employees for new jobs to replace old jobs transformed by increasing automation and industrialization. And governments invested in education, as a workforce largely made up of farmers diversified into bankers, engineers and more.But today, tax incentives in the U.S. mean companies might pay less tax purchasing equipment than spending the same amount of money hiring workers.However, Frank Pasquale, a law professor at Brooklyn Law School, argues that human jobs don't have to be traded in for the inevitable advances in technology and artificial intelligence.In his book New Laws of Robotics: Defending Human Expertise in the Age of AI, he draws a line between AI, or artificial intelligence, and what he calls I.A., or intelligence augmentation.He gave an example of an AI robot doctor scanning a patient and handing out a diagnosis, compared to a human doctor using an advanced scanner to compare a person's vital signs to millions of archived images of cancerous and non-cancerous cells to help aid the diagnosis.""The idea is that ultimately you'd have the doctor as an intermediary between the technology and [the] person who's being treated,"" he said.As of now, a robot programmed with preferred responses to a patient or customer's questions is no substitute for genuine person-to-person communication — and Pasquale argues it's foolish to pretend otherwise.""The robot may simulate emotion and empathy, but because it is itself not mortal … it is sort of a counterfeiting of the human ability to understand, reflect, [and] empathize,"" he said.He developed four ""new laws of robotics"" to navigate its growing role in society, a play on sci-fi author Isaac Asimov's laws of robotics introduced in the 1942 short story Runaround.Pasquale's new laws are:Employ robotics and A.I. in ways that complement professionals, instead of replacing them.Prevent robots from mimicking human qualities like empathy or emotionAvoid ""arms races"" between robotics researchers.Keep record of who designed or controls a robot, in order to know who to contact — or hold responsible — in case something goes wrong.As the pandemic thrusts robots and automation further into the mainstream spotlight, some people may find them unusual, or even unnerving.Carpenter explained that many people's expectations of robots are based in science fiction. And in the West, at least, those depictions are often threatening. For every R2-D2 in Star Wars, she says, you'll find a seething Terminator — or the murderous robot dog in Black Mirror.""It's a combination of fascination at the technology, but also a little bit of fear [and] trepidation because they don't understand its capabilities and its limitations,"" said Carpenter.If you're introducing robots into the workplace, she said, talk to your colleagues about what they're being used for, and how they might affect everyone's work.""Have discussions with your staff. Say, this is what we're thinking about. These are the robots we're looking at. This is how your job might change,"" she said.Sometimes, Carpenter added, people might be more willing to embrace robots in the workplace if they take on a familiar form — like how the four-legged Spot resembles a dog.But she noted that people can develop an attachment to robots simply because of the roles they play, even without anthropomorphizing them.Carpenter studied how the U.S. military uses robots for tasks like bomb disposal for her book Culture and Human-Robot Interaction in Militarized Spaces.She found that many U.S. military forces use robots for sensitive or dangerous tasks, such as explosive disposal. Even though they looked more like miniature tanks, some soldiers would give them names, or consider them a mascot for their unit.""I want to emphasize, though, they would never regard it the same as a human teammate, at this point,"" she said.""But you can see … that we're navigating and negotiating where robots fit into our lives, even socially.""",0.07845458852921541,0.4545064181258211
733,"Beijing looks like a 'ghost town,' says BBC correspondent under quarantine | CBC Radio","After weeks of driving around China covering the spread of the coronavirus, Stephen McDonell is now staying put.",2020-01-30T23:32:47.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/radio/asithappens/as-it-happens-the-thursday-edition-1.5446163/beijing-looks-like-a-ghost-town-says-bbc-correspondent-under-quarantine-1.5446165,"TranscriptAfter driving around China covering the spread of the coronavirus, Stephen McDonell is now staying put. McDonell, the chief China correspondent for the BBC, has been forced to quarantine himself in his apartment in Beijing after returning from a visit to Hubei province, which is in lockdown. The World Health Organization said Thursday the coronavirus now represents a global health emergency. At least 212 people have died, most of them in Hubei.  Here is part of McDonell's conversation with As It Happens host Carol Off. You're covering one of the biggest stories in China in years, and yet you're forced to stay home in quarantine. As a reporter, what's that like?It's not too bad. At least I got to initially go to the sort of heart of it in Hubei province. And it's because we were there that upon returning to Beijing, I've had to stay at home for a couple of weeks, so as to not pass on the virus, potentially, to my colleagues.It's been a sort of a contrast. We certainly were crazy busy down there for a few days.It is also interesting here, though. Because Beijing — it's incredible. Like, normally, it's quiet anyway for the Spring Festival. But at the moment ... in this enormous city, there's barely anybody on the streets. Shops are closed, businesses also closed.We've had news now that these big companies — Toyota, Samsung, Ikea — are all delaying starting up work again after the Spring Festival break because of the fear of their workforce being contaminated. And it's like the whole country has gone into sort of ghost-town mode.For anyone who's normally been to China, it's not what you would expect it to be like.What's the level of fear that people are feeling right now?It's more serious when you're in the sort of what you might call ... the virus hot zone.The closer we're getting to Hubei, the more people are worried. There are obviously more checkpoints. There are police, there are medical teams dressed head-to-toe in protective gear. To pass those checkpoints, you need to have a temperature screening.Once you go into Hubei, well, of course, people are most worried there, because that's where the corona virus outbreak started. But I think mainly they're pretty happy that the government is taking this very decisive action — even though it's kind of Draconian and heavy-handed.Locking down a province of 60 million people — it's like the entire population of Italy not being able to move around — it is quite a drastic step to take. And yet most Chinese people, I think, can understand why it's being done. And even the World Health Organization isn't criticizing China over this.How did you get out? How difficult was it actually to cross a border and get out of that province and get back to Beijing?We sort of thought we'd ease ourselves in on a small little back street — a small road.But even on that very little road we were attempting to cross over the border, there was a police checkpoint. And when we went to go in the police were like, ""Well, we'll let you in. But we're not going let you back out again.""So we thought, well, what the hell? And we just pushed ahead and went in — not knowing how we'd get back out again.We travelled through lots of towns, which just felt like were completely deserted. If people had told you that nobody lived there anymore, you would believe it — apart from the odd person walking down the street, sort of hunched over with their face mask on. And then we went to a small city. And we were interviewing a patient from their hospital bed via a phone app.I wished this person good health ... and hung up the phone. As if on cue, the police turned up. And the local ... government officials were hot on their heels, and basically said they didn't want us there. And so we said to them, ""Well look, you know, even if we wanted to go, how would we get out of this province? Because you know it's all locked down.""""Oh, no worries,"" they said, and escorted us back across the border ... with the police lights flashing.It was more important for them to breach their own quarantine procedures than have a sort of team of pesky journalists hanging around.Interview produced by Chris Harbord.

735,Manitoba cancels $5-million order for medical gowns in move local supplier calls 'ineffective and uninformed' | CBC News,The Manitoba government is being accused of being ‘ineffective’ in its attempts to secure protective personal equipment in the fight against COVID-19 after a Winnipeg supplier watched a $5 million PPE deal go sour because officials balked at the terms.,2020-04-22T10:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/ppe-covid19-manitoba-1.5540452,"The Manitoba government is being accused of being ineffective in its attempts to secure protective personal equipment in the fight against COVID-19 after a Winnipeg supplier watched a $5-million PPE deal go sour because officials balked at the terms. The CBC has learned the provincial government cancelled the $5-million order for gowns and goggles at the last minute because it refused to send money directly to China.""Slow, ineffective and uninformed,"" said wholesale supplier Craig Henderson, when asked about his experience working with procurement officials. ""(The government has) been presented with an absolutely honest and straightforward offer by two guys who have worked as hard as they can for almost three weeks now to try to get the PPE.""Henderson is the owner of Big Top Fireworks in West Kildonan and has spent decades importing fireworks for wholesale, with the majority of the product coming from China.When Health Minister Cameron Friesen issued a public plea on March 25 asking for businesses to help supply them with PPE to combat COVID-19, Henderson saw an opportunity to use the business relationships he built with suppliers in China to bring in these items. ""And as soon as I heard that I went, 'Well, I'm pretty sure I can do that.' And I went to look into it, contacted my guy over in China and began researching it,"" he said.""And by one day after the governments asked, we realized that we could supply masks and gowns and hand sanitizer and every other piece of PPE that they were requesting in very large quantities.""Using an agent on the ground in Hebei, an industrial hub in China, Henderson says he was able to find factories that could produce medical-grade gowns, N95 masks and other coveted PPE. Henderson had worked with this agent, Lai Weichang, for decades. On March 27, Henderson began emailing government officials, explaining what he could offer. Emails between Henderson and officials within the finance department show their initial interest was in obtaining N95 masks — which it then abandoned because of an ""export ban"" on N95s from China, according to an email from a civil servant to Henderson.Eventually, a $300,000 deal to purchase 100,000 Class 1 safety goggles was in the works and a $4.7-million purchase order was signed for 500,000 isolation gowns on April 12.These are medical-grade gowns used by health-care staff to protect them from infection.""We firmly had been told and were firmly of the opinion that the money was going to be transferred. We could lock down those factories at that price and that delivery schedule,"" Henderson told CBC last week. And within days, it all fell apart. ""I received a one-line email … essentially saying, 'No, we're not gonna do this,'"" Henderson said. The email told Henderson they were cancelling the purchase order for the gowns, because ""government is not going to make payments to a Chinese agent for this type of equipment.""Which baffled Henderson, as the purchase order was issued to a Chinese company, with a Chinese address.""I feel sorry for the health-care workers with the ineffective purchasing that's now occurring from the Manitoba government,"" Henderson said. As for the order for goggles, the procurement officer told Henderson he would prepare a purchase order on April 13 and then stopped returning his emails. Andrea Slobodian, a spokesperson for Manitoba's Central Services department, said the order was cancelled because the terms were changed to involve a direct payment to China. ""The province has made the conscious decision to work with local suppliers as much as possible and to source materials through and provide direct payment to Canadian and U.S.-based suppliers in order to provide legal and contractual protections,"" she said in a prepared statement.She said no one noticed it was a payment to a Chinese company until they went to add in the banking information.Manitoba's drive to get PPE to front line workers has been front and centre throughout the pandemic. While the Manitoba government announced in March it was first to sign up to work with federal health officials to secure PPE in a co-ordinated national effort, there have been multiple setbacks. Millions of supplies were ordered through the feds but the province only ""received a fraction of that,"" Manitoba Shared Health Chief Nursing Officer Lanette Siragusa said on April 8.This prompted the province to temporarily scale back a universal personal protective equipment protocol introduced at the beginning of April. On Tuesday, Siragusa announced a new protocol, abandoning the universal protocol in favour of a new guideline that ranks the level of PPE based on those with the highest risk and need. ""Supply levels and demand continues to be a challenge and changes day by day,"" she said. ""We are taking every possible step to ensure appropriate protection remains available for staff in risk situations and settings for the duration of this pandemic.""The province announced this week, following the CBC's questions, that it had made a deal to purchase up to 200,000 isolation gowns from MWG Apparel Corp. — a Winnipeg-based company which specializes in industrial workwear.In total, they have issued purchase orders for more than $100 million in COVID-related PPE, supplies and equipment since March 29, 2020, from suppliers in Manitoba, across Canada and internationally.Fraser Johnson, a supply chain expert and professor at the Ivey Business School at Western University, says this pandemic has been a learning experience for governments, which aren't used to fighting for access to these resources.""So you get some provinces going from buying anywhere from 20,000 to 50,000 N95 masks to buying over a million,"" he said. ""The system isn't built to be able to support that kind of volume.""Johnson called it a ""gamble"" for governments to use an unknown overseas supplier.""I've heard horror stories of people and organizations who brought stuff from Southeast Asia, China, shipped in and air-freighted it in and then to find out that it's counterfeit,"" he said.""So that is a significant problem.""Henderson said he is not in this for financial gain, but wants to see Manitobans get access to the PPE they need. The agent Henderson worked with in China has been his partner for two decades and he said he trusts him to only deal with licensed medical equipment. ""There are thousands of factories in China. That's what people have to be able to picture. He (his partner) works at those factories as hard as he can, finding qualified factories, making sure they're certified,"" Henderson said. Henderson is not alone in his frustration when it comes to the government's PPE procurement approach. Doctors across the province are feeling the pinch after a promise by Shared Health in mid-March to secure them the necessary PPE to open their offices to see patients has stalled. A survey of 400 doctors last week by Doctors Manitoba found that only 36 per cent received their PPE order through Shared Health Logistics and half of the orders were incomplete.Almost 60 per cent of those surveyed said they do not have the gowns recommended by provincial authorities and 43 per cent don't have appropriate eye protection.Danielle Paradis is a doctor in rural Manitoba, who splits her time between East Parkland Medical Group, a private clinic, and the Ste. Rose General Hospital. While she hasn't had to worry at the hospital, her clinic has been waiting since mid-March to get the PPE it ordered through Shared Health. ""Shared Health said, 'Yes if you contact us we will help ensure that PPE gets out to you,'"" she said. Instead, she was forced to purchase face shields, surgical masks and goggles out of pocket as they waited.""At this point it has been too slow and it's inadequate,"" she said of the government's response to getting them the PPE.""This is a rapidly changing pandemic here … the fact that we are still continuing to await PPE for weeks on end at this point, I think that is putting health-care providers and the community at large at risk.""",0.09325036075036074,0.4088933982683984

Henry says she began experiencing symptoms upon her arrival and immediately isolated herself at home.Vancouver Coastal Health and Interior Health are conducting investigations into the small group of people with whom she had contact. Officials are still determining if people on the same flights as the patient need to be contacted, said Henry. She said the woman wore a mask while in transit. Henry says the woman reached out to health officials in the Interior about her illness and was placed in isolation in hospital. The B.C. Centre for Disease Control (BCCDC) said a test for the virus came back positive Thursday afternoon. That test must be confirmed by the National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg.The patient is in stable condition, and is now in isolation at home, said Henry. Those who are known to have come into contact with her are also in isolation at home.""So once again we're very thankful and grateful that the people who are coming back not just from Hubei province but all over China are taking the advice very seriously to self-monitor and to connect with us and make sure that they can be tested, assessed and cared for safely,"" Henry said.There are four other confirmed cases of the virus in the province, according to the BCCDC, and three in Ontario, according to the Public Health Agency of Canada. Health Minister Adrian Dix said Friday B.C. has done the most testing of any jurisdiction in Canada. As of this week, the BCCDC has conducted more than 715 tests for the coronavirus on about 500 people.WATCH | Dix explains why he's impressed with B.C.'s response:CBC News BCHenry says the man with the first confirmed case in the province is recovering. ""So that's a good sign,"" she said.A recent test said he is free of the illness. A second test confirming that will allow him out of isolation. ""So we fully expect that to happen soon,"" Henry said. All of the people in B.C. who have contracted the virus are in stable condition, Henry said.Anyone with concerns about their illness or who want to be assessed for coronavirus risk can call 811.China's National Health Commission has reported 5,090 new coronavirus cases on the mainland, for a total of 63,851. There have been 121 new deaths, bringing the death toll in mainland China to 1,380.Chinese officials say 1,716 health-care workers have been infected, and six have died.Public health officials say the risk is low in Canada.",0.166500946969697,0.4637389520202021

749,Pro sports leagues close off locker rooms amid coronavirus fears | CBC Sports,"The NBA, NHL, Major League Baseball and Major League Soccer are closing access to locker rooms and clubhouses to all non-essential personnel in response to the coronavirus crisis, the leagues announced in a joint statement Monday night.",2020-03-09T23:40:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/sports/coronavirus-locker-rooms-closed-pro-sports-1.5491833,"The NBA, NHL, Major League Baseball and Major League Soccer are closing access to locker rooms and clubhouses to all non-essential personnel in response to the coronavirus crisis, the leagues announced in a joint statement Monday night.The leagues said they made the decision ""after consultation with infectious disease and public health experts."" The NBA, in a call with teams earlier Monday, stressed that the move is not to ban reporters but to ensure the safety of players and staff in those areas.The statement, in part, read: ""Given the issues that can be associated with close contact in pre- and post-game settings, all team locker rooms and clubhouses will be open only to players and essential employees of teams and team facilities until further notice. Media access will be maintained in designated locations outside of the locker room and clubhouse setting.""The changes, which the leagues say are temporary, will begin Tuesday — though some NHL teams began putting them into use this past weekend. The NBA said interviews with players would continue in different settings, stressing a gap of some two metres between reporters and interview subjects.For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia.The vast majority of people recover from the new virus. According to the World Health Organization, people with mild illness recover in about two weeks, while those with more severe illness may take three to six weeks to recover. In mainland China, where the virus first exploded, more than 80,000 people have been diagnosed and more than 58,000 have so far recovered.The NBA has calls with team medical staffs scheduled for later Monday night and a call between league officials and team owners scheduled for Wednesday to discuss next steps. The NBA told teams last week to prepare for the possibility of playing games in empty arenas, something the game's biggest star — Los Angeles Lakers forward LeBron James — insists he does not want to see.More than 113,000 people worldwide have tested positive for the disease and over 3,900 people with the virus have died, most of them in China. More than 62,000 people have already recovered. The virus has infected 600 people in the United States — including the director of the agency that runs the airports in New York and New Jersey — and at least 26 have died, most in Washington state.The Pro Basketball Writers Association quickly responded to the leagues' announcement by saying its membership ""believes the safety of fans, players, team employees, arena workers and the media who cover the league must be protected. Our thoughts are with all people who already have been adversely impacted by the virus.""Therefore, we understand the NBA's decision to temporarily close locker rooms to everyone but players and essential team personnel with the NBA's promise that once the coronavirus crisis abates, the league will restore full access to the journalists who cover the league.""",0.13676885130373503,0.46620859760394634
756,Why health experts advise cancelling cruises amid coronavirus | CBC News,"Experts warn that cruise liners pose special danger as the coronavirus crisis worsens, and call on the industry to rethink ship design.",2020-03-10T08:00:58.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/coronavirus-cruise-warnings-1.5491789,"The coronavirus outbreak on the cruise ship Diamond Princess started with a single passenger who came aboard in late January with a slight cough, and then developed a fever shortly after disembarking, six days later. By the time doctors in Japan started testing the remaining passengers and crew on Feb. 3, there were 10 cases. After a 14-day quarantine, that number ballooned to 619, with seven resulting deaths so far.  A new study modelling the onboard outbreak, published in the Journal of Travel Medicine, reaches some sobering conclusions about how much worse — or better — things might have gone.In the early stages of the shipboard epidemic, the rate of infection on the Diamond Princess was four times higher than in Wuhan, China, the epicentre of what has now become a global outbreak. Left unchecked, the disease would have eventually touched 79 per cent of those on board, some 2,900 people, the Swedish researchers calculate. However, if all passengers and crew had been relocated, assessed and, where necessary, isolated when the first 10 cases were discovered, the outbreak might have been limited to a total of 76 people, they say. The difference was the boat. ""The cruise ship conditions clearly amplified an already highly transmissible disease,"" the epidemiologists write. Doctors have long known that it doesn't take much to turn a pleasure cruise into a ship of sickness. Passengers and crew are regularly laid-low by influenza, food poisoning or gastrointestinal viruses like Norwalk. Over the past decade, cruise companies operating out of U.S. ports alone have reported an average of almost 3,200 such illnesses each year. But the coronavirus outbreaks aboard the Diamond Princess — and now its Carnival Cruises sister ship, the Grand Princess, where 21 people and counting have been diagnosed with COVID-19 — show how the close quarters of onboard life have become potentially life-threatening. The current generation of massive, floating luxury hotels — some of them ferrying more than 6,000 passengers, from all over the world, each voyage — can function like a Petri dish, creating the perfect environment for the spread of a plague.""Cruise ships really provide a fairly unique situation because you take a large group of people and you confine them to a rather limited space, and really you rely on excellent hand hygiene and infection-control measures to be in place to prevent infections from spreading very widely,"" said Dr. Abdu Sharkawy, an infectious disease specialist with the University Health Network and associate professor at the University of Toronto. Unlike airplanes, where a majority of passengers tend to originate from one region or country, cruise ships host travellers from all corners of the world. And while plane passengers share a confined space for a few hours, people aboard ships are in close quarters for days, if not weeks.On Monday, Canada's Chief Public Health Officer Dr. Theresa Tam, asked Canadians to ""think twice about being on cruise ships."" The U.S. Centers for Disease Control has similarly recommended that all travellers — and most particularly those with underlying health issues — ""defer"" cruise vacations for the foreseeable future. Sharkawy says, as March break approaches, vacationers need to ""use common sense"" and look at what has already happened on the high seas. ""If I had a cruise booked, I would frankly cancel it,"" he said. ""You just don't have that degree of control, you don't have that amount of flexibility when you're stuck on a vessel with 3,000, or 4,000, or more, other passengers and you're kind at the mercy of the local authorities.""Ross Klein, a sociologist at Memorial University in St. John's, has been studying the cruise industry for more than two decades, tracking outbreaks and other on-board problems. He says the cruise companies have developed a fairly workable strategy to deal with things like stomach bugs and the flu, with illnesses hitting just a tiny fraction of the 30 million passengers they carried globally in 2019. But that playbook clearly isn't working for COVID-19.""I think the coronavirus caught them by surprise and I think they just weren't sure what to do,"" says Klein. ""It's almost like being caught like deer in the headlights.""Klein says that part of the problem might be that a modest amount of sickness has traditionally been a money-maker for cruise companies. ""There's a revenue stream that comes from illness, not just the cost stream,"" he explains. On-board health care isn't free. ""U.S. physician prices, you know? I mean, $150 for an office visit. And if you need drugs, you've got to pay too … The doctor gets a commission, and the ship makes money, and everybody's happy. Except for the passenger who doesn't have insurance.""Over the weekend, the Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA), an industry body, unveiled a coronavirus action plan, which will deny boarding to people who have visited or travelled from South Korea, Iran or China, or anyone who has come in contact with a COVID-19 patient within the past 14 days. All passengers will also have their temperatures taken as they embark, with those showing a fever above 38 C referred for secondary screening. CBC NewsWhether such measures will be sufficient to protect cruise passengers, who tend to skew older — one-third of all who sail are aged 60 or above, the age group most at risk from COVID-19 — remains to be seen. The CLIA did not respond to a request for an interview. And the three major ocean cruise companies — Carnival, Royal Caribbean and Norwegian — all declined to provide CBC News on-board access to document their cleaning and coronavirus control measures. Some experts say the coronavirus crisis points to a need to reimagine the spaces where we work, play and travel, and to start adapting them for 21st century, global health challenges.""We have to think beyond the everyday experiences. We have to anticipate risks and respond to threats,"" said Lindsay Tan, who studies how pathogens and people intersect as director of the Design Ecology Lab at Auburn University in Alabama. ""So that's both the shape of spaces, how big they are, how many people are going to be in them, how they're going to be used, but also the materials that we're using. Different materials have different properties that carry different loads of virus; properties that are easier to clean.""For cruise companies that may mean challenging consumers' definition of ""high-end"" and moving from fabric finishes to surfaces that can be more easily cleaned. ""If I told you that your cruise ship was going to have a vinyl headboard you might not think that sounds really luxurious, but I assure you there are properties that we can put into vinyl now that allow it to be comfortable, luxurious and safe,"" says Tan. ""We're already doing it in health-care spaces. You can have a seat that is beautiful and comfortable, and it's also able to be washed down with bleach."" The cruise industry is trying its best to weather the storm, by waiving cancellation fees and penalties, and offering full credit for passengers who agree to rebook for future voyages. Klein predicts that major PR campaigns and deep discounts will soon follow, in an effort to quell public fears.That's what has worked with past outbreaks of lesser illnesses. But with lives on the line, convincing people that it is safe to sail, might be a much tougher sell.""It could be years and years before people have confidence,"" said Klein.",0.14310724063060512,0.4582973620356799

Europe as a whole has recorded more than 175,000 since the virus emerged in China late last year.Health experts, however, believe that the John Hopkins tally falls short of showing the true tragedy of the pandemic.Many governments have struggled to produce statistics that can reasonably be considered as true indicators of the pandemic given the scarcity of diagnostic tests, especially in the first phase of the crisis. Authorities in Italy and Spain, with over 60,000 combined deaths, have acknowledged that their death count is larger than the story the numbers tell.Brazil's government has stopped publishing a running total of coronavirus deaths and infections; critics say it's an attempt to hide the true toll of the disease.Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro went as far as to tweet on Saturday that his country's disease totals are ""not representative"" of Brazil's current situation, insinuating that the numbers were actually overestimating the spread of the virus.Critics of Bolsonaro, who has repeatedly clashed with health experts over the seriousness of the disease and has threatened to take Brazil out of the World Health Organization, said the decision was a maneuver by the hardman-style leader to hide the depths of crisis.Brazil's last official numbers recorded over 34,000 virus-related deaths, the third-highest toll in the world behind the U.S. and Britain. It reported nearly 615,000 infections, putting it second behind the U.S.Canada had 95,699 confirmed and presumptive coronavirus cases as of 1:30 p.m. ET Sunday, according to a CBC News tally, including 33,630 active cases and 54,221 recoveries.At least 7,848 people in Canada have died from coronavirus.WATCH | Scientists aim to reduce waste from created from disposable pandemic supplies:The NationalHere's a look at what's happening around the world on Sunday. Spain is preparing to take another step forward in the scaling back of its containment with Madrid and Barcelona opening the interiors of restaurants with reduced seating on Monday.In France, the government announced that from Tuesday, it will ease restrictions limiting travel from the French mainland to overseas territories in the Caribbean and Indian Ocean.In Turkey, Istanbul residents flocked to the city's shores and parks on the first weekend with no lockdown, prompting a reprimand from the health minister.Russia remained troubling, with nearly 9,000 new cases over the past day, roughly in line with numbers reported over the past week.India confirmed 9,971 new coronavirus cases in another biggest single-day spike, a day before it prepares to reopen shopping malls, hotels and religious places after a 10-week lockdown.Pakistan is pushing toward 100,000 confirmed infections as medical professionals plead for more controls and greater enforcement of social distancing directives. But Prime Minister Imran Khan said a full shutdown would devastate a failing economy.China has reported its first non-imported case in two weeks, an infected person on the island of Hainan off the southern coast.South Korea has reported 57 additional cases of the coronavirus, marking a second day in a row that its daily jump is above 50 as authorities struggle to suppress a spike in fresh infections in the densely populated Seoul metropolitan area.Britain will allow places of worship to reopen on June 15 — but only for private prayer.",0.07148989898989898,0.4114015151515151

Dr. Vera Etches said the city's rolling five-day average of the number of people diagnosed daily is now almost 55, surpassing the previous high set in late April. ""It's the speed of the increase that concerns us. We can't sustain a rapid rise in cases,"" she said.

While new testing technologies could help, doctors say they won't be a silver bullet.The gold standard swab of the nose or throat can be uncomfortable. In contrast, a key promise of saliva tests is that people could collect saliva themselves so that fewer nurses and other health professionals would be needed at assessment centres, as staffing is one of the factors that can drive up wait times. But that ideal won't happen immediately. Currently in Canada, both saliva collection and testing remain a research project that regulators are closely evaluating.There are three main barriers to overcome before saliva tests roll out widely. Gobs of saliva vary in how fluid they can be, so collecting a high-quality sample can be a challenge even for something as non-invasive as spitting into a cup. The next hurdle for scientists is to get accurate and consistent results on the presence of the virus. Finally, clinicians need to determine how well the test results help them to correctly identify those with the disease.On Thursday, British Columbia announced it's introducing a new mouth rinse, gargle and spit test for students from kindergarten to Grade 12 to make it easier for children and teenagers to check whether they have COVID-19. But this new test is only offered to school-age kids, and only in B.C.COVID-19 medical coverage now available even though Canadians advised to avoid international travel Canadians yearning to travel abroad despite the COVID-19 pandemic can now get medical insurance to cover costs if they get sick with the coronavirus while travelling, CBC's Sophia Harris reports. In March, when the virus began its global spread and Canada advised against non-essential travel abroad, travel insurance providers stopped selling COVID-19 medical coverage. Now, several insurance providers have resumed offering the coverage along with their regular travel insurance plans.Air Canada, WestJet, Sunwing and travel agency Flight Centre have also joined in, offering free COVID-19 medical coverage to passengers booking certain international flights and vacation packages. ""They are able to travel if they want to, and we just want to enable that to take place as safely as we can,"" said Richard Job, Flight Centre's vice-president of commercial partnership.Travel insurance broker Martin Firestone said he's surprised by the spate of offers — considering Canada's advisory against international travel remains intact due to the ongoing pandemic. ""Your country is now currently under a Level 3 travel advisory, and you've got airlines enticing people with free medical coverage,"" said Firestone with Travel Secure in Toronto. ""Whether you have coverage or not, you may be in a very precarious position with [available] hospital beds and treatment and the ability to be flown back to Canada.""Canadian airlines cancelling flights again as hoped-for bounceback in demand fizzles Canadian airlines are cancelling hundreds of flights as hopes for a spike in demand fall flat, snarling plans for the few passengers who remain. Figures from flight data firm Cirium show Air Canada and WestJet have cancelled at least 439 flights so far this month.John Gradek, who heads McGill University's Global Aviation Leadership program, says the inordinately high number comes after airlines banked on a return of business travel and a continued uptick in leisure trips following months of profit loss. Now, carriers are cancelling the half-booked flights and consolidating passengers on remaining ones to cut costs.Twenty-six-year-old Rachel Farrell had booked a Transat flight out of Halifax for mid-February as part of her destination wedding in the Dominican Republic, but she was informed this week the airline had cancelled the trip and could not make the journey possible until six days later. Farrell's wedding group of two dozen paid $37,000 for the package. She says Transat is offering flight credit but no refund, as the tour company struggles to bounce back from a 99 per cent year-over-year drop in revenue last quarter.Stay informed with the latest COVID-19 data from Canada and around the world.THE SCIENCEDoctors think you should get the flu shot this year — and soonAs COVID-19 cases climb in many provinces, flu season is also on the horizon. Doctors and governments say the COVID-19 pandemic makes it more important than ever to get the flu shot because:Too many people with flu and flu-related complications can put pressure on the health system, which will likely already be under strain due to COVID-19. A high vaccination rate can reduce the demand for COVID-19 testing, since the flu and COVID-19 have similar symptoms. Many testing centres have recently seen long lines and wait times due to a surge in demand. Getting the flu — as with other pre-existing lung diseases — can increase the risk of COVID-19 complications in people who catch that, too. ""If they have the flu, they're more likely to wind up in hospital and die from COVID-19,"" said Dr. Iris Gorfinkel, a family physician and vaccine researcher at Prime Health Clinical Research in Toronto.The federal government said that this year, it's raising awareness and promoting the flu vaccine especially to populations at higher risk of flu and flu-related complications, including seniors, people with compromised immune systems and those with chronic medical conditions.AND FINALLY...Canada's biggest cities are seeing a surge in household waste thanks to COVID-19 Some of Canada's biggest cities are seeing a surge in household waste thanks to myriad COVID-related trends, including the re-emergence of disposable goods, a summer full of home renovations and the continuous growth of online shopping. Early figures from the cities of Vancouver, Calgary, Winnipeg, Toronto and Halifax reveal that the amount of residential garbage collected has increased significantly since the start of the pandemic.Data compiled by CBC Radio's The Cost of Living shows the garbage picked up in many of these cities went up in some months by as much as 35 per cent compared with the year before.In Toronto, residential garbage collection jumped by 12 per cent from June 2019 to June 2020. Vancouver saw 18 and 11 per cent increases in June and July, respectively. In Calgary, single-family residential garbage collection rose by double-digit percentages each month from April through July, when comparing those months in 2019 and 2020. Winnipeg and Halifax also saw increases.Commercial waste, on the other hand, is down significantly across Canada, suggesting a major shift in where and how we consume goods and services.Find out more about COVID-19Still looking for more information on the pandemic?

""Manufacturing of medications actually slowed and in some cases stopped.""Priddle, while noting the supply has returned to pre-COVID-19 levels, said what happened earlier this year wasn't normal.""I have never seen anything like this in the last 30 years for sure. It is truly unprecedented,"" she said.The NLPB also issued tips for patients as its recommendation is eased, including:The easing back on the 30-day supply will be good news for people who usually get 60- or 90-day prescriptions, meaning they will also now save on dispensing fees charged by pharmacies.""The [NLPB] isn't insensitive to this at all and we do recognize that there are people in our province that are paying extra … and probably can't afford to pay the extra,"" Priddle said.Priddle said pharmacists are thanking consumers for their patience during the last few months. ""We would still ask them to be kind to the pharmacists as they're presenting for for their medications,"" she said. ""They're working with you as best they can to deal with all the situations that are coming at them.""The board said while the 30-day supply recommendation is diminishing, it will continue to closely monitor drug supplies and the overall healthcare environment associated with COVID-19. The board will respond accordingly should access to medications become compromised. ""I'm hopeful that that we will not have to put in such harsh measures again but we'll do what we need to do to protect the supply,"" said Priddle.Read more articles from CBC Newfoundland and Labrador",0.11249999999999999,0.35407088122605357

He said they were tested prior to being purchased.AHS reiterated its stance in a statement to CBC News on Thursday, almost identical to a statement it released on April 22.""All PPE purchased and provided by AHS is approved for medical use and meets health-care standards,"" the Thursday statement said.""AHS has worked with the suppliers to have the nose pieces adjusted and the length of the mask [from nose to chin] increased for a better fit. These changes will be in place for the next shipment to AHS.""Alberta mask issues a matter of personal preference, official saysIn the meantime, AHS recommends that doctors can compress the entire edge of the mask containing the nose piece in a 'W' shape to help the fit across the nose, and adding a face shield for extra protection.AHS says it is confident it can resolve the issues that have been identified and that it has created a quality control group to field test any new models or products.That's not good enough for Julyan-Gudgeon.""The government, in the form AHS media, has stated that they are meeting a standard,"" he said. ""Then when you challenge them on it they send you links as to how to wear the mask … but they seem to shy away from any discussion of the exact performance standards."" Julyan-Gudgeon believes AHS is only focusing on esthetics.""They're not getting the point that the actual protection performance of these masks are, by an established protocol, already substandard,"" he said.He said he wants the government to be more transparent about understanding the standards and then to follow through on delivering those standards.",0.12414772727272727,0.3521070075757575

Kennedy said vendors that provide clients with things like furniture, linens, exotic flowers and even paper goods are feeling the effects of the coronavirus outbreak in China.""[It's all] trickling down from third-party manufacturers to larger national suppliers, and now our local suppliers,"" she said.Kennedy said given the circumstances, her focus right now is to help manage clients' expectations, and to plan weddings accordingly.""With everything that's happening globally, it's important to know that we might not get everything that we want, but it's still going to be amazing.""",0.13790745464852608,0.46159297052154197

826,Coronavirus fears putting a damper on cruise bookings | CBC News,Some local travel agencies are reporting a decline in cruise vacation bookings and an increase in cancellations over fears caused by the coronavirus outbreak.,2020-02-20T16:00:11.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/coronavirus-cruise-ship-bookings-1.5469283,"Some local travel agencies are reporting a decline in cruise vacation bookings and an increase in cancellations over fears caused by the coronavirus outbreak.Katherine Le, president of Ottawa-based Eastview Travel, said about 15 per cent of her cruise vacation bookings have been cancelled or postponed in the past three weeks.""People are worried about what's going on if they go on a cruise ship,"" Le said. ""They worry about getting infected with the coronavirus.""The outbreak originated in Wuhan, China, and has since infected over 74,000 people in that country and another 924 worldwide, according to an update Wednesday from the World Health Organization (WHO).That includes passengers who were aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship in the Japanese port of Yokohama.The decline in cruise ship bookings comes as Canadian airlines have cancelled most flights to China and the government has issued a travel warning for the country, exacerbating the situation for travel agents like Le who focus on Asia.A total of 621 passengers from the Diamond Princess are now infected, including 57 Canadians. It's the largest cluster of cases outside China, the WHO has said.Passengers who tested negative for coronavirus began to disembark Wednesday after a two-week quarantine that infectious disease experts have criticized for doing more harm than good.Le said her customers have expressed fears of being caught in a similar situation.""When you get on a cruise ship that means you get trapped in there, and you cannot leave,"" Le said.In another case, the MS Westerdam sailed from port to port in Asia seeking to offload passengers, only to be denied at each one.Finally, the government of Cambodia allowed it to dock in Sihanoukville.One passenger who disembarked tested positive for the respiratory illness caused by the virus, which is officially known as COVID-19.Wen Jin, sales manager at Midearth Travel, which specializes in all-inclusive packages to China, said anxiety among potential cruise-goers extends beyond those travelling to Asia.Jin also organizes flight and cruise packages to the Caribbean in partnership with Sunwing Airlines. She said she hasn't received any new bookings for cruises since Jan. 15.Instead, Jin said she's been dealing mainly with cancellations and refunds, which has been eating into her commission.""I work double,"" Jin said. ""One time it's to buy the cruise, the other time it's to refund the cruise. So I work two hours, but I get nothing.""Jin said one family who had a cruise booked for Feb. 8 leaving from Miami, Fla., cancelled after they heard about an incident on a New Jersey cruise ship.In that case, the Royal Caribbean's Anthem of the Seas was delayed at its departure port over fears that four people had coronavirus.While the people later tested negative, the scare was enough for the family to decide the risk wasn't worth it, Jin said.""They are afraid off being stopped inside of the ship, so they cancelled the trip,"" she said.Jin said other families were forced to cancel and refund their trips when some cruise lines adopted policies barring people with Chinese, Hong Kong or Macau passports from their ships.The situation is not the same at all agencies.Mohinder Hona, general manager of Honda Travel, said his cruise vacation business has not been impacted so far.""Obviously, that is a concern right now, but it hasn't really stopped people from booking cruises because everyone knows that this is not something that is going to last forever,"" Honda said.Honda pointed out that people often book cruises months, if not years in advance.A spokesperson for the Association of Canadian Travel Agencies said the industry group is in the process of surveying its members to assess trends in light of the coronavirus outbreak, but won't have results until next week.",0.02292517006802721,0.37472170686456396

829,Chinese students trying to recoup thousands of dollars from Canadian homestay providers they say misled them | CBC News,A group of students from China and their parents say they're trying to recoup thousands of dollars from a family of homestay providers in Canada who promised a level of service they didn't deliver.,2020-01-06T09:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/international-students-china-homestay-toronto-british-columbia-1.5402622,"Several Chinese international students are warning others about a pair of homestay providers thousands of kilometres apart who they allege are taking advantage of young newcomers moving to Canada for high school. CBC News has spoken with seven students from China and their parents who allege the mother-daughter pair lied about the living conditions in their homes in Toronto and Burnaby, B.C., and broke the terms of their room-and-board contracts.The students described similar experiences of moving into a situation that was not as advertised, including seeing their hosts eat steak after feeding the teens hot dogs and leftovers and discovering that what they had been told would be a short walk to and from school would actually take hours each day.Many of the students are now trying to recoup thousands of dollars after moving out early.""I want my money back, and I don't want any other students to go through what my daughter did,"" said Li Limei, the mother of a teenager who lived at the homestay in Toronto. In the summer of 2018, Li started scouring the internet for housing for her 15-year-old daughter, Angel An, who was to start Grade 10 at Loretto Abbey Catholic Secondary School in Toronto that fall. ""I wanted Angel to get a head start at a Canadian high school,"" Li said in Mandarin, during a video interview on the WeChat app from her home in Beijing. She hoped finishing high school in Toronto would boost her child's chances of getting accepted into a Canadian university.Angel was preparing to join the annual influx of tens of thousands of Chinese students to Canada whose parents share that hope.In 2019, there were almost 70,000 Chinese international students of elementary school, high school and university age in Canada — up by about 10,000 from five years ago, according to Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada.The sharp increase has fuelled the business of housing students.Li easily found housing for Angel through WeChat, a popular place for Chinese families, homestay providers and settlement agencies that help people find homestays to make connections. She said a woman named Fiona Liu saw her post to the homestay group and offered to host Angel. Li said she made it clear she did not want her teen daughter sharing a house with male students and the home had to be pet-free because of her daughter's allergies to cats and dogs. ""Fiona promised she only accepts girls, that there were no male students,"" said Li. The contract Li signed stipulated there would be no pets. Li was satisfied when she got a first-hand look inside the detached three-storey house when she helped Angel move in August 2018. CBC News reviewed Li's rental agreement, which showed she paid $20,800 for a year's rent before Angel moved in.Within a month, Angel called her mother to say Liu had a dog and a male student had moved in. Li immediately contacted the homestay provider saying her daughter couldn't live with male students or dogs. She said Liu didn't listen and even brought home a second dog a few months later. Angel's mom said her daughter's asthma flared up and she developed allergic dermatitis.Because of the stress of her living situation, Angel dropped out of school in May and moved back to China, four months before her homestay contract was up.""I regret it so much,"" said Li. ""It really affected my daughter."" Li has since been trying to get about $8,000 in rent and deposit money back because she argues Liu broke the terms of the contract. Despite trying to contact Liu multiple times, Li said the homeowner has not answered her.""To this day, she hasn't returned my money,"" she said. CBC News reached out to Liu through email and phone calls, but she has not responded. On a visit to Liu's Toronto house in October, CBC spoke with several Chinese international students who confirmed she was hosting them.A teenage girl who had been living there for four months said her experience has been positive. However, her male housemate's room does not have a door. She said there's just a carpet hanging over it. On a subsequent visit to the house in December, a man who several students confirmed is Liu's husband, spoke with CBC News outside the house. He refused to identify himself or confirm whether Liu or any international students live there. But, when asked why Liu would allow male students into the house when she had said there would only be females, he said such an arrangement would be nonsensical in the real world. ""Can you segregate men and women on the TTC, for example?"" he said in Mandarin, referring to Toronto's public transit system. The seven families with whom CBC spoke found accommodation for their children either with Liu in Toronto or with her daughter, Tiff Lei, in Burnaby, B.C.All seven have attempted to get refunds — that add up to about $40,000 — but they allege the pair either stall, send cheques that bounce or don't respond at all.CBC News tried to call, email and text Lei about the allegations. The calls went to voice mail each time. A response to a text said it was the wrong number, even though the families verified the number belongs to Lei. Oswald Li, 19, said he's trying to get back his $1,400 damage deposit from Lei. He and another Chinese student lived with her in Burnaby for six months before moving out in February 2019. He described the experience as a ""nightmare."" He said he was promised three nutritious meals a day but was often fed beef jerky, french fries and hot dogs. He said much of the food wasn't fresh. Sometimes, after he finished eating, he would see Lei enjoying a steak for dinner, he said. Photos on a now-defunct website advertising the homestays in Toronto and Burnaby showed photos of chicken, cake and crab.When asked about the quality of the food, the man at the Toronto home told CBC News, ""You can't eat seafood every day.""After he moved out, Oswald Li said Lei gave him a cheque equalling the amount of his damage deposit. He said it bounced.""It was frustrating,"" he said. The parents, children and settlement agencies with whom CBC News spoke found each other by chance on WeChat and soon discovered they'd had similar experiences dealing with the same two people in Canada. They discovered Liu went by different names in her communication with different families. To Li Limei, she was ""Fiona Liu"" or ""Liu Jia."" To others, she was ""Gao Ling Qian."" CBC News confirmed through property records that both properties in Ontario and B.C. are owned by the same family. The director of a Beijing-based agency that helped settle Oswald Li and some other students in Canada told CBC News he feels betrayed by both the mother and daughter, with whom he placed students.""I feel angry, really, really angry. The students are young, and [Liu and Lei] lied to them,"" said Li Peng, director of CAEL Education Consulting, from his office in Beijing. He said Lei gave the families an address of a home closer to the students' school, but when they arrived in Burnaby, the teens were taken to a homestay farther away. In Toronto, Liu told some students their home was a five- to 15-minute walk to their schools. When they arrived, they realized the walk was closer to 90 minutes. All the students CBC News spoke with moved out early but not all have returned to China.Li Peng said his company and another settlement agency based in Shijiazhuang, China, that also worked with Lei in Burnaby, reimbursed the students themselves.He said he got back $9,000 from Liu after suggesting he would send friends of his to her house to collect.Both companies say they are still owed thousands of dollars.""We trusted [them],"" he said. ""It was our mistake.""Some of the parents who spoke with CBC News are considering legal action, but say it's tough because they live in China and are not able to navigate Canada's legal system from there. Li Peng said the family took advantage of young students who are alone in the country and don't have a support network or knowledge of how the legal system works. ""They don't have any other relatives in Canada,"" he said. ""They don't know how to protect themselves."" ",0.03812696861083959,0.35050667970022803

""And then there's a clinical decision whether they even qualify for our test.""Dr. Wajid Ahmed, medical officer of health with the Windsor-Essex County Health Unit, told reporters that the elderly have the highest risk of contracting coronavirus, explaining that many of those who have died in China were over the age of 60. Ahmed said that influenza is ""circulating in our community,"" adding that residents should take appropriate precautions to protect themselves from the flu and other respiratory infections. ",0.15305555555555556,0.4486111111111111

Iran maintains the IAEA inspectors have no legal basis to inspect the sites.""My objective is that my meetings in Tehran will lead to concrete progress in addressing the outstanding questions that the agency has related to safeguards in Iran and, in particular, to resolve the issue of access,"" Grossi said in a statement.""I also hope to establish a fruitful and co-operative channel of direct dialogue with the Iranian government which will be valuable now and in the future.""The Iranian delegation to international organizations in Vienna tweeted that ""we hope this visit will lead to reinforced mutual co-operation.""Since President Donald Trump unilaterally pulled the U.S. out of the nuclear deal with Iran in 2018, the other countries involved — France, Britain, Germany, Russia and China — have been struggling to keep it alive.The deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, promises Iran economic incentives in exchange for curbs on its nuclear program. But with the reinstatement of some American sanctions, Iran's economy has been steadily deteriorating, and Tehran has begun violating provisions of the agreement to try to pressure the other countries to do more to offset those sanctions.At the same time, Iran has continued to provide IAEA inspectors with access to its nuclear facilities — one of the major reasons the countries still party to the agreement stress that it's important to keep it alive.Last week, the U.S. ratcheted up the pressure, officially informing the United Nations it was demanding the restoration of all UN sanctions on Iran, arguing that Iran is in non-compliance and invoking a provision of the nuclear deal to ""snap back"" even more sanctions.Russia, China, Britain, France and Germany, who often disagree, all declared the U.S. action illegal, arguing it is impossible to withdraw from a deal and then use the resolution that endorsed it to reimpose sanctions.Iran has also rejected the move, but the U.S. has stuck to its guns, declaring that a 30-day countdown for the snapback of penalties eased after the 2015 agreement was signed had begun.The five nations and Iran are due to meet in Vienna on Sept. 1.",0.04129901960784316,0.3465686274509804

891,OPEC faces 'make-or-break' decision on oil production | CBC News,Members of OPEC meet this week to discuss oil production cuts as the spread of COVID-19 has eroded crude prices worldwide.,2020-03-03T23:30:26.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/opec-oil-caronavirus-1.5483779,"OPEC and its allies meet regularly to assess the supply and demand for oil around the globe, but few gatherings have happened under such volatile and trying circumstances.COVID-19's spread has weighed mightily on stock markets and oil prices in recent weeks, with experts still trying to assess the risk the virus poses worldwide.For OPEC, the situation is another big test of the cartel's ability to stabilize oil prices when struck with unexpected turbulence.""It's very important,"" said Judith Dwarkin, chief economist of RS Energy Group in Calgary.""They're facing a make-or-break decision about how to respond to COVID-19 disease, which has now spread beyond China and does pose a threat to global public health and the global economy.""While the impact of the illness on citizens' welfare is a paramount concern, markets are growing increasingly troubled about the blow it will have on world economies.Global oil prices have fallen 20 per cent since the start of the year as the novel coronavirus has spread. In Canada, a downturn in oil prices might not only have an impact on the revenues of oil companies but government coffers, too.Last week, Alberta revealed a provincial budget built in part on oil prices averaging $58 US a barrel in North America. On Monday, oil prices closed a little above $47 US a barrel.Members of OPEC and their allies are meeting this week at the group's headquarters in Vienna, Austria.OPEC, Russia and other producers already have a deal in place to cut output from Jan. 1 by 2.1 million barrels per day (bpd), a figure that includes additional voluntary cuts by Saudi Arabia.But that has not been enough to counter the impact of the virus on China, the world's biggest oil importer, and on the  global economy, as factories are disrupted, fewer people travel and other business slows, curbing oil demand.""China is the front line for impact in the first quarter [of the year],"" Dwarkin said. ""We estimate roughly 900,000 barrels per day has probably been sliced out of China's oil demand. So the need to make a decision to deepen cuts is important."" On Tuesday, officials indicated they were considering deeper cuts in a bid to lift crude prices.Reuters reported a panel of OPEC and its allies recommended cutting oil output by an extra one million bpd on Tuesday signalling that Russia and Saudi Arabia were moving closer to a deal to prop up prices.Leading into this week's meetings, some experts anticipated the cartel's cut might amount to only 600,000 bpd — a figure that might have underwhelmed the market given current uncertainty.Indeed, things are moving quickly and analysts are trying to understand just how the virus' spread will impact economic activity, especially consumer activity.Denton Cinquegrana, chief oil analyst at the Oil Price Information Service by IHS Markit, said it seems like China may be turning a corner, but the virus is only beginning to impact people in the U.S.""Here, in the United States, you're starting to see a little bit of the panic and spread of the virus start to take place and have an impact on demand,"" he said. ""The demand impact we may not know for really a couple months down the road.""Cinquegrana said if OPEC agreed to just the 600,000 bpd cut, Saudi Arabia may go ""a little bit on their own"" to bring the number closer to one million bpd.""That may be enough to get it back close to the $50-a-barrel level,"" he said. ""But, again, there's some real concerns about demand going forward."" A cut in U.S. interest rates on Tuesday offered only limited support for crude ahead of the OPEC meetings on Thursday and Friday.The price of West Texas Intermediate crude, the North American benchmark, closed up 43 cents at $47.18 US per barrel on Tuesday. Brent crude, the global benchmark, fell four cents a barrel to settle at $51.86 US a barrel.Dwarkin said COVID-19 has made OPEC's work an even heavier lift this week.""But as one former Saudi oil minister said, OPEC is like a teabag,"" Dwarkin added.""It works best when it's plunged into hot water. Well, it's definitely in hot water right now.""  ",-0.008341416813639032,0.4804515443404333

899,Mining ventilation expert says better air flow could clear the air and curb spread of COVID | CBC News,"As store owners continue to open their doors, they're making sure to think about the health and safety of their customers and staff. But an expert in ventilation and public health wants these businesses to also be thinking about air flow in their building. He says small particles of COVID-19 can linger in the air particularly where there is poor ventilation.",2020-07-14T09:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/sudbury/indoor-air-ventilation-covid19-1.5648186,"As store owners continue to open their doors, they're making sure to think about the health and safety of their customers and staff.Of course physical distancing measures are still in place, and many communities, like Sudbury, have made face coverings a required accessory for indoor public spaces.But a Sudbury physicist who develops ventilation systems for the mining industry, feels we need to take more than just physical distancing into consideration when we're indoors.Daniel Cluff is the CEO of CanMIND Associates, which develops ventilation systems for the mining industry. He even worked on the first clean room underground for the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory (SNOlab).Cluff feels that physical distancing is important with COVID-19 to ensure droplets or large particles of the virus, from an infected person, fall to the floor instead of passing on to someone else.He admits he's not a medical expert but he's been following much of the research on ventilation systems connected to COVID-19.He thinks it's possible that smaller particles could continue to linger, suspended in the air, long after the large particles have fallen.""Eventually they might even hit the roof, depending on if there's a little bit of turbulence. As time goes by these [small particles] will build up.""In order to clear these built-up particles from the air within indoor public spaces, Cluff says proper ventilation is essential.But he says there is a danger if the air flow speeds up or blows too quickly.""The more the air is moving the more the larger particles can get entrained in the air, then it has the reverse effect. It's actually more dangerous because now you've got all the big particles flying around. They could splash you in the face, get in your eye.""He suggests a fine balance of air changing, called laminar flow.Paul Bozek is a professor in the Occupational and Environmental Health Division with the Dalla Lana School of Public Health at the University of Toronto. He teaches about ventilation to students pursuing a career in public health.He says the risk is low of contracting the virus through small particles in the air. But it's not impossible. If air flow is closed off in a space, then anyone spending a long time in that space could be affected. ""It's not just distance when you're talking about living or working or shopping indoors. Time and ventilation can affect your risk of being infected,"" Bozek said.""For a well ventilated space where you're keeping your physical distance and you're minimizing your time, it's not a risk."" He adds the same goes for just momentarily passing through a poorly ventilated space.Bozek cites one instance where individuals contracted COVID-19 at a restaurant in Guangzhou, China.A cluster of COVID-19 developed after several groups of patrons had been eating at tables which were far enough apart for physical distancing. It was the air conditioning unit that turned out to be the culprit.To improve ventilation, Bozek suggests letting some outdoor air in to help dilute any indoor air that could have lingering particles of COVID-19.Bozek says he's rather disappointed with what the provincial government has offered up for ventilation directives on its website for businesses that are looking to reopen. It simply says to ""Open doors and windows to let in more fresh air.""In an email to CBC News, Public Health Ontario (PHO) offered general advice on ventilation in indoor and general public settings, such as increasing outdoor air ventilation, maintaining air handling systems and possibly running them longer, and increasing air flows with portable fans and air conditioning.PHO also added that reducing the risk of infection also means following current public health guidance, like physical distancing, and using a non-medical face mask while in indoor public spaces.",0.06811224489795918,0.39024313429075336
925,"Nearly half of coronavirus-related tweets are sent by bots, research finds | CBC Radio","Twitter bots are spreading misinformation and fake news about the coronavirus as rapidly as the pandemic has infected the world, U.S. researchers have found.",2020-05-22T21:16:26.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/radio/asithappens/as-it-happens-thursday-edition-1.5578885/nearly-half-of-coronavirus-related-tweets-are-sent-by-bots-research-finds-1.5580610,"Twitter bots are spreading misinformation and fake news about the coronavirus as rapidly as the pandemic has infected the world, U.S. researchers have found. Kathleen Carley, professor of computer science at Carnegie Mellon University in Pennsylvania, said that out of the more than 200 million coronavirus-related tweets her team analyzed, 45 per cent were sent by bots.""It's definitely not what we expected,"" Carley told As It Happens host Carol Off.Typically, she says about five to 25 per cent of tweets are posted by bots and the study's results are ""way higher than we ever thought to see.""  The research found that of the top 50 influential retweeters, 82 per cent are bots. And out of the top 1,000 retweeters, 62 per cent are bots.Bots are small, automated computer programs that are able to perform a number of simple functions over the internet. Carley says they can engage in conversations, repeat back common phrases, or rebroadcast the same message over and over.""All they're doing is retweeting messages by other groups or by other individuals,"" she said.""For example, around the state media accounts for Russia and China, 95 per cent of the top three tweeters are bots. They're just retweeting those accounts.""Carley said the majority of messages that were being retweeted from these accounts were about what these governments were doing with respect to handling COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. While a large amount of the activity was coming from these two governments, a surprising surge in U.S.-based, or ""homegrown,"" bots has also been flooding the platform, especially as the debate around reopening the American economy was heating up, she said. ""There's conservative bots who are arguing against liberals. There are liberal bots arguing against conservatives. It's across the spectrum.""Other types of messages these bots were pushing included calling on people to donate money to certain organizations, or just simply introducing certain people to each other by mentioning them, she said. However, disinformation around coronavirus was not being generated by the bots, but instead was being created on different websites and blogs, then being tweeted out by bots.""They're often part of the support mechanism for spreading disinformation, but they're not the originators of it,"" Carley said. ""Not only are 45 per cent of the actors bots, [but] they're in very strategic positions in the network so they're actually often responsible for things that end up trending,"" she said. The team used a combination of ""artificial intelligence and social networks"" to analyze different factors about each of the messages. These included who the user was, what their online behaviour was like and how the tweet was written, she said. Carley says mismatches between the timing of multiple tweets sent by the same actor, the location of the messages, as well as the content, language and use of typos all gave some clues as to if it had been posted by a real person or a piece of computer script.    Carley says the pandemic is ""very ripe"" for exploitation because the crisis is global, and ""information is spreading from one country to another, which means that it's a perfect opportunity for different nation states to position themselves using these bots to [spread] their messages."" The pandemic is also affecting so many people and causing so much desperation that it's created the right conditions to conduct fraud by using bots, she said.  ""All of those factors combined to make this a very good nexus.""Written by Adam Jacobson.

929,"Markets up sharply, rebounding from 7-day, coronavirus-driven decline | CBC News","Stocks rose sharply on Wall Street Monday, clawing back some of the losses they took in a seven-day rout brought on by worries that the coronavirus outbreak will stunt the global economy.",2020-03-02T15:31:18.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/markets-virus-concerns-1.5482163,"Stocks rose sharply on Wall Street Monday, clawing back some of the losses they took in a seven-day rout brought on by worries that the coronavirus outbreak will stunt the global economy.The Dow Jones Industrial Average surged more than 700 points, while the benchmark S&P 500 climbed 2.3 per cent, placing in on track for its best day since January 2019. The S&P 500 is coming off a weekly loss of 11.5 per cent, its worst since October 2008 during the global financial crisis.Despite the pickup in stocks, the bond market signalled that investors are still worried. Bond prices climbed, pushing yields to more record lows. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 1.08 per cent from 1.12 per cent late Friday. Gold, another traditional safe-haven asset, rose 1.7 per cent.The big bounce in stocks came after an especially wild day of trading on Friday in which the Dow sank more than 1,000 points before a late wave of buying left it down 350.Investors are increasingly anticipating that the Federal Reserve and other major central banks around the world will lower interest rates or take other steps to shield the global economy from the effects of the outbreak.""Investors have convinced themselves that global central banks will likely be even more accommodative in order to short-circuit any psychological damage,"" said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA.The Dow climbed 1,293.96 points, or 5.09 per cent, to 26,703.32 by market close. The S&P 500 index rose 4.6 per cent and the Nasdaq gained 4.49 per cent. European benchmarks were mostly higher, and Asian markets rose broadly. Canada's main stock index, the S&P/TSX Composite Index, dipped at opening but was up 290.21, or 1.8 per cent, to 16,553.26 by day's end.The International Monetary Fund and World Bank announced simultaneously Monday that they are ready to help countries affected by the coronavirus through their emergency lending programs and other tools.""We will use our available instruments to the fullest extent possible,"" the IMF managing director, Kristalina Georgieva, and World Bank President David Malpass said in a joint statement. ""International co-operation is essential.""The statement echoed similar promises to act if necessary from the Federal Reserve on Friday and the Bank of Japan over the weekend. Some analysts now speculate that the Fed could cut rates sometime this week, before its next formal meeting March 17-18. Traders have priced in a 100 per cent probability that the Fed will cut rates by a half-percentage point during or before its March meeting.There were signs that the economic impact was continuing to mount. A measure of China's manufacturing output plunged last month to its lowest level on record, as the viral outbreak closed factories and disrupted supply chains.Separately, economists at Goldman Sachs slashed their forecasts for U.S. growth to just 0.9 per cent in the first quarter and to zero for the April-June quarter.The Organization for Economic Development, a research organization made up of mostly advanced economies, cut its world growth forecast in a report Monday. The OECD said that even if there are only limited outbreaks outside China, the global economy will grow just 2.4 per cent this year, the weakest since the financial crisis in 2009. That forecast matches several private estimates.If other countries are hit with outbreaks similar to China's, growth could fall as low as 1.5 per cent, the OECD said.For investors, the great amount of uncertainty over how consumer behaviour and spending will be affected has been unsettling.""It's not a typical economic blow,"" said Bill Strazzullo of Bell Curve Trading. ""What if major cities are on some kind of a lockdown? What will that do to restaurants, entertainment, shopping, travel? It's almost impossible to game this out.""Last week's rout knocked every major index into what market watchers call a ""correction,"" or a fall of 10 per cent or more from a peak. Market watchers have said for months that stocks were overpriced and long overdue for another pullback. The last time the market had a drop of that size was in late 2018, when the trade war with China was escalating and investors were worried about rising interest rates.The virus outbreak that began in central China has been shutting down industrial centres, emptying shops and severely crimping travel all over the world. More companies are warning investors that their finances will take a hit because of disruptions to supply chains and sales.As fear over the coronavirus' spread hits consumers, shoppers stocking up on everyday goods helped lift shares in household goods companies. Costco jumped 8.1 per cent. Walmart rose 6 per cent. Procter & Gamble gained 3.5 per cent.Stocks in travel-related companies have been among the hardest-hit as the outbreak has led to cancelled flights and disrupted vacation plans. Cruise operators continued to pile up losses Monday. Royal Caribbean Cruises fell 2.5 per cent, Norwegian Cruise Line dropped eight per cent and Carnival fell 4.7 per cent.Technology and health-care stocks accounted for a big share of the gains. Apple climbed 5.9 per cent and Gilead Sciences rose 6.4 per cent. The biotechnology company has been testing one of its drugs as a potential treatment for the coronavirus.Given that the main economic impact so far of the virus outbreak is on the supply side of economies rather than on the demand side, questions are being asked as to whether looser monetary policy will have any meaningful impact.""For all the talk of lower rates the one thing a rate cut can't do is get people back to work and supply chains back running again,"" said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets.Stimulus hopes nevertheless helped shore up markets in Asia earlier. The Nikkei 225 index closed 1 per cent higher, while the Shanghai Composite index rose 3.2 per cent. The benchmark for the smaller exchange, in Shenzhen, jumped 3.8 per cent, while South Korea's Kospi climbed 0.8 per cent. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong climbed 0.6 per cent.China has seen most of the 90,000 or so virus cases worldwide. In the United States, authorities have counted at least 80 cases of the virus, two fatal, and concern was driving some to wipe store shelves clean of bottled water, hand sanitizer and other necessities. Both deaths were men with existing health problems who were hospitalized in Washington state.Oil prices have also slumped as traders price in the prospect of lower demand as a result of the virus outbreak. Last week, oil prices tanked by around 15 per cent. On Monday, benchmark U.S. crude was up $2.07 to $46.83 per barrel. Brent, the international standard, rose $2.28 to $51.95.",0.0838125187181791,0.4132056753519019
934,What would a U.S. ban on Chinese-owned app TikTok mean? | CBC News,"U.S. President Donald Trump says he wants to take action to ban TikTok, a popular Chinese-owned video app that has been a source of national security and censorship concerns.",2020-08-01T21:08:51.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/tiktok-ban-chinese-trump-1.5671958,"U.S. President Donald Trump says he wants to take action to ban TikTok, a popular Chinese-owned video app that has been a source of national security and censorship concerns.The threat comes as Microsoft Corp. is in advanced talks to buy the Chinese app, owned by ByteDance Ltd., according to a person familiar with the discussions who spoke only on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity to the negotiations. Microsoft declined to comment.It's not clear whether Trump would accept a divestment as a concession.But there have been reports of U.S. tech giants and financial firms being interested in buying or investing in TikTok as the Trump administration sets its sights on the app.Questions and answers about what's at stake:ByteDance launched TikTok in 2017 before buying Musical.ly — a video service popular with teens in Canada, the U.S. and Europe — and combined the two. A twin service, Douyin, is available for Chinese users.TikTok's fun, goofy videos and ease of use have made it immensely popular, and U.S. tech giants like Facebook and Snapchat see it as a competitive threat.It has said it has tens of millions of users in the U.S. and hundreds of millions globally. But TikTok has also been a way that millions of people have built careers and made a living.The app would be pulled from the app store of Apple and Google and not function unless used by a virtual private network, experts say.A message to the TikTok community. <a href=""https://t.co/UD3TR2HfEf"">pic.twitter.com/UD3TR2HfEf</a>Experts believe that while the ban may seem legitimate, it likely won't come to that, given the pressure by ByteDance to sell its stake and any control of TikTok to a U.S. company or completely spin off, said Ben Bajarin of Creative Strategies, an industry analysis and market research firm based in San Jose, Calif.""I think a total spinoff or U.S. tech firm acquisition is the likely scenario here so it can keep operating,"" he said.Many are trying to move followers to other platforms like YouTube and Triller, an entertainment platform built for creators. Some are trying to monetize through sites like Patreon, a crowdfunding platform for artists, musicians and other creators, said Amber Atherton, CEO at Zyper, a community marketing platform that connects brands with the top one per cent of their superfans.Atherton said teens will continue to access TikTok anyway through a virtual private network in the same way that teens access Instagram in China. But she said teenagers are devastated about a ban, since TikTok is about everyday people where users can discover product demos and other information.Industry officials say that any ban could invoke some retaliation from China against U.S. businesses.""It could make many companies wary of the U.S. government's capricious decisions, which leads to instability and uncertainty, "" said Sucharita Kodali, an analyst at Forrester Research, an e-commerce research firm.""Investors then opt to park capital in more stable, predictable environments. Something of this nature is relatively uncommon. Usually, it happens when there are sanctions or other major political action.""",0.11831395348837204,0.4757751937984497

975,OPINION | Opinion: White House pressure for more Iran sanctions is isolating U.S. on international stage | CBC News,"Atrophy of U.S. political and moral authority presents Ottawa with a serious foreign policy challenge, writes Sam Khanlari.",2020-09-18T08:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/opinion/opinion-united-states-iran-nuclear-deal-1.5727821,"This column is an opinion by Sam Khanlari, a Toronto-based writer and editor. For more information about CBC's Opinion section, please see the FAQ.The announcement of a nuclear accord between Iran and several world powers five years ago signalled the opening of a new chapter of relations between Tehran and the West. After more than a decade of impasse over Iran's nuclear program, the historic diplomatic agreement would ensure Tehran never obtained atomic weapons, and in exchange Iran's economy would be gradually re-integrated into the global financial system.Fast forward to today, and despite the best efforts of the Trump administration, the deal clings to life. Although Iran has been largely deprived of the economic benefits within the agreement, the United States is the one isolated on the international stage after its repeated attempts at sabotaging the deal.Last month, the United Nations Security Council roundly dismissed a U.S.-tabled resolution to extend an expiring arms embargo on Tehran. The motion represented the Trump administration's latest salvo to discredit the 2015 accord; the first one came when Donald Trump withdrew from the deal in May 2018.The stage is now set for a showdown at the UN, as the United States pushes the Security Council — the body charged with ensuring international peace and security — into uncharted territory. U.S officials have vowed to penalize any country or entity that defies their call for sanctions to be reimposed on Tehran.The remaining members of the deal (Britain, China, France, Germany, Iran, and Russia) contend that the U.S. is no longer a participant, and therefore not in a position to alter the agreement's terms. Despite the difficulties posed by the U.S. withdrawal, they remain committed to the deal and have reportedly urged other nations to simply ignore the U.S. ultimatum.Another arena for this geopolitical standoff is a Canadian courthouse, where the United States is seeking the extradition of Meng Wanzhou, Huawei's chief financial officer, following her 2018 arrest at a Vancouver airport on charges of violating U.S. sanctions on Iran. After withdrawing from the nuclear deal in 2018, the U.S. simply reinstated its previous sanctions, which allegedly contributed to Wanzhou's arrest.At the heart of the extradition case lies what some say is the biggest strategic issue currently facing Canada's leaders, who are left in ""a no-win position"" picking sides between China and the United States.For its part, Ottawa does not have an Iran policy of its own.Most Canadians' understanding of contemporary Iran is inextricably linked to the revolution in 1979 and the seizure of the U.S. embassy in Tehran. Cinematic adaptations provide reminders of Ottawa's involvement. This legacy, coupled with a supposed paucity of Canadian interests in the region, has helped limit discussion of Canada's foreign policy toward Iran to cautious engagement, complete isolation, or support for wholesale regime change.As a result, Canadian politicians have often echoed their American counterparts' calls to delegitimize Iran's government. In 2012, Prime Minister Stephen Harper abruptly severed all relations with Tehran and enacted unprecedented legislation allowing for the seizure of Iranian state assets. ""It's no coincidence that we closed the embassy basically the day after the legislation became effective,"" Dennis Horack, a retired Canadian diplomat, said in 2018.Justin Trudeau campaigned on a pledge to restore diplomatic relations with Tehran in 2015, but his government is no longer committed to it.Meanwhile, the U.S. currently enforces some 8,000 sanctions across 30 countries and territories. But not only have sanctions largely failed to achieve their stated policy goals, their impact on the health and welfare of local populations has been extensive. Even in the midst of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, the White House has responded to calls for the U.S. to temporarily alleviate the impact of sanctions on Iranians by announcing additional ones.In addition to continuing the <a href=""https://twitter.com/UN?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">@UN</a> arms embargo, the UN sanctions we are restoring on Iran will also re-impose accountability for other forms of Iranian malign activity that the authors of the nuclear deal foolishly downplayed. <a href=""https://t.co/VV9Rhkol40"">pic.twitter.com/VV9Rhkol40</a>As The Economist put it, ""America is uniquely well positioned to use financial warfare in the service of foreign policy."" Banks in Europe and Asia may be an ocean away, but the plumbing of international finance runs through U.S territory. And by leveraging its leading financial position, Washington has, according to the Boston Review, ""effectively conscripted the worldwide banking system to enforce a punitive foreign policy that is actively opposed by most of the world's nations.""The split over the Iran nuclear deal and fear of U.S. penalties is having an impact on financial ties with traditional European allies.Mark Carney, former governor of the Bank of England, recently proposed the formation of a global digital currency to ""dampen the domineering influence of the U.S. dollar on global trade.""And in a speech last year, French President Emmanuel Macron recognized this ongoing ""geopolitical and strategic reconfiguration,"" and added that, ""I am not saying that we need to fight the dollar, but we need to build real economic and financial sovereignty.""With nationalism on the rise, faith in many multilateral institutions developed in the postwar period is foundering. The UN Security Council has slowly morphed into a battleground rather than ""a body that delivers effective management of peace and security challenges."" There is growing interest in an alternative global payment system with the potential to help targeted countries skirt U.S. sanctions. There are varied predictions of the rise of civilization-states as ideological counterweights to Western liberal democracy, as the world economy enters an ""Asian century.""In a major foreign policy speech just before the coronavirus pandemic, Canada's Minister of Foreign Affairs Francois-Phillipe Champagne highlighted some of the challenges associated with ""the emergence of a multipolar world with new epicentres of influence and competition over ideas and models of governance.""A change in U.S. leadership next year would not reverse the currents driving these changes.In tandem with the pandemic, these trends have, according to Roland Paris, an international affairs expert who has advised the federal government, ""accelerated geopolitical shifts that show no sign of dissipating — and some of them jeopardize Canadian interests in ways that may be unfamiliar to a country long used to a more benign international environment.""By virtue of geography, Ottawa has held a favourable position alongside the world's superpower. As Paris noted recently, however, Canadian foreign policy has long been characterized by complacency, and the current moment necessitates ""not only new policy approaches, but also different ways of doing foreign policy.""The atrophy of America's political and moral authority presents Ottawa with its most serious foreign policy challenge since the end of World War II. This leaves Canada and its European allies tasked with upholding — and ultimately reforming — the multilateral institutions that have animated the policies of Western countries for more than half a century.Meanwhile, President Trump's destructive policies on Iran abuse this old world order and hasten the rise of a new one.",0.05773438163144046,0.29324548001018585

A portable morgue was set up.At least 57 bodies were recovered, health department officials said, and Pakistan International Airlines chairman Arshad Malik said finding all the dead could take two to three days.At least two people aboard survived, according to the Sindh provincial health department, revising an earlier statement that three were alive.The news from Pakistan this morning is devastating.

Prayers & condolences go to families of the deceased.""World leaders expressed condolences, including Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.Global Affairs Canada said it was not aware of any Canadian citizens affected by the crash.The pilot of Pakistan International Airlines Flight 8303 was heard transmitting a mayday to the tower shortly before the crash of the Airbus A320, which was flying from Lahore to Karachi. Video on social media appeared to show the jet flying low over a residential area with flames shooting from one of its engines.The plane came to rest at about 2:39 p.m. local time between houses smashed by its wings in a narrow alley in the poor and congested residential area known as Model Colony. Police in protective masks struggled to clear away crowds amid the smoke and dust so ambulances and fire trucks could get through.Pakistan had resumed domestic flights earlier this week ahead of the Eid-al Fitr holiday marking the end of the Islamic fasting month of Ramadan. Pakistan has been in a countrywide lockdown since mid-March because of the coronavirus, with Southern Sindh, where Karachi is the capital, the epicentre of virus infections.WATCH | Pakistan International Airlines plane crashes in Karachi, Pakistan:WorldA transmission of the pilot's final exchange with air traffic control, posted on the website LiveATC.net, indicated he had failed to land and was circling around to make another attempt.""We are proceeding direct, sir — we have lost engine,"" a pilot said.""Confirm your attempt on belly,"" the air traffic controller said, offering a runway.""Sir — mayday, mayday, mayday, mayday Pakistan 8303,"" the pilot said before the transmission ended.Witnesses said the Airbus A320 appeared to attempt to land two or three times before crashing in a residential area near Jinnah International Airport.A resident of the area, Abdul Rahman, said he saw the aircraft circle at least three times, appearing to try to land before it crashed into several houses.Pakistan officials said the plane had 91 passengers and seven crew members on board, revising earlier statements from airport officials. The airport in Lahore, where the Pakistan International Airlines flight originated on Friday, initially said there were 107 people on board. A spokesperson for Pakistan's civil aviation authority attributed the discrepancy to confusion in the tense aftermath of the crash.In a statement issued Friday, Airbus said its ""thoughts are with those affected"" by the crash and confirmed it is ""providing assistance to the investigation."" We regret to confirm that an A320 operated by Pakistan International Airlines was involved in an accident during flight <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/PK8303?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#PK8303</a> from Lahore to Karachi on May, 22 2020.

It said, ""The aircraft is fully airworthy and meets all the safety"" standards.Ownership records for the Airbus A320 showed China Eastern Airlines flew the plane from 2004 until 2014. The plane then entered PIA's fleet, leased from GE Capital Aviation Services.Perry Bradley, a spokesperson for GE, said the firm was ""aware of reports of the accident and is closely monitoring the situation.""The plane had logged 47,100 flight hours and 25,860 flights before Friday, according to figures from Airbus.",-0.11351851851851856,0.3570370370370371
