"As Canadians sour on China, an ambassador changes his tone | CBC News","Dominic Barton, Canada's ambassador to China, made his first appearance at the China committee this week since before the pandemic hit Canada. He was noticeably less forgiving of Beijing and less bullish on business opportunities than last time — perhaps reflecting a turn against China in public opinion.",2020-12-10T09:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/china-kovrig-spavor-dominic-barton-1.5835036,"Today marks two years since the two Michaels were detained by China.It's also been ten long pandemic months since Canada's ambassador to Beijing, Dominic Barton, made his previous appearance before the Commons subcommittee on Canada-China relations. Tuesday's second round of that hearing showed how much the mood around China has changed during 2020. Barton appeared conscious of the need to make some repairs to the impression he left in February, when his testimony drew unusually direct criticism from former diplomats with experience working in China.Back then, Barton suggested that it was incumbent upon Canadians to recognize that ""China values unity and the needs of society at large, rather than freedom of individual choice ... we just have to understand that.""Former diplomat and China expert Charles Burton told the subcommittee that Barton's words parroted Communist Party propaganda asserting that Chinese culture is inherently averse to liberty and democracy — when in fact the aversion comes from Xi Jinping's Politburo.Watch: Trudeau says government will examine all options to bring Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig.:Politics NewsIn his Tuesday appearance, however, Barton opened with remarks on ""our efforts to promote rights and freedoms in China.""""We are concerned by the decline of civil and political rights in China,"" he told MPs.Barton began his appearance with a lengthy description of a recent visit to the Tibet Autonomous Region, which he toured in a party of foreign diplomats. It was one of two closely-supervised Tibetan tours put on for mostly western diplomats this year, a sign that the Communist Party — bravado notwithstanding — still cares about what western countries say regarding its human rights record.It may also have been an attempt to switch foreign attention to Tibet from the even more problematic neighbouring region of Xinjiang, where China's heavy-handed persecution of the Muslim Uighur people is opening new fronts for confrontation with the West.Barton said that he had consulted with pro-Tibet groups and academics in Canada before accepting the trip, which he said he undertook partly to show Tibetans the world was still concerned about their plight.In addition to discussing what he'd seen on the tour — which took in a school, a monastery and greenhouses — Barton also talked about the motives of the Communist Party in allowing the trip. He said he understood that ""what I saw was not the complete picture on any issue"" and described one effort to escape his minders — when he left his hotel at 5 a.m. for an unaccompanied stroll through the streets of Lhasa.Barton once famously described himself as ""a bull on China"" and his entire pre-diplomatic career was built on viewing China primarily as a business opportunity.During his last committee appearance, Barton told members he ""would love to talk more about promoting trade and investment. I probably should shut up and move on, but I'm very excited by the opportunity we have on many fronts.""This time, he took his own advice and left out the economic boosterism — suggesting that the ambassador had not only learned to read the room but perhaps understood how the ground had shifted under him.""Countries all around the world are evolving their approach to China,"" he told the subcommittee Tuesday night. That's certainly true in Europe, where both public attitudes and government approaches to China have become considerably tougher over the course of 2020. Shachi Kurl of the Angus Reid Institute said Barton's changed tone also reflects new realities at home.""This isn't just about Canada and Ambassador Barton aligning with the Western consensus,"" she told CBC's Power and Politics. ""It really is about aligning with the Canadian consensus, because for several years we have seen a deterioration, and then a deterioration, and then a further deterioration in Canadian views of the Beijing regime.""Opinion polls do show a crashing decline in China's standing in Canadian public opinion, reaching what Kurl calls ""an all-time low"" as 2020 draws to a close.""You now find among the Canadian population a bloody-mindedness that says, 'You know what? This is not OK,'"" she said. ""This is about more than the human rights situation, this is about more than events in Hong Kong. What has really viscerally affected Canadians is the kidnapping of the two Michaels.""Obviously, the detention of Kovrig and Spavor was always intended by Beijing to be a pressure tactic — not a play for hearts and minds. But it hasn't worked as a pressure tactic and has instead backfired disastrously upon China's public image.Would the CCP judge the strategy wise in hindsight, or consider it a failure? Either way, the need to save face makes it hard for the Communist Party — famously averse to backing down on anything — to alter its course now.During his committee appearance, Barton praised the two Canadians for their resilience, which he said was an inspiration to him.Barton was eager to mend fences when asked about another Canadian detainee: Huseyin Celil, a Uighur rights activist from Burlington, Ont. who was snatched on behalf of Chinese authorities while visiting Uzbekistan 14 years ago, whisked across the border and given a life sentence.When asked about the case in February, Barton said he had not been able to visit Celil because Celil was not a Canadian citizen. Once again, he was echoing a view espoused by the government of China, which has refused to recognize the fact that Celil has been a Canadian citizen since 2001. Foreign Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne was forced to correct the record in the House of Commons a few days after Barton's misstatement.Two former ambassadors to China condemned Barton's mischaracterization of Celil. ""China doesn't get to determine who is or becomes a Canadian citizen,"" said David Mulroney, who represented Canada in Beijing from 2009 to 2012.This time, Barton described the steps he had taken to reach out to the Celil family in the wake of that embarrassing incident.There is still no sign of progress in Celil's case, however. His detention differs from that of Kovrig and Spavor in that Celil was not seized as a bargaining chip to pressure Canada, and his case predates the Huawei dispute.Instead, Celil's detention intersects with another issue that has raised tensions between China and Canada — one that also came up in one of the tenser moments in this week's meeting between Barton and MPs.Conservative MP Garnett Genuis pressed Barton to make a clear statement on China's suppression of its Uighur minority, who are concentrated in the far western Xinjiang region.He read out the recent words of the Trudeau government's newish ambassador to the UN, Bob Rae, who told CBC News ""there's no question that there's aspects of what the Chinese are doing that fits into the definition of genocide in the genocide convention."" Did Barton agree with that statement? The ambassador refused to be pinned down, saying that while the situation was ""very, very concerning,"" more reports from the area were needed.Rights activists are particularly suspicious of Barton on this file because the company he headed, McKinsey, earned a reputation for indifference to Uighur suffering while eagerly promoting the Chinese government's economic plans for their homeland.The company defended itself but faced harsh criticism — even from the traditional business press.""I think we need to see the reports,"" Barton said. ""I haven't talked to Ambassador Rae about the particular evidence he has on that side.""""We need to have independent people on the ground who can go wherever they want"" in Xinjiang in order to determine what's happening, he added. Genuis was skeptical. ""We'd love to get access,"" he said. ""I think there's realities in terms of whether that's ever going to be given.""""Is Mr. Rae's statement consistent with the government's policy, or is yours?"" Genuis asked.Barton minimized the gap between the two, arguing that Rae was also seeking more investigation. A noticeable difference remained, however, in how the two men described the situation."

"China's Sinopharm vaccine 86% effective, say United Arab Emirates officials | CBC News","The United Arab Emirates said Wednesday a Chinese coronavirus vaccine tested in the federation of sheikdoms is 86 per cent effective, in a statement that provided few details but marked the first public release of information on the efficacy of the shot.",2020-12-09T11:57:30.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/vaccine-sinopharm-uae-1.5833823,"The United Arab Emirates said Wednesday a Chinese coronavirus vaccine tested in the federation of sheikdoms is 86 per cent effective, in a statement that provided few details but marked the first public release of information on the efficacy of the shot.The announcement brought yet another shot into the worldwide race for a vaccine to end the pandemic, a scientific effort that has seen China and Russia compete with Western firms for an effective inoculation. While questions remain about the Sinopharm shot, already at least one country outside China plans to roll it out in a mass-vaccination campaign.The U.A.E., home to Dubai and Abu Dhabi, conducted a trial beginning in September of the vaccine by Chinese state-owned pharmaceutical giant Sinopharm involving 31,000 volunteers from 125 nations. Volunteers between 18 and 60 years old received two doses of the vaccine over 28 days.The U.A.E.'s Health and Prevention Ministry announced the results via a statement on the state-run WAM news agency, saying it has ""reviewed Sinopharm CNBG's interim analysis of the Phase III trials.""""The analysis shows no serious safety concerns,"" the statement said, without detailing whether any participant suffered side effects.It wasn't immediately clear if the announced results included only those taking part in the testing in the UAE or if they also include results from China and elsewhere. The statement described the vaccine as receiving ""official registration"" without elaborating on what that meant.Emirati officials and Sinopharm did not respond to questions from The Associated Press.However, calls Wednesday to SEHA, the Abu Dhabi health authority, included an option for individuals to schedule an appointment to receive a ""COVID-19 vaccine."" The centre was swamped with calls following the announcement on the vaccine's efficacy.The Sinopharm vaccine has been approved for emergency use in a few countries and the company is still conducting late-stage clinical trials in 10 countries. Morocco is gearing up for an ambitious COVID-19 vaccination program, aiming to vaccinate 80 per cent of its adults in an operation starting this month that's relying initially on the Sinopharm vaccine.Sinopharm's shot relies on a tested technology, using a killed virus to deliver the vaccine, similar to how polio immunizations are made. Leading Western competitors, like the shot made by Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech, use newer, less-proven technology to target the coronavirus's spike protein using RNA. The United Kingdom already has begun vaccinating people with the Pfizer shot.WATCH | Inside the scramble to mass produce a COVID-19 vaccine:The NationalTop officials in the UAE, including Dubai's ruler, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, have publicly received the shots as part of the vaccine testing.Already, Pfizer reports its shot as being 95 per cent effective, while another RNA candidate from Moderna appears to be 94.5 per cent effective. Results suggest a third vaccine from Oxford University and AstraZeneca is safe and about 70 per cent effective, but questions remain about how well it may help protect those over 55.In transport, Pfizer says its vaccine must be stored in a freezer at –80 C to –60 C or in a thermal container at –90 C to –60 C. The Moderna vaccine must remain at a temperature of –20 C.The Sinopharm vaccine is believed to be able to travel at a temperature of 2 C to 8 C, a major draw for areas of the world where nearly three billion people live without stable electricity and refrigeration. In November, the Communist Party secretary for Sinopharm said almost one million people in China had received its vaccine.Since the pandemic began, the UAE has detected over 178,000 cases of the virus, with 160,000 recoveries and nearly 600 deaths. Its aggressive testing policy has seen over 17 million tests conducted in a country home to just over nine million people."

Hong Kong media publisher Jimmy Lai charged under national security law: reports | CBC News,"Hong Kong democracy activist and media tycoon Jimmy Lai has been charged under the city's national security law on suspicion of colluding with foreign forces and endangering national security, local media reported on Friday, citing unnamed sources.",2020-12-11T07:50:40.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/lai-charged-hongkong-1.5837177,"Hong Kong democracy activist and media tycoon Jimmy Lai, 73, has been charged under the city's national security law on suspicion of colluding with foreign forces, his Apple Daily newspaper reported on Friday, citing a police source.Lai, an ardent critic of Beijing, would be the highest profile person charged under the sweeping new law imposed on the Chinese-ruled city in June.He was due to appear in court on Saturday, according to Apple Daily, a popular tabloid known for its feisty and critical coverage of China and Hong Kong.The security law, which punishes what Beijing broadly defines as secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces with up to life in jail, has been condemned by the West and human rights groups as a tool to crush dissent in the semi-autonomous, Chinese-ruled city.Authorities in Hong Kong and Beijing say it is vital to plug gaping holes in national security defences exposed by months of sometimes violent anti-government and anti-China protests that rocked the global financial hub over the last year.""The goal is to hold Jimmy Lai, and shut Jimmy Lai up,"" Mark Simon, an associate of Lai, told Reuters.Hong Kong police did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The publishing tycoon is one of the financial hub's most prominent democracy activists, while his Next Media group is considered one of the key remaining bastions of media freedoms in Hong Kong.Tensions between China and the United States have escalated in recent weeks as Washington accuses Beijing of using the security law to trample wide-ranging freedoms guaranteed when the former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997.Authorities have intensified a crackdown on opposition forces in the city, dismissing lawmakers from the legislature, conducting widespread arrests and jailing high-profile democracy activists such as Joshua Wong.Lai was denied bail earlier this month following his arrest on a separate charge of fraud related to the lease of a building that houses his Apple Daily, an anti-government tabloid.He was arrested in August when about 200 police officers swooped on his offices. Hong Kong police later said they had arrested nine men and one woman for suspected offences including ""collusion with a foreign country/external elements to endanger national security, conspiracy to defraud"" and others.The tycoon had been a frequent visitor to Washington, where he has met officials, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, to rally support for Hong Kong democracy, prompting Beijing to label him a ""traitor."""

"China angered by U.S. arms sales to Taiwan, threatens sanctions | CBC News","China threatened on Thursday to retaliate against the latest U.S. arms sale to Taiwan, as the island welcomed the weapons package but said it was not looking to get into an arms race with Beijing.",2020-10-22T12:27:25.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/china-response-us-arms-taiwan-1.5772252,"China threatened on Thursday to retaliate against the latest U.S. arms sale to Chinese-claimed Taiwan, as the island welcomed the weapons package but said it was not looking to get into an arms race with Beijing.The Trump administration has ramped up support for Taiwan through arms sales and visits by senior U.S officials, adding to tensions between Beijing and Washington, already heightened by disagreements over the South China Sea, Hong Kong, human rights and trade.Beijing has applied increasing pressure on democratically ruled Taiwan to accept China's sovereignty, including by flying fighter jets across the sensitive mid-line of the Taiwan Strait, which normally serves as an unofficial buffer.Beijing considers Taiwan a wayward province it has vowed to reunite with the mainland, by force if necessary. Washington considers it an important democratic outpost and is required by law to provide it with the means to defend itself.Responding to the U.S. approval of a potential $1.8 billion US arms sale to Taiwan, China's Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said during a daily news briefing that such sales should stop.The sales ""seriously interfere with China's internal affairs, seriously damage China's sovereignty and security interests, send a seriously wrong signal to Taiwan independence forces and severely damage China-U.S. relations and peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait,"" he said.""China will make a legitimate and necessary response according to how the situation develops,"" Zhao added.He did not give details, but China has sanctioned U.S. companies in the past for selling weapons to Taiwan, though it is unclear what form they have taken.In Taipei, Taiwan Defence Minister Yen De-fa thanked the United States and said the weapons were to help Taiwan improve their defensive capabilities to deal with the ""enemy threat and new situation.""""This includes a credible combat capability and asymmetric warfare capabilities to strengthen our determination to defend ourselves,"" he added.""This shows the importance attached by the United States to security in the Indo-Pacific and Taiwan Strait. We will continue to consolidate our security partnership with the United States.""Yen said they were not looking for confrontation.""We will not engage in an arms race with the Chinese Communists. We will put forward requirements and build fully in accordance with the strategic concept of heavy deterrence, defending our position and defensive needs.""Taiwan's armed forces are dwarfed by China's, which are expanding their capability with new weapons like aircraft carriers and stealth fighters.Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen has made defence modernization a priority in the face of a rising Chinese threat, particularly ""asymmetric warfare"" capabilities, which refers to making any Chinese attack difficult and costly, for example with smart mines and portable missiles.Like most countries, Washington has no formal diplomatic ties with Taipei, though it is its strongest global backer. The U.S. has been pushing Taiwan to modernize its military so it can become a ""porcupine"" — that is, hard for China to attack.Among other weapons systems, Wednesday's formal notifications to Congress by the State Department were for 11 truck-based rocket launchers made by Lockheed Martin called a High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS), for an estimated cost of $436.1 million.The notifications also covered 135 AGM-84H Standoff Land Attack Missile Expanded Response (SLAM-ER) Missiles and related equipment made by Boeing for an estimated $1.008 billion, and six MS-110 Recce external sensor pods made by Collins Aerospace for jets, at an estimated cost of $367.2 million.Further congressional notifications are expected to follow, including drones made by General Atomics and land-based Harpoon anti-ship missiles made by Boeing to serve as coastal defence cruise missiles.The U.S. administration has stepped up pressure on Beijing in the run-up to the Nov. 3 U.S. presidential election, in which President Donald Trump has made a tough approach to China a key foreign policy theme.Last week, the U.S. national security adviser, Robert O'Brien, said that while China probably was not ready to invade Taiwan for now, the island needed to ""fortify itself"" against a future attack or any bid to isolate it through non-military means, such as an embargo.Taiwan has been testing new surface-to-surface missiles, which its media says have the ability to strike deep inside China, potentially giving the island the ability to attack far-off Chinese air bases and command centres."

The cubs were sent to China in January and their parents were to remain in Calgary until 2023."

"China, top global emitter, aims to go carbon-neutral by 2060 | CBC News",Chinese President Xi Jinping says his country will aim to stop adding to the global warming problem by 2060.,2020-09-23T13:01:48.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/china-carbon-neutral-1.5735172,"Chinese President Xi Jinping says his country will aim to stop adding to the global warming problem by 2060.Xi's announcement during a speech Tuesday to the UN General Assembly is a significant step for the world's biggest emitter of greenhouse gases.Calling for a ""green revolution,"" Xi said the coronavirus pandemic had shown the need to preserve the environment.""Humankind can no longer afford to ignore the repeated warnings of nature,"" he said.Citing the Paris Agreement that he and former U.S. President Barack Obama helped forge in 2015, Xi said his country would raise its emissions reduction targets with ""vigorous policies and measures.""""We aim to have CO2 emissions peak before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2060,"" he said.The term ""carbon neutrality"" means releasing no additional CO2 into the atmosphere, though technically it allows countries to keep emitting if they ensure that an equal amount is captured again in some form.The announcement was cheered by climate campaigners. Greenpeace executive director Jennifer Morgan called it ""an important signal"" that showed climate change is ""top of agenda for China.""""A big shift for curbing emissions and a significant step forward in international cooperation"" U.N. climate chief Patricia Espinosa said.The goal will be a challenge for China, which relies heavily for its electricity on coal, one of the most carbon-intensive fossil fuels.China released the equivalent of 10 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide, or CO2, into the atmosphere in 2018, according to the Global Carbon Project that tracks emissions worldwide. That was almost twice as much as the United States and three times as much as the European Union.Several other major emitters have set earlier deadlines, with the EU aiming to be carbon neutral by 2050. Frans Timmermans, who leads the EU executive's efforts on climate change, welcomed Xi's announcement.""We need decisive action from every country to keep temperatures under control, tackle climate change and keep our planet inhabitable,"" he said.The United States has so far not set such a goal. President Donald Trump, who once described climate change as a hoax invented by China, has started the process of pulling the U.S. out of the Paris accord.If China fulfills Xi's goal, it could prevent 0.2 to 0.4 C further warming for the world, according to ""very rough estimates"" by MIT management professor John Sterman, who models and tracks emission reductions and pledges with Climate Interactive.But much depends on how they do their emissions reduction and how soon they cut them, he said, adding he has to do a more thorough analysis.""That's a lot,"" Sterman said. ""China's by far the world's big emitter. They're emitting more than the EU and US together.""""It puts a lot more pressure on the United States,"" Sterman said.Perhaps even more important than the carbon neutrality pledge is the effort to peak carbon dioxide emissions before 2030 instead of by 2030, Sterman said. Carbon dioxide's more than 100-year lifetime in the air makes earlier emission cuts more effective than promises in the future, he said.""Emissions that don't happen between now and 2030 are going to reduce warming a lot more than the same emission reductions after 2060,"" Sterman said.However, pledges are not the same as actions. What's needed is signs of action, such as eliminating plans to build new coal-fired power plants, cutting subsidies for coal power and getting off coal entirely, Sterman said. Coal is the biggest carbon dioxide emitter of power sources.Twenty-nine nations before China have pledged to achieve climate neutrality in different years, according to the Carbon Neutrality Coalition. They include Canada.With China, the 30 countries that have some kind of carbon neutrality pledges, account for about 43 per cent of the world's carbon dioxide emissions from the burning of fossil fuels. The largest polluting countries not on the list are the United States, India, Russia, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, South Africa, Turkey, Brazil and Australia."
4 new barges headed for Tuktoyaktuk from China | CBC News,"The COVID-19 pandemic may be delaying deliveries across Canada, but it’s not stopping four new barges from travelling from China to Tuktoyaktuk, N.W.T., this summer.",2020-07-28T17:58:03.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/barges-new-china-tuktoyaktuk-1.5659538,"The COVID-19 pandemic may be delaying deliveries across Canada, but it's not stopping four new barges from travelling from China to Tuktoyaktuk, N.W.T., this summer.Marine Transportation Services (MTS) is expecting the new fleet this August, arriving on a heavy-lift ship from Shanghai.Steve Hagerman, the director of MTS, the N.W.T. government-owned barge company, said the cross-continental delivery would've been noteworthy, even if the country wasn't already in the midst of a pandemic.""That's going to be a one-of-[a-kind] for sure. I don't believe that this will be repeated again,"" said Hagerman.Barges bring critical fuel and other dry goods to Arctic coastal and Mackenzie River communities every summer in both the N.W.T. and Nunavut.Hagermen said these four barges from China Merchants Jinling Shipyard are part of a new series that are made specifically to handle large volumes of fuel products. With the increased capacity, it will allow MTS to decrease the number of deliveries into some communities.An Infrastructure spokesperson said the total budget to design, build and deliver the four barges is $20.7 million; the federal government paid for 75 per cent, and the territorial government covered the other 25 per cent.Hagerman said, so far, organizing the delivery has been going better than he anticipated — despite the shipyard in China shutting down ""for well over a month"" since the height of the pandemic in March.Another concern has been that, like the N.W.T., China has been seeing high water levels, and the country is dealing with severe flooding.""We were really concerned, of course, that we wouldn't be able to get the barges at all this year,"" he said. ""I don't know how they did it, but they fast-tracked and put us right back on schedule.""With the ships coming in during the COVID-19 pandemic, there will be restrictions in place, said an Infrastructure spokesperson in an email Tuesday. Interactions between crew and residents are already restricted for regular community cargo deliveries, with designated drop-off zones. ""For the delivery of the barges from China, the barges will be unloaded by another vessel between 30 and 60 kilometres offshore, depending on weather. There will be no physical interactions or contact between vessels or vessel crews,"" the email said.The crew from China will not leave their vessel, with communication between crews only by radio. The email said MTS staff who are physically involved with attaching the new barges have gone through 14 days of self-isolation, as have the Chinese crew members.Nunakput MLA Jackie Jacobson said the new barges are going to be a big deal for his riding and other Arctic coastal communities.""It just reassures, having new barges in place that are able to carry as much fuel as we need for these communities. Instead of doing two trips a year, they are able to do it all in one,"" said Jacobson.""I'm looking forward to making sure that all my coastal communities are being serviced and I think this is a big step for our government working with the coastal communities.""""We haven't seen any big boats since last year, so it will be good to see,"" said Jacobson.Hagerman, with MTS, said the heavy-lift ship is slated to head overseas with the barges on July 28.It should arrive about 14 days later, depending on the weather.Hagerman said the new vessels won't be replacing any current barges, and although these vessels are generally used on the ocean, they can also be used on rivers."

China sentences 4th Canadian to death on drug charges in 2 years | CBC News,China has sentenced a fourth Canadian citizen to death on drug charges in less than two years following a sharp downturn in ties over the arrest of an executive of Chinese tech giant Huawei.,2020-08-07T08:07:28.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/canadian-death-sentence-china-1.5677675,"China has sentenced a fourth Canadian citizen to death on drug charges in less than two years following a sharp downturn in relations over the arrest of an executive of Chinese tech giant Huawei.Ye Jianhui was sentenced Friday by the Foshan Municipal Intermediate Court in the southern province of Guangdong. Ye had been found guilty of manufacturing and transporting drugs, the court said in a brief statement.Another suspect in the case was also given the death penalty and four others sentenced to between seven years and life in prison. Death sentences are automatically referred to China's highest court for review.Ties between Canada and China have soured over Canada's late 2018 arrest of Meng Wanzhou, a company executive and the daughter of Huawei's founder, at Vancouver's airport in at the request of the U.S., which wants her extradited to face fraud charges over the company's dealings with Iran.Her arrest angered Beijing, which calls it a political move aimed at constraining China's rise as a global technology power.Ye's sentencing comes a day after fellow Canadian Xu Weihong was given the death penalty by the Guangzhou Municipal Intermediate Court, also in Guandong province. Convicted Canadian drug smuggler Robert Schellenberg was sentenced to death in a sudden retrial shortly after Meng's arrest, and a Canadian citizen identified as Fan Wei was given the death penalty in April 2019 for his role in a multinational drug smuggling case.In apparent retaliation, China also detained former Canadian diplomat Michael Kovrig and Canadian entrepreneur Michael Spavor weeks after Meng's arrest, accusing them of vague national security crimes.Foreign Affairs Minister François-Philippe Champagne, reacting Thursday to news of Xu's sentence, said Ottawa was profoundly concerned.""We oppose the death penalty at every step of the way,"" Champagne said in an interview on CBC's Power and Politics. ""We have said it time and time and time again to the Chinese government and will continue to do that.""Champagne said Canada is trying to build an international coalition of nations to advocate against the arbitrary detention of foreign nationals and for consular access when they are detained."

Canada building its own PPE network in China | CBC News,When Cargojet flight 1392 touched down in Hamilton on Saturday it brought with it millions of badly needed N95 respirator masks to help in the fight against COVID-19.,2020-04-13T08:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canada-building-own-ppe-supply-chain-in-china-1.5530259,"Note: This story was updated with new information on April 16, 2020.When Cargojet flight 1392 touched down in Hamilton on Saturday it brought with it millions of badly needed N95 respirator masks to help in the fight against COVID-19.The Boeing 767 was the third delivery of critical supplies arriving under a made-for-Canada plan set up with the help of diplomats and consultants in China, a warehouse in Shanghai, and two of Canada's airlines.The plan was born out of urgency. With the global market for medical supplies overwhelmed by chaos and acts of piracy, Canada needed to take some of the risk out of securing everything from badly needed medical masks to gowns to gloves. Federal bureaucrats and political staff handling procurement of medical supplies were frustrated by deliveries showing up late. Unreliable and profiteering brokers were driving prices through the roof. Rival countries were buying shipments out from under each other.Yesterday, we received our third shipment of supplies needed to help our front-line healthcare workers protect themselves and continue caring for Canadians. The shipment contained millions of N95 respirators.There are even stories circulating of unnamed countries sending government planes to China — ferrying suitcases stuffed with cash — to buy supplies right on the tarmac or at the factory door.""It is really a Wild West when it comes to buying medical supplies right now,"" Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland told reporters on April 6.That intense global competition comes as health professionals in Canada warn of extreme shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE) that they say is putting the lives of front-line workers at risk. Some staff have even walked off the job because of a lack of protective gear.What Canada hopes will be a partial solution got its start in the embassy in Beijing.Dominic Barton, Canada's ambassador to China, may be new to the world of diplomacy, but the former managing director of the management consulting firm McKinsey brings a deep understanding of the Chinese economy to his role. Prior to his ambassadorship, Barton also sat on the advisory board of the state-run China Development Bank. His experience is being put to use in the global bidding wars for medical supplies. ""We're lucky we have Barton,"" said a federal official working directly on the procurement efforts. ""He's a business person first. He has good links into China, gets China, gets Chinese business.""Barton redeployed much of the staff at Canada's embassy, consulates and trade offices all over China. The diplomatic staff flipped their role from selling Canada to the Chinese, to buying Chinese medical supplies for Canada.""We have engaged our embassy on the ground in efforts to ensure that our orders are delivered on schedule and those parties are also identifying new opportunities for us,"" Public Services and Procurement Minister Anita Anand said on April 7.  But Canada's diplomats lacked an intimate knowledge of China's medical manufacturing sector and supply chains. So Canada hired a multi-national management consulting firm to help officials navigate what had suddenly become the world's most competitive industry. Federal officials would not initially confirm the name of the consulting firm because of the sensitive nature of these operations, but a source with direct knowledge of the arrangement said it was not Barton's old firm McKinsey. The unnamed consulting firm is helping Canada identify which factories are more reliable in terms of delivering quality goods that will meet Canadian standards. Stories have been surfacing around the world of sub-par masks and other defective supplies arriving from China only to be sent back or thrown out.Public Services and Procurement Minister Anita confirmed April 16 that Deloitte Canada will provide assistance on transportation, receiving, storage services and customs clearances.Members of the Chinese diaspora in Canada are also using their business connections to help federal and provincial governments secure reliable supplies. Canada's plan helps. But it isn't foolproof. The Toronto Star reported that Canada recently received a shipment of badly needed testing swabs only to find they were contaminated with what is believed to be mould. ""Cutting deals and securing quality supplies quickly is probably the biggest challenge in this entire thing,"" said the official working on procurement. There is also the challenge of ensuring that what Canada orders actually arrives. Barton may know business and the consultants may know the supply chains, but none of that guarantees medical supplies actually make it to Canada. ""Ordering of course does not guarantee a delivery,"" Anand said recently. ""In order to make sure that goods find their way back to Canada, we are taking very serious steps on the ground.""Those steps include hiring France-based Bolloré Logistics — a global transportation and logistics firm that has operated in Shanghai since 1994 — to help with on-the-ground support, including the transportation and receiving of goods, to ensure the Canadian orders are delivered in as timely a fashion as possible and are not diverted to a higher bidder. Bolloré Logistics helps get the supplies from the factory to a secure warehouse in Shanghai near the airport where they can be stored while the company works on customs clearance. This is where the near shut-down of international travel that is crippling global airlines actually helps Canada. There is a sudden glut of planes and pilots available to fly and maintain a critical air bridge for medical supplies. The first two flights organized as part of this effort arrived in Toronto on April 1 and April 6, delivering a resupply of personal protective equipment. The April 6 flight arrived with about eight million surgical masks ordered by the federal government, and other orders made directly by the governments of Nova Scotia and Quebec. The federal government has secured an arrangement with Air Canada and Cargojet to run more supply flights from China once Bolloré Logistics has enough supplies in the warehouse ready to go. The Cargojet flight that landed in Hamilton was the most recent delivery. Air Canada is due to send planes to Shanghai this week to deliver additional shipments. Touchdown in Hamilton from Shanghai today <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/CJT1392?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#CJT1392</a> 75,000 pounds of Personal Protection Equipment for Canadian front line workers &amp; <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/GovtOfCanada?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#GovtOfCanada</a> Proud of our entire <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/Cargojet?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#Cargojet</a> team for all their hard work &amp; sacrifice. 🇨🇦✈️ <a href=""https://t.co/nakmWoxJNk"">pic.twitter.com/nakmWoxJNk</a>The plan is for the number of flights to grow as the supply chain in China is able to deliver more supplies. Airlines are working to be ready to meet the demand.On April 7, Air Canada's Vice President of Flight Operations Murray Strom issued an internal call for pilots to volunteer for special flight assignments to support this effort.""The government of Canada has requested Air Canada provide emergency airlift capabilities to operate cargo-only flights"" from Shanghai to Canada, Strom wrote to his pilots in a memo obtained by CBC News. Strom specifically asked pilots trained to fly Boeing 777s and 787s to step up — suggesting there could be as many as four daily flights travelling to Shanghai via Japan. ""This operation will require a lot of pilots over the next seven to 10 days to assist both Canada and our airline to make this happen,"" Strom wrote. ""These are truly unique times we are going through, but we all need to be willing to do our part to assist our fellow Canadians who are going through some very tough times.""On Saturday Air Canada publicly announced that it was boosting its cargo capacity by stripping the seats out of three of its enormous Boeing 777 aircraft to double their cargo capacity.""Bringing critical medical and other vital supplies rapidly to Canada and helping distribute them across the country is imperative to combating the COVID-19 crisis,"" Tim Strauss, vice-president of cargo at Air Canada, said in a statement. We’re transforming three of our <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/B777s?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#B777s</a> to transport goods in the cabin, thereby doubling their cargo capacity to help fly critical medical and vital supplies to and across Canada.

But it's backstopping a still-fragile supply chain in a time of great stress. To further reduce risk, Canada is buying from as many Chinese factories as possible so it doesn't become reliant on a single operator. The idea is to reduce the exposure from having a manufacturing line bought out by a rival country or being left vulnerable due to a sudden drop in quality from a specific supplier. ""These supply chains are complex,"" Anand said on April 7. ""But we are taking every effort to make sure that we get those goods back to Canada and in the hands of front-line health-care workers.""The global procurements are part of what Public Services and Procurement Canada calls an ""aggressive approach"" to getting PPE for front-line workers, including bulk-buying for the provinces and scaling up domestic manufacturing capacity. Provinces and territories are also taking steps to build their own inventory of supplies.""We are exploring all options for securing the necessary equipment and supplies to fight COVID-19, through both domestic and international supply chains, to ensure that front-line health-care workers across the country are equipped and protected in the fight against COVID-19,"" spokesperson Michèle LaRose said in an email."

Moscow views the Crimea annexation as legitimate, and denies meddling in the vote that gave Donald Trump the U.S. presidency.Russia has also drawn international criticism for speedily approving a COVID-19 vaccine, and some Western experts said it cut corners during testing. Putin has touted the vaccine on national television and said that one of his adult daughters had already been inoculated.On on Tuesday, he offered to provide the vaccine free to all UN staff. However, both Russian and Western experts insist that further studies are needed to determine the vaccine's effectiveness and safety.Putin continued to call for unity and urged countries to reaffirm their commitment to the UN charter and international law, lamenting a ""deficit of humanity and kindness"" between countries amid the pandemic.He repeatedly stressed the Soviet Union's role in helping vanquish the Nazis in World War II — the conflict that gave birth to the United Nations. Despite calls for deep reform of the UN, Putin said the Security Council's five permanent members should keep their veto power, and said their leaders agreed to an in-person meeting once the pandemic allows.""In an interconnected, interdependent world, in the whirlpool of international events, it is necessary to act together and rely on the principles of international law enshrined in the UN charter,"" he said.Earlier, Chinese President Xi Jinping told delegates that Beijing has no intention of fighting ""a Cold War or a hot one with any country,"" as tensions grow between China and the United States.""We will continue to narrow differences and resolve disputes with others through dialogue and negotiation. We will not seek to develop only ourselves or engage in zero-sum game,"" Xi said in a pre-recorded video statement.Long-simmering tensions between the U.S. and China hit their boiling point over the pandemic, spotlighting Beijing's bid for greater multilateral influence in a challenge to Washington's traditional leadership.The coronavirus emerged in China late last year and Washington has accused Beijing of a lack of transparency that it says worsened the outbreak. China denies the U.S. assertions.In what appeared to be a rebuke to U.S. President Donald Trump, though both leaders' speeches were pre-recorded, Xi called for a global response to the virus and giving the World Health Organization a leading role.Xi's speech followed Trump telling the UN that it ""must hold China accountable"" for its actions related to the coronavirus pandemic.""The Chinese government, and the World Health Organization, which is virtually controlled by China, falsely declared that there was no evidence of human-to-human transmission,"" Trump, who offered no evidence for his claim, said, also in a prerecorded message.WATCH / Trump launches full attack on China at UN meetingWorldOn Tuesday, the U.S. death toll from the coronavirus topped 200,000, a figure unimaginable eight months ago. Trump has been blamed for worsening the pandemic by ignoring the virus and obfuscating the nation's federal response to curb its spread.  The U.S. president promised to distribute a vaccine. ""We will end the pandemic,"" he said, and enter a new era of prosperity, co-operation and peace.Trump, a frequent critic of the UN, also said in the excerpts that if the organization is to be effective, it must focus on ""the real problems of the world"" like ""terrorism, the oppression of women, forced labour, drug trafficking, human and sex trafficking, religious persecution, and the ethnic cleansing of religious minorities.""Meanwhile, Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro defended his administration's record protecting the Amazon rainforest, telling global leaders that his country has been wrongly portrayed as an environmental villain.Speaking first, as is tradition for the Brazilian leader, Bolsonaro said that the South American nation has succeeded in boosting agricultural exports to feed a growing global population, which has made it a target.""We are victims of one of the most brutal disinformation campaigns about the Amazon and the Pantanal wetlands,"" Bolsonaro said. ""The Brazilian Amazon is well-known to be very rich. That explains why international institutions support such campaigns based on ulterior interests, joined by self-serving and unpatriotic Brazilian associations, with the objective of harming the government and Brazil itself.""Deforestation in Brazil's Amazon region may have reached a 14-year high in the 12 months through July, according to preliminary data published last month by the country's space agency. Final data will be released in coming months.Fires also spiraled out of control in Brazil's Pantanal, the world's largest tropical wetlands, with the number of blazes surpassing 16,000 so far in 2020 — considerably more than any full year on record since 1998.Bolsonaro came to office in 2019 promising to open more of the Amazon to development, such as farming and mining. International concern, particularly after last year's fires, has led investors to try to distance themselves from increasing deforestation and to pressure Bolsonaro's government to take more action against it.Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said in his address that any COVID-19 vaccine should be universally available, regardless of where it is produced.""No matter what country they are produced in, vaccines that are made ready to be administered should be presented to the common use of humanity,"" he said in a video address.Erdogan also proposed a regional conference with all Mediterranean coastal states, including the breakaway Turkish Cypriots, to address tensions over maritime boundaries and hydrocarbon exploration in the region.He said Turkey's primary preference was to solve disagreements ""justly and in an appropriate way"" through talks, but added that ""futile"" attempts to exclude Turkey from plans in the eastern Mediterranean could not succeed.NATO members Turkey and Greece are at odds over rights to potential energy resources in the eastern Mediterranean and the extent of their continental shelves.Tensions heated up last month when Turkey sent a seismic survey vessel to waters claimed by Greece and Cyprus, but they cooled a bit last week when Ankara recalled the ship in a move welcomed by Greece and the EU.""I would like to reiterate our call to establish dialogue and co-operation with coastal states in the Mediterranean,"" Erdogan said. ""So we are proposing the holding a regional conference where the rights and interests of all coastal states are taken into consideration, and where Turkish Cypriots are present, too."""

P.E.I. urged to allow COVID-19 tests to meet new China travel requirements | CBC News,Some members of P.E.I.'s Chinese community are asking the Island's Department of Health to expand options for COVID-19 testing to allow those wishing to travel to China to meet new requirements drafted by the Chinese government.,2020-09-03T10:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-covid-19-testing-for-travellers-1.5709749,"Some members of P.E.I.'s Chinese community are asking the Island's Department of Health to expand options for COVID-19 testing, after the Chinese government imposed new requirements for travel. Starting on Sept. 9, anyone boarding a flight from Canada to China needs to provide proof of a negative COVID-19 test within the past 72 hours. Right now on P.E.I., testing is available only to those who have coronavirus symptoms or a close contact with symptoms. ""Right now, there is no policy here in the province to have people tested for travel reasons,"" said Ally Guo, a member of the Island Chinese community who also volunteers within the community. ""If you have no symptoms and no problem, they cannot test for you.""Guo has recently started a social media group advocating for a testing option on P.E.I. for travel purposes — and she said at least 40 families have already joined.  The group has reached out to the Association for Newcomers to Canada, the Island's Department of Health, MP Sean Casey, and Chief Public Health Officer Dr. Heather Morrison.""We are trying to communicate with Health, and try to get them involved to have that exception for those people required to submit that kind of report [so that] they can present their ticket information or something, to have that test done,"" said Guo.One of the people trying to get back to China is Lihua Ji, who came to P.E.I. from Beijing in December for the birth of her grandson.The plan was to stay for a couple months and return to China in March, but the pandemic made that impossible.Since then, Lihua Ji has had four flights home cancelled. She's got a ticket booked for Sept. 15, but isn't sure how she'll be allowed to board the flight unless she's able to get tested for COVID-19 within three days of the trip. Speaking through Guo, the new grandmother told CBC that she worries for her husband, who is in poor health and lives alone in China. She also said she brought only enough medication for a few months, and has been using less of it to stretch out what she's got. That supply is quickly running out. Guo said those wishing to travel internationally and require a negative COVID-19 test for travel are willing to pay the costs of being tested.They can't get them done privately, even if that were an available option, because the Chinese government specifies that for travel from Canada, the tests need to be administered by institutions designated or recognized by the Chinese embassy or consulates in Canada.In P.E.I., the only acceptable tests would be administered by the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Charlottetown or the Prince County Hospital in Summerside. Officials with the Chief Public Health Office say they are working on the possibility of a testing option for travel purposes, but don't have any additional details at this time. They say more countries are requesting this as a prerequisite for entry for travel so they do plan to address this.No timelines have been provided, however."

The United States is responsible for all this,"" Wang said. ""We once again urge the United States to immediately retract its wrong decision and create necessary conditions for bringing the bilateral relationship back on track.""The White House urged China on Friday not to engage in ""tit-for-tat retaliation.""""Our action to direct the closure of PRC [People's Republic of China] Consulate General in Houston was taken to protect American intellectual property and Americans' private information,"" National Security Council spokesperson John Ullyot said.""We urge the CCP [Chinese Communist Party] to cease these malign actions rather than engage in tit-for-tat retaliation,"" Ullyot saidWang said some consulate personnel ""interfered in China's internal affairs and harmed China's security interests,"" but gave no details. He said Beijing complained ""many times"" to Washington about that.Also Friday, the U.S. State Department sent out a notice warning Americans in China of a ""heightened risk of arbitrary detention.""""U.S. citizens may be subjected to prolonged interrogations and extended detention for reasons related to 'state security,""' the notice said.Americans may be detained or deported for ""sending private electronic messages critical"" of the Chinese government, it said. The notice gave no indication of what prompted the warning.On Tuesday, the Trump administration ordered the Houston consulate closed within 72 hours. It alleged Chinese agents tried to steal data from facilities including the Texas A&M medical system.The ministry on Thursday rejected the allegations as ""malicious slander"" and warned the Houston consulate's closure was ""breaking down the bridge of friendship"" between the two countries.The United States has an embassy in Beijing and consulates in five other mainland cities — Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu, Shenyang and Wuhan. It also has a consulate in Hong Kong, a Chinese territory.The Chengdu consulate was in the news in 2012 when Wang Lijun, the police chief of the major city of Chongqing, visited and told American officials his concerns about the death of a British business associate of the wife of Chongqing's Communist Party secretary, Bo Xilai.That prompted the British Embassy to ask for a new investigation, which led to the arrest and conviction of Bo's wife. Bo was later dismissed and sentenced to prison.The consulate was surrounded by police while Wang was inside. He later emerged and was arrested and sentenced to 15 years on charges of corruption and defection. The U.S. government has refused to confirm whether Wang asked for asylum.Also Thursday, the U.S. Justice Department said it believes the Chinese Consulate in San Francisco is harbouring a Chinese researcher, Tang Juan, who is accused of lying about her background in the Communist Party's military wing on a visa application.The department announced criminal charges of visa fraud against Tang and three other Chinese researchers.U.S. authorities this week announced criminal charges against two Chinese computer hackers who are accused of targeting companies that are working on vaccines for the coronavirus.WATCH | Pompeo takes aim at China in Nixon Library speech:NewsThe Justice Department said Tang lied on a visa application last October as she made plans to work at the University of California, Davis, and again during an FBI interview months later.U.S. officials including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have stepped up accusations of technology theft. In a speech Thursday, Pompeo said some Chinese students and others ""come here to steal our intellectual property and to take this back to their country."""

How a photographer secretly documented the darkest moments of China's Cultural Revolution | CBC Radio,Li Zhensheng — a photographer who lived a double life during China's Cultural Revolution — has died at the age of 79.,2020-06-25T00:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/radio/asithappens/as-it-happens-thursday-edition-1.5626893/how-a-photographer-secretly-documented-the-darkest-moments-of-china-s-cultural-revolution-1.5625420,"Read Story TranscriptLi Zhensheng — a photographer who lived a double life during China's Cultural Revolution — has died at the age of 79.Li worked for a state-run newspaper as a photographer. He was ordered to not take ""negative"" images, but he secretly snapped thousands of illegal pictures that displayed the harsh truth of the decade.In May 1966, Chairman Mao Zedong announced the start of the Cultural Revolution, which effectively purged the Communist Party ranks and consolidated power for Mao. It resulted in economic stagnation, hunger, persecution, and bloodshed that left at least half a million people dead. Li's job with the newspaper Heilongjiang Daily allowed him to document a period of massive upheaval in China. He hid thousands of negatives under the floorboards in his apartment. Years later, he published some of them in his book Red-Color News Soldier. The images have also been displayed in exhibits around the world.  The New York Times has called his pictures, ""perhaps the most complete and nuanced pictorial account of the decade of turmoil ignited by Mao Zedong.""Robert Pledge is the director of the photographic agency Contact Press Images and editor of Red-Color News Soldier. Here is part of his conversation with As It Happens host Carol Off. I just want to say just for people who don't know the Cultural Revolution or don't remember, this was an extraordinary period of time ... from 1966 to 1976. It's believed that maybe a million and a half people were killed during that time. Tens of millions were persecuted for ""revisionism."" And he was able to get some very candid photos. How did he do that? How is he able to get access to these moments?Because he was a newspaper photographer, and therefore allowed to carry a camera, which most people were not allowed to do during that very turbulent period. It was a very violent period of time where parents were denounced by children. People were publicly humiliated. Hundreds of thousands, possibly millions of people were killed [or] committed suicide. He worked for a newspaper. And therefore, he was part of the propaganda machine, if you will. And that gave him some protection. Unlike most of his colleagues, he realized that this event would be very profound and long lasting. And he sensed that this was an event that was so huge that he had to record it and go beyond being part of the propaganda purpose.Did he set out to do that? At the beginning did ... he know that he was going to be exposing the dark side of the Cultural Revolution when he set out?No, of course not.I think in May 1966 … Chairman Mao declared that China would undergo Cultural Revolution and that would happen every seven years in China. Li Zhensheng was ... a young photographer [who] thought that was terrific for his career. The only problem is that very quickly he realized that this Cultural Revolution had everything but ... culture. Temples and churches were being destroyed, statues were being broken down. People were being mistreated. There was nothing cultural about it. That's when he realized that he had to record what he was seeing, what he was experiencing for history. So there's something very interesting and unique in his situation because he was, on the one hand, the propaganda photographer, and on the other hand, the undercover photographer who was recording the reality — the things that were really happening — and taking great risks doing that.Just for an example, can you give us some of the most striking images. There's so many of them, but what are the ones that really do expose that dark side?In the early stages of the movement, '66, '67, there were these massive rallies of young Red Guards. Teenagers ... would publicly humiliate members of the establishment — political establishment, if you will — the governor, the general secretary of the party, the professors, the teachers, even the parents. And they would bring them out in the stadium … to publicly humiliate them. [They] had them stand on a chair with their hands tied behind their backs [to] be shouted at and whipped and mistreated in public. I mean, it was devastating. So many people committed suicide as a result. They weren't necessarily killed right there on the spot. For instance, the governor of Heilongjiang Province, Li Fanwu, was brought up and stood on a chair. And young kids 12, 13, 14 years of age would shave his hair off — tear his hair off to humiliate him because they accuse him of wanting to look like Chairman Mao with his hairstyle. And that they noted [the governor's] ambition, political ambition.And Li Zhensheng photographed these moments. He photographed them and he realized that they would never be published.How did he conceal the photos?He would then process the film [and] he would edit the film. [He would] choose the pictures and all the images on his negatives that he knew were politically incorrect, if you will, all those negatives that were negative, he would cut them out and then he would bundle them. And he ended up burying them under the floorboard of his very small apartment.We know that Li Zhensheng's photos have been seen around the world, that they are famous images. But he had only limited access ... to mainland China. How important was it that people in China should see his work of the Cultural Revolution? His main objective in life since he retired was to have his images be seen by the younger generation of Chinese who were never told much by their parents or grandparents who felt embarrassed or ashamed [or] traumatized by the events.You had to remember that some families were torn between those who supported the Cultural Revolution and those who now opposed it. The participants and the victims are alive today. So it is not something that people would speak about comfortably.And they never told their children, or few told their children or their grandchildren what happened to them during that kind of time.

However Canadian groups say the tests are unfounded since there is no scientific evidence that COVID-19 has been transmitted in food.,2020-06-19T09:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/nova-scotia-lobster-covid-19-testing-china-1.5618215,"A recent coronavirus outbreak traced to a market in Beijing is disrupting Canadian live lobster exports to China.New testing measures imposed in at least three cities — Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou— have led to cancelled lobster shipments from Nova Scotia this week and delays for shipments that do arrive.""We've hit a significant snag,"" said Geoff Irvine, executive director of the Lobster Council of Canada.""The latest news is that they will continue to do these random inspections, which has effectively caused many of the large shipments to stop.""Chinese authorities began testing for COVID-19 in imported food after an outbreak was traced to a cutting board used for salmon in the Xinfadi market in the Chinese capital. China is a crucial market for Canadian lobster fishermen. Before the pandemic struck, China was edging closer to overtaking the United States as the top importer, with sales of live lobster to China reaching $457 million last year.Random seafood shipments, including live lobster from Canada, are being held until test results come back.""The tests can take up to 36 hours, which means that the product sits out of water for 36 hours, so there can be mortality issues that someone has to pay for,"" Irvine said.The inspections have interrupted a rebound in live lobster sales to China after the market collapsed earlier in the year due to the pandemic.Figures from Statistics Canada, first reported by seafood publication Undercurrent News, reveal the scale of the collapse.In January, Canada sent 4,323 tonnes of live lobster worth $79.3 million in China. The majority of it was from Nova Scotia.In February, sales fell to 46 tonnes — worth just $940,000.""We've known since the start of the pandemic that there were going to be bumps in the road with regards to export markets. We've seen those challenges from day one,"" said Federal Fisheries and Oceans Minister Bernadette Jordan.The hope is this setback is a blip.""There's been no official closure of the borders or border ban on seafood products. It's just this testing regime that makes doing the business very, very risky,"" said Irvine.""The effect of these inspections are that the live shippers just simply don't want to ship there to take the risk.""I do know some shippers who are changing their terms of sale. If Chinese buyers want to pay for the product in advance and take the risk … of the inspections, they can still do that.""Other industry associations are also speaking out, including the Fisheries Council of Canada and the National Fisheries Institute in Washington.All say there is no scientific evidence that COVID-19 has been transmitted in food or food packaging, citing multiple public health agencies from the World Health Organization to the Canadian Food Inspection Agency.""The bigger problem is that it's completely unfounded,"" said Irvine.Earlier this week, Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada told provincial officials and industry stakeholders the Chinese government has not notified Canada of what it is doing.""There are no clear details on the type of products that will be targeted or the delay that may be caused for clearing customs as a result of testing,"" said a June 16 note. ""However, there are indications that meat, poultry, aquatic products and fruit and vegetables may be subject to testing.""The Government of Canada remains in close contact with the Canadian Mission in Beijing and will continue to seek further clarifications from official sources.""On Thursday night, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency said Chinese authorities have asked Canada and other countries for ""assurances"" food is free of COVID-19.""The General Administration of Customs China (GACC) has written to trading partners, including Canada, to officially request that government authorities provide assurances that food processing establishments eligible to export to China follow measures to prevent any COVID-19 contamination of food products during food production,"" spokesperson Christine Carnaffan said in an email response to CBC News.""The Government of Canada continues to engage with Chinese counterparts to reassure China of the strong measures in place in Canada to ensure the safety of the food and food products exported from Canada.""The statement reiterated the Canadian Food Inspection Agency's position: ""There is currently no scientific evidence that food or food packaging is a likely source or route of transmission of COVID-19. In addition, there have been no confirmed cases of food or food packaging being associated with the transmission of the virus."""
Maple Leaf suspending pork exports to China over COVID-19 cases in Brandon and Lethbridge | CBC News,"Maple Leaf Foods is temporarily suspending the exports of pork products to China after dozens of workers at the company's plant in Brandon, Man., and one at the Lethbridge, Alta., plant tested positive for COVID-19, it announced in a release on Wednesday.",2020-08-19T17:41:04.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/maple-leaf-pork-exports-china-brandon-manitoba-1.5692188,"Maple Leaf Foods is temporarily suspending the exports of pork products to China after dozens of workers at the company's plant in Brandon, Man., and one at the Lethbridge, Alta., plant tested positive for COVID-19, it announced in a release on Wednesday.The company says it's doing so because of a Chinese protocol that requires any plant reporting a COVID-19 positive case suspend exports to China temporarily.""We respect China's new import protocols for Canadian products and are working cooperatively with Canadian and Chinese authorities to resume exports quickly,"" Michael McCain, Maple Leaf's president and CEO, said in a release.On Wednesday, the company confirmed there are 60 cases of COVID-19 at the Brandon plant and one at the Lethbridge plant.Maple Leaf says the person who contracted the virus in Lethbridge linked it to a social event outside of the plant and is now fully recovered. There have been no other positive cases since the single positive test there in July, the company says.Public health officials in Manitoba maintain the Brandon workers contracted the virus outside of the workplace.The Canadian Food Inspection Agency told CBC News there is currently no scientific evidence that food or food packaging is a likely source or route of transmission of the virus.""If the CFIA becomes aware of any potential food safety risks, appropriate actions are taken immediately to prevent contaminated foods from entering the domestic or international food supply,"" the agency said in an email to CBC News."
Government files reveal new information about shipment of deadly viruses from Canada to China | CBC News,One of the scientists escorted from the National Microbiology Lab last year amid an RCMP investigation was responsible for a shipment of Ebola and Henipah viruses to the Wuhan National Biosafety Laboratory four months earlier. Coronavirus was not part of the shipment.,2020-06-14T08:00:57.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/canadian-scientist-sent-deadly-viruses-to-wuhan-lab-months-before-rcmp-asked-to-investigate-1.5609582,"Newly-released access-to-information documents reveal details about a shipment of deadly pathogens last year from Canada's National Microbiology Lab to China — confirming for the first time who sent them, what exactly was shipped, and where it went.CBC News had already reported about the shipment of Ebola and Henipah viruses but there's now confirmation one of the scientists escorted from the lab in Winnipeg amid an RCMP investigation last July was responsible for exporting the pathogens to the Wuhan Institute of Virology four months earlier.Dr. Xiangguo Qiu, her husband Keding Cheng and her students from China were removed from Canada's only level-4 lab over what's described as a possible ""policy breach."" The Public Health Agency of Canada had asked the RCMP to get involved several months earlier. The virus shipments are not related to the outbreak of COVID-19 or research into the pandemic, Canadian officials said. PHAC said the shipment and Qiu's eviction from the lab are not connected.""The administrative investigation is not related to the shipment of virus samples to China,"" Eric Morrissette, chief of media relations for Health Canada and the Public Health Agency of Canada wrote in an email.""In response to a request from the Wuhan Institute of Virology for viral samples of Ebola and Henipah viruses, the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) sent samples for the purpose of scientific research in 2019.""However, experts are concerned.""It is suspicious. It is alarming. It is potentially life-threatening,"" said Amir Attaran, a law professor and epidemiologist at the University of Ottawa.WATCH | Deadly viruses were sent from Canada to China, documents show:CBC News Manitoba""We have a researcher who was removed by the RCMP from the highest security laboratory that Canada has for reasons that government is unwilling to disclose. The intelligence remains secret. But what we know is that before she was removed, she sent one of the deadliest viruses on Earth, and multiple varieties of it to maximize the genetic diversity and maximize what experimenters in China could do with it, to a laboratory in China that does dangerous gain of function experiments. And that has links to the Chinese military.""Gain of function experiments are when a natural pathogen is taken into the lab, made to mutate, and then assessed to see if it has become more deadly or infectious.In Canada, gain of function experiments to create more dangerous pathogens in humans are not prohibited, but are not done because they're considered too dangerous, Attaran said.""The Wuhan lab does them and we have now supplied them with Ebola and Nipah viruses. It does not take a genius to understand that this is an unwise decision,"" he said.""I am extremely unhappy to see that the Canadian government shared that genetic material.""Attaran pointed to an Ebola study first published in December 2018, three months after Qiu began the process of exporting the viruses to China. The study involved researchers from the NML and University of Manitoba.The lead author, Hualei Wang, is involved with the Academy of Military Medical Sciences, a Chinese military medical research institute in Beijing. All of this has led to conspiracy theories linking the novel coronavirus responsible for COVID-19, Canada's microbiology lab, and the lab in Wuhan. Online claims that Chinese scientists stole coronavirus from Winnipeg lab have 'no factual basis'The RCMP and PHAC have consistently denied any connections between the pandemic and the virus shipments. There is no evidence linking this shipment to the spread of the coronavirus. Ebola is a filovirus and Henipa is a paramyxovirus; no coronavirus samples were sent.The ATIP documents identify for the first time exactly what was shipped to China.The list includes two vials each of 15 strains of virus:  PHAC said the National Microbiology Lab routinely shares samples with other public health labs.The transfers follow strict protocols, including requirements under the Human Pathogens and Toxins Act (HPTA), the Transportation of Dangerous Goods Act, the Canadian Biosafety Standard, and standard operating procedures of the NML.CBC News has not been provided with some of the paperwork involved with the transfer, as information was redacted under sections of the Access to Information Act dealing with international affairs, national security and other issues.The ATIP documents provide details about the months leading up to the shipment — including confusion over how to package the deadly viruses — the lack of decontamination of the package before it was sent, and concerns expressed by the NML's director-general Matthew Gilmour in Winnipeg, and his superiors in Ottawa. They wanted to know where the package was going, what was in it, and whether it had the proper paperwork.In one email, Gilmour said Material Transfer Agreements would be required, ""not generic 'guarantees' on the storage and usage.""He also asked David Safronetz, chief of special pathogens: ""Good to know that you trust this group. How did we get connected with them?""Safronetz replied: ""They are requesting material from us due to collaboration with Dr. Qiu.""Meanwhile, it appears the NML's shipper initially planned to send the viruses in inappropriate packaging and only changed it when the clients in China flagged the problem.""The only reason the correct packaging was used is because the Chinese wrote to them and said, 'Aren't you making a mistake here?' If that had not happened, the scientists would have placed on an Air Canada flight, several of them actually, a deadly virus incorrectly packaged. That nearly happened,"" Attaran said.The package was routed from Winnipeg to Toronto and then to Beijing on a commercial Air Canada flight on Mar. 31, 2019. The next day, the recipients replied that the package had arrived safely. ""We would like to express our sincere gratitude to you all for your continuous support, especially Dr. Qiu and Anders! Thanks a lot!! Looking forward to our further cooperation in the future,"" said the heavily redacted email, which does not provide the name of the sender.Nearly one year after the expulsion of Qiu, Cheng, and her students from the NML, there are still no updates on the case from the RCMP or PHAC.At the time, Public Health Agency spokesperson Morrissette said the department was taking steps to resolve this case as quickly as possible. On Thursday, he said the investigation has not yet concluded.""Administrative investigations are impartial, thorough and in-depth. They are also procedurally fair and respect the rights of individuals,"" he said.Gordon Houlden, director of the China Institute at the University of Alberta, said he welcomes scientific collaboration and exchanges with China, ""but there has to be a framework of rules in place"" and Canada's intellectual property must be protected.Houlden, a former diplomat, has many unanswered questions about this particular shipment.A vacuum of information is always a problem, especially in a situation of heightened tension with China over the arrest of a Huawei executive in Canada, the seemingly retaliatory arrest of two Canadian men in China and questions over the origins of the coronavirus, he said. ""There's also a danger if you don't provide information that people will jump always to the worst conclusion,"" Houlden said. Current NML head Matthew Gilmour was not made available for an interview. He is leaving as of July to work for the U.K.-based Quadram Institute Bioscience. His medical adviser, Dr. Guillaume Poliquin, will take over until a permanent replacement can be found.Qiu could also not be reached for a comment."

The new Long March 5B rocket has been specially designated to propel modules of the future space station into orbit."
"New coronavirus cases reported in South Korea and China, as Iran, Italy battle outbreak | CBC News","South Korea and China both reported a rise in new coronavirus cases on Sunday, as the South Korean prime minister warned that the fast-spreading outbreak linked to a local church and a hospital in the country's southeast had entered a ""more grave stage.""",2020-02-23T05:12:24.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/new-coronavirus-cases-reported-in-south-korea-and-china-as-iran-italy-battle-outbreak-1.5472986,"South Korea and China both reported a rise in new coronavirus cases on Sunday, as the South Korean prime minister warned that the fast-spreading outbreak linked to a local church and a hospital in the country's southeast had entered a ""more grave stage.""Some virus clusters have shown no direct link to travel to China. The death toll in Iran climbed to six, the highest outside China, and a dozen towns in northern Italy effectively went into lockdown as authorities tested hundreds of people who came into contact with an estimated 79 confirmed cases there. Two people have died in Italy.The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said that 113 of the 120 new cases were reported in the fourth-largest city of Daegu and surrounding areas. The agency said 70 of them are linked to a branch of the Shincheonji church in Daegu, which has become the biggest cluster of viral infections in the country, which now has a total of 556 cases.Daegu Mayor Kwon Yong-jin told reporters that 247 residents had tested positive for the virus since the city confirmed its first case on Feb. 18. That first patient is a Shincheonji church member in Daegu who has no recent record of overseas travel. Officials said she attended church services and visited other places before being diagnosed with the disease, but they still believe it's unlikely that the woman set off the chain of infections.Kwon said there are concerns that the number of those infected in Daegu could see yet another massive increase because authorities were launching intensive examinations of church members with virus-related symptoms. More than 9,000 worshipers were being tested.Downtown Daegu was mostly deserted with shelves at some supermarkets and stores empty. Many restaurants, bars, real-estate offices and tour agencies have shut down as traffic nosedived and people stayed home, ordering food and supplies online.On Sunday, mainland China reported 648 new infections for a total of 76,936. The daily death toll fell slightly to 97. In all, 2,442 people have died in the country from COVID-19.The number of new Chinese cases has seesawed daily but remained under 1,000 for the past four days. Several changes to how the infections are counted, however, have made it difficult to draw conclusions from the figures.The central Chinese city of Wuhan and other parts of Hubei province, where the outbreak first emerged in December, remain under lockdown. More than 80 per cent of the country's cases are in Hubei, where the death toll has also been higher than in the rest of the nation.China's Politburo, made up of senior officials of the ruling Communist Party, cautioned Friday that while the epidemic has been ""preliminarily contained,"" the country has yet to see a turning point.Officials signaled that regular activities should gradually resume after the virus prompted an extension of last month's Lunar New Year holiday. Many workplaces have opted to have their employees work remotely, and schools are conducting online classes.In Beijing, most residential communities have implemented ""closed management,"" limiting the number of people per household who can go in and out using exit-entry cards and requiring those just returning to the Chinese capital to isolate themselves at home for 14 days.A cluster of infections was reported out of Beijing's Fuxing Hospital. The facility, which has 34 confirmed cases, has been closed off to protect the surrounding community, said a statement from Xicheng district authorities.More than 500 cases also have been found in prisons across the country.The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said a male patient hospitalized at Cheongdo city, near Daegu, died on Sunday, the country's fourth fatality. He was believed to be 57 years old but no other details on him were made available.On Saturday night, Prime Minister Chung Sye-kyun said in a nationally televised address that the virus outbreak had entered ""a more grave stage"" and repeated the government is making all-out efforts to contain the further spread of the disease. Chung also said his government will sternly deal with any acts that hamper national quarantine efforts.Globally, more than 78,000 people have been infected in 29 countries.Israel, which has reported one case, turned back a South Korean airliner with most of its passengers after it landed at the country's Ben Gurion airport Saturday evening. Twelve Israelis on board were evacuated and quarantined while the plane was taxied away from the allotted terminal, Israeli media reported.Yonhap news agency cited Seoul's Foreign Ministry as registering a strong protest with the Israeli government. The Foreign Ministry told the Israeli government that no excessive, unreasonable measures should be taken against South Korean nationals, according to the report.Seoul's Foreign Ministry couldn't immediately be reached for comment. According to Yonhap, the plane was returning to South Korea on Sunday afternoon.South Korea earlier informed Israel that nine members of a group who toured Israel and the West Bank for a week this month tested positive for the virus. The tourists were diagnosed upon returning home. Israeli and Palestinian health authorities asked people who were in close contact with the tourists to quarantine themselves.A team of global experts with the World Health Organization is on the way to China's Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said Saturday. It has been visiting other parts of China this week.Tedros also told a meeting of African health ministers that the WHO is concerned about cases with ""no clear epidemiological link, such as travel history to China or contact with a confirmed case."" He is especially concerned about the growing number of cases in Iran, where 28 people have been infected."
China to lift coronavirus lockdown in most of Hubei province | CBC News,"Chinese authorities say they will end a two-month lockdown of most of coronavirus-hit Hubei province at midnight, as domestic cases of what has become a global pandemic subside.",2020-03-24T15:27:48.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/china-lift-hubei-lockdown-1.5507908,"Chinese authorities said Tuesday they will end a two-month lockdown of most of coronavirus-hit Hubei province at midnight, as domestic cases of what has become a pandemic subside.People with a clean bill of health will be allowed to leave, the provincial government said, easing restrictions on movement that were unprecedented in scale. The city of Wuhan — the capital of Hubei and where the virus was first detected in December — is to remain locked down until April 8.China barred people from leaving or entering Wuhan beginning on Jan. 23 in a surprise middle-of-the-night announcement and expanded that to most of the province in succeeding days. Trains and flights were cancelled and checkpoints set up on roads into the central province.The drastic steps came as the coronavirus began spreading to the rest of China and overseas during the Lunar New Year holiday, when millions of Chinese travel.WATCH | Wuhan springs to life as COVID-19 recedes:WorldThe virus raged for weeks in Wuhan and surrounding cities. Hospitals overflowed and temporary ones were hastily set up to try to isolate the growing number of infected patients. More than 2,500 people have died in Wuhan out of 3,270 countrywide.The outbreak has since been brought under control, and Hubei has seen almost no new infections for more than a week.The move to end the lockdown showed the authorities' apparent faith in the success of the drastic measures as they try to kick-start the world's second-largest economy and put money in the pockets of workers, many of whom have gone weeks without pay. It remained unclear, however, which cities and provinces, including Beijing, would allow people from Hubei to enter their jurisdictions. About 120,000 migrant workers — including many who had made the traditional trip home to Hubei for Lunar New Year — have already been allowed to leave in recent days on special buses and trains, according to Chinese media reports. The reports said manufacturing centres, such as Guangdong and Zhejiang province, are open to people from Hubei.Outside of Hubei, the government says work has restarted on about 90 per cent of major public construction projects across the country. While many migrant workers remain trapped by travel restrictions and quarantines, factories are operating again, though not at full capacity.In the Beijing area, the city zoo and parts of the Great Wall reopened this week, though they required advance reservations to limit the number of visitors. Some restaurants were reopening for business, some on the condition that customers do not sit facing each other.At the Xibei restaurant inside a mall in eastern Beijing's Shuangjing neighbourhood, a line formed around 11 a.m. Tuesday for the lunch opening, although managers said they expected to serve only around 140 customers, down from the usual daily number of 900 before the virus outbreak.Half of the establishment's 20 tables had ""closed"" signs on them to help keep a distance between customers, while food delivery workers rushed in and out with orders of grilled beef and lamb, noodles, pancakes and other northern Chinese dishes.Wu Lin, who works in cosmetics, was dining out for the first time since restrictions were imposed because of the outbreak.""Since [the restaurant] can open at the moment, I believe their prevention and control is fairly good,"" Wu said. ""For example, they check the temperature of every customer and staffer. It gives us a sense of safety.""Officials have turned their attention to the threat of the virus entering from abroad, with almost all new cases being recorded among people arriving from overseas. China's National Health Commission on Tuesday reported 78 new coronavirus cases, among which 74 were imported.Starting Wednesday, Beijing will require everyone coming from overseas to be tested for the coronavirus on top of being quarantined for 14 days. In a notice published online, city authorities said those who have entered the city within the last 14 days will also undergo the mandatory testing.""Currently, the imported risk from the epidemic's rapid spread overseas continues to rise,"" the Beijing notice said.The heightened measures — which apply regardless of one's final destination — follow a previous order that all overseas arrivals quarantine themselves at designated hotels at their own expense unless they live alone."

China reports lowest quarterly growth in 26 years | CBC News,"China's economic growth decelerated to a 26-year low in the latest quarter amid a tariff war with Washington, adding to a deepening slump that is weighing on global growth.",2019-10-18T12:44:27.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/china-quarterly-report-1.5325722,"China's economic growth decelerated to a 26-year low in the latest quarter amid a tariff war with Washington, adding to a deepening slump that is weighing on global growth.The world's second-largest economy expanded by six per cent in the three months ended in September, down from the previous quarter's 6.2 per cent, data showed Friday, the lowest rate since China started reporting data by quarters in 1993.The slump increases pressure on Chinese leaders to avert politically dangerous job losses as they fight a tariff war with U.S. President Donald Trump over Beijing's trade surplus and technology ambitions.""Pressure on economic activity should intensify in the coming months,"" said Julian Evans-Pritchard of Capital Economics in a report.The slowdown in China, the world's biggest trader, has global repercussions. It is depressing demand for industrial components from Asian countries and prices of soybeans, iron ore and other commodities, hitting Brazil, Australia and other suppliers.The International Monetary Fund cited the U.S.-Chinese tariff war as a factor in this week's decision to cut its 2019 global growth forecast to three per cent from its previous outlook of 3.2 per cent.Trump agreed last week to delay a tariff hike on Chinese goods and said Beijing promised to buy up to $50 billion of American farm goods. Officials say the two sides still are working out details.Beijing has yet to confirm the scale of possible purchases of U.S. goods. It is unclear whether Chinese leaders want more steps including possibly lifting punitive tariffs already in place before purchases go ahead.An even bigger impact on Chinese growth appears to come from cooling domestic activity including consumer spending and investment.Retail sales growth declined to 8.2 per cent over a year earlier in the first three quarters of 2019, down from the first half's 8.4 per cent, the National Bureau of Statistics reported.Chinese leaders are in a marathon campaign to nurture growth based on domestic consumption and reduce reliance on trade and investment. But those plans call for maintaining the level of exports that support millions of jobs.Factory output growth slowed to 5.6 per cent in the January-September period, down from six per cent in the first six months of the year.China's exports to the United States, its biggest foreign market, fell 21.9 per cent in September from a year ago. That helped to drag down overall Chinese exports by 1.4 per cent. Imports of American goods sank 15.7 per cent.The latest economic growth figure was the lowest since China began reporting data by quarters in 1993. Annual growth tumbled to 3.9 per cent in 1990 but rebounded to 9.3 per cent the following year."

"No concentration camps in China just 'vocational training centres,' says envoy | CBC News","Detention camps housing hundreds of thousands, perhaps over one million ethnic Uighurs, in western China are nothing more than vocational training centres, the country’s ambassador to Canada insisted on Wednesday.",2020-03-04T20:28:03.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/china-concentration-camp-uighurs-1.5485658,"Detention camps housing perhaps as many as one million ethnic Uighurs in western China are nothing more than ""vocational training centres,"" the country's ambassador to Canada insisted on Wednesday.Cong Peiwu, speaking at a security and defence conference in Ottawa, was put on the hot seat several times during a panel discussion about the competition between great powers in the Middle East.He discussed how China could use soft power influence in the troubled region while being asked whether it is detaining a substantial number of Muslim Uighurs against their will in high-tech concentration camps. Cong took issue with the characterization.""There's nothing like concentration camps in China,"" he said.Last fall, a leak of internal Chinese government documents to the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) painted a stark picture of camps, which have been built across Xinjiang region in the past three years. The leaked documents, dubbed ""The China Cables"" by the ICJI, contain a nine-page 2017 memo, sent from the then deputy-secretary of province's Communist Party to the officials in charge of the camps.The memo spells out how the camps should be run as high-security prisons, complete with strict discipline and punishments.The publication of the records by media outlets around the world, including CBC News, caused a sensation and led to condemnation from several governments, including Global Affairs Canada, which said it was concerned about ""credible reports of the mass detention, repression and surveillance"" in Xinjiang.Chinese officials, including Cong, have responded by attempting to discredit the reports.""Some of the western media can be misleading you. So, be careful. There's a lot of fake news,"" he said  As for the concentration camps, as you call it ... actually it was used to be vocational training centres.""PoliticsHe stuck to Beijing's often-repeated position that the camps were necessary to quell the unrest from a few years ago.""So, that's why the government had to take preventative measures when it comes to counter-terrorism,"" he said.Cong also faced questions about the detention of two Canadians, Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig, who have been held for over year, an action widely seen as retaliation for the arrest of Chinese telecommunication executive Meng Wanzhou by federal authorities.She is wanted in the U.S. in connection with the alleged violation of Iranian sanctions by her company, Huawei.Cong insisted Spavor and Kovrig are being treated fairly according to Chinese law, although he would not say when the country will present evidence to back up the claims of security officials that the two men are spies and a threat to national security. He faced several questions about the case during the panel discussion and afterward when speaking with journalists. The ambassador did suggest the frosty relationship between Canada and China has thawed a bit because of the Liberal government's measured response to the outbreak of the novel coronavirus. ""I would like to commend and appreciate what the Canadian side has done so far in the fight against the outbreak,"" Cong said. ""I think, first, it has adopted a cool-headed approach and an evidence-based manner.""Expressions of ""support, solidarity and sympathy"" by Canada have been also appreciated, he added.Politics"

China set to propose national security legislation concerning Hong Kong | CBC News,"China will propose national security legislation for Hong Kong in response to last year's often violent pro-democracy protests that plunged the city into its deepest turmoil since it returned to Chinese rule in 1997, a newspaper and a source said on Thursday.",2020-05-22T00:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/china-hong-kong-legislation-1.5578290,"China will propose national security laws for Hong Kong in response to the often-violent pro-democracy protests last year that plunged the city into its deepest turmoil since it returned to Chinese rule in 1997, a parliamentary spokesperson and the state news agency Xinhua said on Thursday.The official's statement confirmed what three people with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters, potentially sparking fresh anti-China protests in the former British colony, which enjoys many freedoms not allowed on the mainland.""In light of the new circumstances and need, the National People's Congress (NPC) is exercising its constitutional power to establish a new legal framework and enforcement mechanism to safeguard national security in Hong Kong,"" Zhang Yesui, the spokesperson for the legislature, said.He was speaking at a late-night briefing on the eve of the start of China's annual parliamentary session. Further details would be given on Friday, he added.WATCH | Chinese proposal takes aim at Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement:The NationalThe Hong Kong dollar weakened on the news.Xinhua said a preparatory meeting for a Chinese parliament session adopted an agenda that included an item to review a bill ""on establishing and improving the legal system and enforcement mechanisms for the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region to safeguard national security.""Earlier Thursday, the South China Morning Post, citing unnamed sources, said the laws would ban secession, foreign interference, terrorism and all seditious activities aimed at toppling the central government and any external interference in Hong Kong.Online posts had already emerged urging people to gather to protest on Thursday night and dozens were seen shouting pro-democracy slogans in a shopping mall as riot police stood nearby.Opposition democrats said the move would gravely wound Hong Kong's reputation as a financial centre and its high degree of autonomy.""If this move takes place, 'one country, two systems' will be officially erased,"" said democratic lawmaker Dennis Kwok.""This is the end of Hong Kong,"" added Kwok, flanked by other opposition democrats.Hong Kong people took to the streets last year to protest a now-withdrawn bill that would have allowed extraditions of criminal suspects to mainland China. The movement broadened to include demands for broader democracy amid perceptions that Beijing was tightening its grip over the city.""If Beijing passes the law … how [far] will civil society resist repressive laws? How much impact will it unleash on to Hong Kong as an international financial centre?"" said Ming Sing, political scientist at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.The legislation could be a turning point for Hong Kong, potentially triggering a revision of its special status in Washington and likely to spark more unrest.""If it happens, we'll address that issue very strongly,"" U.S. President Donald Trump said from Washington before departing for a visit to a Michigan factory.U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on May 6 he was delaying a report assessing whether Hong Kong was sufficiently autonomous to warrant Washington's special economic treatment that has helped it remain a world financial centre.The delay was to account for any actions at the National People's Congress, he said.Tension between the two superpowers has heightened in recent weeks, as they exchanged accusations on the handling of the coronavirus pandemic, souring an already worsening relationship over trade.Pompeo said on Wednesday that pro-democracy lawmakers had been ""manhandled"" this week while trying to stop what he characterized as procedural irregularity by pro-Beijing legislators, and added: ""Leading Hong Kong activists like Martin Lee and Jimmy Lai were hauled into court. Actions like these make it more difficult to assess that Hong Kong remains highly autonomous from mainland China.""A previous attempt by Hong Kong to introduce national security legislation, known as Article 23, in 2003 was met with mass peaceful protests and shelved.Hong Kong has a constitutional obligation to enact Article 23 ""on its own,"" but similar laws can be introduced by Beijing separately into an annex of the Basic Law, the city's mini-constitution.That legal mechanism could bypass the city's legislature as the laws could be imposed by promulgation by Hong Kong's pro-Beijing government.""Some people are destroying Hong Kong's peace and stability. Beijing saw all that has happened,"" pro-establishment lawmaker Christopher Cheung, who is not part of discussions in Beijing, told Reuters.""Legislation is necessary and the sooner the better.""National security legislation has been strongly opposed by pro-democracy protesters who argue it could erode the city's freedoms and high degree of autonomy, guaranteed under the ""one country, two systems"" formula put in place when it returned to Chinese rule.Protesters denounce what they see as the creeping meddling in Hong Kong by China's Communist Party rulers. Beijing denies the charge."
China posts lowest full-year growth in 25 years,"China's economic growth edged down to 6.8 per cent in the final quarter of 2015 as trade and consumer spending weakened, dragging full-year growth to its lowest in 25 years.",2016-01-19T00:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/china-economic-growth-2015-1.3409708,"China's economic growth edged down to 6.8 per cent in the final quarter of 2015 as trade and consumer spending weakened, dragging full-year growth to its lowest in 25 years.Growth has fallen steadily over the past five years as the ruling Communist Party tries to steer away from a worn-out model based on investment and trade toward self-sustaining growth driven by domestic consumption and services. But the unexpectedly sharp decline over the past two years prompted fears of a politically dangerous spike in job losses.Full-year growth declined to 6.9 per cent, government data showed Tuesday. That was the lowest since sanctions imposed on Beijing following its crackdown on the Tiananmen Square pro-democracy movement caused growth to plummet to 3.8 per cent in 1990.The October-December growth figure was the lowest quarterly expansion since the aftermath of the global financial crisis, when growth slumped to 6.1 per cent in the first quarter of 2009. Growth in the July-September quarter of 2009 was 6.9 per cent.Growth in investment in factories, housing and other fixed assets, a key economic driver, weakened to 12 per cent in 2015, down 2.9 percentage points from the previous year. Retail sales growth cooled to 10.6 per cent from 2014's 12 per cent.""The international situation remains complex,"" said Wang Bao'an, commissioner of the National Bureau of Statistics, as a news conference. ""Restructuring and upgrading is in an uphill stage. Comprehensively deepening reform is a daunting task.""""Official data do not point to a hard landing in the fourth quarter of 2015, but they provide little reason to stop worrying about China's drag on the global economy, either,"" said economist Bill Adams of PNC Financial Services Group in a report.Growth was in line with private sector forecasts and the ruling Communist Party's official target of about seven per cent for the year.As a result, Asian stock markets mostly eked out modest gains Tuesday. The Shanghai Composite was up 1.6 per cent at 2,961.58 and Hong Kong's Hang Seng gained 0.8 per cent to 19,386.75. Japan's Nikkei 225 overcame early losses to rise 0.2 per cent to 16,989.31. South Korea's Kospi advanced 0.2 per cent to 1,881.77.Beijing responded to ebbing growth by cutting interest rates six times since November, 2014, and launched measures to help exporters and other industries. But economists note China still relies on state-led construction spending and other investment.December exports shrank 1.4 per cent from a year earlier, well below the ruling party's target of six per cent growth in total trade. For the full year, exports were down 7.6 per cent, a blow to industries that employ millions of Chinese workers.Forecasters see indications retail sales and other activity accelerated toward the end of 2015, suggesting Beijing's efforts to put a floor under the downturn are gaining traction.""The growth picture remains two-sided. The real estate construction slump and weak exports continued to weigh on activity,"" said Louis Kuijs of Oxford Economics in a report.""Meanwhile, though, consumption continued to expand robustly, supported by solid wage growth,"" said Kuijs. ""The robust growth in the consumption and services nexus is key for policymakers. They need it to avoid labour market stress.""Spending on online commerce grew by 33.3 per cent over 2014. Wang said the share of total economic activity accounted for by consumption rose to 56.4 per cent, up 15 percentage points from 2014.Forecasters expect economic growth to decline further this year, with the International Monetary Fund targeting a 6.3 per cent expansion."

""We will not tackle this problem of global warming and climate change unless we get everyone on board, everyone with an oar in the water and everyone rowing together.""Baird is leading the Canadian delegation at the two-week United Nations climate change conference in Bali, where participants will be discussing the framework for a new agreement to replace the Kyoto Protocol when it expires in 2012.  The conference, which is drawing representatives from 190 countries, officially began Monday, although Baird will not be arriving until next week.""It'sessential we work at this conference to bring other countries aboard,"" Baird said.Still, Baird said Canada will not shy away from making a bolder commitment than developing nations, whose new economies could suffer under drastic emissions-reducing measures.""Let me be clear, Canada can afford to do more faster than developing countries, so it doesn't have to be a one-size fits all solution,"" Baird said. ""But everyone's got to be going in the same direction down the right road.""Baird has insisted previously that all emitters must be on board when a new climate change treaty is drafted. Under the Kyoto Protocol, some developing countries did not have targets to meet because of their fragile economies.During Baird's speech to the Economic Club of Toronto, a protester jumped on stage carrying a sign that read ""Liar.""Baird and the Conservative government have been attacked for their failure to meet the emissions targets set out in the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, which was signed by Canada under a Liberal government in 1998.Kyoto, which was ratified by 141 countries,provides specific targets for different nations, with Canada expected to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by six per cent from 1990 levels by 2012.But Baird's environmental plan, made public in April, only calls for Canada to reduce overall emissions by 20 per cent from 2006 levels by 2020. This plan means Canada will miss its Kyoto goals by years."

But the sky is not falling either,"" Clearwater Seafoods CEO Ian Smith told analysts this week.The company was briefing the financial market on healthy sales results for the last three months of 2019 before the outbreak hit China.Live lobster sales in China are big business not only for Clearwater.In the first 10 months of 2019, sales from Atlantic Canadian companies were $384 million.Clearwater, based in Bedford, N.S., is warning of potential ""headwinds"" in 2020 because of the coronavirus, or COVID-19.""The real question is what have the impacts already been and what are they likely to be going forward,"" Smith said.On the upside, he said all live lobster that was in China before the Chinese New Year, which is when the outbreak hit, has now been eaten or further processed.Smith said when the markets resume, this represents a multimillion dollar export opportunity.Restaurants in China have adapted by offering takeaway and delivery services, while demand has picked up for frozen products produced by Clearwater.Smith said retail and e-commerce sales in China are up so far this year, but not enough to offset lost food service business.Clearwater has diverted live lobster to other areas while it monitors the impact of the outbreak in China and around the world.The company has seen no disruption or change in order patterns from customers in Europe and North America, except for one exception: lower sales to Asian grocery stores and restaurants in North America, which is a small piece of its business.Clearwater also ships frozen products to China on container vessels, primarily Arctic surf clams caught off Cape Breton and Newfoundland.Atlantic Canadian containerized exports to China are mostly frozen seafood and agriculture products.Each week, between 100 and 200 containers from the Port of Halifax arrive in China, where some cargo has been stalled by the outbreak.Nova Scotia Fisheries and Aquaculture Minister Keith Colwell said it's fortunate the cargo is frozen and not perishable.The ""jam up"" in giant ports like Shanghai left shippers from Atlantic Canada with few options as port workers were either ordered to stay home or unable to go to work, said Yang Xue, a Halifax-based export consultant.He predicts the bottleneck will end as Chinese people return to work and port staff work around the clock to clear backlogs.""They are fully staffed. I think this will be resolved in the next week or two,"" he said.St. John's-based Ocean Choice International ships frozen shrimp, sea cucumber, yellowtail flounder and redfish to China.""We have shipped products to China since the coronavirus outbreak, and while we have experienced some delays associated with customs clearance and logistics once the shipments reach China, we have not experienced any major delays that have caused issues,"" said spokesperson Cara Pike.A spokesperson for frozen french fry maker Cavendish Farms, which is owned by J.D. Irving Ltd., says the company ""has not seen any delays/impacts to our export program due to coronavirus.""Meanwhile at Clearwater, Smith said containers shipped to China in December — it takes 45 to 60 days to get there — are moving from the port to their intended destinations.""We continue to sell our products in China. In March alone, we are forecast to sell hundreds of thousands of pounds of new orders, not just for clams, but also for other species to our Chinese customers,"" he said.MORE TOP STORIES"

Health Canada issues recall of some KN95 masks made in China | CBC News,Health Canada has issued a recall of KN95 respirators manufactured by dozens of Chinese companies because they “pose a health and safety risk to end users.”,2020-05-13T23:38:01.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/health-canada-issues-recall-of-some-kn95-masks-made-in-china-1.5568734,"Health Canada has issued a recall of KN95 respirators manufactured by dozens of Chinese companies because they ""pose a health and safety risk to end users."" In a bulletin issued to Canadian importers and distributors on Monday, Health Canada warned that some KN95 masks recently tested by the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health ""failed to meet 95 per cent filtration specifications."" NIOSH, part of the U.S.-based Centers for Disease Control, is responsible for conducting research and making recommendations to prevent work-related injury and sickness.""Health Canada cannot reasonably conclude that the benefits associated with having the KN95 Filtering Facepiece Respirator available in Canada, as currently labelled, outweigh the risks,"" the May 11 bulletin says. The bulletin, titled Recall of KN95 Respirators, was sent to companies across Canada that are authorized to import or distribute supplies for use in hospitals or other health-care institutions. It notes that some of these companies may have imported and sold masks that have now been recalled.The bulletin does not say how many KN95 masks have been imported to Canada. Read the full bulletin here.For hospital workers in the COVID-19 pandemic, N95 masks have become the health-care standard in personal protective equipment because they are designed to filter out at least 95 per cent of airborne particles. The recalled masks are made to the Chinese standard, KN95, which is also supposed to filter out more than 95 per cent of particulates. But NIOSH tests found that some masks filtered out as little as one per cent. ""Manufacturers of concern are only those that failed to meet 95 per cent filtration specifications,"" says the recall notice. According to Health Canada's website, it started authorizing the use of KN95 masks for medical purposes in light of the pandemic.""To expand the availability of N95 respirators during the pandemic, equivalent alternate standards may also be acceptable …this includes both medical and commercial (non-medical) KN95... respirators,"" the site says.Health Canada indicates the N95 and KN95 standards are similar ""with respect to design, filtration, performance and materials standards.""  However, it says that ""recent testing performed by the CDC resulted in concerns with some KN95 respirators (specifically those with ear loop design) that pose a difficulty in achieving a proper fit, which is essential for use.""Health Canada notes that by contrast the headband design on other KN95 masks offers a proper fit and seal. Ottawa also noted that some KN95 respirators failed to meet the 95 per cent filtration standard.Earlier this month, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) made a decision similar to Health Canada's. It published a list of products produced by dozens of Chinese manufacturers declaring they ""are no longer authorized."" The FDA started allowing the sale of the KN95 masks for medical use in the US since early April under an ""emergency use authorization."" Despite the concern about the quality of many KN95 masks, Ottawa says ""this action does not implicate KN95 respirators purchased by the Government of Canada and tested by the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC).""It says that before it sends masks to front-line workers they are subjected to quality tests including a ""visual inspection to check for defects in design and construction, and testing to confirm that they meet filtering specifications."" Last week, Ottawa revealed that it had suspended shipment of millions of Chinese-made masks because they failed to meet the required specifications. Federal government rejects 8 million N95 masks from single distributorAccording to the federal government's website, as of May 7 it has ordered 135 million N95 respirators. The site says so far 11.5 million have arrived but ""a significant portion of these remain under testing."" So far Ottawa has determined eight million of those masks fall below federal standards for medical use while others are still being tested.  Of the 11.5 million N95 masks received so far, Ottawa says one million have been found to meet federal standards. Ottawa urged any importer that brought in KN95 masks from any of the dozens of China-based manufacturer's listed on the NIOSH website to take immediate action and ""stop sale"" of the products. It added that they should relabel the KN95 respirators as face masks which can be used in health care or non-healthcare settings where 95 per cent filtration isn't necessary. ""The products are not being removed from the market,"" says Health Canada.Ottawa also instructed importers to alert their Canadian customers immediately. It says it will still allow KN95 masks into the country provided independent testing shows the masks meet the standards."

He lives with his girlfriend, who is Chinese. Wuhan is where the virus that has brought the world to its knees was first detected, and the city has been on lockdown every since. That is now easing, with people allowed out of their homes. ""We left our apartment a little bit at the beginning to go grocery shopping, when it wasn't so strict, but then about a week into that they said you can't go out at all. Now we have our groceries brought to us,"" Henshaw said. It's been 62 days since people have been told to stay indoors, and Henshaw said that like here in Canada, people have been getting together using social media, with entire neighbourhoods arranging for large grocery delivery orders that get dropped off at doorsteps. ""Someone from the community will say, 'Hey, I need vegetables, does anyone else need vegetables?' and then 50 people get together, and one person contacts the grocery store and send a city bus filled with food,"" Henshaw said. ""The bags get dropped off and the individuals pick up their bags and go back home."" Henshaw has help from his girlfriend, with whom he lives, so he can order food and navigate other parts of life in China without knowing the language very well. He's been spending his time like many Canadians are now — reading, watching movies and television (he's partial to Schitt's Creek) and working out from home, as well as learning to make Chinese dumplings. He's also been making English-language teaching videos for his students. Hey <a href=""https://twitter.com/danjlevy?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">@danjlevy</a> I wanted to let you know that as a Canadian living in Wuhan China during the <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/Coronavirus?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#Coronavirus</a> my gf and I have loved watching <a href=""https://twitter.com/SchittsCreek?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">@SchittsCreek</a> .

"South China Sea dispute to get Hague court ruling soon, to China's chagrin | CBC News","An international court said it would deliver a hotly anticipated ruling in the Philippines' case against China over the South China Sea on July 12, drawing an immediate rebuke from Beijing, which rejects the tribunal's jurisdiction.",2016-06-30T04:23:33.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/south-china-sea-court-ruling-1.3659328,"An international court said it would deliver a hotly anticipated ruling in the Philippines' case against China over the South China Sea on July 12, drawing an immediate rebuke from Beijing, which rejects the tribunal's jurisdiction.The United States, which is a close ally of the Philippines and is concerned about China's expansive South China Sea claims, reiterated its backing for The Hague-based Permanent Court of Arbitration and urged a peaceful resolution of the dispute.Manila is contesting China's historical claim to about 90 per cent of the South China Sea, one of the world's busiest shipping lanes. Several Southeast Asian states have overlapping claims in the sea and the dispute has sparked concerns of a military confrontation that could disrupt global trade.In a lengthy statement, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Hong Lei said Manila's unilateral approach flouted international law.""I again stress that the arbitration court has no jurisdiction in the case and on the relevant matter, and should not hold hearings or make a ruling,"" he said.He said: ""On the issue of territory and disputes over maritime delineation, China does not accept any dispute resolution from a third party and does not accept any dispute resolution forced on China.""In Manila, presidential communications secretary Herminio Coloma Jr said the Philippines ""expects a just and fair ruling that will promote peace and stability in the region.""U.S. state department spokeswoman Anna Richey-Allen reiterated U.S. backing for the court. ""We support the peaceful resolution of disputes in the South China Sea, including the use of international legal mechanisms such as arbitration,"" she said.China's official Xinhua news agency said the court was a ""law-abusing tribunal"" that had ""widely contested jurisdiction."" It said the case would only worsen the dispute.""Manila fails to see that such an arbitration will only stir up more trouble in the South China Sea, which doesn't serve the interests of the concerned parties in the least,"" it said.China's bases its South China Sea claim on a so-called ""Nine Dash line"" stretching deep into the maritime heart of southeast Asia and covering hundreds of disputed islands and reefs, rich fishing grounds and oil and gas deposits.A ruling against Beijing ""would deprive China of any legal basis for making such a claim,"" Paul Reichler, the Philippines' chief lawyer in the case told Reuters.For China to reject the ruling meant it had ""essentially declared themselves an outlaw state"" that did not respect the rule of law, Reichler said.The Philippines argues that China's claim violates the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea and restricts its rights to exploit resources and fishing areas within its exclusive economic zone. While the territorial dispute over the South China Sea was a key issue, priority would be given to crushing Islamist militants in the Philippines, Manila's new defence minister Delfin Lorenzana told Reuters.Lorenzana's comments about his priorities will add to uncertainty about incoming Philippines president Rodrigo Duterte position on the dispute. Duterte has said he would confront Beijing but also said he would engage through dialogue. U.S. officials are worried China may respond to what is widely expected to be a negative ruling for Beijing by declaring an air defense identification zone in the South China Sea, as it did in the East China Sea in 2013, and by stepping up its building and fortification of artificial islands.U.S. officials say that beyond diplomatic pressure, the U.S. response to such moves could include accelerated ""freedom-of-navigation"" patrols by U.S. warships and overflights by U.S. aircraft as well as increased defense aid to southeast Asian countries.China has accused the United States of ""hyping"" the issue and warned in May that international complaints about its actions in the South China Sea would snap back on its critics. But it has largely avoided specific comments on how it might respond to the arbitration ruling.Tensions have spread ahead of the ruling, with Indonesia's president ordering an expansion of offshore oil exploration and commercial fishing in waters near the Natuna Islands, where Indonesian navy vessels and Chinese fishermen recently clashed."

Hong Kong bookseller sentenced to 10 years in prison in China | CBC News,"A court in eastern China has sentenced a Swedish seller of books that took a skeptical look at the ruling Communist Party to 10 years in prison for ""illegally providing intelligence overseas,"" in a further sign of Beijing's hard line toward its critics.",2020-02-25T13:14:25.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/china-bookseller-sentence-1.5474918,"A court in eastern China has sentenced a Swedish seller of books that took a skeptical look at the ruling Communist Party to 10 years in prison for ""illegally providing intelligence overseas,"" in a further sign of Beijing's hard line toward its critics.Gui Minhai first disappeared in 2015, when he was believed to have been abducted by Chinese agents from his seaside home in Thailand. He and four others who worked for the same Hong Kong publishing company all went missing around the same time, only to turn up months later in police custody in mainland China.The Ningbo Intermediate People's Court announced Tuesday that it gave Gui, a naturalized Swedish citizen, a 10-year prison sentence. Gui admitted to his crime, agreed with the sentence and will not appeal, the court said.For years, Gui sold gossipy books about Chinese leaders in the semi-autonomous Chinese region of Hong Kong. His was among a spate of high-profile disappearances that stirred unease over the central government's growing reach in Hong Kong, a former British colony that has been promised greater democratic rights than are afforded the mainland.China maintains tight control over all information and brooks no criticism of its ruling Communist Party. It has detained scores of lawyers, writers and public intellectuals. In recent months, police have reprimanded medical workers who warned about the ongoing outbreak of a new virus that originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan.Amnesty International's China researcher Patrick Poon said the verdict demonstrated that ""the Chinese authorities are not letting the coronavirus crisis distract them from repressing dissidents.""""Despite the authorities' claim that Gui has somehow handed over `intelligence' while in their custody, the reason for his targeting almost certainly relates to his attempted trip to Beijing with two Swedish diplomats in 2018,"" Poon said in an emailed statement.The court claims that Gui, who was born in Ningbo, applied to reinstate his Chinese citizenship in 2018. That would mean renouncing his Swedish citizenship, as China does not officially allow dual citizenship.He was initially released into house arrest in Ningbo, then police detained him once again while he and two Swedish diplomats were on a train together bound for Beijing.""We have noted the reports and are now seeking official confirmation about the case,"" the Swedish foreign ministry said in an email to The Associated Press. ""We have consistently made it clear that we demand Gui Minhai be released so that he can be reunited with his daughter and family.""The foreign ministry said that Sweden was not given access to the trial, and that officials there were unable to review the indictment or offer Gui access to legal counsel.""We demand — once again — that we immediately be given consular access,"" the ministry said.Gui's arrest has been a source of friction between Beijing and Stockholm. In November, Sweden's culture minister awarded the bookseller the annual Tucholsky literary prize despite a threat from the Chinese ambassador to ban her from entering the country.Standing next to Gui's empty seat at a ceremony in Stockholm, Culture Minister Amanda Lind said it was ""crucial for culture and democracy that artists and authors can work freely.""Human rights groups have repeatedly accused China of extracting forced confessions from individuals it perceives to be opponents of the Communist Party's rule.""We demand Gui Minhai's release,"" Swedish Foreign Minister Ann Linde told Sweden's public broadcaster SVT.She stressed that Sweden was not informed about the trial and that the country will use ""all diplomatic tools"" to protest.""We got no information that this was going on and had not had access to either the trial or been allowed to see the charges,"" Linde told SVT. ""This is not at all in line with how diplomatic consular work is going. We have the right to gain access to Swedish citizens. We have demanded it, but didn't get it.""Repeating an assertion often made by Beijing when its judicial system faces scrutiny, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said at a daily briefing, ""China is a country ruled by law.""""Gui Minhai's legal rights and interests have been fully protected,"" Zhao said, adding that China opposes outside interference into its internal affairs."

""Once this is hopefully moved on and been rectified or settles down, then we'll revisit those travel plans.""Chris Busch, assistant vice-president of enrolment management at the University of Windsor, said his institution has put in place a similar freeze on trips to China. According to Busch, recruitment trips, as well as reciprocal exchange programs where UWindsor students study abroad in China have been paused or rescheduled ""until the coronavirus outbreak has been addressed to our satisfaction.""The university's decision to pause trips to China was made earlier this week, and the decision was made at the same time for each group of travellers. Busch said a lot of UWindsor faculty made the decision themselves ""that they did not want to travel and, therefore, we're very supportive of that.""Any costs associated with postponing the trips will be taken on by the university, Busch added. The university has already issued a statement on its website informing students about the coronavirus. Additionally, Busch said, students can seek support through student health counselling and wellness services, as well as through the My Student Support Program (MySSP).""It's available live, it's in simplified Chinese and other languages too,"" Busch said. Though China is one of the largest sources of incoming foreign students, Busch said the number of people who go to China is low. ""I would say the number would be somewhere between 30 and 40 per semester,"" he said. Windsor Regional Hospital has tested a handful of people for coronavirus. There are currently no confirmed coronavirus cases in Windsor-Essex region. The latest figures published by the World Health Organization (WHO) have approximately 31,480 confirmed coronavirus cases across 24 countries. Approximately 31,000 confirmed cases are in China, where 637 people have died to date. One person has died of coronavirus outside of China. According to Health Canada, there are still three confirmed cases in Ontario and two confirmed cases in B.C. On Thursday, B.C's provincial health officer identified two presumptive cases in the province. Ontario's chief medical officer said on Thursday that 62 people are still being tested for coronavirus in the province. "
China sentences Canadian to death for drug operation | CBC News,"A court in southern China has handed down sentences to at least six foreigners involved in a global methamphetamine operation, including a Canadian sentenced to death.",2019-04-30T11:02:41.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/china-sentences-canadian-death-drugs-1.5116336,"A court in southern China has handed down sentences to at least six foreigners involved in a global methamphetamine operation, including a Canadian given the death penalty.The Jiangmen Intermediate People's Court on Tuesday sentenced 11 people, including an American and four Mexicans, who produced more than 63 kilograms of the illegal drug. The Canadian was identified as Fan Wei, but it was unclear whether that's a legal name.A person identified as Wu Ziping was also sentenced to death; the court did not give Wu's nationality.Fan and Wu were the only two to receive the death penalty, according to CNN.The sentence is likely to further strain relations between Canada and China. Canada arrested a Chinese tech executive last December at the request of the U.S., and since then China has detained two Canadians and delayed some Canadian exports in apparent retaliation.Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland condemned the penalty.""We're very concerned by this sentence,"" she said Tuesday morning. ""Canada stands firmly opposed to the use of the death penalty everywhere around the world. We think that this is a cruel and inhumane punishment which should not be used in any country.""We are obviously particularly concerned when it is applied to Canadians.""According to the court, Fan and Wu conspired to manufacture and sell the drugs in 2012, and brought the others — described as ""drug-making technicians"" — on board. Between July and November of that year, the court says, the group set up a ""den"" in Guangdong's Taishan city, where they produced and sold more than 63 kilograms of methamphetamine and 365.9 grams of dimethyl amphetamine.A court employee reached by phone declined to give further details.Global Affairs Canada said Canadian officials have been following the case and providing consular assistance to Fan and his family since he was first detained in 2012. Canadian officials also attended the April 30, 2019 verdict and sentencing.""We call on China to grant clemency for Mr. Fan,"" said spokesperson Guillaume Bérubé.""It is of extreme concern to our government that China has chosen to apply the death penalty, a cruel and inhumane punishment.""GAC is providing no further details, citing privacy issues.In a separate drug-smuggling case, China sentenced Canadian Robert Lloyd Schellenberg to death in a sudden retrial in January — one month after Canadians Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor were detained on vague national security allegations. The moves were widely seen as punishment for Canada's arrest of Meng Wanzhou, chief financial officer of the Chinese telecom company Huawei.Freeland did not say Tuesday whether she believes the latest death sentence is in retaliation for the arrest of Meng.China has also suspended the licence of two major Canadian canola exporters, alleging officials discovered hazardous organisms in canola seed shipments."
China shrugs off criticism over Canadian's death sentence | CBC News,"China says it's ""not worried in the slightest"" by mounting international concern over the death sentence handed to Canadian Robert Schellenberg for drug smuggling.",2019-01-16T12:23:31.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/china-international-criticism-death-sentence-canadian-1.4980001,"China said on Wednesday it's ""not worried in the slightest"" by mounting international concern over the death sentence handed to a Canadian for drug smuggling.Monday's sentence for Robert Schellenberg for smuggling 222 kilograms of methamphetamines prompted Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to accuse China of ""arbitrarily"" applying the death penalty.The United Nations said it was opposed to the death penalty apart from exceptional circumstances, and Australia's acting foreign affairs minister, Simon Birmingham, said he was ""deeply concerned"" by the case.Speaking at a daily news briefing in Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said Canada's ""so-called allies could be counted on 10 fingers"" and that they do not represent ""the entire international community.""""I can very clearly state that we are not worried in the slightest,"" Hua said of the mounting outcry, adding that a majority of Chinese supported severe punishment for drug crimes.Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland dismissed the remark saying Canada is getting far more support from its allies than perhaps the Chinese regime is prepared to admit. ""The EU alone, which has issued a statement, is a union of 28 countries and we're very pleased to have the support from the EU which is a great partner and ally,"" Freeland told reporters in Saint-Hyacinthe, Que. ""It is of course on the basis of friendship with Canada, but more than that, it is on the basis of a much broader recognition of the principle that we are speaking out about that we are getting such strong support from our allies,"" she added. CBC NewsFreeland added that she had spoken with U.S. Secretary of State Michael Pompeo on Tuesday and had not only received support from him on that call, but was pleased to see that support was made public in a statement earlier today. The statement said Freeland and Pompeo ""expressed their concerns about the arbitrary detentions and politically motivated sentencing of Canadian nationals.""Freeland attributed her allies support to efforts being made by Trudeau who she said ""has been energetically reaching out to our allies and explaining that the arbitrary detentions of Canadians are not just about Canada, they represent a way of behaving which is a threat to all countries.'Schellenberg's sentence has further strained relations between China and Canada, already aggravated by the December arrest in Vancouver of Meng Wanzhou, chief financial officer of Huawei Technologies, on a U.S. extradition request as part of an investigation into suspected violations of U.S. trade sanctions.Days after Meng's arrest in Vancouver, China detained two Canadians on suspicion of endangering state security.China has not linked any of the three Canadians' cases to Meng's arrest, but has warned of severe consequences if she was not immediately released.The Global Times, a state-run tabloid with a nationalistic bent, said China ""cannot be weak at this time.""""Canada does not have any special cards that can allow Chinese law to bow its head to it,"" the newspaper said in an editorial on Wednesday. It also said Canada's protests would have no effect.CBC NewsFreeland said Tuesday that Ottawa had formally applied for clemency for Schellenberg, as it usually does for citizens condemned to death abroad.When asked if China typically listened to this type of request, Hua said the judiciary was not subject to ""interference from administrative organs.""""You ask whether China is willing to listen to the Canadian side's request, but I don't know if Canada's leaders or politicians have seriously listened to China's solemn position.""We have very clearly outlined the case's facts and its seriousness,"" she added.Schellenberg had appealed a 15-year prison sentence issued in November, but the court in Liaoning province sided with prosecutors who argued at a retrial that the punishment was too light.A lawyer for Schellenberg, Zhang Dongshuo, said his client would appeal."
"Bookings from China down 70%, says B.C. tourism organization | CBC News",Canada's tourism industry is bracing for the impact of the novel coronavirus on the number of foreign visitors this summer travel season.,2020-03-04T20:27:56.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/bookings-from-china-down-70-bc-tourism-coronavirus-covid-19-1.5485493,"Canada's tourism industry is bracing for the impact of the novel coronavirus on the number of foreign visitors this summer travel season.Some people in the industry are already seeing a change in the number of people coming from overseas, particularly from China — the second-largest long-haul market for Canada-bound tourists, and where the virus outbreak began.""Bookings are down from China by about 70 per cent between March and October, so that's obviously quite considerable,'' said Maya Lange, the vice-president of global marketing with Destination B.C., a Crown corporation focused on attracting visitors to the province.Several airlines have restricted the number of flights to the country, and some people have had difficulties getting visas due to temporary closures at some application centres.Several Canadian tourism marketing agencies have pulled all their ad money from China and are using it to double down on efforts to attract people from other markets like the United States and United Kingdom.According to Statistics Canada, there were 571,000 tourist arrivals from China in 2019.""In the past, in any one of our markets, when exceptional circumstances have occurred, we have taken similar actions to ensure our tourism marketing efforts are impactful,'' said Tess Messmer, a spokesperson for Destination Canada, a Crown corporation focused on marketing Canada abroad.The corporation said China remains an important market and it will still work with online travel agencies and travel media there.Tourism Ottawa has also pulled its ad dollars out of China, but said it hopes to maintain a relationship with Chinese tour providers and other contacts.""We know that this will end at some point and we want to continue the relationship, we don't want to abandon the gains that we've made in any markets,'' said spokesperson Jantine Van Kregten.Chinese travellers, while heavily sought after by the Canadian tourism industry, still make up a relatively small portion of Canada's annual visitors, Lange said.She was expected to give a presentation to members of B.C.'s tourism industry Wednesday, with a focus on what to expect if the novel coronavirus continues to spread globally.She said during the SARS outbreak in 2003, tourists from within Canada and the U.S. still vacationed.""So, we do think those markets will continue to travel, obviously if Canada continues as a safe destination,'' she said.There are hopes within the industry, too, that the tourism shortfall will be offset by Canadians travelling within Canada.Michael Ballingall with Big White Ski resort said the resort is seeing cancellations from Italy and Spain.""But the magic is, we're starting to see bookings from Ontario for Ontario spring break,"" he added.The virus has spread from China to more than 70 countries. Canada is still considered a safe place to visit, with a low risk of transmission of the virus.So far, 33 cases of the virus have been confirmed domestically, with 20 in Ontario, 12 in B.C. and one in Quebec. All of them have been linked to people who have recently returned from abroad and their close contacts.Premier John Horgan told travellers at a news conference Wednesday that the province is safe.""British Columbia is relatively free of incidents or cases,"" said Horgan. ""So I think people should be comfortable that they can participate in the community.""Health Minister Patty Hajdu said the federal government is preparing for a large influx of international travellers during the upcoming tourist season, but was not specific about those plans.Federal and provincial health authorities in Ontario and B.C. have so far not issued special instructions about large gatherings like events and festivals, calling it ""business as usual.""""If there's a need to change that, it will be a conversation with the federal government, provincial government, and something we'll look at locally based on the risk of the infection and the benefits of maintaining societal functioning,"" said Dr. Vera Etches, Ottawa's top local public health official.Still, health authorities warn the situation in Canada and abroad has been changing rapidly and everyone needs to be ready to adjust.""For event planners, I would say you need to do a risk assessment on an ongoing basis,'' Dr. Bonnie Henry, B.C.'s provincial health officer."

Interpol president reported missing during trip to China | CBC News,"Meng Hongwei, Interpol's president, boarded a plane and arrived in China, according to a French judicial official. But then, nothing. His wife, who put out a call on Friday, said she hasn't heard from her 64-year-old husband since the end of September, the official said.",2018-10-05T23:38:55.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/interpol-president-missing-1.4853196,"He left his home in Lyon, France, for a visit to his homeland, and then vanished — putting the International Criminal Police Organization, best known as Interpol, at the centre of its own missing persons case.Meng Hongwei, Interpol's president, boarded a plane and arrived in China, according to a French judicial official. But then, nothing. His wife, who put out a call on Friday, said she hasn't heard from her 64-year-old husband since the end of September, the official said.To make matters murkier, Meng is not just the head of Interpol: He's also a vice-minister for public safety in China.Interpol, based in Lyon, would say only that reports that its president is missing is ""a matter for the relevant authorities in both France and China.""France launched its own investigation on Friday morning, according to a judicial official who wasn't authorized to speak publicly and asked for anonymity.Whether China was taking action was unknown. But the South China Morning Post, a Hong Kong newspaper, hinted that Meng may have been the latest target of an ongoing campaign against corruption in China.The newspaper said that upon landing last week Meng was ""taken away"" for questioning by what it said were ""discipline authorities."" The term usually describes investigators in the ruling Communist Party who probe graft and political disloyalty. The Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, the party's secretive internal investigation agency, had no announcements on its website about Meng and could not be reached for comment.Meng is the first from his country to serve as Interpol's president, a post that is largely symbolic but powerful in status and not without political weight. But because Interpol's secretary general is responsible for the day-to-day running of the police agency's operations, Meng's absence may have little operational effect.Far from being a Hollywood-style agency with agents toting weapons across the globe, Interpol is low-profile and discreet about its cases, unless it wants to talk.The organization links up police officials of its 192 member states, who can use Interpol to disseminate their search for a fugitive or a missing person. Only at the behest of a country does the information go public via a ""red notice,"" the closest thing to an international arrest warrant. ""Yellow notices"" are issued for missing persons.But Interpol walks a fine line between its noble mission — facilitating international police co-operation — and the politics and policies of some of its member countries.Meng's appointment as president in 2016 — amid Chinese leader Xi Jinping's sweeping anti-corruption drive — alarmed some human rights organizations, fearful it would embolden China to strike out at dissidents and refugees abroad.Such actions would be contrary to Interpol's mission statement: ""Action is taken within the limits of existing laws in different countries and in the spirit of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights."" It adds that ""intervention or activities of a political, military, religious or racial character"" are prohibited.Meng has a shiny curriculum vitae, having held down various positions within China's security establishment, including as a vice-minister of public security — the national police force — since 2004. In the meantime, he served as head and deputy head of branches of the coast guard, all while holding positions at Interpol. His term in Lyon runs until 2020.His duties in China would have put him in close proximity to former leaders, some who had fallen afoul of Xi's campaign. He likely dealt extensively with former security chief Zhou Yongkang, now serving a life sentence for corruption.Xi has placed a premium on getting officials and businesspeople accused of fraud and corruption to return from abroad, making Meng's position even more sensitive.The anti-corruption drive recently drew headlines after the disappearance three months ago of X-Men star Fan Bingbing, one of the country's best-known actresses.Watch: Movie star Fan Bingbing's disappearance raises questionsThe NationalHer whereabouts remain unknown. But on Thursday, Chinese tax authorities spoke publicly about her disappearance, ordering her and companies she represents to pay taxes and penalties totalling $130 million US. Fan is being fined around $70 million personally for tax evasion.

From Manitoba to China: Donated masks will help front-line workers battle coronavirus | CBC News,"Thousands of sorely needed protective masks are at a Winnipeg UPS store, ready to be shipped to front-line health-care workers at a hospital in northeastern China in the midst of a coronavirus outbreak.",2020-02-19T20:34:03.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/not-just-tourists-coronavirus-masks-china-1.5467232,"Thousands of sorely needed protective masks are at a Winnipeg UPS store, ready to be shipped to front-line health-care workers at a hospital in northeastern China in the midst of a coronavirus outbreak.The Manitoba chapter of Not Just Tourists had more than 5,000 N95 small particulate masks donated months ago because they were considered surplus, donation co-ordinator Dolores Friesen said.""That is the type of mask you need to use to protect yourself if you're working with a virus such as the outbreak that's going on in China right now,"" Friesen said.""We had several boxes of these masks just sitting there, not sure how we were going to get these masks ever used.""Not Just Tourists pairs travellers with suitcases of surplus medical supplies such as gauze, syringes and surgical instruments to take with them wherever they go. While they're on vacation, they drop off the suitcase at a clinic or hospital registered with the organization.Up until now, there wasn't much demand for these particular masks.Then Friesen, who is a nurse, heard from a former colleague and friend, Dr. John Ducas, a St. Boniface Hospital cardiologist who volunteers with an organization called Bethune Bai Qiuen Canadian Alliance, which provides health-care support for hospitals and clinics in China.A doctor Ducas has worked with a number of times got in touch recently, desperate for N95 masks.More than 1,700 health-care workers in China have been infected with COVID-19, including five who died. The novel coronavirus has spread widely throughout China, even though Chinese New Year celebrations were cancelled and the government has promoted hand-washing, wearing medical masks and seeking immediate medical attention.Earlier this month, the World Health Organization announced a chronic shortage of gowns, masks, gloves and other personal protective equipment in every region, but especially China. The WHO is working to distribute the equipment to those who need it, and health-care workers are the first priority.Although the hospital the masks are going to isn't in Wuhan, the epicentre of the epidemic, it's still in need, Ducas said.""It's at least 500 kilometres away, but that doesn't stop a virus,"" he said.""This is a relatively large hospital. There's lots of people in and out of there. This is a potential hazard to the health-care workers and to the patients. There are Chinese health-care workers that have gotten this infection and have died.""Friesen knows first-hand how important personal protective equipment is. She was a nurse in a Winnipeg intensive care unit when serious respiratory illnesses SARS and H1N1 were on the minds of Manitobans and claiming lives around the world.""I can understand how important it is to get these supplies in the hands of the people that need it, like, right now,"" she said.""I can't even imagine what it would be like to be doing that and not have enough supplies to protect yourself.… That would just be horrendous.""The boxes of masks are at a UPS store in Winnipeg, waiting to be shipped out, as Ducas sorts out the customs rules with his colleagues in China.The masks likely would be thrown away if it wasn't for Not Just Tourists.""These are supplies that would have been thrown in a landfill here and instead, they're now going to be repurposed for something really important,"" Friesen said."

But China has pledged to buy $32 billion worth of American agricultural products over the next two years, including lobster and other seafood products.Rahaman says the Chinese government has the clout to compel its companies to switch back to lobster from the United States.He calls it ""pseudo-capitalism.""""They have private corporations who are heavily indebted to state-owned banks and, through that channel, China can actually direct trade and commerce,"" he said.""I understand there is a lot of skepticism on whether they will actually follow through on the promises they have made. But if they really want to do it they can deliver on this promise.""Rahaman added: ""We're going to pay a price in terms of our seafood market access to the Chinese market.""Keith Colwell, Nova Scotia's minister of fisheries and aquaculture, said the province has nothing to fear.

Coronavirus deaths surpass 400 in China as new hospital for infected opens | CBC News,The number of deaths in China from the rapidly spreading coronavirus surpassed 400 on Monday as the central government sent medical workers to a newly built hospital and further restricted people's movement in sweeping new steps to contain the illness.,2020-02-03T10:59:26.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/china-coronavirus-wuhan-health-1.5449626,"The latest: The number of deaths in China from the rapidly spreading coronavirus surpassed 400 on Monday as the central government sent medical workers to a newly built hospital and further restricted people's movement in sweeping new steps to contain the illness.China's National Health Commission said the number of deaths in the country rose to 425 as of the end of Monday, up by 64 from the previous day. Of the new deaths, all were in central Hubei province, the epicentre of the virus outbreak. In the provincial capital of Wuhan, 48 people died.Across China, there were 3,235 new confirmed infections on Monday, bringing the total number so far to 20,438.Meanwhile, Hong Kong reported its first coronavirus death Tuesday, according to local news broadcaster TVB, the second fatality outside mainland China.The 39-year-old male had previously been reported by local authorities as having an underlying illness. Hong Kong has had 15 confirmed cases including one that was transmitted locally. With Wuhan and some other Chinese cities in virtual lockdown, travel severely restricted, and China facing increasing international isolation, fears of wider economic disruption are growing.Earlier Monday, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported the number of confirmed cases outside China had reached 153. WHO said the number of cases will keep growing because tests are pending on thousands of suspected cases.Reopening of schools was also delayed to keep the virus from spreading further in Hubei, where the 1,000-bed hospital in the provincial capital Wuhan was completed in just 10 days. A second hospital with 1,500 beds will open within days. Restrictions were tightened still further in one city by allowing only one family member to venture out to buy supplies every other day.Separately, a Chinese woman suspected of spreading the virus asymptomatically while in Germany for a business meeting on Jan. 20, was determined, in fact, to be exhibiting symptoms. The German government's public health agency wrote to the New England Journal of Medicine, which first falsely reported the case on Thursday, to correct the mistake. The report had stoked fears that the outbreak could be much harder to control if people could spread the virus before they appeared sick. Medical teams from the People's Liberation Army were arriving in Wuhan to relieve overwhelmed health workers and to work at the new hospital, located in the countryside far from the city centre. Its prefabricated wards, where patients began arriving by late morning, are equipped with state-of-the-art medical equipment and ventilation systems.Leading Chinese epidemiologist Zhong Nanshan said additional hospital space was crucial to stopping the spread of new infections.""The lack of hospital rooms forced sick people to return home, which is extremely dangerous. So having additional [beds] available is a great improvement,"" Zhong told state broadcaster CCTV.Zhong played a major role in overcoming China's 2002-2003 outbreak of SARS, a coronavirus from the same family as the current pathogen.WATCH | What we actually know about the coronavirus:CBC NewsIn a sign of the economic toll of the outbreak, China's Shanghai Composite index plunged 8.7 per cent when it reopened Monday following the Lunar New Year holiday. It steadied later on the central bank's moves to inject cash.""We are fully confident in and capable of minimizing the epidemic's impact on economy,"" Lian Weiliang, deputy chief of the National Development and Reform Commission, said at a news conference in Beijing.Meanwhile, health ministers from the Group of Seven (G7), which includes Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the U.K., the U.S., and the EU, agreed to co-ordinate their response to dealing with coronavirus on Monday, the German health ministry said.The ministers agreed to co-ordinate their approach on travel regulations and precautions, research into the new virus and co-operation with WHO and China.""An appropriate response to the virus can only be co-ordinated internationally and at European level. Because a virus knows neither borders nor nationalities,"" German Health Minister Jens Spahn said in a statement.Canada's public health agency says there have been four confirmed coronavirus cases here — three in Ontario and one in B.C. The overall risk to Canadians from the disease is low, the Public Health Agency of Canada says. The first two confirmed cases were reported in Toronto after a couple returned from a trip to China that officials said included travel to the Wuhan area. One patient was treated in hospital and then released. The other was in self-isolation in their home.The next case was confirmed in B.C., and the most recent case was in London, Ont. Both of these patients had travelled to the Wuhan area in China.In Canada, efforts continued Monday to get Canadians who want to leave out of the affected area.Ottawa is currently working with China to arrange flights out of Wuhan for more than 300 Canadians. It's not yet clear when the flight will happen, but Foreign Affairs Minister François-Philippe Champagne said planning is well underway and a second plane will be available if needed.Canada's Health Minister Patty Hajdu said Monday there's no indication that any of the Canadians who have asked for help getting out of Wuhan have the coronavirus. Hajdu also noted that officials don't expect that anybody with symptoms of the virus would be allowed by Chinese authorities to get on the flight.Even without signs of the virus, Canadians who are on the flight out of Wuhan will be quarantined at a military base for two weeks to prevent the spread of the virus, Global Affairs Canada said over the weekend.Brazil will join Canada and a number of other nations by repatriating their citizens from Wuhan, said Brazilian Health Minister Luiz Henrique Mandetta on Monday, adding the country will declare a national health emergency later in the week. On Monday, the CDC confirmed that there had been a second case of person-to-person transfer of the coronavirus. The first such case in the U.S. had been reported last week. The U.S. said Sunday that Americans who had travelled in China within the last 14 days would be routed to designated airports for enhanced health screenings and most non-Americans who recently were in China would be denied entry.Carrie Lam announced Monday that Hong Kong will shut almost all land and sea border control points to the mainland from midnight to stem the spread of the virus. She said only two border checkpoints — at Shenzhen Bay and the bridge to Macao and Zhuhai — will remain open.Lam denied that the move was due to pressure from medical workers. Some hospital workers went on strike Monday and more threatened to walk out on Tuesday unless the government agrees to talks.Hong Kong has recorded 15 cases of the virus and has cut flights and train and bus connections to the mainland, but a push is growing for it to close the border completely.Strike organizers say about 6,000 medical staff were prepared to participate. Hong Kong was severely impacted by the SARS outbreak, which many believe was intensified by official Chinese secrecy and obfuscation.This, on same day Beijing denounces foreign governments (esp US) who have moved to close borders to travelers from China, calling the moves ‘unnecessary’ and ‘excessive’.

The U.S., Japan, Singapore, Indonesia, New Zealand and Australia have imposed similar restrictions despite criticism from China and WHO's guidance that such measures were unnecessary.WATCH | Hospital workers in Hong Kong press for stronger border controls amid outbreak:WorldOn Monday, China accused the U.S. of spreading fear by pulling its nationals out of Wuhan and restricting travel instead of offering significant aid.Washington has ""unceasingly manufactured and spread panic,"" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told reporters, noting that the WHO had advised against trade and travel curbs.""It is precisely developed countries like the United States with strong epidemic prevention capabilities and facilities that have taken the lead in imposing excessive restrictions contrary to WHO recommendations,"" she added.About 150 cases have been reported in two dozen other countries. The Philippine Health Department said a 44-year-old Chinese man from Wuhan died from the virus and his companion remained hospitalized. Vietnam's confirmed cases increased to eight, including a Vietnamese American man who had a two-hour layover in Wuhan on his way from the U.S. to Ho Chi Minh City.Amid accusations of a slow official response to the outbreak, six officials in the city of Huanggang, next to Wuhan in Hubei province, were fired over ""poor performance"" in handling the outbreak, the official Xinhua News Agency reported. It cited the mayor as saying the city's ""capabilities to treat the patients remained inadequate and there is a severe shortage in medical supplies such as protective suits and medical masks.""The trading and manufacturing centre of Wenzhou, with nearly 10 million people in coastal Zhejiang province, confined people to their homes, allowing only one family member to venture out every other day to buy necessary supplies.

The statement also said the patients are in stable condition and their close contacts have been placed under medical observation.The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission said in a statement that 136 new cases of coronavirus had been discovered in the city on Saturday and Sunday.As of late Sunday, 198 cases in total had been reported in Wuhan, including three deaths. Some 170 people were still being treated in the hospital, while 25 had been cured, it said.The statement gave no further details of the latest death toll.Outside China, two cases have been reported in Thailand and one in Japan, all involving people from Wuhan or who recently visited the city. South Korea on Monday reported its first confirmed case, a 35-year-old  female Chinese national who had travelled from Wuhan.Beijing said on Sunday it will increase efforts to contain the coronavirus outbreak, while health authorities around the world are working to prevent its spread.Chinese President Xi Jinping said on Monday the country would curb the spread of the outbreak, state television reported.""People's lives and health should be given top priority and the spread of the outbreak should be resolutely curbed,"" it quoted Xi as saying.Bundled up in winter clothes as they head home for the Lunar New Year holiday amid a health scare over the mysterious new virus, Chinese travellers on the teeming concourse of Beijing West station were evenly split between the masked and the barefaced.Covering up was clearly the best decision for many of the passengers waiting to board the packed train carriages for the five hour journey to Wuhan, the epicentre of an outbreak that has sent shivers through the world's most populous country.Going back to her hometown, 28-year-old Tan Jie has been ribbed at work about the danger of contracting the new coronavirus, but the blue surgical mask on her face shows she is taking the risk seriously.""My Beijing colleagues joked and said 'when you come back to work, we'll have to quarantine you for two weeks,'"" Tan said, trying to make light of the dampener the scare has put on the most important holiday for Chinese families.Liao Guang and her husband are looking forward to being reunited with their two-year-old child in Yichang, a city in the same province as Wuhan, and rushed to buy masks before travelling, as alarm spread on social media after the number of confirmed cases tripled over the weekend. ""All the trending items were about this pneumonia outbreak, so I thought we should buy a mask and take some kind of a preventative measure,"" said Liao, a 26-year-old, trailing a wheelie bag.""I think during this [holiday], we're not going to go out too much, and probably won't go to places with a lot of people, like the movie theatre.""In response to an outbreak in China caused by a novel (new) <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/coronavirus?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#coronavirus</a>, <a href=""https://twitter.com/CDCgov?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">@CDCgov</a> will begin health screenings of travelers arriving from <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/Wuhan?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#Wuhan</a>, China at SFO. <a href=""https://t.co/UhQlPGuwGD"">https://t.co/UhQlPGuwGD</a> <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/novelcoronavirus?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#novelcoronavirus</a> <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/2019nCoV?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#2019nCoV</a> <a href=""https://t.co/N1opzql4nf"">https://t.co/N1opzql4nf</a>The virus belongs in the same family of coronaviruses as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which killed nearly 800 people globally during a 2002/03 outbreak that also started in China.

Who's the Canadian leading WHO's coronavirus investigation in China? | CBC News,A renowned Canadian doctor and emergencies specialist is leading a team of international experts investigating the coronavirus outbreak on the ground in China.,2020-02-12T09:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/coronavirus-china-who-bruce-aylward-1.5459615,"A renowned Canadian doctor and top emergencies official is leading an international team of experts for the World Health Organization investigating the coronavirus outbreak on the ground in China.The front-line team was formed after WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus secured an agreement with Chinese President Xi Jinping in late January allowing them entry into the country to conduct the investigation.""A lot of people are asking, 'Where is the outbreak going? Is it getting better? Is it getting worse?'"" Ghebreyesus said at a media briefing Monday. ""An advanced team of WHO experts has just arrived in China, led by Dr. Bruce Aylward, to lay the groundwork for the larger international team.""I’ve just been at the airport seeing off members of an advance team for the <a href=""https://twitter.com/WHO?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">@WHO</a>-led <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/2019nCoV?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#2019nCoV</a> international expert mission to <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/China?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#China</a>, led by Dr Bruce Aylward, veteran of past public health emergencies.Tedros said Aylward will be working with between 10 and 15 colleagues, who have yet to be named, and their Chinese counterparts to get the ""right expertise on the team to answer the right questions"" about the outbreak.Limited information has been provided publicly about the team's mission or where specifically it will be operating — and it has taken them two weeks to get into China at a critical time during the outbreak. A native of St. John's, N.L., Aylward joined WHO in 1992 after completing his medical training at Memorial University, the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine and the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health.CBC News was unable to reach Aylward for an interview, but a spokesperson for WHO said they would provide more information about the mission as it becomes available.""Bruce has always been adventuresome. He chose a career that was cutting edge in terms of world health,"" said Dr. Ian Bowmer, the president of the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada and a former Memorial University professor who Aylward credited for his interest in infectious diseases. ""I think he's incredibly well positioned to take the lead for the World Health Organization.""Aylward is highly experienced in infectious disease control, having led WHO's response to the Ebola outbreak in West Africa and mass immunization programs throughout Asia, and has been instrumental in the ongoing efforts to eradicate polio worldwide.In 1998, he headed up WHO's collaboration with the Global Polio Eradication Initiative, a public-private partnership with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.""He was essentially the person who led the initiative related to the eradication of polio for WHO,"" said former Ontario Chief Medical of Health Dr. Arlene King. ""He's very familiar with the landscape in China and some of the sensitivities that he will need to navigate in order to be ... successful there."" With more than 50 million people in quarantine near the epicentre of the outbreak in the central Chinese province of Hubei, Aylward is entering a ""complex and difficult situation"" but he is a ""trusted voice,"" said senior WHO adviser Dr. Chris Maher.""China has really pulled out all the stops in trying to respond to [the outbreak], so it's not an easy situation to be operating in,"" Maher said. ""But I think this is right up Bruce's alley, it's the sort of thing that he enjoys and does well, so he's a good choice to go in.""From 2014 to 2016, Aylward helped develop WHO's Health Emergencies Programme and directed more than 2,000 people in WHO's on-the-ground response to the Ebola outbreak in West Africa.Aylward also led WHO's response to the Zika virus outbreak in Latin America and Caribbean nations in 2016, declaring a global public health emergency and investigating the link between the virus and microcephaly.""He has had to deal with governments at the highest levels in all regions of the world, and all of those experiences have to be very important for him in China,"" said former U.S. ambassador John Lange, the UN Foundation Senior Fellow for Global Health Diplomacy.""It's hard to imagine that there are many people in the world with such varied experiences directly relevant to the kind of work that he's doing."" Aylward's career is not without criticism, however. He faced backlash for WHO's handling of the effort to fight the Ebola epidemic in 2014. An investigation by the Associated Press in 2015 found a string of avoidable errors badly undermined the work of international aid workers, including a lack of resources, expired supplies and a delay in declaring an international emergency.Aylward, who was then WHO's top Ebola official, said it was common for Ebola treatment centres to be caught up in political wrangling. ""Undoubtedly in some cases there was bureaucracy,"" he said at the time, adding it was wrong to lay the blame at WHO's door. ""These were government decisions at the end of the day.""But a quicker and more effective response to the epidemic from WHO would have resulted in far fewer deaths, said Dr. Irwin Redlener, director of the National Center for Disaster Preparedness at Columbia University in New York, at the time. ""I personally would have no confidence that the same team at WHO would be able to handle the next international outbreak,"" Redlener told the Associated Press. ""We've already seen what the old leadership at WHO has been able to do, so I don't know why we would expect them to be able to right themselves."""

That means staying home from work or school and avoiding contact with others.And scores of Calgarians are trying to comply, even though some of them didn't even visit high-risk areas. Glen Wang is one of them. He arrived home in Calgary from China at the end of January.""I was not near Wuhan at all,"" he said.Wang said he feels his exposure risk was very low, but that he wanted to self isolate just in case.""It's a sensible and reasonable thing to do for myself, for my family and also for the society,"" he said.""It's two weeks of inconvenience but it's worth it.""If he has any needs, Wang doesn't have to look very far. His friends and neighbours have been dropping off things such as bananas and milk for him.And if he needs any more help, he can turn to the newly formed Calgary Chinese Support and Relief group.Jinny Jin is a volunteer with that group.""We do airport pickup and drop off. And we help to do grocery shopping,"" she said.Jin says the group has nearly 400 volunteers already.She hopes more people will come forward to help ensure the safety of all Albertans. "

China slaps down Canada's concerns about Muslim rights | CBC News,"China said Thursday that 15 foreign ambassadors, including the envoy from Canada, exceeded their diplomatic roles by issuing a letter expressing concern about the incarceration of hundreds of thousands of members of the country's Muslim minorities in re-education camps.",2018-11-15T14:23:47.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/china-canada-uighurs-letter-1.4906522,"A move spearheaded by Canada that enlisted global allies in an effort to rebuke Beijing for its repression and surveillance of Muslim populations in Xinjiang is being criticized by the Chinese leadership.  China said Thursday that 15 foreign ambassadors, including the envoy from Canada, exceeded their diplomatic roles by issuing a letter expressing concern about the incarceration of hundreds of thousands of members of the country's Muslim minorities in re-education camps.Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying told reporters at a daily briefing that it would be ""problematic"" if the diplomats were attempting to put pressure on local authorities in the northwestern region of Xinjiang, where the detentions have taken place.Hua said the letter violated the terms of the Vienna Convention governing diplomatic relations, and that the ambassadors should not ""interfere in the internal affairs of other countries.""""As ambassadors, they are supposed to play positive roles in promoting mutual understanding, mutual trust and co-operation ... rather than making unreasonable requests to the countries where they are based,"" Hua said.She said the letter issued this week and reportedly spearheaded by Canada's ambassador, John McCallum, was based on hearsay, despite widely distributed reports from detainees, relatives and officials documenting the sweeping and seemingly arbitrary detentions.Inmates and relatives say the camps impose military-style discipline and punishments and force detainees to renounce their religion and culture while swearing fealty to President Xi Jinping and the ruling Communist Party.""As part of the Universal Periodic Review, Canada called on China to release Uyghurs and other Muslims who have been detained arbitrarily and without due process due to their ethnicity or religion,"" Global Affairs Canada said in a statement. ""We also called for China to end the prosecution and persecution on the basis of religion or belief, including for Muslims.""Asked about the letter, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said he had ""highlighted the questions and concerns that we have"" surrounding the issue in his bilateral meeting with Chinese Premier Li Keqiang on the sidelines of the annual summit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations in Singapore.""Canada will continue to look for ways to advance and promote human rights in partnership with our like-minded allies everywhere around the world,"" Trudeau said at a news conference Thursday.The letter to the Chinese government has not been made public, but Reuters said it was signed by 15 Western ambassadors, including the Canadian, British, French, Swiss, European Union, German, and Australian envoys.Diplomats from the countries named in the report either did not reply to requests for confirmation or said they had no comment.Hua's comments came as a bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers is bringing a measure to urge President Donald Trump to help Chinese Muslims respond to the crackdown.The legislation would urge Trump to condemn ""gross violations"" of human rights in Xinjiang, where the UN estimates that as many as one million Uighurs and other predominantly Muslim minorities are being held in arbitrary detention.It would also support an existing push for sanctions against Xinjiang Communist Party chief Chen Quanguo and other officials under the Magnitsky Act, which prevents foreign officials from entering the U.S. and freezes any assets they have in U.S. banks.Other sanctions raised for consideration by the act include a ban on sales of U.S.-made goods or services to Xinjiang state agents such as those that could be used for surveillance and suppression.Chinese authorities have denied that the internment camps exist, but say petty criminals are sent to ""employment training centres."" The Xinjiang government has revised regulations to officially permit the use of ""education and training centres"" to reform ""people influenced by extremism.""The rules direct the centres to teach the Mandarin language, occupational and legal education, as well as ""ideological education, psychological rehabilitation and behaviour correction.""Xinjiang's native Uighur and Kazakh ethnic groups are culturally, religiously and linguistically distinct from China's Han majority, and the region has been home to a low-intensity rebellion against rule from Beijing. Many of the region's natives say their culture is under threat from Chinese policies aiming to assimilate them and that they face disadvantages in education and employment from Han migrants from other parts of China.Members of the Muslim Hui ethnic group — culturally and linguistically closer to the Han — have also been ensnared in the campaign that has drawn comparisons to Mao Zedong's radical 1966-76 Cultural Revolution.Also on Thursday, China's cabinet released a report titled ""Protection and Development of Xinjiang Culture"" that stressed the importance of adopting Mandarin Chinese among ethnic groups and referred to their Islamic faith as ""religious culture.""""Xinjiang adheres to the historical tradition of the Sinosization of religion and actively adapts religion to socialist society,"" the report said."

Most of the flights the agency books to Asian destinations have a layover in Beijing or Shanghai. ""No one wants to take the risk,"" said Law. Law has also received several calls from travellers in China who want to come back to Montreal sooner than planned. It isn't just vacations Montrealers are cancelling.

Nova Scotia secures 2 direct charter flights from China | CBC News,Premier Stephen McNeil is hoping two direct charter flights from China next year are the first of many to come.,2019-12-05T18:11:54.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/travel-tourism-china-airline-nova-scotia-1.5385525,"Nova Scotia Premier Stephen McNeil is hoping two direct charter flights from China next year are the first of many to come.In late September and early October of 2020, flights carrying as many as 271 tourists on a Boeing 787-9 will travel directly from the city of Guangzhou to Halifax via China Southern Airlines. Passengers on the two flights will have the option to buy travel packages that would see them also visit parts of New Brunswick and P.E.I. while in Canada.McNeil said it's his hope that if the two trips go well, it will lead to more charters and ultimately help make the case for a direct commercial flight between China and Atlantic Canada, something he's been working on for four years.""Oftentimes Transport Canada looks at the central part of our country and looks at [the] West Coast when it comes to the Asia market,"" he told reporters in Halifax on Thursday.""We need them to look at providing us with an opportunity to have a direct flight into Atlantic Canada.McNeil said the previously announced air access fund will be used to backstop the venture, but he's not anticipating a need to tap into the money.""We believe there's no question we'll sell out these flights.""Tourism Nova Scotia CEO Michele Saran said they're looking to China as a key part of efforts to grow the industry here and she believes ""Nova Scotia is the next hot spot for the Chinese visitor.""Saran said it would be her hope to eventually have charters twice a week from May until the end of October each year. Canada saw 1.6 million inbound visitors from China in 2019. Saran said the goal is to get more of those people coming to Atlantic Canada and she believes the charters represent a big step toward that effort.Tourism Nova Scotia has set a goal of growing the number of tourists from China to Nova Scotia from the 2018 total of 5,000 to 50,000 by 2024. It's a challenging goal, said Saran, but one she believes is possible.Although the federal government has issued a travel advisory for people going to China, McNeil said he doesn't have any safety concerns about the area they are targeting.""If my children wanted to go, I'd be more than happy to send them to China,"" he said.""Where we're going into — Guangzhou — is a very metropolitan part of China. It's an extraordinary city and the region provides Nova Scotians and Canadians with, I believe, a wonderful taste of Chinese culture.""He noted that many Canadian business people continue to go back and forth freely between the two countries without issue and McNeil said Nova Scotia needs to be involved.""Our national governments will solve the issues associated between our two national governments, but at the same time we need to continue this partnership to grow the economic fortunes of our citizens.""China continues to hold Canadian citizens Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig on what are widely believed to be arbitrary grounds as retaliation for Canada detaining Huawei chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou.Tory Leader Tim Houston said ""it's bizarre"" for McNeil to be promoting tourism with China while the federal government has a travel advisory in place.""It's kind of a bit surprising, I guess, the way they continue to be all in on that particular file.""Houston said the province should instead focus on targeting other markets."

Situated one province to the south is Hubei, whose capital city, Wuhan, is considered the epicentre of the recent coronavirus outbreak.""It's a bit tense,"" Walsh told The St. John's Morning Show. ""There's a lot of people who are afraid. Everybody is staying inside, staying at home, trying to be safe.""Walsh, who is married to a Chinese woman, moved to Xi'an eight months ago with their two-year-old son.They've found themselves in a state of fear around a potentially deadly virus. As of Wednesday, 6,000 people had been infected, and 132 people are confirmed dead.Coronaviruses are a broad group of viruses that can include the common cold but also more severe respiratory illnesses like SARS. The recent outbreak involves a specific strain known as 2019-nCoV.Millions of people fled Wuhan before the city was locked down. Authorities are now stopping people on buses and at checkpoints around Xi'an, looking for people who may have left.""They're looking for Wuhan people, or from the province of Hubei,"" Walsh said. The last time they attempted to take the highway, Walsh and his family were stuck at a checkpoint for two hours as authorities checked the temperatures of each person passing through. He watched as they took a person out of the car behind them, alleging he was from Wuhan.Walsh's temperature had a high reading on the first test, but registered as normal on a second test. They were allowed to pass through.He drew comparisons to the state of emergency in Newfoundland last week, saying all stores are closed except for essential retailers, like grocery stores and gas stations.While only 56 people have been infected in his entire province, Walsh said the concerns are still rising as they watch the numbers increase day after day in the neighbouring province of Hubei.""You don't know how quickly this is going to spread and you don't know how deadly it can be.""The family has an important decision to make this week. They had planned a vacation to Japan for the first week of February, but are now considering whether it's safer to leave the country, or if going to the busy airport will only put them at a greater risk.""We have to make a big decision on what is safest for our family,"" he said.In Canada, the risk remains low. A husband and wife in Ontario are the only two confirmed cases in Canada, while there is one presumptive case in British Columbia.On Wednesday afternoon, Air Canada announced it was suspending flights to Beijing and Shanghai.Read more from CBC Newfoundland and Labrador"

Trump says U.S.-China trade deal will be signed on Jan. 15 | CBC News,"U.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday that Phase 1 of the trade deal with China would be signed on Jan. 15 at the White House, though considerable confusion remains about the details of the agreement.",2019-12-31T16:21:54.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/us-china-trade-deal-phase-one-1.5411534,"U.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday that Phase 1 of the trade deal with China would be signed on Jan. 15 at the White House, though considerable confusion remains about the details of the agreement.The president wrote in a tweet that he would sign the deal with ""high level representatives of China"" and that he would later travel to Beijing to begin talks on the next phase.Last week, Trump said he and Chinese President Xi Jinping would host a signing ceremony to ink the Phase 1 deal.The deal, struck earlier this month, is expected to reduce tariffs and boost Chinese purchases of American farm, energy and manufactured goods while addressing some disputes over intellectual property.I will be signing our very large and comprehensive Phase One Trade Deal with China on January 15. The ceremony will take place at the White House. High level representatives of China will be present. At a later date I will be going to Beijing where talks will begin on Phase Two!However, no version of the text has been made public, and Chinese officials have yet to publicly commit to key planks, such as increasing imports of U.S. goods to $200 billion US, nearly doubling U.S. exports to China.The United States launched a trade war against Beijing a year and half ago over allegations of unfair trade practices, such as theft of U.S. intellectual property and subsidies that unfairly benefit Chinese state-owned companies.The deal was particularly hard on U.S. agricultural producers, who were cut off or severely reduced in their access to the Chinese market.The United States Trade Representative said the Phase 1 deal includes stronger Chinese legal protections for patents, trademarks, copyrights, including improved criminal and civil procedures to combat online infringement, pirated and counterfeit goods.Issues such as industrial subsidies would be addressed in a later deal, U.S. authorities said."
"Security fears, political tensions souring China's relations with Central Europe | CBC News","A half-decade ago, China planted an economic flag in Central Europe with its multi-billion-dollar Belt and Road plan to build a vast infrastructure network. Five years on, though, some of those countries are finding the relationship increasingly uncomfortable.",2019-11-30T09:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/china-belt-and-road-central-europe-1.5370854,"This story is part of a CBC News series exploring China's expanding influence around the world and how Canada and other countries are contending with China's power.A half-decade ago, China planted an economic flag in Central Europe with its multi-billion-dollar plan to build a vast infrastructure network of roads, railways, pipelines and ports. Just like elsewhere in the world, China touted its Belt and Road Initiative as a deal that would stretch far into the future and bind countries together under Chinese investment and benevolent guidance. Five years on, though, some of those countries are finding the Chinese embrace increasingly uncomfortable. Case in point: early this year, Polish authorities arrested two people suspected of espionage. One of those was Wang Weijing, a Chinese senior manager in Poland for the telecom manufacturer Huawei Technologies. The other man arrested was a Pole, a friend of Wang's who had access to highly sensitive Polish telecommunications work.""I am wrongfully accused,"" Wang said to Reuters in July. ""Not to mention that finding a spy in Huawei is a perfect excuse to kick Huawei out of Poland.""Wrongfully accused or not, Huawei almost immediately said it had fired him. The Poles have held him in prison for 11 months.""The case is unequivocal,"" said Polish President Andrzej Duda in July.That's not good news for Wang or China.The stakes in Poland are major. Huawei has invested more than $1 billion US in the country and has promised to invest hundreds of millions more if it gets a prized 5G contract from the Polish government next year.  But Poland now finds itself at the centre of a power struggle between China and the United States. The U.S. in May effectively banned the purchase of Huawei equipment by U.S. telecoms, arguing that the equipment made the U.S. vulnerable to Chinese spying. It also urged allies to impose similar bans.Duda has gently referred to ""an impasse"" in Poland's relations with China, which could lead to China losing the big 5G contract. The Chinese have hinted quietly that they could move their investments elsewhere if they do.Meanwhile, next door in the Czech Republic, the stakes are lower but the argument is much louder and more public. It revolves around a sister city agreement between Prague and Beijing that collapsed in recriminations and reprisals in October. The Chinese insisted on including in the sister city accord a clause saying both cities endorsed the One China policy, which implicitly recognizes China's sovereignty over Taiwan, as well as Hong Kong and Tibet. The mayor of Prague, Zdenek Hrib, said politics had no place in a sister city agreement and wanted it removed.""Our conscience is not for sale,"" said Michaela Krausová, a leading member of the governing party of the Prague city council.The Chinese refused despite the fact that sister city agreements between Beijing and other Western cities, notably London, Riga and Cologne, contained no such clause.Hrib is a new mayor from the ranks of a new party, the Pirate Party, which was set up to shake up Czech politics. He took office last year and five months later, visited Taiwan. He also flew the Tibetan flag over Prague city hall. The Chinese were not amused. Matters were not improved when the Czech cybersecurity watchdog warned against using Huawei equipment, saying it posed security threats.Hrib's symbolic actions infuriated the Chinese government. In the spring of 2019 it abruptly cancelled a tour of China by the Prague Philharmonic Orchestra.""Prague's inappropriate behaviour is the fundamental reason that the city's leaders are not welcome by the Chinese people,"" said Geng Shuang, the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman.Other cultural tours were also cancelled. In October, the Prague city council definitively rejected the sister city accord, and the Chinese Embassy talked openly of reprisals.The Czech foreign minister, Tomas Petricek, responded angrily: ""Diplomacy is not conducted with threats."" Hrib went further.""China would do better to concentrate on its previous promises of investment,"" he said. ""They weren't fulfilled. Refusing the Prague Philharmonic tour after the contract was signed shows that China is not a reliable economic partner.""That was a direct slap in the face of the Chinese. It was also aimed at Czech President Milos Zeman. Over four years, he had carved out a very China-friendly policy, much to the annoyance of the European Union. The Pirate insurgency threatens it. ""It's very easy to create unfriendly relations,"" Zeman told the Chinese ambassador in September. ""The mayor of Prague has little experience in such affairs, but I must say the Chinese response was excessive.""Zeman had invited massive Chinese investment and in the beginning got it. According to the Czech National Bank, there were Chinese investments of more than $1.3 billion in 2015-2016.  But these have been reversed. In the last two years, almost $800 million has been withdrawn.One of the reasons is that the head of the big investment company pouring the money in, Ye Jianming, has been detained for corruption by the Chinese. His company has imploded. This is particularly embarrassing to Zeman because he had made Ye an economic adviser, a high-profile if symbolic role.Zeman said in October that one of the investments that did materialize, a major stake in Prague's biggest professional soccer team, has been sold off as part of the Chinese reprisals. To add to the confusion, the team itself doesn't seem to know about this.Chinese reprisals might lead to a large drop in the number of Chinese tourists to Prague. Last year, 650,000 people from China visited the city. Czech sinologist Olga Lomova professed herself unconcerned in an interview with Czech radio in October.""We have too many tourists already. I don't think it would be a loss.""The Chinese have hardly given up on their overtures to central and southern Europe. Instead, they hint they could move their Polish investment to Hungary, run by the hard-right Prime Minister Viktor Orban. The Hungarian government would be delighted. It's already the largest recipient in Central Europe of Chinese investment with more than $5 billion, and in 2017 signed a strategic partnership agreement with China.Within days of the arrest of Wang in Poland, Gergely Gulyas, a senior Hungarian minister attached to the prime minister's office, announced: ""The Hungarian government sees no security risk"" in Huawei technology. In other words, bring it on.And the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, continues to do the rounds, most recently in Italy and Greece, promising enticing new investments and stirring up old quarrels by suggesting the Elgin marbles — priceless sculptures from the Parthenon now in the British Museum —  belong in Athens.And in Brussels, the EU does little but wring its hands. To do more would risk further alienating the leaders of Central Europe, who are openly critical of the union that has showered subsidies on them for 15 years. Central European leaders have shown you can bite the hand that feeds you. With, so far, few consequences."

It's a well-travelled road in the middle of Beijing, normally full of dangerous cars and hurtling buses.On this day, it's a safe stroll to the other side.For almost three weeks, Beijing has been a ghost town, eerily empty from Tiananmen Square to its freeway-like ring roads.People are just starting to trickle back after China's listless Lunar New Year holidays, extended this year to keep them from spreading the coronavirus further through travel and a return to work.""I can feel how serious it is,"" said Jin Yang, on his first day back as a foreign exchange worker. ""I've never experienced anything like it.""Iconic attractions like the Forbidden City are shuttered, subways largely unridden, malls and airports avoided. Schools and universities have been closed indefinitely.At some of the restaurants and stores that are open, masked shopkeepers hand you your purchase at the door to limit contact.Indeed, the entire megacity of more than 20 million people echoes with the epidemic.The virus's epicentre may be a thousand kilometres south in the province of Hubei, where more than 60 million people are locked down by decree, but the nervousness has spread to the capital and engulfed the whole country.With more than a thousand dead and tens of thousands infected in China, Beijingers are hunkered down in their apartments — partly because of new rules about who can come and go, but mostly because of fear.Residents have built improvised barricades out of bamboo sticks, traffic barriers and even bikes piled high and chained together around their compounds. Signs warn strangers away, especially those from the infected city of Wuhan.""I'm upset and worried about the virus,"" said Liu Likun, reached by video chat inside his apartment.He and his wife have locked the door, stocked the fridge and sent their three-year-old son to stay with grandparents in a village outside Beijing.""I miss my son,"" said mother Liu Yingjie, appearing on the video screen next to her husband.

""These days, there is no absolute safety from the virus in China. But it's the best we can do.""Indeed, daily life everywhere is improvised or suspended. Most office workers do their jobs online or on the phone from home. Many factories and workshops are idle, despite government attempts to keep the economy from stalling completely.There's a lot of spare time.

They act on tips from neighbours and then — as online videos have shown — squads arrive to forcefully remove entire families and send them off to quarantine in police vans.Is all of this really necessary?""Probably,"" said Ian Lipkin, an American epidemiologist who has been in Beijing to advise the Chinese government on how to handle the coronavirus epidemic.Mass lockdowns on this scale are unprecedented, he said, and it's unclear if they will work.""We don't have anything else to offer at present,"" Lipkin said. ""This is really the most transmissible virus that I've seen in many, many years.""With no proven medicine or treatment, and a vaccine at least 18 months away according to the World Health Organization, ""isolation"" is the only alternative, Lipkin said.""And unfortunately, I don't think that's going to be voluntary. It's difficult.""WATCH | Workers at an industrial complex in Chongqing make their way through disinfecting mist tunnels:WorldIf the virus spreads more widely around the globe, Lipkin said, countries like Canada and the United States will also have to consider measures such as involuntary quarantine, even if it raises far more complicated questions of personal rights than it does in an authoritarian state like China.Even here, some don't accept the need for heavy-handed lockdowns or even quarantines.Outside an apartment building in Beijing, Zhao Zaixin plays in the snow with his three-year-old daughter.

"Canada is waking up to China's quest for a 'new world order', says Japanese observer | CBC News","One of Japan’s top academics says China is trying to create its own new world order and leading Western democracies, including Canada, have begun to look at their relationship with the rising superpower through that lens.",2020-02-16T09:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/china-totalitarianism-xi-jinping-canada-japan-1.5465067,"One of Japan's top academics says China is trying to create its own new world order — and leading Western democracies, Canada included, have started to look at their relationship with the rising superpower through that lens.For the last several years, Junya Nishino's research has been focused on his country's relationship with South and North Korea. North Korean leader Kim Jong-un's outbursts gave him plenty to work on.But it has been hard for the demure, precise professor of political science to ignore an increasingly assertive Beijing, its provocative actions and the amount of time and political energy being expended by Japan's leaders on the China relationship.While acknowledging China is an ""indispensable"" economic power for his country and Western nations, Nishino said the policy of engagement based solely on trade and business interests has failed.""We have to keep in mind that China is a very different regime,"" he told CBC News in a recent interview. ""China is not a democratic country. China is an authoritarian system. So we always need to pay close attention.""Since the 1990s, Western countries — with Canada in the vanguard — have pursued a policy of helping Beijing build up an affluent middle class through liberalized trade and investment, in the long-term hope that it would lead to a more democratic country.Over the last several years, however, it has become apparent, in a variety of ways, that the Chinese leadership has no interest in moving in that direction.China's President Xi Jinping, with the full support of his party, rewrote the country's constitution in March 2018 and scrapped term limits, essentially allowing him to stay in office for life.The surprise move came as Beijing pressed claims over the South China Sea, built up its military and launched a global infrastructure plan known as the Belt and Road Initiative.The country also drastically enhanced domestic security and enforced ideological purity standards in schools and the media.At the same conference that extended his grip on power, Xi told Chinese lawmakers and political advisers that his country's brand of authoritarian capitalism is a ""new type of political party system"" that would benefit the rest of the world.""From the Japanese perspective, clearly, China is trying to create its own new order, not only in East Asia, but the world,"" said Nishino.A year ago, writing in the Qiushi Journal, the Chinese Communist Party's (CCP) main theoretical magazine, Xi insisted that his country ""must never copy the models or practices of other countries.""Western-style separation of powers — the bedrock of democratic institutions — held no appeal for China, Xi wrote, arguing that the party must remain supreme.""We must never follow the path of Western 'constitutionalism,' 'separation of powers' or 'judicial independence,''' Xi wrote.Those sentiments made Nishino and other China-watchers sit up and take notice.""We and China have very different values and we need to keep this in mind,"" said Nishino, who has been speaking to Canadian officials and audiences over the past week.After an initial flurry of interest among Europeans in the Belt and Road Initiative, he said, there now seems to be a wariness among Western countries — and they'd do well to avoid the plan.During President Barack Obama's second term, the U.S. recognized that China had changed and began to take a harder line. Such an approach is more difficult for Japan to take because of geography.Relations between Tokyo and Beijing run hot and cold, thanks in large part to tension over eight uninhabited islands — little more than hunks of rock — in the East China Sea.Both countries lay claim to the islands, which are known as the Diaoyu islands in China and as the Senkaku islands in Japan.But China remains Japan's most important trading and economic partner and the business communities in both countries have tried to keep a positive and constructive relationship going.The challenge of keeping that constructive relationship alive is more intense in Japan than it is in Canada, but the problems facing both countries are not dissimilar. China is deeply embedded in the supply chains of Western democracies.And there lies the problem shared by Canada and Japan, Nishino said. Japan has been trying to strike a balance between a tough security policy and a healthy trading relationship. The Trump administration can afford to be bellicose and fight a trade war with China. Canada and Japan cannot.Japan has been working hard to find a way to ""co-exist"" with China without being pushed around, Nishino said.What's left unanswered — especially in light of Beijing's hostage diplomacy over Canada's detention and possible extradition of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou — is how difficult co-existence will be going forward."

China reduces imports from North Korea | CBC News,"China has reduced its total imports from North Korea by as much as 86 per cent, while exports to the North have dropped by as much as 34 per cent.",2018-04-07T10:37:21.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/china-north-korea-imports-1.4609739,"As the U.S.-North Korea summit looms, President Donald Trump's maximum pressure policy on North Korea may be working — thanks to China.Beijing appears to have gone well beyond UN sanctions on its unruly neighbour, reducing its total imports from North Korea in the first two months this year by 78.5 and 86.1 per cent in value — a decline that began in late 2017, according to the latest trade data from China. Its exports to the North also dropped by 33 per cent to 34 per cent both months.The figures suggest that instead of being sidelined while North Korean leader Kim Jong-un made his surprising diplomatic overtures to Seoul and Washington, China's sustained game of hardball on trade with Pyongyang going back at least five months may have been the decisive factor in forcing Kim's hand.Trade with China is absolutely crucial to North Korea's survival.It accounts for the largest share of the North's dealings with the outside world and provides a lifeline to many of the necessities Pyongyang relies on to keep its nation fed and its economy from breaking down. Estimates vary, but it is believed that roughly half of all transactions in the North Korean economy are made in foreign currencies, with the Chinese yuan being the most common.That gives Beijing tremendous leverage, though for political and national security reasons it has generally been reluctant to exert too much pressure on Pyongyang.That reluctance is clearly wearing thin.The statistics need to be taken with a dose of caution. Neither country is known for its commitment to transparency. Even so, more specific data reveal an even tougher, targeted crackdown, according to Alex Wolf, a senior emerging markets economist with Aberdeen Standard Investments:""While China's role over the past few months has often been overlooked or little understood, it appears a strategy could be emerging: China wants to play a central role in 'resolving' this crisis, but wants to do it on its own terms,"" he wrote. ""It's increasingly clear that Chinese pressure is a driving force and China will play a central role in any future talks.""Kim announced in his New Year's address he would reach out to the South to ease tensions on the Korean Peninsula. He then agreed to hold a summit with South Korean President Moon Jae-in on April 27 and with Trump after that. But to the surprise of many, Kim suddenly showed up in Beijing first for a summit with President Xi Jinping last month, underscoring the continued primacy of China in North Korea's foreign relationships.Lu Chao, director of the Border Study Institute at the Liaoning Academy of Social Sciences, noted that China accounts for almost 80 per cent of the North's total trade, meaning the onus for implementing UN sanctions has been mainly borne by Beijing, whose enforcement has created ""huge pressure on North Korea.""""There is no doubt China is doing more than ever when it comes to sanctions,"" he said, adding restrictions on sales of textile and seafood products to North Korea imposed by China last autumn ""have dealt a huge blow to the country.""""China has played a very important role in promoting the current change of the situation,"" he said.The decrease in trade isn't just about politics.China's economy is also dealing with overproduction in many industries and its demand for North Korean imports is low. Efforts at joint development projects have languished and difficulties suffered by Chinese firms in North Korea — especially problems receiving payment — have soured enthusiasm for cross-border trade.But the deficit presents an obvious dilemma for the Kim regime: the more it depletes its foreign reserves by buying in excess of what it sells, the less money it has to buy anything at all. Normally, that would lead to inflation — and even hyperinflation — as imported necessities become scarcer and people who can afford to do so dump their holdings in the local currency to buy safer U.S. dollars or Chinese yuan.Georgetown University economist William Brown said he believes the North's current account deficit has risen dramatically since the strengthening last November of sanctions on North Korean exports by China, which he said are by now ""certainly biting.""""Why is Kim venturing his offer now? My impression is he is feeling very strong pressure from China's virtual embargo on North Korea's exports, and what he must see as a gradual ratcheting down of needed imports, even petroleum,"" Brown wrote in a recent blog post. ""This is an enormous economic hit of a sort the country has never had to deal with on this scale.""Brown believes an important indicator of the North's economic health will be movement of the unofficial but widely used exchange rate for the North Korean currency, which has been surprisingly stable at around 8,000 to the U.S. dollar for years but should now be under intense inflationary pressure.""China is giving us the chance, and (we should) use it cleverly to get what we want out of the nuclear program and systemic reform,"" he added. ""It's not so impossible if you realize everyone, even young Kim, can benefit.""​"

Plague in 2019? Why there's no reason to panic about China's recent cases | CBC News,It's not a headline that you expect to see in 2019. But plague is back in the news after China reported three cases of the infectious disease earlier this month. Here's why experts say there's no need to panic.,2019-11-23T09:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/plague-china-second-opinion-1.5370711,"This is an excerpt from Second Opinion, a weekly roundup of eclectic and under-the-radar health and medical science news emailed to subscribers every Saturday morning. If you haven't subscribed yet, you can do that by clicking here.It's not a headline that you expect to see in 2019. But plague is back in the news after China reported three cases of the infectious disease earlier this month.The first cases were recorded in a middle-aged couple from the remote region of Inner Mongolia, who were sent to Beijing for observation after struggling to breathe.The third case emerged last weekend: A hunter from the same region was diagnosed with bubonic plague after catching and eating a wild rabbit. About 28 people who were in close contact with the hunter were also put in quarantine.It's actually the second time this year plague has been found in the region; in May, a Mongolian couple died reportedly after eating raw marmot kidney, leading to a six-day quarantine in that region that stopped nine tourists from leaving. While the ""Black Death"" wiped out millions of people in the 14th century, making the term synonymous with destruction, experts caution the plague is relatively rare — and treatable — today. ""There are about 12 countries on the planet that have plague. And sporadic cases of plague, believe it or not, are expected in many of these countries,"" said Dr. Isaac Bogoch, an infectious disease specialist with Toronto General Hospital.The plague is caused by Yersinia pestis, a bacteria commonly found in rodents and their fleas.Bubonic plague, the most common form, is typically transmitted to humans through flea bites, or possibly from handling an infected animal. If left untreated, the bacteria can spread to the bloodstream, leading to septicemic plague, or the lungs, causing pneumonic plague. Pneumonic plague — the type reported in the first two China cases — is particularly troublesome as it can spread human to human via respiratory droplets released through coughing.Without medical intervention, these two forms can frequently be fatal, in part because plague is a rapidly progressing disease, said Dr. Paul Mead, chief of the bacterial diseases branch of the U.S.-based Centers for Disease Control (CDC).Most people will seek treatment well before these stages, said Mead, because at this point, patients will likely be ""very, very ill, perhaps within hours of death.""And while early symptoms of the plague are relatively mundane — fever, chills, headaches and weakness — there's also a ""hallmark"" sign that sends many to the hospital, adds Bogoch: Large, swollen and painful lymph nodes. Overall, upwards of 80 per cent of the world's cases are bubonic, easily treatable today with readily available antibiotics.""In the Middle Ages, of course, this was the pre-antibiotic era,"" said Bogoch. ""They didn't understand microbiology and how infections are acquired or transmitted, so the outcome was completely devastating.""But today, he said, the plague is simply a bacterial infection.""Fortunately, in most places … there is the capacity to diagnose and treat this infection,"" said Bogoch. ""People get treated and they get better. And most people who have timely access to medical care will live.""Even in the rare case of pneumonic plague, most modern health-care systems are much better equipped to contain it than in the 14th century, said Mead. ""Relatively simple interventions, such as a face mask, can prevent it.""According to the World Health Organization, there were 3,248 cases reported worldwide between 2010 and 2015, resulting in 584 deaths — a fatality rate of about 18 per cent.Those numbers jumped in 2017, with an ""unprecedented"" outbreak in Madagascar, one of three countries where plague is endemic. (The others are the Democratic Republic of Congo and Peru.)Over a few short months, 2,417 people were sickened, with about 200 deaths.But even in endemic countries like Madagascar, the plague has an element of seasonality, said Bogoch, meaning health officials can prepare for it. In Madagascar, the disease tends to make a comeback in September, at the beginning of its humid, rainy season, when there's also an abundance of rats.In some cases, officials may opt for antibiotic prophylaxis, providing medication before any potential outbreak, said Bogach.The plague also exists closer to home. There are about seven cases reported in the U.S. each year, according to the CDC, all clustered in the country's southwest corner.It is a nationally notifiable disease, said Mead, meaning local health officials monitor for it and report all cases. It's also enzootic, he said, meaning it regularly affects the animals of a particular region. ""It cycles between certain rodents, and it has for a long time,"" he said. ""For the most part, it's a disease of rural areas.""And though it's still rare by U.S. standards, Mead said health-care providers in certain regions know to look for it in patients. And those who work with wildlife are also monitoring for it.A group of plague-infested prairie dogs shut down a park near Denver this past summer, and two campgrounds in the picturesque Yosemite National Park were shuttered in 2015 after a child was hospitalized with the disease.The CDC says there have been 12 recorded deaths in the country since 2000. (By comparison, traffic deaths add up to around 40,000 Americans annually.)In Canada, plague is exceedingly rare, though the Public Health Agency of Canada also monitors for it. The last human case of plague here was reported in 1939.Still, the recent cases in China have sparked fear among some citizens, in part because the couple being treated for the contagious pneumonic plague were sent for treatment in the densely populated city of Beijing.That prompted the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention to put out a message on popular microblogging platform Weibo, cautioning that there was no need for residents to panic and that the risks of transmission were ""extremely low,"" according to the New York Times. The patients were quickly isolated, the Chinese CDC said, and epidemiological investigations were conducted on anyone who might have been exposed.While the three Chinese patients continue to be monitored, all this attention could actually be a blessing, said Dr. Shanthi Kappagoda, an infectious disease physician in Stanford, Calif., who specializes in travel-related illness.""I think a high level of alertness is actually great, because then cases won't be missed and people will be treated early,"" she said. But for anyone still concerned, Kappagoda offers this advice.""I think the general message should be: Do not panic,"" she said. ""We have effective treatment for this and we have good control measures both in our hospitals and our public health systems.""To read the entire Second Opinion newsletter every Saturday morning, please subscribe."

"Xi to visit India, weeks after China criticized unilateral action in Kashmir | CBC News","India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi will welcome Chinese President Xi Jinping at an informal summit this week, the Indian foreign ministry said on Wednesday, their talks coming at a time of strained ties over the disputed region of Kashmir.",2019-10-09T13:44:35.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/china-xi-modi-khan-1.5314467,"India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi will welcome Chinese President Xi Jinping at an informal summit this week, the Indian foreign ministry said on Wednesday, their talks coming at a time of strained ties over the disputed region of Kashmir.The meeting in the southern Indian city of Chennai on Friday and Saturday is aimed at enhancing the rapport the leaders built when they met in the Chinese city of Wuhan last year to help stabilize ties after a standoff in another contested section of their long border, far removed from Kashmir.The leaders of the two most populous countries in the world last met one-on-one at a resort in Wuhan, China, in April 2018.But India's decision in August to withdraw special status for the part of Kashmir they administer drew sharp condemnation from Pakistan and its old ally, China, which took the matter to the UN Security Council.India stripped Kashmir's semi-autonomous status in August, deploying thousands of troops and cutting off internet connectivity to prevent protests. Thousands of people, including mainstream political leaders and young people, have also been detained.During a meeting with Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan in Beijing on Wednesday, Xi said that he was watching the situation in Kashmir closely, the official Xinhua News Agency reported.Xi said that the right and wrong of the situation was clear and India and Pakistan should resolve the dispute via peaceful dialog, according to Xinhua.India says its revocation of the special status of Muslim-majority Kashmir, which was accompanied by a crackdown on dissent by the security forces, is an internal matter aimed at developing the Himalayan territory, which is also claimed by Pakistan, more quickly.India will make clear that any change to its Jammu and Kashmir state is an internal affair if the Chinese side were to raise the matter in the forthcoming talks, a government source said.he Himalayan region of Kashmir is divided between India, Pakistan and China. India rules the populous Kashmir Valley and the Hindu-dominated region around Jammu city, while Pakistan controls a wedge of territory in the west, and China holds a thinly populated high-altitude area in the north.China's close security ties with Pakistan have long been a matter of concern in New Delhi and in recent years India has drawn closer to the United States to help balance China's rising weight across the region.""The forthcoming Chennai Informal Summit will provide an opportunity for the two leaders to continue their discussions on overarching issues of bilateral, regional and global importance and to exchange views on deepening India-China Closer Development Partnership,"" the Indian ministry said in a statement.China, which has been criticized by the United States for its treatment of members of Muslim ethnic minorities, said it believed India and Pakistan must refrain from taking unilateral action in Kashmir and has expressed concern over human rights violations there. India has dismissed those concerns.Srikanth Kondapalli, professor of Chinese studies at New Delhi's Jawaharlal Nehru University, said it was important for the nuclear-armed neighbours to stabilize relations as both dealt with domestic and regional issues.""The second informal meeting as such is significant given these ominous signals at bilateral, regional and global levels,"" he said.During Xi's visit, Modi is expected to raise economic issues, including India's $53 billion trade deficit with China in 2018/19, and the smaller presence of Indian companies in China compared with that of other major economies.Xi will also make a state visit to Nepal at the end of his India visit, the first by a Chinese president in 22 years, the Nepali foreign ministry said.China has deepened ties with India's neighbours, building ports and power stations in an arc stretching from Bangladesh to Sri Lanka and Pakistan as part of its grand Belt and Road energy and infrastructure plan."

China has pressured international airlines and other companies to describe the city as ""Hong Kong, China"" on their websites, rather than just as ""Hong Kong."" Both Hong Kong and Macao are semi-autonomous territories which have separate identities from China in many peoples' minds.The latest flap comes at a sensitive time for China, as protesters in Hong Kong demanding democracy have taken to the streets all summer, motivated in large part by a desire to protect their way of life from interference by the central government in Beijing."

""That was a very strong commitment on their part.""Glavine said the job now is to turn that promise into a formal agreement. He and a delegation from the province are just back from what the province billed as ""Nova Scotia's first culture-sector mission to Asia.""The minister estimated the weeklong trade mission to China and Japan cost taxpayers about $80,000. According to his department, the delegation included five government representatives and the managing director for Halifax-based 2b Theatre.Department spokesperson Lynette MacLeod said in an email they are still waiting on final invoices for translation services, transportation in China, venue rentals, meals, event hosting and some other expenses. The airfare costs totalled $24,061.14 and hotel costs were $10,766.64.""I believe $80,000 for a long-term investment is really, you know, a small price,"" said Glavine about the expense.The CEO of the Art Gallery of Nova Scotia, Nancy Noble, said it would be ""really great"" for the gallery to get that kind of international exposure.""There are millions of people who live there, so I think the potential is enormous,"" she said.Lewis died in 1970. The gallery owns the rights to her work, so any merchandise sold during the exhibit would come back to the gallery as revenue.In recent years, the popularity of the Hollywood film Maudie, loosely based on the story of Lewis's relationship with her husband Everett, has stirred up interest in the gallery and Lewis-themed prints and memorabilia. Shop sales at the AGNS last year were almost five times what they were the year before. Revenue from admissions more than doubled over the same time."

Cree youth take hockey skills to China | CBC News,Some Cree youth recently brought their hockey skills to Beijing as part of a 7-day Quebec trade mission aimed at expanding economic ties with China.,2018-02-07T22:58:25.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/cree-youth-hockey-china-1.4525256,"Some Cree youth recently brought their hockey skills to Beijing, as part of a seven-day Quebec trade mission aimed at expanding economic ties with China.Quebec Premier Philippe Couillard hosted a delegation in late January from 140 Quebec companies representing seven sectors — sports and consumer goods, entertainment and innovation and culture, among others. Quebec also hosted a winter carnival and took part in hockey demonstrations with young Chinese players.""It was fun. It was a bit hard. They were pretty good,"" said Alayna-Jade Gull, an 11 year old forward on the team. Gull and her teammate, 12-year-old Ronin Cooper, represented the James Bay community of Waswanipi during the trade mission. There were also two Algonquin players from Kitigan-Zibi.  The youth played three exhibition games, including at the national stadium known as the Bird's Nest, built for the 2008 Summer Olympics and Paralympics in Beijing.""I'm a big hockey guy. I love watching my daughter play,"" said Jarris Gull, Alayna-Jade's father, who was a chaperone on the trip.""Seeing her play at the Bird's Nest... it was something special.""The delegation also visited the hockey arena being built for the 2022 Olympics and visited the Great Wall of China.""All the First Nations kids wanted to keep going,"" said Jarris Gull, who took a small group of the hockey players to the top of the Great Wall.""We went to the highest peak, but had to go pretty fast, because we had to go back for a hockey game.""The Quebec-based École de Hockey Michel Vallière was part of organizing the skills exercises, which included the players from Waswanipi and Kitigan-Zibi, as well as non-Indigenous players from the community of Ste Agathe des Monts. It is part of a growing partnership between the school and China.Quebec is trying to position itself as a winter sport expert and an obvious choice as a foreign investor as China expands development of its regional sports industry, particularly hockey in the lead up to the 2022 Winter Olympics planned for Beijing.In 2016, Quebec exports to China were $3 billion, up 12.1 per cent from the previous year; Chinese imports to Quebec totalled $10.8 billion.Premier Couillard says highlighting people's expertise is a priority for him.""We have given ourselves the means to better support our businesses, our educational institutions and our organizations in their projects,"" said Couillard in a press release.""Because, beyond the raw materials, what distinguishes us ... are our talents."""
Good news for elephants — China bans ivory sales | CBC News,"A ban on ivory sales in China, the world's largest importer and end user of elephant tusks, is now in effect. Wildlife activists call it a vital step to reducing the slaughter of the endangered animals.",2018-01-02T14:49:17.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/china-ivory-sales-ban-1.4469750,"A ban on ivory sales in China, the world's largest importer and end user of elephant tusks, took effect on Sunday with wildlife activists calling it a vital step to reducing the slaughter of the endangered animals.China has made a big push to eradicate ivory sales and demand has fallen since early 2014 because of a crackdown on corruption and slower economic growth.Public awareness campaigns featuring celebrities have helped boost awareness of the bloody cost of ivory. Wildlife groups estimate 30,000 elephants are killed by poachers in Africa every year.""It is the greatest single step toward reducing elephant poaching,"" said Peter Knights, chief executive of the group WildAid.The trade in pre-convention ivory has been legally thriving in China and Hong Kong since 1975, and environmental activists have long asserted that it has spurred demand for all ivory.The ban on all ivory sales has already led to an 80 per cent decline in seizures of illegal ivory entering China as well as a 65 per cent decline in raw ivory prices, said conservation group WildAid.Under the ban, China's 172 ivory-carving factories and retail outlets will also close. Some factories and shops started closing in March.Illegal ivory supplies have also been rife in unlicensed shops and online across China.This year, ivory prices in China were about 65 per cent lower than 2014 levels, said WildAid, with retailers in some places trying to sell off stocks and offering heavy discounts before the ban.The Chinese ban has been hailed by activists but they warn that Hong Kong, a special administrative region of China,  remains a big obstacle to the eradication of elephant poaching.China's ban on sales does not apply in the former British colony, which has the largest retail market for ivory and has  traded it for more than 150 years.Hong Kong is a prime transit and consumption hub for ivory with more than 90 per cent of consumers from mainland China.Since 2003, Hong Kong has intercepted about 40 tonnes of illegal ivory, only about 10 per cent of what is believed to have been smuggled in, WildAid said in a paper to the city's legislature in May.Hong Kong set a timetable for a ban on ivory trading last year, with a phase-out time of five years. A final vote on the  ban is expected in the city's legislature in early 2018.Conservationist Zhou Fei said the Chinese ban could be a catalyst for the closure of ivory markets across Asia.However, Kenya-based conservation group Save the Elephants said this year that neighbouring Laos has expanded its retail market more rapidly than any other country. "

"N.S. premier returns from China, says talk is key to easing tensions | CBC News","McNeil's trip to China was the first by a Canadian politician since the arrest in B.C. of Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer of Chinese telecom giant Huawei.",2019-05-16T18:02:20.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/stephen-mcneil-canada-china-trade-guangdong-1.5138735,"Premier Stephen McNeil says tensions between Canada and China won't be resolved without the two sides talking.McNeil made the comments Thursday, less than 24 hours after returning from a three-week trade mission that included five days in China. Coincidentally, it was the same day the Chinese government formally arrested Canadian citizens Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor and accused them of espionage.Kovrig and Spavor have been detained by Chinese officials since December, not long after Canadian authorities arrested Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer of Huawei, in Vancouver.The premier acknowledged there are difficulties with the China-Canada relationship right now, but he said that can only be fixed through communications.""Not having a conversation solves nothing,"" he told reporters following a cabinet meeting in Halifax.""Walking in and building a connection with each other allows you to have those kind of conversations.""McNeil may have some of the best connections with China of any elected official in Canada and his most recent trip was the first by a Canadian politician since the arrest of Meng.He's been to China seven times since becoming premier in 2013, each time pursuing growth in exports and tourism, and the establishment of a direct flight between Halifax and China.Nova Scotia's exports to China are worth almost $800 million, with seafood — particularly lobster — accounting for much of that. McNeil believes that success is built largely on the relationship he's established with Guangdong province Gov. Ma Xingrui.""We're pretty direct with one another,"" said McNeil. ""I think he appreciates that.""That directness led to conversations about the issues between the two countries.McNeil said the two sides talked about the need for people to feel safe travelling to one another's country, particularly as they try to promote tourism links. Part of the Nova Scotia delegation included art exhibits featuring the work of Maud Lewis and six other Nova Scotia artists.""If I'm coming here and asking Nova Scotians and Canadians to go into Guangdong province as a tourist, I need to be reassured that they can do so and feel free to experience what that province has to offer and, at the same time, be able to come back home when their vacation is over,"" said McNeil.He said his experience travelling to China was no different than any of his previous trips.""I couldn't have been greeted any better, quite frankly. I was greeted by an old friend,"" said McNeil.The premier said he offered to play a role in easing tensions between the two sides if Chinese officials thought that would be helpful, and he'd make the same offer to Ottawa.While there's been no ask at this time, he said China's ambassador to Canada is scheduled to visit Nova Scotia at the end of the month and a cultural and business delegation from Guangdong would also visit later this year, ahead of another trip McNeil plans to China this year.While other parts of Canada have felt the effects of China closing its borders to products such as canola and soybeans, Nova Scotia has so far been immune from such actions. McNeil said it's ultimately up to the Chinese government to make such decisions, but he's hopeful he's made the case during his visits for why no action should be taken against Nova Scotia exports by touting the province's quality control measures.""They understand the importance of the seafood going into that marketplace and it's certainly our hope — and I think it's [Ma's] as well — that that trade continues at the rate and proceeds as it has been.""McNeil's trip also included stops in parts of Europe, where he promoted seafood exports, as well as direct travel links to Halifax. The premier said broadening trade customers leads to sustained high prices, which benefits the industry and its workers here."

She accused them of ""intimidation"" and ""harassment.""Tempers flared and tensions ran high as the two sides tried to drown out each other with shouts of  ""One China"" and ""Hong Kong belongs to China"" coming from the pro-China group.Shouts of ""no violence"" came from the other side.""We have got the police permit to launch a peaceful march, however, before we could go out to start a march, we noticed that there's a very well-orchestrated counter-rally here by the pro-China camp,"" Fung told CBC News.Members of the Toronto Police Service had to separate the two sides more than once.The protests in Hong Kong, which have been ongoing since June, were sparked by a proposed extradition law.""This extradition bill, if enacted, is going to allow China to arbitrarily arrest anybody who is working, travelling, living or even in transit via Hong Kong,"" Fung, told CBC News at an earlier march in June."

Conservatives ask CSIS to investigate ex-ambassador's China comments | CBC News,The Conservative Party is asking Canada's spy agency to investigate whether recent comments by Ottawa's former ambassador to China pose a threat to the upcoming fall election.,2019-07-12T14:14:39.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/china-mccallum-csis-conservatives-1.5209439,"The Conservative Party is asking Canada's spy agency to investigate whether recent comments by Ottawa's former ambassador to China pose a threat to the upcoming fall election.John McCallum, who was fired as ambassador in January amid mounting tensions between Canada and China, said in a recent interview he has warned former contacts in China's Foreign Affairs Ministry that any further ""punishments"" imposed on Canada's exports could trigger a change of government that would be unfavourable to Beijing.""Anything that is more negative against Canada will help the Conservatives, [who] are much less friendly to China than the Liberals,"" McCallum was reported as telling the South China Morning Post. The story was published Wednesday.In a letter to Canadian Security Intelligence Service director David Vigneault, Conservative Party deputy leader Lisa Raitt and its public safety critic Pierre Paul-Hus ask CSIS to investigate whether McCallum's ""disturbing"" comments pose a threat to the security of Canada.""This advice was partisan in nature and encouraged the government of China to take specific actions in order to influence Canada's democratic process,"" they write.""This is highly inappropriate, for a myriad of reasons, not the least of which is the fact the Government of China continues to arbitrarily detain two Canadians, Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, and has taken other hostile actions towards Canada.""The party told Radio-Canada the letter was sent today.A spokesperson for CSIS confirmed it had received the letter.""As you can expect, we do not publicly comment or confirm or deny the specifics of our investigations,"" said John Townsend.The letter also asks that McCallum's activities be included as part of the regular briefings to the critical election incident protocol panel — the new team set up to sound the alarm if it sees evidence the October federal election is being undermined.""Canadians expect that the upcoming election will be conducted in a free and fair manner, and that any and all incidents of foreign interference will be fully investigated, with action taken to prevent said interference,"" wrote Raitt and Paul-Hus.""We believe Mr. McCallum's actions, as confirmed by his own public statements, deserve the utmost scrutiny of your agency.""McCallum's interview comes after China suspended imports of Canadian canola, pork and beef following the arrest of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou in Vancouver in December at the behest of American officials.""This problem will pass,"" McCallum was quoted as saying in the article. ""It's important for Canadian business people not just to come to China but to come often … especially when the going is tough.""McCallum was fired from his ambassadorial post after suggesting publicly that Meng, daughter of the founder of the Chinese telecom giant, had a strong case to fight extradition to the U.S.CBC NewsHe also said any deal to spare Meng from prosecution in the U.S. should include the release of Kovrig and Spavor.Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland also took exception to her former cabinet colleague's comments while speaking to reporters at an event in London on Thursday.""Mr. McCallum does not speak in the name of the Canadian government,"" she said.""I think it is inappropriate for any Canadian to be advising any foreign government in ways it ought or ought not to behave to secure any particular election outcome in Canada.""When asked about the letter during a stop in Edmonton today, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau pointed to Freeland's comments the night before.""The foreign minister addressed yesterday the comments by Mr. McCallum,"" Trudeau said.""We will be unflinching about that in our communications both public and private as a government, because that is the path to both defending Canada's interests and defending the Canadians that are unjustly held."""
"At the Grand Prix of China, change is in the air | CBC Sports","As the skaters head to Chongqing, China, for the fourth event in the six-event ISU Grand Prix of Figure Skating series, it is clear that change is in the air. As Pj Kwong writes, even for some of the veteran skaters, there is no guarantee that a clean skate will get you to the top of the podium.",2019-11-07T09:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/sports/olympics/winter/figureskating/figure-skating-china-pj-kwong-preview-1.5350149,"As the skaters head to Chongqing, China, for the fourth event in the six-event ISU Grand Prix of Figure Skating series, it is clear that change is in the air. Even for some of the veteran skaters, there is no guarantee that a clean skate will get you to the top of the podium.The men's event at the Cup of China (Friday, 2 a.m. ET on CBCSports.ca) has so many contenders and no true frontrunner, making it really interesting to dissect.It was barely two years ago that senior international newcomer Camden Pulkinen won the American junior national title. Fast forward to the Skate Canada International where Pulkinen finished fourth overall with a second after the short program in his Grand Prix debut. Far from a household name, Pulkinen took the opportunity to place himself firmly on the figure skating landscape.Korea's Junhwan Cha's career is filled with promise and some good results including the bronze from the Grand Prix Final last season. China's Boyang Jin's inconsistent performances have hindered him to be sure, but two World bronze medals prove he has the goods.In the final analysis, the title for the men should come down to two experienced competitors. The first is Canadian Keegan Messing, who has been ranked as high as eighth in the world and is a crowd favourite. The second veteran is Japan's Keiji Tanaka who won the pre-season Figure Skating Classic and took home a bronze from Skate Canada, just ahead of Messing.The women's event can go any number of ways; much in the same way as the men's. The outstanding talent I see in Korea's 15-year-old sensation Young You  is impressive. Seemingly out of nowhere, her effortless grace and strong technique were enough for a bronze medal at Skate Canada and makes her a podium threat in China.Another newcomer whose name you will want to know is 15-year-old Russian skater Anna Shcherbakova. Among her accolades are the 2018 world junior silver medal and the gold from Skate America. Shcherbakova's senior national title in 2019 while simultaneously taking bronze in the Russian national junior ranks indicates just how much young talent there is in Russia currently. As proof, the first three Grand Prix women's events this season have all been won by Russian teenagers making their respective Grand Prix debuts.I have a soft spot for the 2015 world champion Elizaveta Tuktamysheva from Russia whose own Grand Prix season has started with a bronze medal at Skate Canada.Tuktamysheva's work ethic and talent are extraordinary and cannot be underestimated. The same goes for two-time world medallist Satoko Miyahara from Japan whose style and perseverance are second to none.China's legendary strength in their pairs' program is well documented. On home ice it is going to come down to two Chinese teams battling it out for the top spot. Cheng Peng and Yang Jin are a force to be reckoned with. This team has shown steady progress since getting together in 2016 which includes being fourth in the world, a silver at last season's Grand Prix Final and a win at this season's Skate America event.  Wenjing Sui and Cong Han are in a league of their own. The two-time world champion team who took Olympic silver in 2018 have been plagued by injuries, including last season when they sat out the Grand Prix series while Sui recovered from a stress fracture in her foot. Cup of China will be their first of the series, and these two always come prepared to win.The ice dance title will be a battle between rivals. Russia's Victoria Sinitsina and Nikita Katsalapov are appearing for the first time this Grand Prix season and as the reigning world silver medallists may have a slight advantage on paper.On the other hand, American three-time world silver medallists Madison Chock and Evan Bates have been very strong with gold medals in a couple of pre-season competitions and a silver medal from the Grand Prix of France one week ago.More than any other, ice dance will come down to style preference and who can deliver the best and most technically challenging program on the day."

"New economic cold war is unlikely to thwart China, but don't rule out change from within: Don Pittis | CBC News",A giant and growing internal economy and state grip on economic levers mean external threats won't change China's mind. Only the Chinese people can do that.,2020-07-06T08:00:14.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/china-economy-sanctions-1.5637118,"Last week, former prime minister Brian Mulroney urged that this country begin an ""urgent rethink"" on its relations with China.A front-page story in the Globe and Mail on Canada Day declared that the former Progressive Conservative PM had backed off on his previous suggestion of sending a high-level business negotiating team to Beijing to resolve Canada-China differences. Instead, he advocated a firmer stance.""There has to be an immediate and urgent rethink of our entire relationship,"" Mulroney told the Globe. That included kicking Chinese telecom company Huawei off Canada's 5G systems and staying close to the U.S.-led Five Eyes spy network.But those who think taking a hard economic line on China — a country that is neck and neck with the biggest economy on Earth — will change its aggressive and anti-democratic outlook must understand Chinese exceptionalism.Instead, as many China scholars have told me in the past, change within China must come from the Chinese people — and not necessarily as represented by the Chinese Communist Party.That may seem far-fetched to those watching Beijing's crackdown on Hong Kong, its vicious police tactics backed by central government financial support to help keep the Chinese region's business community sweet.As the New York Times reported last week, ""The business world has largely fallen in line behind China's campaign to tighten its grip on Hong Kong.""While officials have offered moral and cash support for the former British colony, the most significant reason for the latest burst of business activity comes from a different source.U.S. regulatory restrictions on Chinese firms and fear that the U.S. administration and Congress may impose financial penalties have made Hong Kong's sophisticated marketplace a more-than-tolerable second choice to New York for raising cash.As Walid Hejazi, an associate professor of international business at the University of Toronto's Rotman School of Management, suggested in the context of threatened U.S. trade restrictions, squeezing China out can have perverse effects.""Given there is a trade war, it can push China into doing things that could really help it over the longer term in terms of diversifying itself into Asia, into other markets, but also developing its domestic economy,"" Hejazi told me at the time.Like the U.S. in an earlier stage in its own development, China may be on the verge of building a domestic economy so large, exports become of decreasing importance.Even if Canada and the U.S. could do without China's increasingly high-level technology, of which Huawei is only a single example, even if they could withstand a reduction in the Chinese market for their exports of food and resources, the Asian country's increasing self-sufficiency means some sort of new economic cold war is unlikely to have the desired impact.Even if, as some credible sources have suggested, Chinese economic data is fudged, there is no question that the country's economy is huge and growing. Beijing is spending a fortune on the education of its billion-plus population. It seems serious about trying to bring its poorest into the wage economy.‘Poverty alleviation goals are more than a policy target. They are a major source of legitimacy both within China and globally’ <a href=""https://t.co/YdpHOIVVUw"">https://t.co/YdpHOIVVUw</a>Condemned by human rights groups for forced birth control for minorities and other abuses, nonetheless the power of a command economy gives it strategic advantages at this point in its evolution. Unlike the U.S. and Canada, it does not have to negotiate with wealthy taxpayers to create university places or make what it considers to be essential investments.But while Beijing rejects attempts at outside coercion, developments in Hong Kong may reveal a path to domestic transformation.While Beijing's strong-arm tactics can work on powerless Uighurs, Hong Kong may be a Chinese microcosm of what can happen when an authoritarian government runs out of legitimacy with informed and educated citizens who do not want to be imposed upon.People who think of South Korea and Taiwan as healthy pluralistic democracies may not realize that in my lifetime, both were run by nasty militarist — anti-communist in those cases — dictatorships. The running street battles between police and students before the removal of South Korea's Park Chung-hee are legendary.WATCH | Nathan Law flees Hong Kong:WorldEven as Hong Kong becomes more like China, the former colony may have inoculated the entire country with a taste for self-government and some ideas on how to get it. By alienating so many Hong Kongers, China has wasted an opportunity.Now, the self-exile of Hong Kong democracy leader Nathan Law harks back to earlier times, when Russian anti-government leader Vladimir Lenin retreated to England and Vietnamese revolutionary Ho Chi Minh hid out in France.Without even trying, places where you are allowed to think and say just about what you like create a refuge for dissent. Canada's suspension of extradition rules is a sign that Hong Kong has strayed too far from that ideal.Canada need not give up on China as a place where pluralism and democracy will one day help its people rule themselves.In years gone by, North American economic sanctions may have had the clout to pressure even large countries into adjusting their policies. It is implausible to think that China, with an economy that the IMF says is still growing — while Canada, the U.S. and Europe will shrink about eight per cent this year — will be pressured.That will be the job of its own people.Follow Don on Twitter @don_pittis"
China warns of retaliation after Trump threatens fresh tariffs | CBC News,"China has warned of retaliation after U.S President Donald Trump vowed to slap a 10 per cent tariff on $300 billion US of Chinese imports, sharply escalating a trade row between the two countries.",2019-08-02T11:48:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/china-retaliate-trump-threatens-fresh-tariffs-1.5234224,"China on Friday said it would not be blackmailed and warned of retaliation after U.S. President Donald Trump vowed to slap a 10 per cent tariff on $300 billion US of Chinese imports from next month, sharply escalating a trade row between the world's biggest economies.Trump on Thursday stunned financial markets by saying he plans to levy the additional duties from Sept. 1, marking an abrupt end to a truce in a year-long trade war that has slowed global growth and disrupted supply chains.Beijing would not give an inch under pressure from Washington, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said.""If America does pass these tariffs then China will have to take the necessary countermeasures to protect the country's core and fundamental interests,"" Hua told a news briefing in Beijing.""We won't accept any maximum pressure, intimidation or blackmail. On the major issues of principle we won't give an inch,"" she said, adding that China hoped the U.S. would ""give up its illusions"" and return to the right track of negotiations based on mutual respect and equality.Trump also threatened to further raise tariffs if Chinese President Xi Jinping fails to move more quickly to strike a trade deal.The newly proposed wave of duties would extend Trump's tariffs to nearly all of the Chinese goods that the United States imports.Trump made his threat in a series of Twitter posts after his top trade negotiators briefed him on a lack of progress in U.S.-China talks in Shanghai this week....during the talks the U.S. will start, on September 1st, putting a small additional Tariff of 10% on the remaining 300 Billion Dollars of goods and products coming from China into our Country. This does not include the 250 Billion Dollars already Tariffed at 25%...The president later said if trade discussions fail to progress he could raise tariffs further — even beyond the 25 per cent levy he has already imposed on $250 billion US of imports from China.Senior Chinese diplomat Wang Yi told reporters on the sidelines of an Association of Southeast Nations event in Thailand the additional tariffs were ""not a correct way"" to deal with the bilateral dispute.The news hit U.S. and Asian financial markets hard. Oil prices plummeted seven per cent and retail associations predicted a spike in consumer prices. Asked about the impact on financial markets, Trump told reporters: ""I'm not concerned about that at all.""""President Trump is, in effect, using American families as a hostage in his trade war negotiations,"" said Matt Priest, president of the Footwear Distributors and Retailers of America.Stephen Lamar, executive vice president of the American Apparel & Footwear Association, said his group's members were shocked that Trump had not allowed the resumed U.S.-China trade talks to proceed further before acting.Chinese manufacturers produce 42 per cent of apparel and 69 per cent of footwear purchased in the U.S., Lamar said.Moody's said the new tariffs would weigh on the global economy at a time when growth is already slowing in the U.S., China and the eurozone.Possible retaliatory measures by China could include tariffs, a ban on the export of rare earths and penalties against U.S. companies in China, analysts say.So far, Beijing has refrained from slapping tariffs on U.S. crude oil and big aircraft, after cumulatively imposing additional retaliatory tariffs of up to 25 per cent on about $110 billion US of U.S. goods since the trade war broke out last year.China is also drafting a list of ""unreliable entities"" - foreign firms that have harmed Chinese interests. U.S. delivery giant FedEx is under investigation by China.U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin briefed Trump on their first face-to-face meeting with Chinese officials since Trump met Xi at the G20 summit at the end of June and agreed to a ceasefire in the trade war.""When my people came home, they said, 'We're talking. We have another meeting in early September.' I said, 'That's fine, but until such time as there's a deal, we'll be taxing them,"" Trump told reporters.A source familiar with the matter said Trump grew frustrated and composed the tweets shortly after Lighthizer and Mnuchin told him China made no significant movement on its position.Previous negotiations collapsed in May, when U.S. officials accused China of backing away from earlier commitments."

""I don't know what to do.""Yu said her husband, David Zhao, 57, travelled to China on a business trip on Jan. 13 in perfect health. Although Zhao never travelled to Hubei province, the epicentre of the outbreak, his boss and colleagues are from the city of Wuhan, she said.Zhao was vice president of Canada Stewart Energy Group Ltd., and Yu said the company has regular meetings with people from the city of 11 million.According to what a colleague told Yu's family, her husband was coughing, vomiting and had diarrhea in the days leading up to his death. Yu said she strongly suspects he died of COVID-19.   ""These symptoms are very similar to this virus,"" she said.Zhao was later found dead, alone, in the apartment his company pays for. Yu doesn't know the exact date of his death, but suspects it was Jan. 22. Yu said she first heard the news about her husband's death from her church pastor, who was contacted by the RCMP on Jan. 23, after being unable to reach Yu. The pastor was listed as Yu's emergency contact.  That first day, Yu spoke to no one about Zhao's death, except members of her church. The next day, she received a call from Global Affairs Canada, and used a friend to interpret. In that conversation, Yu was told that her husband had suffered a ""sudden death,"" she said.Emails between Yu and Global Affairs show that the initial examination of Zhao's body in China concluded he died of a heart attack. Yu alleges that on Jan. 30 she was told by Global Affairs that the ""government is willing to help"" and that Global Affairs Canada and the Canadian embassy in Beijing could represent her in the search for an autopsy report.""I want to know the true reason for David's death,"" she said. But the next day, Jan. 31, she was told such authorization could not be granted. Instead, Yu was told she would either have to authorize a family member in China, or the funeral home where Zhao's remains are being kept, to represent her interests for an autopsy. Initially, she was told that a person would have to meet the Chinese officer handling the case in person.She was also asked by the Chinese police why she wanted to have the autopsy done. The mother of two was told, with Global Affairs acting as intermediary, that if it was simply to find out why Zhao had died, then a nearby forensic centre could do the examination. But if she was specifically trying to find out if he died of COVID-19, then China's Disease Control Centre would handle the case.Yu said her parents, both in their seventies, are unable to travel to Beijing because of travel bans within the country. She said none of her other family in China can travel to the city.""Aijun is under a lot of pressure by the Chinese officer, to ask from her, to cremate the body as soon as possible,"" the interpreter said on Yu's behalf. She said the officer has also contacted Yu's mother and repeatedly asked for authorization to cremate the body. Yu hasn't had any direct contact with any Chinese official, she said, and feels uneasy about talking to authorities without Global Affairs representing her interest. ""She doesn't know what to say or what not to say,"" the interpreter said. In an emailed statement, a spokesperson for Global Affairs Canada said the department ""is aware of the death of a Canadian citizen in China and our thoughts are with the family.""The statement also said ""consular officials are in contact with the relatives of the deceased and are providing consular assistance.""The department wouldn't comment further on the case, citing privacy concerns. ""Canadian consular officials in Beijing, China, remain in contact with local authorities to assist with the request for a post-mortem examination,"" the spokesperson said.Yu describes her husband as a caring, family man. She calls losing him, and the past month of fighting to learn more about his death, her ""darkest hour.""She said she can't stop thinking about him ""lying on a cold place, alone."" She said she was ""devastated.""""There are a lot of things David [was responsible for] doing, like with the family. A lot of things [I] don't even know what to do without David."" Yu said she's lost without her husband, who often helped her with speaking English. She might have to leave Surrey, uncertain if she'll be able to afford it without her husband's income. She said her two children were devastated by the news, but have been comforted by their faith. ""They know their dad went to heaven,"" she said."
China considering halting all meat products from Canada over fake veterinary health certificates | CBC News,"China is considering halting all meat imports from Canada starting Wednesday after the Canadian Food Inspection Agency notified China that it had discovered a number of fabricated veterinary health certificates in meat products bound for China, according to a government official.",2019-06-25T22:20:01.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/china-ban-canadian-meat-1.5189874,"China is considering halting all meat imports from Canada starting Wednesday after the Canadian Food Inspection Agency notified China that it had discovered a number of inauthentic veterinary health certificates in some meat products bound for China, according to a government official.China already has halted imports from three Canadian pork producers over food safety issues — two in May and another earlier this month — as trade tensions between the two countries have escalated.A Canadian government official, who spoke to CBC News on the condition they not be named, confirmed the CFIA notified its Chinese counterparts it had uncovered faked veterinary certificates for some Canadian meat products.In response, the official said, China was considering halting all meat shipments from Canada. The official also said the federal government expects developments to emerge throughout the evening.According to a statement released by China's embassy, a batch of pork from Canada was found to contain residues of ractopamine, a feed additive banned in many countries. Imports of pork from that facility were halted pending an investigation on the Canadian side.""The subsequent investigation revealed that the official veterinary health certificates attached to the batch of pork exported to China were counterfeit and the number of those forgery certificates was up to 188,"" the statement said.The documents, called export certificates by Canadian authorities, include a number and a veterinary's signature.The move comes on the eve of the G20 leaders summit in Japan, which brings together leaders of the leading 20 industrial and developing nations, including Canada, China and the U.S.""The CFIA has taken measures to address this issue and is continuing to work closely with industry partners and Chinese officials,"" said Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food Marie-Claude Bibeau in a statement. ""CFIA is investigating this technical issue and has informed appropriate law enforcement agencies.""This incident is specific to export certificates to China. Export certificates to other countries are not affected.""Bibeau said that her government will back Canadian producers and continue to work to diversify trade to ""ensure farmers have access to new markets.""The Canadian Pork Council said in a statement Tuesday night that the halt in Canadian exports is not the result of a food safety issue but ""the misuse of Canada's reputation as a supplier of safe quality products.""It said the Canadian Pork Council, Canadian Meat Council and Canada Pork International are working with government to identify potential next steps. ""Demand for pork products remains strong in China and Canadian producers look forward to having the opportunity to continue to meet the needs of our Chinese customers."" The Conservatives say Prime Minister Justin Trudeau should personally raise the issue with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the forthcoming G20 summit. ""Conservatives know that Canadian farmers produce some of the highest quality meat in the world. Any assertion by the Chinese government to the contrary is both false and baseless,"" said Conservative agriculture critic Luc Berthold in a statement. ""It is clear that this is not an issue of food safety, but a political issue caused by Justin Trudeau's incompetence and weakness on the world stage.""Canada's former ambassador to China Guy Saint-Jacques told CBC News Network's Power & Politics that the ongoing tussles with Beijing over trade may remain a fixture of relations between the two countries for some time to come. ""I think we have to expect, unfortunately, that this kind of pressure … will continue,"" he told host Vassey Kapelos.  Last week, the Xinhua state news agency said China was halting imports from a Canadian pork producer after food safety issues were detected in one batch of pork.Xinhua said customs authorities in the eastern city of Nanjing found traces of ractopamine in pork products from Frigo Royal. It said China will suspend imports from Frigo Royal and also stop accepting health certificates issued by the company's veterinary officer.Ractopamine is known as a ""muscle drug"" that accelerates pigs' growth. It is banned in China, Russia and EU countries, but has been approved for use in the U.S. and Canada.China said it would open all containers of Canadian meat and meat products and, in some cases, 100 per cent of the contents would be inspected.In May, China halted pork imports from two other Canadian producers — Olymel LP and Drummond Export — because of labelling problems.Relations with China have been fraught ever since Chinese authorities detained Canadians Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor in December. The arrests were widely seen as retaliation for Canada's arrest of technology giant Huawei's chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, in Vancouver on an extradition request from the U.S.She was later granted bail and is now awaiting court proceedings.In March, the ruling Communist Party's Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission accused Kovrig of stealing state secrets passed on to him by Spavor.China cancelled Winnipeg-based agricultural handler Richardson International's registration, effectivity forbidding the company to export canola seed to the country.China said it made the move due to fears that Canadian canola was tainted by an insect infestation. Canada says it has conducted tests on the canola and has not found any pests or bacteria of concern.Canada exported more than $5 billion worth of canola last year, nearly half of it destined for the Chinese market — almost five million metric tonnes, according to the Canadian Canola Growers Association.The Canadian government official said this most recent issue with meat exports bound for China is not on the same scale as the canola ban."
Liberals block committee probe into claims of inappropriate pressure on ex-China diplomats | CBC News,Liberal members of the House committee on foreign affairs Tuesday shut down opposition parties' attempt to launch an investigation into claims a federal official pressured two former diplomats over their statements on Canada-China relations.,2019-07-30T12:25:02.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/china-comments-committee-1.5229956,"Liberal members of the House committee on foreign affairs Tuesday shut down opposition parties' attempt to launch an investigation into claims a federal official pressured two former diplomats over their statements on Canada-China relations.Opposition parties allege the government tried to muzzle two ex-ambassadors who have been outspoken about Canada's ongoing diplomatic conflict with China. The bid to open an investigation failed after the Liberals, who hold a majority of the committee's seats, defeated the motion in a 5-4 vote Tuesday afternoon.The Globe and Mail reported last week that former Canadian ambassador to China David Mulroney said Paul Thoppil, an official with Global Affairs Canada, instructed him to clear any public comments on Canada's China policy with the department beforehand. The official reportedly cited the ""election environment"" and said he was passing on a request from the Prime Minister's Office.Mulroney told the Globe and Mail Thoppil also cautioned against telling Canadians to suspend non-essential travel to China. The former diplomat said he found the request troubling and claimed the department official implied he should soften his tone.Another former ambassador, Guy Saint-Jacques, also said he had been contacted by Thoppil. But in several recent interviews he said he didn't interpret the government's outreach as an attempt to filter his views.Last week, Conservative and NDP MPs wrote a letter to the committee asking for a summer meeting to talk about the allegation.""We believe it is incumbent on the committee to study these matters and ensure that Canada's non-partisan public service is not being unduly exploited for political purposes,"" they wrote.Ahead of the committee meeting, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told reporters in Vancouver on Monday that his office did not pressure Mulroney to avoid recommending that Canadians avoid non-essential travel to China.Conservative Party Leader Andrew Scheer said Trudeau's comments mirrored ones the prime minister made after the SNC-Lavalin scandal erupted, when the PMO was accused of exerting inappropriate influence over the office of then-attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould.""Justin Trudeau's office stands accused once again of political interference,"" Scheer said. ""Today he borrowed from the SNC playbook.""Conservative committee member MP Leona Alleslev said she was ""not surprised, but disappointed"" when the Liberals voted against an investigation. Alleslev said the opposition hoped to call several witnesses: Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland, Thoppil, Mulroney and St-Jacques.In an interview with CBC's Power and Politics Tuesday, Saint-Jacques said he would have testified before the Foreign Affairs Committee, if called. But he said he didn't know what help his evidence would provide. ""I never felt that they were trying to muzzle me or that they were threatening me,"" Saint-Jacques said. ""I think basically it is another example of miscommunication.""Saint-Jacques also told Power and Politics host Vassy Kapelos that Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland called him last week to assure him personally that the government wasn't trying to silence him.Parliamentary secretary to the minister of foreign affairs Rob Oliphant accused the Conservatives of calling an emergency committee meeting purely to score political points. Oliphant said politicians on all sides should not be playing politics with the lives of the two detained Canadians — entrepreneur Michael Spavor and former diplomat Michael Kovrig — caught up in the diplomatic and trade confrontation between Canada and China.""There are times in politics, there are times in public policy, there are times in Canadian shared life that we let some of that go,"" Oliphant told the committee. ""There should be nothing more on our minds than assuring their safety and considering their well being.""In addition to the lives of the two ""arbitrarily detained"" Canadians, Oliphant called on the members to remember the plight of canola farmers and meat producers whose livelihoods also have been affected by the diplomatic row.Oliphant also echoed a statement from Global Affairs Canada, which said the department's message to the former diplomats ""was not clearly communicated.""""We undertake such engagement in part to ensure informed public discussion of important foreign policy issues so that comments of others such as former diplomats are well informed by current circumstances. The call with Mr. Mulroney was made with this intention,"" wrote Sylvain Leclerc in an email.""We welcome the views and advice of informed Canadians such as Mr. Mulroney on these complex issues and regret that this message was not clearly communicated.  There was no intention, nor was there any instruction from anyone, including the PMO, that Mr. Mulroney clear his public comments with the government.""The Liberal government tried to distance itself earlier this summer after former cabinet minister John McCallum, who was fired as ambassador to China in January amid mounting tensions between Canada and China, said he had warned former contacts in China's Foreign Affairs Ministry that any further ""punishments"" imposed on Canada's exports could trigger a change of government that would be unfavourable to Beijing.""Anything that is more negative against Canada will help the Conservatives, [who] are much less friendly to China than the Liberals,"" McCallum was reported as telling the South China Morning Post.The Conservatives have asked the Canadian Security Intelligence Service to investigate McCallum's statement.Diplomatic and trade relations with China have been deteriorating since Canada began extradition proceedings against Meng Wanzhou, a top executive with the Chinese telecommunications firm Huawei. Wanzhou faces charges in the United States of fraud and violating international sanctions against Iran."

Mulroney urges government to send Chrétien to China to win release of detainees | CBC News,Former prime minister Brian Mulroney says the government should enlist a former prime minister to lead a high-powered delegation to China to win the release of two imprisoned Canadians — but not him.,2019-06-06T22:28:03.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/mulroney-says-send-chretien-china-1.5165716,"Former prime minister Brian Mulroney says the government should enlist a former prime minister to lead a high-powered delegation to China to win the release of two imprisoned Canadians — but not him.""What they might want to do is take a look at sending over someone like Jean Chrétien, who has a lot of respect of the Chinese,"" Mulroney told The Canadian Press.Mulroney said the former Liberal prime minister should be accompanied by another well-placed Canadian: Chrétien's son-in-law André Desmarais, the deputy chairman and co-CEO of Montreal's Power Corporation. Desmarais is also the honorary chairman of the Canada-China Business Council.Desmarais ""is held in extremely high regard by the Chinese and probably knows more about China than any other living Canadian that's not in public life,"" said Mulroney.""You could put a delegation together led by former prime minister Chrétien and a few others, but mostly Chrétien and Andy Desmarais, and go over there and sit down with people Jean has grown up with in politics, who hold senior positions, leadership positions, in the government of China and say, 'Hey, let's get this done,'"" said Mulroney.Ex-diplomat Michael Kovrig and entrepreneur Michael Spavor are under arrest in China facing allegations of espionage and endangering national security. Their imprisonment has sparked international condemnation that their detention is arbitrary, but China has rebuffed the government's many attempts to engage on the matter.Many see their imprisonment as retribution for Canada's decision to arrest Chinese high-tech scion Meng Wangzhou on an extradition request from the U.S. China has also barred some Canadian canola shipments and is cracking down on other agricultural exports.Rumours of such a delegation of special Canadian envoys to China have been circulating in Ottawa, but it hasn't happened so far.""This is not the first time we've been asked the question, but we don't have any announcements planned or decisions planned in the near future,"" said Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's spokesman, Cameron Ahmad.A Power Corp. spokesman said Desmarais declined to comment, while a spokesman for Chrétien did not reply to a request for comment.Mulroney has also advised the current Liberal government on the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement. The former Progressive Conservative leader was granted unprecedented access to a Liberal cabinet meeting to advise on how to deal with U.S. President Donald Trump — a neighbour Mulroney befriended in their Florida vacation communities.But regarding who has the ear of China, Mulroney deferred to his one-time political opponent, who clashed with him as the leader of the official Opposition in the early 1990s.During his 10 years as prime minister, Chrétien made half a dozen trips to China. He rebooted Canadian relations with the People's Republic after a long pause following the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre, in which the Chinese military killed hundreds, perhaps thousands, of unarmed student protesters.Chrétien also created the Team Canada concept, leading delegations of provincial premiers and business leaders to China to grease the wheels of new business deals.In his post-political life, Chrétien has remained actively engaged in China-related issues in his work with the law firm Dentons. His frequents visits to China occasionally garner headlines, including an April 2016 visit when he met with Chinese Premier Li Keqiang.""Premier Li noted that China-Canada relations developed into a 'golden decade' during Mr. Chrétien's administration, and that China appreciates Mr. Chrétien's contributions to promote the development of China-Canada relations,"" said a statement accompanying a photo of the two men warmly shaking hands, on the website of the Chinese government's State Council.Desmarais's August 2016 visit to Beijing was also noted on the Canada-China Business Council's website with a photo supplied by China's state-controlled Xinhua news agency, which depicts his smiling handshake with Chinese Vice-Premier Wang Yang.Power Corp. has had ties with China's largest business conglomerate dating back to the mid-1980s, when Mulroney was in power in Canada.In 2017, the company further entrenched that relationship by buying an additional 3.9-per-cent equity interest in China Asset Management Co. Ltd., also known as China AMC. The deal brought Power Corp.'s equity interest in China AMC to 13.9 per cent.China AMC is an affiliate of CITIC Group Corporation Ltd., which is ""China's largest conglomerate, with which Power Corporation has had an association since 1986,"" said a company statement.Mackenzie Investments, an indirect subsidiary of Power, also completed a 13.9-per-cent acquisition in China AMC in separate transactions in late 2016 and early 2017.""Power Corp. and Mackenzie Investments therefore hold a combined 27.8-per-cent interest in China AMC,"" said a Power Corp. statement.Mulroney acknowledged that his suggestion has echoes of the 2009 visit that former U.S. president Bill Clinton made to North Korea, where he was able to secure the release of two imprisoned journalists. He suggested there might be a lesson for Canada in how the U.S. sometimes taps its ex-presidents for delicate diplomacy.""They know how to use their former leaders."""

"U.S. governors, citing White House inaction, turn to China, South Korea for testing supplies | CBC News","A chorus of governors from both parties pushed back hard after U.S. President Donald Trump accused Democrats of playing ""a very dangerous political game"" by insisting there is a shortage of tests for the coronavirus. The governors countered that the White House must do more to help states do the testing that's needed before they can ease up on stay-at-home orders.",2020-04-21T13:44:14.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/us-governors-testing-1.5539346,"A chorus of governors from both parties pushed back hard after U.S. President Donald Trump accused Democrats of playing ""a very dangerous political game"" by insisting there is a shortage of tests for the coronavirus. The governors countered that the White House must do more to help states do the testing that's needed before they can ease up on stay-at-home orders.Public health experts say the U.S. needs to dramatically increase its testing infrastructure if it is going to safely roll back restrictions and reopen businesses without risking a major spike in infections.Almost 805,000 Americans have come down with COVID-19, the respiratory illness caused by the novel coronavirus, and more than 43,000 have died, according to figures compiled by Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore as of 3 p.m. ET on Tuesday.Supply shortages have stymied U.S. testing for weeks. The needs range from basic supplies like swabs and protective gear to highly specialized laboratory chemicals needed to analyze patient results. Hospitals, laboratories and state health departments report scouring the globe to secure orders, competing against each other and their peers abroad.The governors' plea for stepped-up co-ordination came Monday when the Trump administration again provided discordant messaging: Trump blasted state leaders on Twitter for being too dependent on the federal government and said later that some governors just didn't understand what they had, while Vice-President Mike Pence assured governors the federal government was working around-the-clock to help them ramp up testing.Pence sought to soften the administration's message amid growing clamour from both parties for a national testing strategy to help secure testing swabs, chemical reagents and other crucial supplies.""When it comes to testing, we're here to help,"" Pence told governors during a video conference from the headquarters of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). The Associated Press obtained audio of the call.Pence said the administration sent each state a detailed list Monday of testing capacity. But Maryland Republican Gov. Larry Hogan said much of the unused lab machinery listed for his state was in federal labs the state does not have access to. Pence said the administration has agreed to open up federal labs to help states.Hogan announced Monday that the state had received 500,000 tests from South Korea — a ""game-changing"" deal negotiated by his wife, Yumi Hogan, who grew up outside Seoul.""They want the states to take the lead, and we have to go out and do it ourselves, and so that's exactly what we did,"" Hogan said.Trump didn't take that lying down. In his daily briefing, he said some governors have ""more capacity than they understand.""""The governor of Maryland could have called Mike Pence, could have saved a lot of money,"" Trump said. ""I don't think he needed to go to South Korea. He needed to get a little knowledge.""Hogan thanked Trump in a subsequent tweet, though some observers detected a bit of shade as he explicitly mentioned the Korean purchase:I’m grateful to President Trump for sending us a list of federal labs and generously offering Maryland use of them for <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/COVID19?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#COVID19</a> testing. Accessing these federal labs will be critical for utilizing the 500,000 tests we have acquired from South Korea.In Ohio, Republican Gov. Mike DeWine said his state is working with another federal agency, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), to find a source of reagent, the chemical used to analyze test results. ""A lot of good things are going on, but we're not there yet,"" DeWine said.Democratic Montana Gov. Steve Bullock said his state received 5,000 nasal swabs Monday from FEMA — evidence the federal government is listening. But he added, ""It doesn't get us far enough.""WATCH | White House sends mixed messages on reopening, protests:The NationalIn New York, Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo said the states should take the lead on testing, but it's up to the federal government to help sort out supply chain issues facing testing manufacturers.""What the states will run into is when you talk to those labs ... they buy machines and equipment from national manufacturers,"" said Cuomo, who is expected to meet with Trump at the White House Tuesday. ""And those labs can only run as many tests as the national manufacturers provide them chemicals, reagents and lab kits.""Pennsylvania Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf said, ""We need the reagents, we need the test kits and I think that's the sort of general cry from other states.""The White House said the Pentagon is finalizing negotiations with a Maine medical company to ramp up production of nasal swabs under the Defence Production Act. An Ohio manufacturer of cotton swabs has also agreed to convert its facilities to allow for 10 million testing swabs per month.Even as testing supplies are paramount, states are still often also fighting for scarce personal protective equipment.Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker arranged a large shipment of PPE from China in the past week.""If it strikes you as atypical that in the midst of a national emergency, a state is directly airlifting emergency response materials from another country, well, you'd be right,"" Pritzker said on Sunday. ""But that's the landscape that we're operating in, competing with other states, other countries, and even our own federal government for supplies.""As the pandemic has spread, Pritzker along with Cuomo has been one of Trump's most frequent targets for criticism among U.S. governors.Meanwhile, Congress reached a tentative agreement Tuesday on a nearly $500 billion US coronavirus relief bill that would replenish a small business rescue program, provide hospitals with another $75 billion, and implement a nationwide virus testing program to facilitate reopening the economy.Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer announced the agreement Tuesday morning and Trump tweeted his support hours later, saying he'll sign the bill if it passes both chambers.Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has yet to publicly comment on the emerging deal, keeping his counsel until the Senate opens.Most of the funding, more than $300 billion, would go to boost a small-business payroll loan program that ran out of money last week. An additional $75 billion would be given to hospitals, and $25 billion would be spent to boost testing for the virus, a key step in building the confidence required to reopen state economies."

China tells Canada of 'consequences' of helping U.S. with Huawei case | CBC News,China says Canada needs to be aware of the consequences of aiding the United States in a case involving the Chinese tech giant Huawei that is believed to have sparked the detentions of two Canadians in China.,2019-05-31T10:14:18.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/china-canada-consequences-us-huawei-1.5157046,"China says Canada needs to be aware of the consequences of aiding the United States in a case involving the Chinese tech giant Huawei that is believed to have sparked the detentions of two Canadians in China.Foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang's comments Friday came after U.S. Vice-President Mike Pence and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called for the release of Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor.Chinese authorities detained Spavor, a businessman, and former diplomat Kovrig on Dec. 10, shortly after Canada arrested China-based Huawei's Chief Financial Officer, Meng Wanzhou, on a U.S. warrant.She faces extradition to the United States on charges she conspired to defraud global banks about Huawei's relationship with a company operating in Iran. She and the company have denied the charges and China has called for her release.""We hope that the Canadian side can have a clear understanding of the consequences of endangering itself for the gains of the U.S. and take immediate actions to correct its mistakes so as to spare itself the suffering from growing damage,"" Geng said at a daily news briefing.Asked about Pence's comments that U.S. President Donald Trump would speak with Chinese President Xi Jinping about the detained Canadians at a G20 meeting in Japan in June, Geng implied Canada was to blame for its problems in China.Pence, who has taken a hard line on China, discussed the detained Canadians with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in Ottawa on Thursday, where they also talked about Huawei and China trade issues.Kovrig and Spavor were formally charged with espionage this month. China has also cut off imports of key Canadian commodities in an effort to press it.Canada has called the arrests arbitrary.During his visit, Pence thanked Canada for standing up for the rule of law in detaining Meng.While Canada says China has made no specific link between the detentions of the two men and Meng's arrest, experts and former diplomats say they have no doubt it is using their cases to pressure Canada."
Clearwater sees sales grow in China despite diplomatic tensions | CBC News,"China accounted for almost 27 per cent of Clearwater's sales in first quarter of 2019, up from almost 18 per cent a year prior, with no indication business is slowing.",2019-05-14T21:43:05.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/clearwater-sees-sales-grow-in-china-1.5135950,"Canadian seafood giant Clearwater Seafoods saw sales to China increase by more than 50 per cent in the first quarter of 2019 compared to a year ago and says it sees no slowing down in its business with the Asian superpower as diplomatic tension between Canada and China spills over into trade.""We're all concerned about this, but we also believe that Canadian seafood and Nova Scotia seafood has a very strong reputation for quality in the China market,"" Clearwater CEO Ian Smith said in a media conference call after the company released its first quarter financial results on Tuesday.Smith noted Nova Scotia Premier Stephen McNeil was recently in China on a trade mission that promoted the province's seafood industry.Almost 27 per cent of Clearwater sales, worth $32 million, were in China where the company sells lobster, clams, cold water shrimp and turbot. For the first quarter of 2018, China accounted for about 18 per cent of Clearwater's sales.The Nova-Scotia based company said sales in China increased 52 per cent in the first quarter compared to the year before because of ""a broad-based shift into China across multiple species.""Clearwater also cited growing demand for lobster.The company appears to be another Canadian beneficiary of the Chinese imposition of a 25 per cent tariff on American lobster in 2018.The move crippled sales of Maine lobster.This spring, Canadian farm exports began hitting obstacles at Chinese ports with claims from authorities that shipments of canola, soy beans and pork from Canada did not meet regulatory standards.Canadian businesses say China is using non-tariff barriers to express its anger over the arrest of Huawei Technologies executive Meng Wangzhou in Vancouver on a U.S. warrant.Clearwater said it is meeting Chinese standards.""We have seen no indications of a slowing of our business with China. And we continue to remain in full compliance with all food-related regulations,"" Smith said.Canola has taken the brunt of Chinese measures with shipments blocked on the grounds it is contaminated, leading to fire-sale prices in other countries.One Canadian exporter has said the goal has been to scare Chinese customers off Canadian products.Clearwater customers are sticking with the company, Smith said.""Our relationships with our Chinese customers remain strong, and importantly, our Chinese customers remain cautiously optimistic,"" he said.China is an increasingly important market for Nova Scotia seafood with sales now in the hundreds of millions of dollars.Clearwater said it achieved sales of $120 million for the first quarter of 2019."

Southern Ontario pushes back against China's steel dumping | CBC News,"Barry Zekelman, owner of Atlas Tube, wants to see measures taken against China to stop its illegal dumping of steel on the world market.",2017-04-04T23:33:34.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/windsor/zekelman-atlas-tube-steel-china-jobs-1.4046388,"Southern Ontario's manufacturing sector wants the federal government to help steel producers remain competitive in an international market that they say is unfairly dominated by shoddy practices in China. Members of the Windsor-Essex Chamber of Commerce teamed up last year with counterparts in Hamilton and Sault Ste. Marie to push the government to stand up to ""steel dumping"" by China. Members of the three Chambers of Commerce say China does not adhere to the same environmental standards and basic labour laws as Canadian companies.After eight months of lobbying, the group presented its case before members of the House of Commons standing committee on international trade in Ottawa on Tuesday. Without a level playing field, Canada can't compete internationally in the steel industry, explained Matt Marchand, president and CEO of the Windsor-Essex Chamber of Commerce.""The instability of the steel market, in large part due to China's steel dumping and non-market economy, has led to the sharp decline in the ability of our steel industry to compete globally, costing middle-class jobs,"" he said.  The owner of Atlas Tube, a steel tube manufacturing company in Harrow, wants action taken against China to stop that country's dumping of cheap steel on the market.Barry Zekelman says China is dumping steel on the global market at a drastically reduced cost, compared to North American steel, by ignoring environmental protection measures.""They're not working on the same playing field that any of us are,"" he told CBC News.Zekelman echoed the Chamber, saying shoddy practices in China threaten the steel industry in Canada and the thousands of jobs that go with it.""All the countries that are being hurt by China have to push back on China and restrict their shipments of steel and steel-related products into those countries,"" he said."

China top of mind as Trudeau hosts Japan's Shinzo Abe | CBC News,"Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Japan's Shinzo Abe met in Ottawa to celebrate the 90th anniversary of their bilateral bond and to commit to further the business relationship. It was a chance to tout their strong relationship in the face of trade woes with Canada's two biggest partners, but it's clear Trudeau's focus was elsewhere.",2019-04-28T17:53:50.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/trudeau-abe-canada-japan-china-1.5114457,"China was top of mind for Justin Trudeau during a visit from Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe this weekend.The two leaders met in Ottawa to commit to further the business relationship between the two countries. It was a chance to tout their strong relationship in the face of trade woes with Canada's two biggest partners, but it's clear Trudeau's focus was elsewhere.During an appearance with Abe, he spoke about the diplomatic relations between ""Canada and China,"" before quickly correcting himself. Later on, he accidentally referred to Japan as China again.China's detention of Canadian citizens and its blocking of canola shipments came up during the meetings between the leaders.Two Canadians, Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig, have been held in China since December. Japanese citizens are also regularly imprisoned in China, and Abe said Japan has been monitoring the situation with the detained Canadians.On the trade front, China recently cancelled canola imports from Canada, claiming the product from two Canadian companies is contaminated, though it did not provide any evidence to officials. It's a blow to farmers here, as China buys 40 per cent of this country's canola exports.Trudeau briefly mentioned that he and Abe had discussed potentially sending some canola to Japan instead. Canada's exports to Japan nearly topped $13 billion in 2018, versus exports of $27 billion to China, according to Global Affairs.Japanese officials said Trudeau had raised it and Abe listened, but the conversation didn't go beyond that.The two prime ministers, their ambassadors, several Japanese ministers, plus Canadian ministers Bill Morneau and Chrystia Freeland were part of the official delegations that met Sunday morning. Trudeau and Abe had a short meeting before the larger gathering, as well as a 90-minute private dinner Saturday night with their spouses and interpreters.Trudeau said, while the two countries engage economically with China, both have to be wary of China's attempts to ""impose"" its approach on the world.Abe took a softer approach, saying that Japan agrees with Canada about human rights and rule of law, but it's important to try to foster international ties with China. He was frank about the challenges.""Canada and Japan are facing challenges when it comes to China,"" he said through a translator.""The global community must unite and convince China to play a constructive role.""That's an increasingly hard goal, as longstanding rules-based systems, like the World Trade Organization, are tested by players like China and the U.S. — both countries with leaders who aren't inclined to play by the established rules.""Obviously with issues like the rise of China and the approach that the United States has taken recently, there are real challenges,"" Trudeau admitted.The Trump administration's approach to trade has caused headaches for the Liberal government, as issues negotiating a new NAFTA agreement and tariffs on steel and aluminum put the North American countries at odds.Abe and Trudeau devoted much of their remarks to hailing the benefits of the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), the new trade deal for 11 Pacific Rim nations that was revived and ratified after the U.S. backed out following Trump's election.Trudeau said the gains Canada has been able to make, including upping beef and pork exports to Japan,  show Canada ""stands in stark contrast,"" to the approach of the U.S.Abe was in Washington meeting with Trump directly before he flew to Ottawa. He refrained from taking the same firm tone as Trudeau about the U.S. ""I think that we share the same position, but we should co-operate together so that the United States will be encouraged to be the leader of the liberal free world and we will co-operate with Canada,"" he said.Trudeau and Abe signed two memorandums that agree to invest more in robotics and AI between the countries, as well as an announcement that Canada would recommit to devoting resources to monitor North Korean activity in Pacific waters.Japan will host the G20 summit in June and Abe and Trudeau will likely meet again at the G7 gathering in France in August."

A Chinese woman has been quarantined in Thailand with a mystery strain of coronavirus, Thai authorities said on Monday, the first time the virus has been detected outside China.In all, 41 cases of pneumonia have been reported in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, which preliminary lab tests cited by state media showed could be from a new type of coronavirus, and one patient has died. There have since been no new cases or deaths, Wuhan health authorities said on Tuesday.""From the information that we have it is possible that there is limited human-to-human transmission, potentially among families, but it is very clear right now that we have no sustained human-to-human transmission,"" said Maria Van Kerkhove, acting head of WHO's emerging diseases unit.The WHO is however preparing for the possibility that there could be a wider outbreak, she told a Geneva news briefing. ""It is still early days, we don't have a clear clinical picture.""Some types of the virus cause less serious diseases, while others — like the one that causes MERS — are far more severe.The UN agency has given guidance to hospitals worldwide about infection prevention and control in case the new virus spreads. There is no specific treatment for the new virus, but anti-virals are being considered and could be ""re-purposed,"" Van Kerkhove said.With Chinese New Year approaching on Jan. 25, when many Chinese tourists visit Thailand, the WHO called on Thai authorities, the public and holidaymakers to be on alert.Richard Brow, the agency's representative in Thailand, said anyone with a fever and cough who had spent time in Wuhan should get checked out by a health worker."

The landing was announced by state broadcaster China Central Television at the top of its noon news broadcast.The landing highlights China's growing ambitions as a space power to rival the U.S., Russia and Europe. In 2013, Chang'e 3, the predecessor craft to the current mission, made the first moon landing since the then-Soviet Union's Luna 24 in 1976. The United States is the only other country that has carried out moon landings.""The space dream is part of the dream to make China stronger,"" President Xi Jinping said in 2013, shortly after becoming China's leader.In year-end wrap-ups, Chinese media and officials hailed the Dec. 8 launch of Chang'e 4 as one of the nation's major achievements in 2018. Thursday's landing was announced to the public by state broadcaster CCTV at the top of the noon news.""On the whole, China's space technology still lags behind the West, but with the landing on the far side of the moon, we have raced to the front,"" said Hou Xiyun, a professor at Nanjing University's school of astronomy and space science.He added that China has Mars, Jupiter and asteroids in its sights: ""There's no doubt that our nation will go farther and farther.""The work of Chang'e 4, which is carrying a rover, includes carrying out astronomical observations and probing the structure and mineral composition of the terrain.""The far side of the moon is a rare quiet place that is free from interference of radio signals from Earth,"" mission spokesperson Yu Guobin said, according to Xinhua. ""This probe can fill the gap of low-frequency observation in radio astronomy and will provide important information for studying the origin of stars and nebula evolution.""One challenge of operating on the far side of the moon is communicating with Earth. China launched a relay satellite in May so that Chang'e 4 can send back information.China plans to send its Chang'e 5 probe to the moon next year and have it return to Earth with samples — the first time that will have been done since the Soviet mission in 1976.A Long March 3B rocket carrying Chang'e 4 blasted off on Dec. 8 from Xichang Satellite Launch Center in southern China. Chang'e is the name of a Chinese goddess who, according to legend, has lived on the moon for millennia."

The Republicans and Democrats backing the measures said they viewed the company as a security threat.""American companies shouldn't be in the business of selling our enemies the tools they'll use to spy on Americans,"" Republican Sen. Tom Cotton, one of the sponsors, said in a statement.The United States placed Huawei on the Commerce Department's so-called Entity List in May over national security concerns. U.S. parts and components generally cannot be sold to those on the list without special licenses.However, Trump, who is seeking to revive trade talks with China, announced late last month that U.S. companies would be allowed to sell products to Huawei.The ""Defending America's 5G Future Act"" was introduced in the Senate by Republicans Cotton, Marco Rubio and Mitt Romney and Democrats Chris Van Hollen, Mark Warner and Richard Blumenthal.A companion bill was introduced in the House by Democratic Representatives Jimmy Panetta and Ruben Gallego and Republicans Mark Gallagher and Liz Cheney.Washington also has launched a lobbying effort to persuade U.S. allies to keep Huawei out of next-generation 5G telecommunications infrastructure, citing concerns the company could spy on customers. Huawei has denied the allegations.Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told a news briefing in Beijing on Wednesday that the United States should immediately cease its ""suppression"" of Huawei.Geng said that relevant U.S. legislators were ""clinging to a Cold War mentality"" in trying to contain China's development, and that such actions ""seriously damaged the United States' national image."""

'Sherlock Mania' hits China | CBC News,"""Sherlock"" has become a global phenomenon, but nowhere more than in China, where fans' devotion is so intense that the BBC says it was the first country outside Britain where the new season was shown.",2014-01-19T06:33:38.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/china-falls-in-love-with-bbc-s-sherlock-1.2502579,"Zhou Yeling dragged herself out of bed at 5 a.m. for a long-awaited date with her favorite Englishman — Sherlock Holmes.Zhou, 19, watched the third season premiere of the BBC's Sherlock on Jan. 2 on the British broadcaster's website. Two hours later, the episode started showing with Chinese subtitles on Youku.com, a video website. Youku says it was viewed more than 5 million times in the first 24 hours, becoming the site's most popular program to date.""I was excited beyond words,"" said Zhou, a student in the central Chinese city of Changsha.Sherlock has become a global phenomenon, but nowhere more than in China, where fans' devotion is so intense that the BBC says it was the first country outside Britain where the new season was shown.Online fan clubs have attracted thousands of members. Chinese fans write their own stories about the modern version of author Arthur Conan Doyle's prickly, Victorian detective and his sidekick, Dr. Watson, to fill the time between the brief, three-episode seasons. In Shanghai, an entrepreneur has opened a Sherlock-themed cafe.Holmes is known in China as ""Curly Fu,"" after his Chinese name, Fuermosi, and star Benedict Cumberbatch's floppy hair. Watson, played by Martin Freeman, is Huasheng, a name that sounds like ""Peanut"" in Mandarin. They have become two of the most popular terms in China's vast social media world.""The Sherlock production team shoot something more like a movie, not just a TV drama,"" said Yu Fei, a veteran writer of TV crime dramas for Chinese television.Scenes in which Holmes spots clues in a suspect's clothes or picks apart an alibi are so richly detailed that ""it seems like a wasteful luxury,"" Yu said.Even the Communist Party newspaper People's Daily is a fan.""Tense plot, bizarre story, exquisite production, excellent performances,"" it said of the third season's premier episode.With its mix of odd villains, eccentric aristocrats and fashionable London settings, Sherlock can draw on a Chinese fondness for a storybook version of Britain.Wealthy Chinese send their children to local branches of British schools such as Eton and Dulwich. Rolls Royce Motor Cars Ltd. says China passed the U.S. last year to become the biggest market for its luxury sedans. On the outskirts of Shanghai, a developer has built Thames Town, modeled on an English village with mock Tudor houses and classic red phone booths.""The whole drama has the rich scent of British culture and nobility,"" Yu said. ""Our drama doesn't have that.""The series has given a boost to Youku.com, part of a fast-growing Chinese online video industry. Dozens of sites, some independent and others run by Chinese television stations, show local and imported programs such as The Good Wife and The Big Bang Theory.Youku.com says that after two weeks, total viewership for the Sherlock third season premiere had risen to 14.5 million people. That compares with the 8 to 9 million people who the BBC says watch first-run episodes in Britain. The total in China is bumped up by viewers on pay TV service BesTV, which also has rights to the program.Appearing online gives Sherlock an unusual edge over Chinese dramas. To support a fledgling industry, communist authorities have exempted video websites from most censorship and limits on showing foreign programming that apply to traditional TV stations. That allows outlets such as Youku to show series that might be deemed too violent or political for state TV and to release them faster.""Our writers and producers face many restrictions and censorship. We cannot write about national security and high-level government departments,"" Yu said.Referring to Mycroft Holmes, a shadowy government official and key character, Yu said, ""Sherlock's brother could not appear in a police drama in China.""Terigele, a 25-year-old geological engineer in the northern region of Inner Mongolia, started an online Sherlock fan club in 2010. The group has grown to become the biggest on the popular QQ social media service, with more than 1,000 members.""I've watched several versions of Sherlock Holmes, and this is my favorite one,"" said Terigele, who like many ethnic Mongols uses one name. ""The fans in my group, and I too, think it is especially interesting to bring these two men into modern society, with the Internet and high technology.""And Chinese fans have fallen in love with Cumberbatch.""I am always super excited to see him on the screen and murmur, 'Wow, so beautiful' every single time,""' said Zhang Jing, 24, who works for an advertising company in the eastern city of Tianjin.That fondness for the performers has helped fuel a fad for Sherlock fan fiction in China. Some stories play on the complicated relationship of Holmes and Watson by making them a gay couple.""The sexual orientation is also an interesting point,"" Terigele said. ""Their relationship is a bit more than friendship. They appreciate each other. It is cute, and it makes the audience more eager to watch it.""And Sherlock makes a helpful cultural ambassador for Britain.When Prime Minister David Cameron visited China last year, fans posted appeals on microblogs for him to press the BBC to speed up the release of a new season.Today, a popular online comment aimed at Cameron is, ""Thank you for Sherlock."""
"Sask. canola farmers 'collateral damage' in Canada-China dispute, says former diplomat | CBC News","An expert on Canada-China relations says a recent move by China to stop canola seed export from a major Canadian agriculture company is ""ridiculous and completely unjustified.""",2019-03-06T18:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/sask-canola-farmers-collateral-canada-china-dispute-1.5044826,"Charles Burton says a recent move by China to stop canola seed export from a major Canadian agriculture company is ""ridiculous and completely unjustified.""China halts canola shipments from major Canadian supplierChina says pest concerns justify ban on Canadian canolaA Chinese customs document dated March 1 says the country has cancelled Winnipeg-based agricultural handler Richardson International's registration, which means the company is forbidden to export canola seed to China.The decision could have serious consequences for Saskatchewan farmers as China is the province's top customer for canola seed, accounting for about $2 billion in trade.In the past, China has wanted to limit the amount of ""dockage"" — material such as weeds, stems and other seeds —  it allows in Canadian canola to help fight the spread of a fungal crop disease known as blackleg.Burton, a professor of Canada-China Relations at Brock University and a former diplomat to China, says the move is politically motivated.Political tensions have been rising between Canada and China since Meng Wanzhou, CFO of Chinese technology firm Huawei, was arrested in Canada.The arrest came at the request of U.S. tax authorities and was made as Wanzhou was boarding a flight in Vancouver.Meng Wanzhou scheduled to appear in B.C. court for extradition hearing date'Highly personal': Huawei charges follow years of concern and questionsBurton told CBC Radio's The Morning Edition that China is trying to get Wanzhou released before she is extradited to the U.S.""She has, possibly, information about Huawei's connection to security and intelligence apparatus and in China that would be very damaging to China's interests if it became known,"" Burton said.""Our farmers seem to be the collateral damage in a geo-strategic struggle between China and the west over intelligence and security matters.""Burton recommends farmers lobby government officials to get tougher with China, which will ""pressure the regime to recognize that this kind of arbitrary action to damage the interests of Saskatchewan canola producers is not something which is acceptable in the relationship.""Burton said the move has no possible benefit for China or Canada and will not lead to the release of Wanzhou.""This matter is just ridiculous and completely unjustified,"" he said.""The damage to Saskatchewan farming families is just not something that our government should take lying down.""Burton said Canada should address the ""parking of [China's] enormous assets into Canadian real estate,"" as a means of countering China's decision, ""There are laws about this that we should be enforcing.""Businessman from China investing in Vancouver real estate ordered to repay millionsChinese bought $1.3B of Canadian commercial real estate this yearHe said Canada in general needs to change the way it approaches its political and trade relationship with China.""I think we ought to stand up for our Saskatchewan farmers,"" he saidSaskatchewan Agriculture Minister Dave Marit, who is also a canola producer, said canceling canola seed shipments from Richardson Industries could have a ""huge implication"" on the provincial economy.Sask. canola farmers find themselves in middle of Canada-China dispute""China is a big market and a big player,"" Marit said. ""Hopefully we can come to some [resolution] and some conclusion to this real quickly,"" he told reporters after question period on Tuesday.Marit said he has talked with his federal counterpart, Marie-Claude Bibeau, and she told him resolving the issue is a priority.In a statement to CBC News, Bibeau said the government, ""will work with China to resolve this issue as quickly as possible.""The statement said the federal government is ""closely monitoring the situation and any potential impact on Canada's agricultural trading relationship with China. We are in regular contact with industry stakeholders regarding this matter, and we will keep them informed as additional information becomes available.""Premier Scott Moe told reporters his government is reaching out to the Canadian ambassador's office in China, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency and Richardson International on top of discussions with the federal government."

""It doesn't mean that they're suspended, either, at this time. So, we will obviously keep working with them and see how it goes.""In recent weeks, citing concerns about pests, China has sent non-compliance notifications to Richardson International Ltd. and Viterra Inc., two major Canadian exporters of canola seed. Chinese officials also suspended their licences.China's moves to choke off Canadian canola-seed imports have been widely viewed as the superpower applying economic pressure on Canada following the December arrest of senior Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou in Vancouver at the behest of the United States.Curt Vossen, the CEO of Richardson, told another House of Commons committee Tuesday that canola products alone were just over 15 per cent of all of Canada's exports to China and, last year, were worth more than $4 billion.China imported $2.7 billion worth of Canadian canola seed last year, which ensures any prolonged feud would be felt by farmers, the industry and the broader economy. The seeds are the raw material for canola oil, which is widely used for cooking and in some industries.Vossen, whose Winnipeg-based company has been doing business in China for more than a century, said he cannot emphasize enough the importance of finding a solution to the feud — and quickly.As the federal government searches for that solution, it's been trying to find new markets and cabinet ministers have been touting Canada's recently ratified trade deals with the Asia-Pacific region and the European Union.""If the current disruption continues over the longer term, we will have no choice but to find other markets for Canadian canola seed, however doing so will be no easy task,"" said Vossen. ""While we are confident that we can eventually find other markets, it will not be a painless exercise.""He urged the federal government to be ""more aggressive"" in defending the interests of Canada's agriculture exporters in China and around the world, where they're facing trade barriers in several jurisdictions.""To say that canola is important to Canada's trading relationship with China would be a gross understatement — canola and, indeed, the entire grains and oilseeds complex is the foundation of Canada's trading relationship with China,"" he said, noting the disruption comes at a critical time right before seeding season, when farmers are deciding how much to grow.The Liberal government has insisted it wants to find a scientific solution to the dispute and Bibeau has said she sent a letter to her Chinese counterpart with a request to send a delegation of experts to China to examine the issue. Officials are examining options to support farmers through the possible expansion of existing programs, Bibeau said.The federal Liberals have also established a working group that includes officials from Richardson and Viterra and representatives from the governments of Alberta, Manitoba and Saskatchewan.On March 1, the same day China suspended Richardson's licence, Canada's Justice Department gave the go-ahead for the extradition case against Meng.It marked the formal start of the high-profile process that has thrust Canada into a highly uncomfortable position between China and the United States.In the days following Meng's arrest, China arrested Canadian citizens Michael Kovrig, a Canadian diplomat on leave, and Michael Spavor, an entrepreneur, on allegations of engaging in activities that have endangered Chinese national security."
Trudeau's trip to China cost taxpayers $1.8M | CBC News,"Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s trip to China last year was the most expensive trip by a Canadian prime minister in a decade. According to figures obtained by CBC News, Trudeau’s 10-day trip to Beijing, Shanghai, Hangzhou and Hong Kong cost Canadian taxpayers $1.8 million.",2017-02-13T10:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/trudeau-china-canada-trade-1.3979264,"Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's trip to China last year was the most expensive trip by a Canadian prime minister in a decade.According to figures obtained by CBC News, Trudeau's 10-day trip to Beijing, Shanghai, Hangzhou and Hong Kong to attend the G20 summit and meet Chinese business and political leaders cost Canadian taxpayers $1.8 million.Former Conservative Prime Minister Stephen Harper's six-day trip in 2014 to Hong Kong and Beijing, which cost $1.7 million, was the second highest tab for prime ministerial trips in the past 10 years. Harper's trip to Japan for the 2008 G8 summit was $1.4 million.But while Trudeau's trip was the most expensive by a prime minister in a decade, it is not the most expensive trip to China by a Canadian leader. For example, in 2001, Liberal Prime Minister Jean Chrétien's Team Canada made an 11-day trip to China accompanied by provincial and business leaders, racking up a price tag of $6.7 million. Liberal Prime Minister Paul Martin's nine-day, five-country trip to Thailand, India, Sri Lanka, Japan and China cost $2 million.While the costs of all of Trudeau's trips to date is not yet known, most of the others were shorter trips or headed to less expensive destinations. For example, Trudeau's trip to the United Kingdom, Malta and then on to Paris for the climate conference in November 2015 came in at $1 million. His trip to Davos, Switzerland, for the World Economic Forum in January 2016 cost $855,379.An analysis by CBC of travel costs by Canadian prime ministers from 2003 to the present shows that trips to China are often among the most expensive. Trips to other countries or other cities are often tacked onto the itinerary and distance also adds to the costs.According to figures obtained by CBC, the cost for the plane alone for Trudeau's trip from Aug. 29 to Sept. 7, 2016, was $543,682 — $416.250 in flying time for the CC-150 Polaris (Airbus) and another $127,432 for catering on the plane.The Privy Council office had $246,613 in costs — $157,260 of it in commercial flights for those who didn't travel with Trudeau on the government airbus.The Global Affairs department had the highest tab of all — $1,012,509. While a breakdown of the costs was not available, Natasha Nystrom, spokesperson for Global Affairs, said the pricetag included the cost of an advance visit to China to lay the groundwork for Trudeau's trip.Trudeau's government has been actively reinforcing the relationship with China – particularly in the wake of U.S. President Donald Trump's election. In January, Trudeau appointed senior cabinet minister John McCallum as Canada's new ambassador to China. The government has also overturned at least one decision by the Harper government, allowing a Chinese firm to purchase Montreal-area high-tech company ITF Technologies.Olivier Duchesneau, spokesman for Trudeau, said the government ""has made it a top priority to create a stronger, more stable and long-term relationship with China.""""In stark opposition to the former government's cold relations with China, we have embarked on a new relationship on an equal footing, one where trade interests are met by human rights concerns and Canada's commitment to the rule of law.""Among the things Trudeau accomplished on the trip to China were ensuring access for Canada's $2-billion canola industry to China, the announcement of several new initiatives, exploratory talks towards a Canada-China free trade agreement and setting a goal to double trade by 2025, said Duchesneau.However, Duchesneau said the government isn't ignoring the question of human rights in China as it tries to improve trade ties.""The prime minister intends to continue regular, respectful and frank discussion with China, including on issues like good governance and the rule of law,"" he wrote in an e-mail.""As we work toward a stronger, more stable and long-term relationship with China, we will have more opportunities to share our culture, increase our people-to-people ties, bolster our shared prosperity, grow Canada's middle class and hold regular, frank dialogue on issues of importance to Canadians like respect for democracy, human rights and the rule of law.""Elizabeth Thompson can be reached at elizabeth.thompson@cbc.ca"

China's costly pollution problem | CBC News,Three decades of unprecedented growth in China has come with an environmental price.,2012-07-05T09:09:48.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/china-s-costly-pollution-problem-1.1247983,"Last month, Chinese officials issued a general warning to foreign embassies, (but really aimed at the U.S.) to stop publishing reports about their country’s air quality.The warning — in reference to a U.S. embassy Twitter account that, since 2008, has posted hourly readings of pollution levels of Beijing — illustrated how sensitive the government is about the country’s pollution problem.And it's a problem that is becoming a growing concern among the public and considered a leading cause of civil unrest. The planned construction of industrial plants has sparked protests in some cities. Bowing to public pressure, officials shut down a planned copper plant for a southwestern China city on Wednesday after thousands protested the possible health impact from the facility.But is China's pollution really that bad?According to the Environmental Performance Index, a bi-annual report put out by Yale University and Columbia University that ranks countries based on a number of environmental factors, India ranked last out of 132 countries.Yet, China wasn't far off, coming in at 128. Its overall index rank, which, along with air quality, included factors such as water, agriculture, and climate change was 116. (India came in at 125).But China is still considered one of the biggest polluters in the world and leads in a number of categories including CO2, sulphur dioxide and mercury and arsenic emissions.China’s pollution comes mostly from its coal-fired power plants and motor vehicle emissions which emit large quantities of particulate matter and sulfur dioxide.Part of the reason the Chinese government is so irked at the U.S. reporting pollution data is that their pollution standards are more stringent which means pollution levels considered unhealthy in the U.S. are often classified as good by China.""Air pollution in China is notorious for its magnitude,""  wrote researchers at the MIT Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change in one study looking at the effects of the country's pollution on GDP.In 1980, levels of particulate matter in China were at least 10 to 16 times higher than the World Health Organization’s annual guideline value, according to the authors. In 2005, as air quality had substantially improved, the levels were still around five times higher.China also has problems with soil contamination from arsenic and other heavy metals from mines and factories. Zhou Jianmin, director of the China Soil Association, told the Guardian last month that he estimated that one-tenth of China’s farmland was affected. Soil contamination could have potentially dire consequences for food production and human health, scientists told the Guardian.""The country, the government and the public should realize how serious the soil pollution is,"" Jianmin said. ""More areas are being affected, the degree of contamination is intensifying and the range of toxins is increasing.""Water pollution is also a growing challenge. China's own government has admitted that  about 14 per cent of China's water sources had unqualified drinking water and that 11.4 per cent of water supplies to cities were unsafe.Government statistics from 2009 reveal that nearly 20 per cent of the length of China's monitored rivers and lakes had pollution worse than Grade 5, making the water officially unfit for even irrigating crops, Reuters reported.The concern now is that the health impact from pollution is chipping away at the economic gains made due to industrialization.The MIT study noted that three decades of unprecedented growth in China has given rise to  ""important quality of life improvements for the more than half a billion people who have been raised out of poverty."" But this has come with a price.""China now faces severe challenges relating to its environment, including air pollution, the availability of clean water, and desertiﬁcation, the report said.""Issues such as these have the potential to create constraints on future growth. Those environmental problems that result in negative health outcomes, such as contaminated water and high levels of air pollution, also incur real costs on the individuals, the health system, and the economy as a whole.""A World Bank study estimated that damage to human health from air pollution in China was around 4 per cent to 5 per cent of GDP levels between 1995 and 2003. But the MIT study estimated the damage at around 6 per cent to 9 per cent of GDP.In fact, the study estimated that lost labour and health care costs associated with pollution cost the Chinese economy $112 billion in 2005.The OECD recently released a report estimating that the number of premature deaths from exposure to particulate matter  is projected to more than double worldwide to nearly 3.6 million per year in 2050, with most deaths occurring in China and India.Some Chinese officials have been surprisingly  frank in expressing their concerns.In delivering the ""state of the environment"" report last year,  Li Ganjie, China's vice minister of environmental protection, admitted that ""the overall environmental situation is still very grave and is facing many difficulties and challenges.""Li said while pollutants in surface water and sulphur dioxide emissions in cities were down, the countryside was becoming more polluted, He pledged to control contamination by heavy metals and said that China needed a law to regulate heavy metals, the New York Times reported.Environmental observers say there are other promising signs of China's commitment to tackle pollution. Earlier this year, officials said Beijing  would start reporting air quality data that includes readings of particulate matter  that measures 2.5 microns or less in diameter.This was seen as an important step, as it's this size of particle that can enter someone's lungs or bloodstream, causing health complications.Nicholas Lardy, a leading expert on China's economy, told CBC News that while China has reduced the energy use per unit of GDP quite substantially, GDP is still growing rapidly, meaning the total amount of pollutants is still going up in absolute terms. For example, China continues to burn up around four billion tonnes of coal a year.""The good news is that compared to business as usual they've made substantial progress. The bad news is they are still the largest emitter of most of the bad stuff,"" he said."

""This year, not many.""He blames the decline on the diplomatic battle that's brewing between Canada and China — the primary source of his customers.Ever since Chinese tech executive Meng Wanzhou was arrested while in Vancouver in December of 2018, he says tourists from that country have seemed less keen on visiting.He says he's even had to reassure potential customers who were worried they could be arrested while in Canada, after seeing images of Zhou in court.""We just say, 'no. No way of that,'"" says Zhang with a shake of his head.According to the Crown corporation, Destination Canada, in 2016 and 2017, China was the country's third largest market for tourism. Almost half of Chinese tourists who arrive here, end up in B.C.The concerns being relayed now are a stark change from last year, when the organization dubbed 2018 the Canada-China year of tourism.It's not just Chinese tourists who are having second thoughts, Canadians are also rethinking whether they should spend time in China.""I just feel unsafe,"" said Vancouver's Jonathan Wong about visiting China after stepping off a flight from Hong Kong on Tuesday.Fellow passenger Lorna Hernandez, says she feels ""a little bit scared"" after seeing several Canadians being detained while another was sentenced to death for drug smuggling.On Tuesday, Canada issued an updated travel advisory for China, warning citizens about the risk of arbitrary enforcement of laws in that country.Hours later, China criticized the move and issued its own travel warning for Chinese citizens travelling to Canada."
U.S. businesses beg Trump not to escalate tariffs on China | CBC News,U.S. businesses are imploring President Donald Trump not to expand his tariffs to $300 billion US in goods from China that have so far been spared in his trade war with Beijing.,2019-06-17T18:05:14.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/hearings-tariffs-china-imports-1.5178526,"U.S. businesses are imploring President Donald Trump not to expand his tariffs to $300 billion US in goods from China that have so far been spared in his trade war with Beijing.These companies warn that the additional tariffs would drive up prices for consumers, squeeze profits and leave U.S. companies at a competitive disadvantage to foreign rivals that aren't subject to higher taxes on the components they buy from China.And in a sign that commercial combat between the world's two biggest economies is hurting business on both sides of the Pacific, the Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei warned that the hostilities with the Trump administration will shrink its expected revenue by $30 billion over the next two years.Huawei is at the heart of the trade war that Beijing is engaged in with the Trump administration, which has accused Chinese companies like Huawei of committing forced technology transfers from American companies and stealing their trade secrets. Last month, the U.S. placed Huawei on its ""Entity List,"" which effectively bars American companies from selling components to Huawei without government approval.In the meantime, American businesses, trade groups and individuals are pleading with the administration to drop its threat to tax the remaining Chinese imports that Trump hasn't already hit with tariffs — or at least spare the particular imports that they and their customers rely on. Some are appearing in person to air their grievances in seven days of hearings in Washington that began Monday.A common theme in their pleas is that American businesses — not China, as Trump often asserts — must pay the import taxes the president is imposing on Chinese goods. And in the end, many of these companies will pass their higher costs on to their customers.Trump has already imposed 25 per cent tariffs on $250 billion in Chinese imports. The goal is to pressure Beijing to stop stealing American technology, forcing U.S. businesses to hand over trade secrets and unfairly subsidizing Chinese tech companies.Eleven rounds of negotiations have failed to resolve the dispute over China's aggressive drive to surpass America's technological dominance. Businesses and investors say they hope the negotiations will gain momentum if Trump and President Xi Jinping hold a face-to-face meeting at a Group of 20 summit in Osaka, Japan in two weeks.""Most businesses are almost praying for a solution,"" said Patrik Berglund, who tracks global trade as the CEO of Xeneta, an Oslo, Norway, a firm that provides data on the shipping industry. ""These things will have enormous consequences. We're so connected in this global world.""This week, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer is sure to hear more complaints when he goes to Capitol Hill. Lighthizer is to testify Tuesday to the Senate Finance Committee and Wednesday to the House Ways and Means Committee. Lawmakers from both political parties have been increasingly inclined to speak out against Trump's aggressive use of tariffs.They were especially alarmed last month when Trump unexpectedly threatened to impose crippling tariffs on Mexico in a push to stop the flow of Central American migrants into the United States. Trump dropped the tariff threat after Mexico agreed to do more to block the migrants.But the combat with China continues. And Chinese companies are being bruised. Huawei's founder and CEO, Ren Zhengfei, likened his company to a ""badly damaged plane"" because of the U.S. actions against it.Ren said Huawei will reduce capacity and expects revenue of about $100 billion annually for the next two years, compared with $105 billion in 2018. In February, he had said the company was targeting $125 billion in 2019. Huawei's overseas cellphone sales will drop by 40%, Ren predicted.The Trump administration asserts that Huawei poses a national security threat because it is beholden to China's ruling Communist Party. But American officials have presented no evidence of any Huawei equipment serving as intentional conduits for espionage by Beijing. Huawei's placement on the Entity List is widely seen as intended to persuade resistant U.S. allies in Europe to exclude Huawei equipment from their next-generation wireless networks, known as 5G.The action against Huawei marked an escalation in a yearlong dispute with China. Trump's earlier tariffs largely spared American consumers by focusing on industrial goods that don't show up directly in the mall or big-box stores. But the new round would inflict financial pain on ordinary households because it will affect many consumer goods, from cellphones and computers to shoes and silk scarves.""There's certainly a lot of business pressure to resolve the China trade wars,"" said Amanda DeBusk, chair of the international trade practice at the law firm Dechert and a former U.S. Commerce Department official.She added: ""The president looks at all of this as a negotiation. As we have seen, sometimes these things have a way of working themselves out as they did with his tariffs on Mexico.""If Trump does expand his tariffs to all remaining goods from China, though, it could prove costly. A report commissioned by the National Retail Federation found that American consumers would pay an additional $4.4 billion a year for clothing, $2.5 billion more for shoes and $1.6 billion more for household appliances.More broadly, economists say the tariffs could weaken a U.S. economy that appears to be on shakier footing. Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, said the higher import taxes would leave the United States with 900,000 fewer jobs than it would have had otherwise.""The U.S. economy will be flirting with recession later this year and early next,"" Zandi said.Jeffrey Pratt, leader of the supply chain practice at the accounting and consulting firm BDO, called the looming tariffs ""a bit of gamechanger"" for his clients. Many can't afford to absorb the taxes themselves and would pass along the higher costs to their customers.Atlas PyroVision Entertainment in Jaffrey, New Hampshire, relies on China for 90 per cent of the fireworks it sells.""Simply imposing a 25 per cent tariff will ultimately cause significant harm to our family business,"" CEO Stephen Pelkey said in a filing with the U.S. Trade Representative. ""We would be forced to pass along the increase directly to our customers.""Noting that community non-profits often use the fireworks for Independence Day celebrations, Pelkey wrote: ""In most cases, a 25 per cent hike in price will force their skies to go dark on the 4th of July.""Bracing for the new tariffs, Yedi Houseware, a Los Angeles family business, has postponed plans to hire and move into a bigger warehouse. Bobby Djavaheri, a company executive, echoed a common complaint: The administration is taxing products — in his case, things like air fryers — that aren't made by American companies. They must be imported. So no U.S. producer benefits from the tariffs; U.S. importers just get socked with a tax.""It's really dumbfounding,"" he said."
"China 'firmly supports' Hong Kong leader amid crisis, Beijing rep says | CBC News","China's top representative in Hong Kong said Thursday the central government in Beijing maintained its support for Carrie Lam, the city's chief executive who is grappling with Hong Kong's greatest political crisis since it returned to Chinese rule in 1997.",2019-07-11T12:03:39.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/china-backs-hong-kong-leader-1.5207793,"China's top representative in Hong Kong said Thursday the central government in Beijing maintained its support for Carrie Lam, the city's chief executive who is grappling with Hong Kong's greatest political crisis since it returned to Chinese rule in 1997.Millions of people have taken to the streets of Hong Kong in the past month in some of the largest and most violent demonstrations in decades to protest against a proposed extradition bill that would allow people to be sent to mainland China for trial.Wang Zhimin, director of the Liaison Office of the People's Government in Hong Kong, criticized the violence at some of the protests, including the July 1 break-in and ransacking of the territory's legislature.""If we indulge crimes and breaches of the law, even whitewash, exonerate or give them support, that would be a blatant challenge to the rule of law in Hong Kong, which will eventually hurt the interest of all the Hong Kong people,"" he said.""Hence, the central government firmly supports Chief Executive Carrie Lam and the Special Administrative Region government.""Wang was speaking at a pro-Beijing event in Hong Kong that was carried live on television.Hong Kong was returned to China from Britain in 1997 as a Special Administrative Region (SAR) with the promise of a high degree of autonomy, although many in the territory say Beijing has tightened its grip in recent years.Many in Hong Kong see the extradition bill as another step in increasing Beijing control over the financial hub.In the face of the opposition to the bill, Lam suspended it in mid-June and this week said it was ""dead."" She has declined to formally withdraw it from the legislative process, though, leaving protesters unsatisfied.In addition to calling for the withdrawal of the bill, demonstrators have asked for Lam to resign, for an inquiry into the use of force by the police at a June 12 protest and for detained and arrested protesters to be set free.Analysts say that after Lam's handling of the turmoil over the extradition bill, her eventual departure — which will require Beijing's blessing — is only a matter of time.Wang repeated a Chinese government assertion that ""foreign forces"" were behind the unrest, and a small number of Hong Kong people were willing to be used to create trouble.""We should give the SAR government time and room. Everybody should unite and move forward, help each other out, and build Hong Kong, our common home,"" Wang said.Thousands of people in Hong Kong laid sunflowers and white lilies at a memorial site Thursday for a man who fell to his death during protests against the extradition bill.Marco Leung, 35, fell from construction scaffolding in June after unfurling banners against the now-suspended legislation. More protests are planned for the weekend.People of all ages attended the outdoor service for Leung at a public playground, where volunteers offered tissues to mourners, and Red Cross workers stood by to provide advice.Hundreds lined up in intermittent rain to pay respects, with the crowd swelling in the evening as people came from work.""Life is indeed precious ... but for freedom, life can be sacrificed,"" Methodist minister Yuen Tin-Yau, one of the event's organizers, said in a speech. ""The reason why human beings on Earth are human is to sacrifice themselves for the sake of benevolence, justice, friendship and freedom.""Stress and trauma over the turmoil have created an unprecedented mental health problem that the city is not equipped to deal with, medical professionals say.Psychologists and social workers also attended the memorial to provide support.Hong Kong's youth have been at the forefront of the city's biggest and most violent protests in decades, with police firing rubber bullets and tear gas in chaotic scenes.Organizers read out a statement from Leung's parents that thanked the community and expressed hope Hong Kong would see better days.""Every brave Hong Konger going to the streets is doing so because they love Hong Kong so much,"" the message said.""Young people, please protect yourselves, and keep your body and soul together, then you have a chance to speak out about injustices in society."""
Fed-up Canada leans on United States to help with China crisis | CBC News,"Canada is leaning on the United States to help settle a dispute with China, which has started to block imports of vital Canadian commodities amid a dispute over a detained Huawei executive.",2019-05-05T20:03:06.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/china-us-canada-trade-canola-1.5123884,"Canada is leaning on the United States to help settle a dispute with China, which has started to block imports of vital Canadian commodities amid a dispute over a detained Huawei executive.In a sign of increasing frustration at what it sees as a lacklustre U.S. response, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's government is signaling it could withhold co-operation on major issues.China has upped the pressure on Canada in recent weeks over the arrest of Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou, arrested last December on a U.S. warrant.It halted Canadian canola imports and last week suspended the permits of two major pork producers.After Meng's Vancouver arrest, Chinese police also detained two Canadian citizens.Beijing is refusing to allow a Canadian trade delegation to visit, forcing officials to use video conference calls as they try to negate a major threat to commodity exports.With no cards to play against China without risking significant economic damage, Canada has launched a full-court press in Washington, which is negotiating its own trade deal with Beijing.The results have been meagre.""It's a very challenging situation. When we raise it with the Americans they just say, 'Dealing with the Chinese is tough,'"" said a Canadian government source.""It's also not clear who we should be targeting since you never know who is up and who is down in the administration at any given point,"" said the source, who requested anonymity given the sensitivity of the matter.Among those the Canadians approached are Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Republican Sen.Jim Risch, chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee.The State Department said it was ""concerned"" by the canola ban. In March, the Foreign Relations Committee responded to Canada's concerns by passing a bipartisan resolution supporting the country.Canada says the United States is obliged to help, given that the U.S. arrest warrant triggered the crisis with Beijing.U.S. negotiators have rejected Chinese proposals to include the Huawei issue in their current trade deal discussions, according to a source familiar with the negotiations.Canada's U.S. ambassador David MacNaughton, who noted Canada has assisted the current U.S. administration on diplomatic efforts with Venezuela, Latvia and NATO, strongly suggested future requests for aid would not be met so positively unless Washington cooperated more.""How do you go to canola farmers and relatives of the two [Canadian detainees] and say, 'Well, actually, notwithstanding all of this, we're going to try and do whatever we can to help?'"" he said.""It makes it much more difficult in public opinion terms for the prime minister to have permission to do some of the things that would be in both countries' interests.""MacNaughton, who has cabinet-level status in Trudeau's government, played a key role in negotiating a new North American trade deal last year.Relations between Trump and Trudeau are formal at best. Officials in Ottawa have not forgotten that the president blew up last year's Group of Seven summit in Canada by describing Trudeau as very dishonest and weak.""At the political level, this administration doesn't like us very much,"" said a second well-placed source.Intertwined with the China crisis is a second problem: the tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum that Trump imposed last year on national security grounds.Meng, who is under house arrest at her Vancouver mansion, next appears in court on May 8 ahead of an extradition hearing, in a process that could take years.MacNaughton said part of Canada's frustration also stems from a lack of information on U.S. intentions toward Meng. Trump has previously suggested the charges against her could be dropped if that would help the trade talks.""What we've said is, 'We'd like to have a little better sense of what your plans are in terms of dealing with her. Are you engaged in negotiations over a plea deal?,'"" he said. ""We're completely in the dark."""

Beijing-funded classes on China for Canadian kids are a lesson in propaganda: expert | CBC Radio,"Students in New Brunswick have been learning about Chinese language, food and culture in weekly half-hour classes paid for by the Confucius Institute. What they're not taught is anything remotely controversial, such as China's record on human rights violations. Are the classes a lesson in soft power and propaganda?",2019-04-12T17:45:51.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/radio/thecurrent/the-current-for-april-12-2019-1.5095255/beijing-funded-classes-on-china-for-canadian-kids-are-a-lesson-in-propaganda-expert-1.5095871,"Read Story TranscriptCanadian school children have been learning about Chinese culture in weekly classes funded by Beijing, but one expert argues they're also getting a lesson in propaganda.""It's basically a classroom that has been outsourced to the Chinese government, giving China the power to edit out whatever it doesn't want foreigners to hear about its history, and its culture, and its authoritarian government,"" said Rachelle Peterson, policy director at the National Association of Scholars, an American non-profit education advocacy group.The classes on language and culture are run by the Confucius Institute — which is funded by China — and taught by teachers brought from China. The partnerships to run classes in Canadian schools are signed between Beijing and provincial authorities here.Peterson told The Current's guest host Gillian Findlay that as part of those deals, schools in Canada receive ""valuable financial arrangements and incentives like trips to China for teachers and students,"" as well as building economic ties that can be important to the wider community.""The Chinese government uses these financial levers to gain access to a vulnerable population — students — whose minds are not yet aware of what's happening in China,"" she said.Peterson called it a ""soft power operation,"" and argued that it was inappropriate for foreign governments to fund Canadian school systems.""Foreign governments should not be funding classrooms, and should not be choosing the textbooks and sending over, hiring and vetting the teachers,"" she said.Following complaints from parents, New Brunswick's education minister Dominic Cardy has said he wants the Confucius Institute out of the province's schools by the end of the year.Cardy said it's clear to him the program's real mandate is to present a ""one-dimensional"" view of China and to influence students to only perceive the country in a positive light.Premier Blaine Higgs later said the government may not be able to back out of the program as quickly as Cardy wants, because the contract runs to 2022.The original 2007 contract allowed either side to cancel it with six months' notice, but the 2017 renewal agreement removed that clause at China's request.In 2014, the Toronto District School Board voted to remove the institute from their schools following protests.The Current contacted the Confucius Institute in New Brunswick, and Hanban, the Chinese government agency responsible for the institutes. Neither returned our request for comment.In a statement, the Confucius Institute in the U.S. told The Current that it recognizes ""discussions about Chinese government and political issues are important for education,"" but that ""those discussions should and can take place in the host institution's politics, history, international affairs, or Asian studies departments.""""Nothing about the Confucius Institute programs prevent that from happening,"" the statement continued.Wenran Jiang characterized New Brunswick's move to stop the classes as ""arbitrary"" and ""undemocratic.""With more than 5,450 students taking the classes in the province, ""there were merely five complaints so far to the minister, which is one-tenth of one per cent,"" said Jiang, an adjunct professor at the school of public policy and global affairs at the University of British Columbia.He argued that if Cardy wants to uphold democratic values, ""he should listen to the 99.9 per cent of the people who did not complain.""CBC NewsJiang told Findlay that the Confucius Institute's curriculum is designed to be neutral, focusing on language, and cultural expressions such as food or clothing.""It's not designed to teach human rights, or Chinese politics or international relations,"" he said.Jiang said that concerns are motivated by sinophobia, adding that the Chinese government does not export ""its ideologies around the world.""Click 'listen' near the top of this page to hear the full conversation.Written by Padraig Moran, with files from CBC News.

Who would have imagined a wolf-size otter?"" said Denise Su, Cleveland Museum of Natural History curator of paleobotany and paleoecology.It had enlarged cheek teeth and strong jaws that appear to have been used for crunching hard objects, perhaps large shellfish and freshwater mollusks, and was capable of swimming in shallow, swampy waters.""I think it used its powerful jaws to crush hard clams for food, somewhat like modern sea otters, although the latter use stone tools to smash shells,"" said Xiaoming Wang, head of vertebrate paleontology at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County.""If Siamogale melilutra was not smart enough to figure out tools, perhaps the only option left was to develop more powerful jaws by increasing body size,"" Wang added.The fossils, found at a site in China's Yunnan Province, include a largely complete cranium and lower jaw, various teeth, and limb bones.The skull was crushed eons ago during the fossilization process. The researchers used sophisticated scanning to digitally reconstruct it, discovering it boasted a mix of otter-like and badger-like skull and dental traits.There was intense interest in the fossil site because an important prehistoric ape skull previously had been unearthed there. Others fossils found include elephants, rhinos, tapirs, deer, beavers, crocodiles and water birds including ducks, swans and cranes.The largest otter alive today is the South American giant river otter, weighing up to about 70 pounds. Otters belong to a mammalian family including the weasel, badger, marten and mink. The earliest-known otter lived about 18 million years ago. But otter evolution is not well understood, with fossils rare and scattered around the world.Siamogale melilutra may not be the largest otter ever, with fossils of another one that may be the biggest previously found in Africa.The research was published in the Journal of Systematic Palaeontology."

Canadian imprisoned in China 'forgotten' | CBC News,The wife of a Canadian citizen who is serving a life sentence in China for speaking out on behalf of the country's Uighur minority says the Canadian government has all but forgotten about him.,2012-07-05T11:47:32.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/canadian-imprisoned-in-china-forgotten-1.1174951,"The wife of a Canadian citizen who is serving a life sentence in China for speaking out on behalf of the country's Uighur minority says the Canadian government has all but forgotten about him.Kamila Telendibaeva says her husband, Huseyin Celil, a refugee from China's troubled Xinjiang region, is being punished because he spoke out about the democratic and religious rights for the Muslim minority group.Human rights activists say Beijing considers anyone in the Uighur community who tries to promote their culture or religious values, or who speaks about greater autonomy for the Uighur people, a terrorist.Telendibaeva says she will join a demonstration today in Toronto to mark the third anniversary of the July 2009 riots in Urumqi, China, in which nearly 200 people were killed.Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Diane Ablonczy says her department was engaged in Celil's case but admits diplomatic hurdles complicated the government's attempt to push for his release.She says China does not recognize dual citizenship and it does not, as a consequence, recognize Canada's right to have consular access to one of its imprisoned citizens.""They have not been willing to budge off that position although we continue to press them and will continue to press them,"" Ablonczy said.Celil escaped from China in 1994 when the terrorism charges first surfaced. He fled to Turkey where he was granted refugee status by the United Nations High Commission for Refugees. He became a Canadian citizen in 2001, when he moved to Ontario and settled in the Hamilton area.In 2006, while visiting his wife's family in Uzbekistan, Celil was detained by Uzbek police and deported to China without the consent of the Canadian government.Wayne Marston, NDP critic for human rights, said that the trumped-up terrorism charges are typical in China for silencing dissent.""Anybody that appears to have expressed concerns about the regime in China is subject to those terrorism laws and the abuse of them,"" he said.Celil's wife said it's been months since she last received an update on her husband's case from the Canadian government.""I'm frustrated,"" Telendibaeva told The Canadian Press from her home in Burlington, where she lives with her four young sons.""I didn't receive anything from the Foreign Affairs Department and I didn't get any information from the Chinese authorities,"" she said.Celil's sister has been the only person allowed to visit him in prison — for 40 minutes behind a glass enclosure every six months, Telendibaeva said. No other visitors have been given access, including Telendibaeva and the couple's children.Prime Minister Stephen Harper raised Celil's case with Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao during a visit to Beijing earlier this year.But Harper's strong statements on China's human rights record did not sit well with the Chinese government and may have hurt Celil's chances of release, Marston said.""There were times that if you handed the Chinese a note with 20 names on it of people who were detained, without too much commentary at all — three, four months later they would start surfacing and would actually get released,"" he said.""But if, on the other hand, you were to, like our prime minister apparently did, make the public announcement that he is going to talk to them about their human rights record, that kind of slows processes altogether,"" he said."

Saudi crown prince arrives in China to boost relations amid tensions with the West | CBC News,Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman arrived in China on Thursday on the latest stop of a sweep through Asia that seeks to boost relations with the kingdom's neighbours amid frictions with the West.,2019-02-21T23:15:38.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/saudi-prince-salman-china-uighur-visit-1.5028845,"Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman arrived in China on Thursday on the latest stop of a sweep through Asia that seeks to boost relations with the kingdom's neighbours amid frictions with the West.His visit follows trips to India and Pakistan, which send millions of labourers to Saudi Arabia and are seeking closer economic ties.He is to meet Chinese officials, including President Xi Jinping, on Friday, highlighting Saudi Arabia's importance as one of China's top oil suppliers and a market for its exports, including military drones.The visit underscores China's attempts to balance its relationships in the Middle East, a major component of its ""Belt and Road"" initiative to link its markets to those in Asia, Africa and Europe through rail and road networks and infrastructure such as power stations and factories.Bin Salman's visit to Beijing follows one earlier this week by a high-powered delegation from Saudi Arabia's chief strategic rival, Iran.At a meeting Wednesday, Xi told Iranian parliament Speaker Ali Larijani that ""China's resolve to develop a comprehensive strategic partnership with Iran will remain unchanged,"" regardless of the evolving international situation, according to China's official Xinhua News Agency.China has also pursued robust ties with Israel.Bin Salman's trip comes five months after he came under intense pressure in the U.S. and elsewhere following the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul. Some reports allege Khashoggi was killed on orders of the royal family. In the U.S. Congress, criticism over the kingdom's handling of the war in Yemen has also been building for months.China is facing growing international criticism over its treatment of its Muslim minority groups as part of a wide-ranging crackdown on religion and minority languages.Thus far, Turkey has been the only majority Muslim country to criticize Beijing, with its Foreign Ministry this month calling the treatment of minority Uighurs ""a great cause of shame for humanity"" and saying it is ""no longer a secret"" that China has arbitrarily detained more than a million Uighurs in ""concentration camps.""Saudi Arabia's Al Saud royal family has long cast itself as the defender of Muslims across the world. Its king describes himself as the protector of Islam's two holiest mosques at Medina and Mecca. Observant Muslims pray five times a day in the direction of the cube-shaped Kaaba at the mosque at Mecca.Saudi Arabia's silence on the Uighur issue is partly explained as a show of appreciation for China's non-interference policy in other states' domestic affairs, which contrasts with Western states' linkage of foreign and economic relations and human rights, said Jonathan Fulton, a political scientist at Abu Dhabi's Zayed University. It also reflects China's success in framing its policies toward Muslim minorities as a struggle against political Islam, Fulton said. ""Many Arab countries are also concerned with Islamist political groups ... and see these as ideological threats to their governments,"" he said.Commenting Wednesday on the crown prince's visit, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said recent years have ""seen a positive momentum in our co-operation with fruitful outcomes in various areas such as infrastructure and space satellites.""""We hope that through this visit we will enhance our relations enhance mutual trust, deepen co-operation ... and inject momentum into our bilateral relations,"" he said.Bin Salman is to visit South Korea after Beijing. In New Delhi, he offered intelligence sharing and other co-operation with India to help fight extremism and terrorism, as Prime Minister Narendra Modi tackles rising tensions with Pakistan following a suicide bombing last week targeting Indian paramilitary soldiers in disputed Kashmir."

Stocks plunge for 2nd day on U.S.-China trade jitters | CBC News,"Stocks took a dive Tuesday morning, with the New York indexes at one point down more than two per cent, amid increased anxiety over the tariff war between China and the U.S. It is the second day of volatility over the trade issue.",2019-05-07T15:43:10.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/stocks-plunge-u-s-china-trade-1.5126051,"Stocks took a dive Tuesday morning, with the New York indexes at one point down more than two per cent, amid increased anxiety over the tariff war between China and the U.S. It is the second day of volatility over the trade issue.Beijing said its top economic adviser will go to Washington for trade talks despite U.S. President Donald Trump's threat to raise tariffs by the end of the week, but China hinted at retaliation for the aggressive tactics.Investors fear the world's two largest economies will fail to reach a compromise and the fallout will be a downturn in global growth.The Dow closed down 1.8 per cent or 473 points to 25,965 and the broader S&P lost 48 points or 1.7 per cent to 2,884. The Nasdaq fell more steeply, losing 1.8 per cent or 159 points, as tech stocks such as Apple and Microsoft are heavily exposed to China.The S&P remains up more than 15 per cent on the year and stocks have had a long bull run, but traders are predicting more volatility in the weeks ahead.In Toronto, the TSX lost a more modest 135 points or 0.8 per cent to 16,357 as oil fell in response to the trade tensions.The main North American crude contract, West Texas Intermediate, was down $1.02 at $61.21 US a barrel, while Brent crude fell $1.66 to $69.58 US.Benchmarks in London and Tokyo declined, while Shanghai, Hong Kong and Sydney rose.""The market had been widely anticipating a positive resolution to the trade dispute and it looks like it's going to be more difficult than that,"" said Larry Berman, ETF Capital Management.He said investors should brace for weeks of uncertainty, with the complicating factor that we are late in a market cycle.""I suspect this could get a lot worse before we see a resolution. I suspect China is going to call his bluff and he will institute the tariffs and that's going to be bad for global trade,"" Berman said.Trump threatened to raise tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods to 25 per cent from 10 per cent, effective Friday. He said he would impose increases on an additional $325 billion of imports, covering everything China sells to the United States.Businesses have said in earnings calls that a round of 25 per cent tariffs will seriously impede growth.The Chinese government said Vice Premier Liu He will go to Washington as planned, dispelling fears he might cancel after Trump threatened to escalate a fight. ""The base case still remains we see a framework agreement reached, but the market is still re-pricing in the risk,"" Edward Moya of Oanda said in a report.In early trading, London's FTSE 100 lost 1.6 per cent  to 7260 and Tokyo's Nikkei 225 plunged 1.5 per cent to 21,923 as trading resumed following a week-long holiday.The Euro Stoxx composite index fell 1.8 per cent after the European Union's executive commission trimmed its forecast for eurozone economic growth this year to 1.2 per cent from 1.3 per cent.The Shanghai Composite Index gained 0.7 per cent to 2,926.39 and Hong Kong's Hang Seng added 0.5 per cent to 29,363.02. Sydney's S&P-ASX 200 picked up 0.2 per cent to 6,295.70 and benchmarks in New Zealand, Taiwan and Singapore advanced.India's Sensex was off 26 points at 38,580.44.Trump's threat Sunday revived jitters that had been largely put to rest by statements from both sides that negotiations were making progress. The American president accused Beijing of backtracking on commitments made in the rapid-fire negotiations.The Trump administration is pressing Beijing to roll back plans for government-led development of Chinese global competitors in robotics, electric cars and other technologies. Trump accused China of reneging on promises to open its markets and made claims those developments in China are based in part on stolen technology.""Beijing is not a big fan of hostage situations,"" said Vishnu Varathan of Mizuho Bank in a report. ""The tight deadline alongside threats of widening the tariff net may not play out favourably for prospects of an imminent deal."""

Both have worked to gain a better understanding of China's positions on international issues through meetings with officials, researchers and scholars, it says.""These meetings and exchanges are the foundation of serious research and diplomacy around the world, including for Chinese scholars and diplomats. However, Kovrig and Spavor's detentions send a message that this kind of constructive work is unwelcome and even risky in China,"" the letter reads.Kovrig and Spavor were detained last month on alleged national security offences, not long after Canada arrested Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou at the request of the U.S.Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said the detentions are in retaliation for Meng's arrest, calling them ""arbitrary.""The signatories are from Canada and around the globe, including the United States, the United Kingdom, Sweden, Australia, Germany, Japan and Italy. In their letter, the academics and former envoys say they are ""deeply concerned"" about the detentions.""We who share Kovrig and Spavor's enthusiasm for building genuine, productive, and lasting relationships must now be more cautious about travelling and working in China and engaging our Chinese counterparts,"" the letter reads. ""That will lead to less dialogue and greater distrust, and undermine efforts to manage disagreements and identify common ground. Both China and the rest of the world will be worse off as a result.""The two men face up to four hours of questioning each day and have no access to a lawyer, according to Canada's top diplomat in Beijing.Kovrig and Spavor were both detained in China late last year. The men, who were arrested not long after Canada arrested Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou at the request of the U.S., stand accused of national security offences.Conservative MP Michael Cooper, who just returned from a trip to China with a parliamentary delegation — which was arranged prior to the arrests, to deal with various diplomatic issues — said Canadian officials conveyed the message that until the two men are released, ""it's not business as usual"" between the two countries.There was some pushback from some Chinese officials who focused on Meng's arrest, said Cooper. He said the Canadians tried to explain that that arrest was not a political decision, but was within the purview of Canada's independent courts.""That was something that was perhaps difficult for them to fully understand, given the fact the Chinese court system is by no means independent,"" he said. Cooper repeated the Conservative position that it is time for Trudeau to intervene to try and de-escalate bilateral tensions.""It's clear that this situation isn't getting any better, and in light of that, what is required is intervention by Canadian officials at the highest levels, chief among them the prime minister,"" he said.Last week, Canada's Ambassador to China John McCallum said the detained men are questioned for up to four hours a day, do not have access to a lawyer, and have consular assistance restricted to one visit per month.Those conditions could continue for up to six months under China's extra-judicial system, he said.McCallum has visited both men in prison and met with their families. He has also met with Robert Schellenberg, a Canadian convicted of drug smuggling in China who recently had his 15-year prison sentence changed to a death sentence after a retrial.Canada has issued an updated travel advisory for China, warning its citizens about the risk of arbitrary enforcement of laws in the country. Just hours later, China issued its own travel warning, citing the ""arbitrary detention"" of a Chinese national in Canada at the request of a ""third-party country."" "

Lee's chip left Korda with an 18-footer for eagle from off the back edge that she missed to the left.""It was a good fight out there, and I fought to the end,"" Lee said.Ariya Jutanugarn tied Lee with a two-stroke swing on the par-3 17th, then hooked her 3-wood drive into the water on 18 to end her chances for a tour-high sixth victory.""I knew that I had a good opportunity, but I wasn't getting ahead of myself,"" Lee said. ""I knew Jess was going to make birdie — was probably going to make birdie — and so I thought to myself, `I need to make birdie here.' I just put myself in good spots and then I ended up making birdie. Just stuck to my game plan.""Lee rebounded after losing a six-stroke lead Saturday, closing with a 2-under 70 in hot and humid conditions to finish at 13-under 275. Korda had a 71. Jutanugarn shot 70, her closing bogey leaving her two strokes back.Five days after Typhoon Sarika blew through the South China Sea beach resort, the wind jumped up on the final holes, making it more difficult to hit the valleys and plateaus on the large greens.""It played like a totally different golf course,"" Korda said. ""It wasn't the same as every day. The golf course conditions were a lot harder today. Some greens were slow and there were some greens that were fast. All in all, it was a tough day out there.""Lee chipped in for birdie on the par-4 first to break a tie with Korda, chipped to 2 feet for birdie on the par-5 eighth and had eight straight pars before stumbling on the 154-yard 17th. She ran her 30-foot first putt 6 feet past, watched Jutanugarn make a 15-footer for birdie, then missed the comebacker to give up sole possession of the lead for the first time since the start of the round.Lee earned $315,000 US and is projected to jump from 17th to 16th in the world ranking. She won last year at Kingsmill and in April in Hawaii.The Australian tied for 37th last week in South Korea and was one of the many players who didn't get to Hainan until Wednesday afternoon, leaving little time to prepare.""I really came into this week with no expectations,"" Lee said. ""Just wanted to have fun.""She did, and her mother and grandmother were there to celebrate with her.""My Nan, she my biggest supporter,"" Lee said. ""I love having her around. She normally comes around for the Asia Swing, so yeah, it's nice to have won in front of her. She was here, so that's really nice.""Korda bogeyed the par-3 seventh, firing her tee shot over the green a day after hitting to 6 inches. The defending champion next week in Malaysia, the 23-year-old American birdied the par-3 11th and par-5 14th. She three-putted the par-4 16th for a bogey, charging a 25-footer 15 feet long.""I think considering we had zero preparation for the tournament and came in on Wednesday, I think I would have taken a second place if you would have told me that that's what I would have gotten,"" Korda said. ""We didn't get a lot of preparation. But with the typhoon, there's nothing you can do.""Ten shots behind Lee after two rounds, Jutanugarn made $139,681 to take the money lead from Lydia Ko with $2,439,878.

Ko and Jutanugarn are playing next week in Kuala Lumpur.Thailand's Pornanong Phatlum (72) and Germany's Caroline Masson (73) tied for a distant fourth at 6 under. England's Charley Hull (69) was 5 under, and Sweden's Pernilla Lindberg (72) 4 under.Brooke Henderson (71) was 3 under. The 19-year-old Canadian has played all four weeks in Asia and plans to make it six in a row with stops in Malaysia and Japan.Michelle Wie was one of the 13 players to break par, closing with a 74 to tie for 10th at 1 under.

Canada granted consular access to Michael Spavor in China | CBC News,"Canada has been granted consular access to Michael Spavor, the second Canadian detained by China this week.",2018-12-16T18:49:34.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/michael-spavor-consular-access-1.4948367,"Canada has been granted consular access to Michael Spavor, the second Canadian detained in China this week.Canada's ambassador to China John McCallum met with Spavor on Sunday, according to a statement from Global Affairs Canada.""Canadian consular officials continue to provide consular services to him and his family and will continue to seek further access to Mr. Spavor,"" the statement said.Spavor and former Canadian diplomat Michael Kovrig were taken into custody earlier this week in Beijing, days after the RCMP arrested a top Chinese business leader transiting through Vancouver at the behest of the United States. The U.S. wants Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer of Huawei Technologies, to be extradited to the U.S. to face fraud charges.McCallum met with Kovrig, who is on a leave of absence from Global Affairs Canada, on Friday. He served as a diplomat in China until 2016 and has been working for the International Crisis Group, a non-governmental agency. China says he was arrested for harming its national security.According to today's statement, consular visits generally aim to assess the well-being of the person being detained, clarify the reason for the detention, provide guidance on legal issues and act as a link between the detainee and loved ones. Officials are working to get further access to both detainees.Global Affairs would not disclose the reason for either Kovrig's or Spavor's detainment, citing provisions of the Privacy Act.But according to the Beijing News, a state-run Chinese newspaper, the two were detained on suspicion of engagement in activities that endanger China's state security.If that is the case, then it is an extremely serious situation, according to Sida Liu, a professor from the University of Toronto who specializes in China's legal system.In an ordinary criminal case in China a suspect is put into a detention centre and their family is notified within 24 hours, Liu told CBC's News Network. They are also given access to a lawyer within 48 hours, Liu said.Watch: Law professor on legal challenges faced by 2 Canadians detained in China:CBC News""But that's for ordinary criminal cases. There's a big exception for national security.""Liu said those conditions would not apply in the cases of the two Canadian detainees.""The two Canadians can be detained for much longer ... and there is no guarantee that the lawyer would be involved at this point.""In an interview on Friday with the Canadian Press, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau criticized China's actions, calling them ""not acceptable."" When asked if the detention of the two Canadian men was intended as retaliation, a spokesperson for China's Foreign Ministry said they were being handled according to Chinese law.U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo also urged China on Friday to end the ""unlawful detention"" of the two Canadians.""We ask all nations of the world to treat other citizens properly and the detention of these two Canadian citizens in China ought to end,"" Pompeo said in Washington, alongside Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland.Pompeo moved to temper an earlier statement by U.S. Donald Trump this week, who mused he might intervene in the Meng case if it helped him get a trade deal with China.Pompeo said the extradition request for Meng isn't being used as political leverage in the trade talks with China.In Washington, the arrests dominated questions Pompeo and Freeland took after a meeting that also included Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan and U.S. Defence Secretary Jim Mattis.The two foreign ministers tried to distance the extradition process that is now in the Canadian courts from politics. Freeland said Friday's discussions focused on upholding the rule of law, and ensuring Meng's right to due process is respected and that the ongoing legal process remains free of politics.""Canada, in detaining Ms. Meng, was not making a political judgment. In Canada there has been, to this point, no political interference in this issue at all. For Canada, this is a question of living up to our international treaty obligations and following the rule of law,"" Freeland said. ""The extradition process is a criminal-justice process. This is not a tool that should be used for politicized ends.""But critics say Canada is being disingenuous in insisting the arrest is not about politics.The arrest of a Chinese tech executive is yet another example that the U.S. is creating ""a new Cold War"" in international trade, says economist Jeffrey Sachs, who adds that Canada is abetting its southern neighbour.Sachs said it's a ""pretty well-known American approach to use its power to try and break the economic momentum of a rival,"" adding that it now sees China as a substantial rival.The fraud allegations against Meng centre around the relationship between Huawei and a Hong Kong company called Skycom, that did business in Iran.According to U.S. prosecutors, Skycom was a ""hidden"" subsidiary of Huawei. Meng once served on Skycom's board of directors but she says Huawei sold its interest in Skycom and she stepped down from the board.Iran is subject to U.S. sanctions and banks can be found criminally liable if they help move money out of a sanctioned country and into the broader global banking system.Watch: Jeffrey Sachs on Huawei executive's arrestCBC NewsSachs believes the arrests are a consequence for Canada's recent involvement in Washington's campaign to levy heavy-handed punishment on Meng over perceived Iran sanctions violations.""I think Canada's doing the bidding of United States policy that is not well-controlled or well-modulated,"" he said.""Maybe Canada's being used and manipulated, not only vis-à-vis China, but for the United States to try to show anyone: 'You dare cross us on any business with Iran, you're going to pay a price.'""With files from Justin Li and the Canadian Press"

Rather, Bolstad likens it to a Facebook page becoming inactive.""[We're] just trying to quiet the conversation right now in terms of tourism.""Bolstad said she can't speculate on what effect this will have on Chinese tourists coming to the Northwest Territories, but said she hasn't heard any concerns from tourism operators in the territory.""These trips are often booked and sold well in advance,"" she said."

hitting, in one recent deal, 230 times the per-acre average for Canadian farmland.While blueberry prices have collapsed, dropping to less than a dollar per pound at peak season, half what some growers said they were getting a few years ago.Norm Letnick, British Columbia's agriculture minister, said he doesn't see it as a glut, and he downplayed the sharp price drop at packing houses.Growers may be doing better at roadside stands, he said.""Because they don't have a middle man, they might be making very good net profit.""For many farmers, that view misses the bigger picture.""Rich people, they can buy the farms, but they don't want to do the farming,"" said Liu, who grows organic berries for export to Asia.""It's very, very, very cheap to lease their farmland...[but] farmers are not getting rich.""About half the listings in recent years for smaller farms and nearly all the larger ones near Vancouver have been purchased by buyers with ties to mainland China, agents said.Canada doesn't track the nationality of property owners, and British Columbia only began doing so in June.It reported 18 per cent of sales in recent weeks in Richmond, home to one of the most well-established Chinese communities in Canada, were to unspecified foreign nationals living abroad.Chinese nationals with resident status in Canada were excluded.The buying spree has set records.A 4.5-acre blueberry farm with no house sold late last year to a Chinese investor for $2.58 million, that is $573,000 per acre.Nationwide, farmland averages $2,460 per acre, according to Farm Credit Canada.The British Columbia Blueberry Council, a trade group representing hundreds of growers, said much of the interest was from Chinese business people who see berry farms as an export opportunity, much like those who have bought vineyards in recent years to export British Columbia wine to China.Real estate agents said some Chinese nationals were looking at the redevelopment potential, viewing farms as lottery tickets that would pay out if urban sprawl one day forces officials to scrap strict prohibitions.""They're playing the long game,"" said agent Michael Lu.Others have built luxurious estate homes with an eye toward retirement and surrounded them with berries.Owners cut their taxes by using the land for farming, often leasing it out to local growers.Owners like blueberries because they are pretty and easy to maintain, especially compared to the province's No. 2 produce export - mushrooms.The province produces 80 percent by value of fresh blueberries exported by Canada, the world's No. 2 producer.Like farmers elsewhere, they went big into blueberries, encouraged that the touted health benefits would stoke the market.They also were banking on trade talks with China.A China cherry deal, finalized in 2014, boosted export values 70 percent in one year.Newcomers have leased plots from absentee landlords because they can't afford to buy their own, and long-established farm families have rented additional plots because they are cheap.Together, they pushed British Columbia's blueberry yields up 71 percent from 2010 to 2015."
How China's 'social credit' system blocked millions of people from travelling | CBC Radio,"Since 2014, the Chinese government has been experimenting with a system that rewards — and punishes — people for their public behaviour through so-called ""social credit"" points. We hear from experts worried about government control, and people who say those fears are overblown.",2019-03-07T20:45:31.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/radio/thecurrent/the-current-for-march-7-2019-1.5046443/how-china-s-social-credit-system-blocked-millions-of-people-from-travelling-1.5046445,"Read Story TranscriptMillions of people were blocked from buying airline tickets or booking train journeys in China last year after being blacklisted under the country's controversial ""social credit"" system.The National Public Credit Information Center revealed in its annual report that people with low scores had been blocked from buying airline tickets 17.5 million times in 2018, according to the Associated Press.People were barred from buying train tickets 5.5 million times, and 128 people were blocked from leaving the country due to unpaid taxes, the report said. Additionally, there were 290,000 instances where a person's low score stopped them from getting a senior management job or acting as a company's legal representative.""If you're on one of these blacklists, you are barred from buying luxury goods on some of China's online shopping platforms, you can't buy a plane ticket, you can't get a mortgage,"" said Nathan Vanderklippe, the Globe and Mail's Asia correspondent.""In some places, if you are on this blacklist, there's been experiments where the government will automatically change your cellphone ringtone,"" he told The Current's Anna Maria Tremonti.""So if your friends call you, instead of hearing a phone ringing, they get a message saying this person's on the blacklist, as a method of public shaming.""Originally conceived in the 1990s, the Chinese government has been experimenting with the current form of the social credit system since 2014. Citizens have points deducted from their score for breaking the law or more minor offences like walking a dog without a leash. Currently, the system is only in effect in certain areas, run by local officials. But the Chinese government wants to have it implemented across the whole country by 2020.While a low score can limit your chances of getting a government job, Vanderklippe pointed out that under the system, citizens also receive rewards for good behaviour.""You can earn points for example by volunteering, perhaps by donating blood, by doing things that are considered pro-social,"" he said.That could result in financial advantages like lower heating bills, or perks and bonuses when booking hotels, he said.Human Rights Watch has called the system an attempt by Chinese authorities to ""create a reality in which bureaucratic pettiness could significantly limit people's rights,"" but one legal expert says those fears are overblown.""I understand why people worry about this because it does seem like a big overreach, collecting these massive amounts of data,"" said Jamie Horsley, senior fellow and lecturer at Yale Law School's Paul Tsai China Center.""It clearly could be abused. I mean, we all worry about the privacy issues,"" she told Tremonti.""But this system doesn't just sweep in all kinds of information. It has to be that there has been a fine imposed, or a court judgment, and information about that specific act gets put in the system.""The WeeklyShe pointed out that the system has encouraged people to obey the law, and pay fines promptly when there are infractions.""It's ... been very effective, and one thing that never seems to be reported is that people are getting off the blacklist as well as being put on them,"" she said.""So something seems to be working."" While the west may view the social credit system ""as a form of state repression tool,"" Lynette Ong argued that view isn't shared everywhere in China.""From the Chinese perspective … they see this as a form of social management,"" said Ong, associate professor of political science at the University of Toronto.In China, which has a population of almost 1.4 billion, there is ""very low trust among strangers, much lower than in our society,"" she told Tremonti.""I think they see [the] social credit system as a way to collect data and build a database, for people to be discerning of who is actually trustworthy,"" she said.However, Ong suggested that the system may be impossible to implement across a country as vast as China.""With slowing growth in China, this needs a lot of resources to fully implement this. And where is the money coming from? I think people are going to question whether it is OK to spend so much money in social credit.""Click 'listen' near the top of the page to hear the full conversation.Written by Padraig Moran.

"Starbucks will deliver from 4,000 stores in the U.S., China | CBC News","The company says it will offer delivery from 2,000 U.S. stores by next summer through a partnership with Uber Eats. It isn't yet saying which stores will offer it.",2018-12-14T15:53:18.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/starbucks-delivery-us-china-1.4946187,"Starbucks is expanding delivery to more stores in the U.S. and China as it tries to accelerate growth in those two markets.The company says it will offer delivery from 2,000 U.S. stores by next summer through a partnership with Uber Eats. It isn't yet saying which stores will offer the service.In China, delivery will be offered from 2,000 stores in 30 cities by the end of this year, up from 150 stores at the end of September. Starbucks began working with its Chinese delivery partner, Ele.me, three months ago.Starbucks made the comments at an investor presentation Thursday in New York. The Seattle-based company said it has simplified its business in recent years — by closing its Teavana stores and selling many European stores to franchisees, for example — so it can focus more directly on the U.S. and China.In the U.S., its largest market, Starbucks says it still sees significant opportunities to expand and expects to open 550 net new stores annually over the next few years. The company also plans to close 150 underperforming stores in 2019.In China, Starbucks plans to open 600 stores annually through 2022, bringing it to a total of 6,000 stores.Delivery is one area where it could expand. Investors questioned the economics of Uber Eats, asking whether Starbucks will earn less because of the fees Uber charges.Roz Brewer, Starbucks' group president of the Americas, said the company is still studying that. In Miami, where it has been running a pilot program with 200 stores, she said the company has found that delivery works best in dense urban areas where Uber Eats' delivery fees are lower because of high demand.And CEO Kevin Johnson noted that customers are spending two to three times more on delivery orders than they would in the store, so that makes the partnership more appealing.Johnson says Starbucks has learned a lot about delivery since launching it in China in September. The company has special spill-proof cups, for example, and is making beverages hotter so they will be the right temperature to drink when they arrive.Johnson said the company has also opened two small kitchens in the back of grocery stores in China so it can quickly fulfil delivery orders. That is one idea that could eventually come to the U.S., he said. The company is also packing orders in tamper-resistant bags, so customers will feel more comfortable getting them from a third-party driver.Johnson said it's difficult to say what percentage of orders either in the U.S. or China will eventually come from delivery. Starbucks' mobile ordering and payment for pickup in U.S. stores more than doubled to 12 per cent of orders between 2016 and 2018, and that could also happen with digital ordering, he said.""Customer behaviours are shifting rapidly,"" Johnson told The Associated Press. ""We must continue to adapt and adapt rapidly to meet our customers where they are.""Even as it's expanding delivery, Starbucks is continuing to try to improve its in-store experience. Brewer said Starbucks plans to renovate one-third of its U.S. stores this year to add equipment and redo delivery and mobile pickup areas.Starbucks is also opening a high-end Reserve Roastery in New York on Friday. The 23,000-square-foot store includes a bar with coffee- and tea-themed cocktails, Italian pastries and rare small-batch coffees roasted on site.Johnson said Starbucks plans to open two more roasteries, in Tokyo and Chicago, next year, but hasn't committed to more after that. The company also has them in Seattle, Shanghai and Milan.""It acts as a brand amplifier,"" Johnson said, noting that customers are still lining up to get inside the Shanghai store a year after its opening."

WTO says China can apply $3.6B worth of retaliatory sanctions to U.S. imports | CBC News,A World Trade Organization (WTO) panel said on Friday that China was entitled to slap compensatory sanctions on U.S. imports worth $3.579 billion annually for the U.S. failure to remove anti-dumping duties — roughly half the amount China had sought.,2019-11-01T16:42:58.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/wto-china-us-dispute-1.5344444,"A World Trade Organization (WTO) panel said on Friday that China was entitled to slap compensatory sanctions on U.S. imports worth $3.579 billion US annually for the United States' failure to remove anti-dumping duties – roughly half the amount China had sought.The decision came as the world's two biggest economies try to clinch Phase 1 of a trade deal. U.S. President Donald Trump and U.S. negotiators are ""very optimistic"" about concluding it, White House adviser Larry Kudlow said.In the WTO ruling, a three-member arbitration panel said Chinese exporters suffered impairment to trade valued at $3.579 billion annually. China may now ask the WTO's Dispute Settlement Body for a green light to impose the retaliatory tariffs on imported U.S. goods valued up to that amount each year.China told the WTO in September 2018 that it had suffered $7.043 billion in damages annually due to U.S. anti-dumping duties ruled illegal by a WTO panel in 2016 and later upheld. China therefore requested permission to raise trade barriers on U.S. goods to the same amount, as allowed under WTO rules.As the Trump administration objected to the amount, the issue was sent to arbitration.The case relates to U.S. dumping duties on industries including machinery and electronics, light industry, metals and minerals, and the U.S. Commerce Department's way of calculating the amount of ""dumping"" — Chinese exports that are priced to undercut American-made goods on the U.S. market.The U.S. calculation method, known as ""zeroing,"" tended to increase the level of U.S. anti-dumping duties on foreign producers and was repeatedly ruled to be illegal in a series of trade disputes brought to the WTO.The U.S. Trade Representative's office in Washington had no immediate response."

'Not supported by foreign forces': Critics dispute China's claim Hong Kong protests fuelled by West | CBC Radio,"A Hong Kong pro-democracy activist is firing back at the Chinese government’s accusation the ongoing political crisis is fuelled by Western forces, calling it “absurd” and a tactic used to “stigmatize our movement.”",2019-07-29T18:53:33.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/radio/thecurrent/the-current-for-july-29-2019-1.5227016/not-supported-by-foreign-forces-critics-dispute-china-s-claim-hong-kong-protests-fuelled-by-west-1.5228543,"Read Story TranscriptA Hong Kong pro-democracy activist is firing back at the Chinese government's accusation the ongoing political crisis is fuelled by Western forces, calling it ""absurd"" and a tactic used to ""stigmatize our movement.""""It is very ridiculous that every time Hong Kong has a protest, the Chinese side will accuse that we are funded or supported by foreign forces,"" said Nathan Law, a longtime activist in Hong Kong and founder of the pro-independence political party Demosisto. ""The truth is, I'm not supported by foreign forces. ... And I do believe every single Hong Kong citizen is coming out because they care about the city. They want political reform and their basic human rights,"" he told The Current's guest host Laura Lynch.The Chinese government took a hardline approach to the mass demonstrations on Monday, pledging in an unprecedented news conference that Beijing will not allow any challenge to China's authority or threats to national security sparked by Western forces.Without naming a specific nation, the country's top policy office blamed the political crisis on ""irresponsible people"" in the West, who aim to stir up trouble ""in order to contain China's development.""Louisa Lim, a former NPR and BBC correspondent based in Beijing, believes the Communist Party is repeating history when it tries to pin the Hong Kong resistance on Western ideology. ""It's really a line out of the Tiananmen playbook that trouble is caused by hostile foreign forces stirring up unrest,"" said Lim, who is also a senior lecturer at the Centre for Advocacy and Journalism at the University of Melbourne.""In the case of Hong Kong, to make this kind of argument really ignores the basic demands that people are asking for.""Hong Kong has been rattled by two months of escalating pro-democracy protests, which have stoked political dissent with the territory's leader, Carrie Lam, for not responding to a series of demands, including her resignation.Yang Guang, a spokesperson for the Chinese Cabinet's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, which has cabinet-level authority over the territory, condemned the demonstrations as ""horrendous incidents"" and backed Lam, as well as police, for ""fearlessly sticking to their posts and fulfilling their duties against all odds.""He urged Hong Kong authorities to ""do what needs to be done"" to halt future clashes.This is the first time the Chinese government's upper brass has formally addressed the Hong Kong protests since the crisis began, and one of the only times Beijing authorities have commented on the former British colony since it returned to Chinese rule in 1997. That promise of a high degree of autonomy has since been questioned with many in Hong Kong saying that Beijing has tightened its grip in recent years.The eighth consecutive weekend of mass demonstrations in Hong Kong took another violent turn as police repeatedly launched tear gas and rubber bullets to drive back pro-democracy protesters. At least 49 people have been arrested in connection with Sunday's protest, which left about two dozen injured.Law said police used ""far more"" riot-control firearms over the weekend than had ever been previously deployed during other clashes.""It was quite brutal,"" he continued. ""It was just like a battlefield.""The escalating political crisis in the semi-autonomous Chinese territory erupted early last month in opposition to the now-suspended extradition bill that would allow people accused of a serious criminal offence to be sent to mainland China to face trial in Communist Party-controlled courts. Lam has not offered any timetable or plan to revisit the legislation, but critics have warned if it goes forth, the legal rights of suspects would be threatened.Lam has reluctantly promised the extradition bill is ""dead"" in order to ""restore calmness to society,"" but so far has refused to scrap it entirely.Most recently, dissent has pivoted toward the police who have been accused of using excessive force against protesters. The movement's demands now include calls for Lam's resignation, full democracy and an independent inquiry into police brutality during the conflict.So far, Lam has refused to accede to any of the requests.""Until the Hong Kong government starts to address those political demands, it's very hard to see any solution in sight,"" said Lim.""This is primarily a political problem that requires a political solution.""Written by Amara McLaughlin, with files from Reuters and The Associated Press.

Grade school children from Canada and China use Skype to learn about each other. They teach each other songs and their languages. ""We get to see kids from a different culture,"" said third-grader Jesse Moffat. ""A lot different,"" his classmate Brook Myslichuk chimes in. Jesse continues: ""A couple of weeks ago, we talked about New Year, Chinese New Year. Traditions. They put up different decorations than we do. A lot of it is red."" ""It's great,"" said Musa Baci, a Grade 4 student. ""[For Earth Day] we found out they call it Grandpa Earth and we call it Mother Earth."" The teachers who participate in the reciprocal learning program come up with topics for the children to discuss, in conjunction with the Chinese students' teachers. The program was created by Shijing Xu, a professor in the Faculty of Education at the University of Windsor. For six years now, she has created opportunities for pre-service teachers to visit sister schools in Canada and China. That program involved universities, school boards and more than 40 schools in the two countries. Now, she's extending that opportunity to younger students. ""Both our systems have our strengths and differences,"" she said. ""We want to learn from each other so we can improve education for both sides in this globalized world. ""Sometimes we think the two cultures are so different, but when we listen to the sharing between the kids, we realize we have commonalities,"" Xu said. The school teachers, who also need to get up early for the Skype chat once a month, see a huge advantage for their students. ""It's an awareness,"" said Rose Lesperance, a Grade 6 teacher at Prince Edward. ""On the other side of the world, kids are doing similar things. They're learning from them. It's not just opening up a book, going online for research."" Grade 3 teacher Julia Szamburski has seen how much it's helped her students grow. ""It's so important. Seeing them talk to one another, the excitement on their faces,"" she told CBC News. ""They're friends now. It's amazing.""The kids first started with exchanging letters. The Skype sessions started last year. The program now involves almost 20 schools in Windsor and Canada, and is continuing to grow. ""I'm looking forward to more of these,"" the third grader Moffat said. Before the kids start their regular school day, they sing 'Twinkle Twinkle Little Star' as the Chinese students clap along."

Western worry grows over allegations of China's economic espionage | CBC News,A closer look at the day's most notable stories with The National's Jonathon Gatehouse: western nations increasingly concerned by allegations of Chinese spying; Justin Trudeau's meeting with provincial leaders tomorrow is likely to be awkward.,2018-12-06T19:51:28.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/thenational/national-today-newsletter-china-spy-trudeau-first-minister-1.4929849,"Welcome to The National Today newsletter, which takes a closer look at what's happening around some of the day's most notable stories. Sign up here and it will be delivered directly to your inbox Monday to Friday.The official reason why Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer and deputy chair of the Chinese tech giant Huawei, is under arrest in Vancouver and facing extradition to the United States is an allegation that she and the company have violated American trade sanctions against Iran.  But such a bold gambit — Meng is also the daughter of company founder Ren Zhengfei, one of China's most influential players — is surely also intended to send a message about how serious Donald Trump is in his ongoing trade war with Beijing.And it has more than a little to do with growing concerns over China's economic espionage.Huawei has already been singled out for special scrutiny, with the U.S., Australia and New Zealand having blocked the use of the company's technology and equipment in new 5G wireless networks over fears of Chinese intelligence gathering.Earlier this week, the heads of Britain's MI6 and the Canadian Security Intelligence Service — the two other partner nations in the ""Five Eyes"" communications monitoring system — both issued public warnings about state-sponsored 5G spying.The alarm over China's espionage activities is based on more than just one firm, however.In recent months, U.S. authorities have indicted or arrested at least 11 alleged Chinese spies and hackers over a supposed government-backed plot to steal aircraft engine technology from French and American companies that dates back to 2010.And just last week, there were reports that the White House is pushing for tough new background checks on Chinese students and considering shortening the visa duration for those studying aviation, robotics or advanced manufacturing from five years to just one. All due to fears that a significant number of the 360,000 that the U.S. welcomes each year might be there to spy as much as learn.The suspicions about China's intentions have also gone global.Since August, intelligence authorities in the U.S., Germany, Britain and France have all warned that the Chinese government is using LinkedIn and other professional social networks to ""harpoon"" business executives and product experts. The allegations involve befriending them through social media in order to harvest their contacts, then extending invitations to collaborate with Chinese companies in hopes of eventually recruiting them as sources.  Among the other China-spying-related concerns in recent weeks:Last March, the Hoover Institution at Stanford University produced a report on Chinese espionage around the world. It concluded that several nations, including the United States, France, Germany, Japan and Canada, are constantly at risk, with New Zealand and Australia being in the most danger.The paper describes a two-pronged spying effort.The first is designed to ""observe and harass its diaspora community,"" in order to shut down voices that are critical of the Chinese government.The second seeks to ""penetrate institutions in democratic states that might draw attention or raise obstacles to Chinese Communist Party interests,"" making it easier for Beijing to act just as it desires at home and abroad.Nicholas Eftimiades, a former CIA and Defense Intelligence Agency employee and now a lecturer with Penn State University's Homeland Security Program, recently published an analysis of 274 documented cases of Chinese worldwide espionage since the year 2000.He concluded that Chinese spying operations have expanded massively over the past two decades, as Beijing makes a ""national concerted effort to expand China's economic and security interests."" He says the Chinese Communist Party is using every means it has to harvest secrets, including quasi-government agencies, academics and state-owned companies.In the past couple of years, that espionage has mostly been focused on military and space technologies, but as the government pursues its strategic ""Made in China 2025 plan"" the push is also on to find shortcuts to advance sectors like agriculture, AI, manufacturing and green technologies.The question is whether anything can really be done to reduce or limit the scale of Chinese intelligence gathering, since stopping it seems impossible.The arrest of Meng Wanzhou is certainly grabbing worldwide headlines, but Eftimiades expresses doubts that Trump's get-tough approach is making any difference.""China's espionage activities continue unabated despite a large number of arrests, public exposure, and most recently, U.S. trade sanctions,"" he notes.Justin Trudeau's meeting with provincial leaders tomorrow is likely to be awkward, writes Rosemary Barton.I'm on the road again this week — this time in Montreal, where the prime minister and his provincial and territorial counterparts are gathering for the first ministers meeting.And while the talks officially begin tomorrow, the mood here is already tense.Trudeau is expected to face criticism from premiers about what's on the official agenda — or more likely, what was left out.You can bet that the carbon tax, pipelines and the oil price crisis will make their way into the discussions. Alberta Premier Rachel Notley and Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe even sent a letter the prime minister earlier this week demanding that oil be formally added to the agenda.In a scrum yesterday, Trudeau said that oil and natural resources would ""of course be on the agenda,"" and that he would be willing to discuss ""anything the premiers want to talk about.""He may not have a choice. Manitoba Premier Brian Pallister has said that, ""if the agenda doesn't change, the premiers will change the agenda during the meeting itself.""This will be Trudeau's fourth meeting with the first ministers since 2015 — and it's likely going to be the most divided one we've seen since since he came to power.A lot has changed since the last time they met. As Chantal Hébert explains in her column this week, political goodwill may be in short supply this time around. Trudeau has lost several key provincial allies, and those remaining are in delicate political positions.Thankfully it's At Issue tonight. Chantal, Andrew Coyne and Chris Hall will be here to talk about the lead-up to the meeting, along with whatever else happens on the political front over the next few hours.Hope you can join us.- Rosemary Barton""We feel it's a First Amendment issue, we have other displays there -- a Hanukkah menorah and Nativity scene. If you have displays of one type you need to be consistent and allow everyone to do so, aside from hate speeches and other unacceptable things.""- Dave Druker, a spokesman for the Illinois secretary of state, on a decision to allow theSatanic Temple of Chicago to place statue in the lobby of the Capitol building in Springfield this holiday season.Dec. 6, 1989: Gunman massacres 14 women at Montreal's École PolytechniqueAnne St-Arneault, 23; Geneviève Bergeron, 21; Hélène Colgan, 23; Nathalie Croteau, 23; Barbara Daigneault, 22; Anne-Marie Edward, 21; Maud Haviernick, 29; Barbara Klueznick, 31; Maryse Laganière, 25; Maryse Leclair, 23; Anne-Marie Lemay, 22; Sonia Pelletier, 23; Michèle Richard, 21; and Annie Turcotte, 21.Digital ArchivesSign up here and have The National Today newsletter delivered directly to your inbox Monday to Friday.Please send your ideas, news tips, rants, and compliments to thenationaltoday@cbc.ca. ​"

Stock markets remain jittery even as Trump and China try to ease trade war fears | CBC News,"The United States and China sought to ease trade war tensions on Monday, with Beijing calling for calm and U.S. President Donald Trump predicting a deal after markets fell in response to new tariffs from both countries.",2019-08-26T00:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/trump-china-markets-trade-1.5259741,"The United States and China sought to ease trade war tensions on Monday, with Beijing calling for calm and U.S. President Donald Trump predicting a deal after markets fell in response to new tariffs from both countries.Trump, speaking on the sidelines of the G7 summit of world leaders in France, said Chinese officials had contacted U.S. trade counterparts overnight and offered to return to the negotiating table.Vice-Premier Liu He, who has been leading the talks with Washington, said on Monday China was willing to resolve the trade dispute through ""calm"" negotiations and resolutely opposed the escalation of the conflict.Trump welcomed that language and, days after referring to President Xi Jinping as an enemy, heaped praise on his Chinese counterpart.""They want calm, and that's a great thing, frankly. And one of the reasons that he's a great leader, President Xi, and one of the reasons that China's a great country is they understand how life works,"" Trump said.""China called last night our top trade people and said 'Let's get back to the table', so we'll be getting back to the table, and I think they want to do something,"" he said.In Beijing, Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said he had not heard that a phone call between the two sides had taken place. However, China's Commerce Ministry typically releases statements on trade calls. It did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The increasingly bitter trade war between the world's two largest economies escalated on Friday, with both sides levelling more tariffs on each other's exports.Trump announced an additional duty on some $550 billion of targeted Chinese goods, hours after China unveiled retaliatory tariffs on $75 billion worth of U.S. goods.On Sunday, the White House said Trump regretted not raising the tariffs even more. But the president also appeared to back off of his threat to order U.S. companies out of China.Liu, speaking at a tech conference in southwest China's Chongqing, said nobody benefited from a trade war.""We are willing to resolve the issue through consultations and co-operation in a calm attitude and resolutely oppose the escalation of the trade war,"" Liu, who is Xi's top economic adviser, said, according to a government transcript.""We believe that the escalation of the trade war is not beneficial for China, the United States, nor to the interests of the people of the world,"" he said.The trade war has damaged global growth and raised market fears that the world economy will tip into recession.Geng, the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, said China would retaliate if Trump enforced the latest U.S. tariffs.Asked if he would abandon the tariffs, Trump said: ""Anything is possible. I can say we are having very meaningful talks, much more meaningful I would say than any time, frankly.""Before Trump spoke on Monday, global stock markets reeled, while China's yuan currency fell to an 11-year low. Investors streamed into the safe harbours of sovereign bonds and gold.The U.S. president, who at times predicts a deal will happen and at other times says he is happy with the tariff situation, said talks would start again soon and a deal would come.""I think we are going to have a deal,"" he said.The two sides had been slated to meet in September in Washington, but it was unclear last week whether the new tariff tit-for-tat would alter those plans.The United States accuses China of multiple economic sins, including intellectual property theft, currency manipulation, and forced technology transfer by U.S. companies to their Chinese partners as a requirement for doing business in China. China denies the U.S. allegations.Beijing and Washington were close to a deal last spring but U.S. officials said China backed away from an agreed text over a reluctance to change laws to address U.S. complaints.The trade war has affected businesses all over the world and disrupted supply chains. Trump recently urged U.S. companies to move their operations out of China, but it was not clear how or whether his efforts to order such a move would work.Liu said on Monday: ""We welcome enterprises from all over the world, including the United States, to invest and operate in China.""We will continue to create a good investment environment, protect intellectual property rights, promote the development of smart intelligent industries with our market open, resolutely oppose technological blockades and protectionism, and strive to protect the completeness of the supply chain.""U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Trump could order companies out of China under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act if he declared a national emergency.Chinese state media on Monday hit out at the United States.The official China Daily said Washington would ""never be allowed to control China's fate.""""It has become unquestionably clear that his administration's tariff war against China is politically motivated. What Washington wants from its largest trade partner is for it to be content to play second fiddle and meekly do as it demands,"" the English-language paper wrote in an editorial.The Global Times, a widely read tabloid published by the ruling Communist Party's official People's Daily, said: ""U.S. companies are welcome to invest and operate in the Chinese market, but if some U.S. companies want to obey Trump's order and join Washington's trade war, the result is bleak. A decision to give up the Chinese market is just suicide."""

AEG also apologized ""for the inconvenience and disappointment that this will cause.""A representative for Jon Bon Jovi didn't immediately reply to an email seeking comment.The Financial Times newspaper reported that the shows had been called off because the Culture Ministry had discovered that the band once included a picture of the Dalai Lama in a video backdrop during a concert in Taiwan in 2010, citing people familiar with the matter.The ruling Communist Party is sensitive to any perceived support from foreign governments and celebrities for the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader, who they denounce as a separatist.A recently released video shows Jon Bon Jovi singing a famous Chinese love ballad from the 1970s in Mandarin, adding to the buzz in China around this tour. Chinese fans expressed their disappointment and anger on social media, with some complaining that they had booked airline tickets and time off work to see the concerts.Authorities tightened scrutiny over foreign musicians performing in China after Icelandic singer Bjork shouted ""Tibet, Tibet"" following a song called Declare Independence at a Shanghai performance in 2008. A concert by U.S. pop group Maroon 5 planned for Saturday in Shanghai was cancelled in July following a reported tweet by a band member about meeting the Dalai Lama.China vows more scrutiny of foreign performers after Bjork outburstBjork riles Shanghai concertgoers with cry for TibetThe announcement of the Bon Jovi cancellations came on the same day as the Communist Party held grand celebrations in the Tibetan capital of Lhasa to mark 50 years since it established Tibet as an ethnic autonomous region firmly under Beijing's control.China claims Tibet has always been part of its territory, but many Tibetans say the Himalayan region was virtually independent for centuries and that Beijing's tight control is draining them of their culture and identity."

She landed forward on a triple lutz and was penalized for a late start.""I wasn't satisfied today,"" Asada said. ""I feel like there are areas that need working on in the free program but I have taken one step toward the Grand Prix Final [in December].""Asada, the 2010 Olympic silver medallist , took a year off from competitive skating but announced in May she would make a comeback. She will next skate in front of home fans at the NHK Trophy starting on Nov. 27 in Nagano.Hongo had seven triple jumps but stepped out of a triple loop.

Han Yan, also of China, was third with 230.33.Fernandez, who was first after the short program, executed a quad loop to start his routine.

6 questions on China's currency devaluation answered | CBC News,China has allowed its tightly controlled yuan to drop in value to a four-year low. Here's what you need to know about the country's currency devaluation and where it might be headed.,2015-08-13T09:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/china-s-currency-devaluation-what-you-need-to-know-1.3188290,"China's central bank is allowing its tightly controlled currency, the yuan, also known as the renminbi, to fall in value.The People's Bank of China allowed the yuan to fall to a four-year low on Wednesday, after it devalued the national currency by almost two per cent the day prior.The move signals a shift in the bank's monetary policy, financial analysists say, one that may indicate the country is moving towards a more market-oriented approach for its currency, which Beijing has been hinting at.Here's what you need to know about this recent devaluation of the yuan.Despite the Chinese economy being the second largest in the world, after the U.S., it has been underperforming for the past year or so, says Loren Brandt, a professor at the University of Toronto's department of economics. So it clearly felt it had to do something to get exports moving again.""This is kind of a normal course of action"" that is seen in most weak economies, Brandt says. ""Their exchange rate adjusts and it provides a margin with which to try to help the economy recover.""In 2014, China's economic growth fell to 7.4 per cent, a noted drop off from years of double-digit growth.In July, exports fell by 8.3 per cent and the country's manufacturers are seeing their fourth year of price deflation, Reuters reports.What's more, Chinese investors were dismayed this summer when the Shanghai Stock Exchange fell steeply, losing 30 per cent of its value in June, and then plunged more than eight per cent in one day.China's slowed economy makes this type of action unsurprising to Brandt, who says it was a question of when, not if, the government would intervene.The Chinese government has already taken several steps to remedy its economic downturn, says Peter Dungan, an economics professor at the University of Toronto's Rotman School of Management.""This is not just one thing, one time.""The central bank lowered interest rates a number of times since November 2014. Most recently, in June, it cut the rate for both one-year loans by commercial banks and for one-year deposits by 25 basis points.The bank also lowered reserve requirement ratios for small businesses. A few months prior, it had done the same for banks to free up more of their money for lending.Currency exchange rates are determined one of two ways, Dugan says.Most countries, like Canada, have a floating exchange rate that's determined by market forces. The government has some ability to indirectly influence the exchange rate. For example, the Bank of Canada can help push the Canadian dollar down by lowering its benchmark lending rate.A small number of nations, like China, have an exchange rate that is ""fixed in some way or other by the authorities."" The Hong Kong dollar and the Danish krone are also at least somewhat fixed rates.In China, the bank determines the yuan's exchange rate based on its own basket of foreign currencies, which economists tend to believe is primarily made up of the U.S. dollar. Generally, the central bank allows the yuan to move two per cent above or below the rate it sets for that day, which it calls the daily fixing. But more often of late it has been following a strong-yuan policy, designed to encourage more imports and consumer spending.Tuesday's move was described by the bank as following more supply and demand forces, which at least some outside bankers saw as a good thing. The yuan dropped 1.9 per cent Tuesday and then a further 1.6 per cent Wednesday. Some suggest it could drop by as much as 10 per cent over the next little while.The intended effect of the lowered exchange rate is to boost exports from the country, Brandt says, to make Chinese exports less expensive and thus, more desirable.Local Chinese businesses could also benefit as imported goods could prove too costly for most consumers.However, Brandt says, ""in the short run, it's very difficult to say"" if the strategy will work for China.One of the concerns is that China now appears to be entering the currency wars and that others may follow suit, perhaps by using other monetary tools like lending rates to attempt to influence their currencies, as the Bank of Canada did earlier this year, which led to the falling dollar.""If one country goes ahead and devalues their currency, then everyone feels like they need to devalue their currency even more to remain competitive with them,"" says Brandt.In some ways, China is coming late to this game. Japan embarked on the devaluation of its yen two years ago, using U.S.-style quantitative easing to drive down its value, and Britain and the European Central Bank have also deployed monetary polices, as recently as the spring, aimed at bringing down the value of the pound and euro as well. The central bank's move to let its rate fall is ""revolutionary,"" says Donald Brean, a finance and business economics professor at the Rotman School of Management, as it is ""moving more towards market signals."" The move hints at the beginnings of reform where eventually the exchange rate could be set solely by market forces, like in Canada, rather than a combination of that and government intervention, Brandt says. ""Time will tell.""A market-based rate is the track China needs to be on to achieve its goal of the yuan becoming a global currency, says Farrokh Zandi, an economics professor at York University's Schulich School of Business in Toronto.China wants the International Monetary Fund to include its currency in the Special Drawing Rights, a basket of reserve currencies it uses to lend to sovereign borrowers and which includes the U.S. dollar, the Japanese yen, the European Union euro and the British pound.The IMF has insisted that China needs to have a floating exchange rate to be admitted into the pool of currencies in the SDR.China's move to devalue its currency ""is perhaps a step in the right direction"" to meet those conditions, Zandi says."
China halts research team's work on gene-edited babies | CBC News,"China's government orders a halt to work by a medical team that claims it helped make the world's first gene-edited babies, as a group of leading scientists declared it's still too soon to try to make permanent changes to DNA that can be inherited by future generations.",2018-11-29T12:59:14.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/china-orders-halt-gene-edited-babies-1.4925176,"China's government on Thursday ordered a halt to work by a medical team that claims it helped make the world's first gene-edited babies, as a group of leading scientists declared it's still too soon to try to make permanent changes to DNA that can be inherited by future generations.Xu Nanping, China's vice-minister of science and technology, told state broadcaster CCTV that his ministry is strongly opposed to the team's efforts, which reportedly produced twin girls born earlier this month.Xu called the team's actions illegal and unacceptable, and said an investigation has been ordered, but made no mention of specific actions taken.Researcher He Jiankui claims to have altered the DNA of the twins to try to make them resistant to infection with the AIDS virus.Mainstream scientists have condemned the experiment, and universities and government groups are investigating.He's experiment ""crossed the line of morality and ethics adhered to by the academic community, and was shocking and unacceptable,"" Xu said.A group of leading scientists gathered in Hong Kong this week for an international conference on gene editing, the ability to rewrite the code of life to try to correct or prevent diseases.Although the science holds promise for helping people already born and studies testing that are underway, a statement issued Thursday by the 14-member conference leaders says it's irresponsible to try it on eggs, sperm or embryos except in lab research because not enough is known yet about its risks or safety.The conference was rocked by the Chinese researcher's claim he helped make the world's first gene-edited babies. Conference leaders called for an independent investigation of the claim by He, who spoke to the group Wednesday as international criticism mounted.There is no independent confirmation of what He says he did.He was scheduled to speak again at the conference on Thursday, but left Hong Kong, and through a spokesperson he sent a statement saying, ""I will remain in China, my home country, and co-operate fully with all inquiries about my work. My raw data will be made available for third party review.""Several prominent scientists said the case showed a failure of the field to police itself and the need for stricter principles or regulations.""It's not unreasonable to expect the scientific community"" to follow guidelines, said David Baltimore, a Nobel laureate from the California Institute of Technology who led the panel.There already are some rules that should have prevented what He says he did, said Alta Charo, a University of Wisconsin lawyer and bioethicist, and a conference organizer.""I think the failure was his, not the scientific community,"" Charo said.Gene editing for reproductive purposes might be considered in the future, ""but only when there is compelling medical need"" with clear understanding of risks and benefits, and certain other conditions, said Dr. Victor Dzau, president of the U.S. National Academy of Medicine, one of the conference sponsors.""Not following these guidelines would be an irresponsible act,"" he said.Other sponsors of the three-day conference are the Academy of Sciences of Hong Kong, the Royal Society of the United Kingdom and the U.S. National Academy of Sciences."

"Russia, China sign natural gas deal worth $400B | CBC News","China signed a landmark deal Wednesday to buy Russian natural gas worth about $400 billion, giving a boost to diplomatically isolated President Vladimir Putin and expanding Moscow's ties with Asia.",2014-05-21T12:53:40.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/russia-china-sign-natural-gas-deal-worth-400b-1.2649241,"China signed a landmark deal Wednesday to buy Russian natural gas worth about $400 billion, giving a boost to diplomatically isolated President Vladimir Putin and expanding Moscow's ties with Asia.Price negotiations on the 30-year deal continued into the final hours of a two-day visit by Putin to China, during which both sides had said they hoped to sign an agreement.Putin was in Shanghai for an Asian security conference where China's president called for a new model of Asian security cooperation based on a regional group that includes Russia and Iran and excludes the United States.The gas deal gives Moscow an economic boost at a time when Washington and the European Union have imposed visa bans and asset freezes on dozens of Russian officials and several companies over Ukraine. It allows Russia to diversify its markets for gas, which now goes mostly to Europe.The agreement ""opened the door for Russia to enter into Asia's gas market,"" said Keun-Wook Paik, senior research fellow at the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies.Politically, the deal has provided ""a breathing space for Russia,"" Paik said. ""Russia, and Putin, can demonstrate it's not completely isolated because of the Ukraine crisis. Russia has demonstrated that they have a very reliable strategic partnership with China.""Russia's economy has been bruised by its dispute with the West over Ukraine's tilt toward the European Union, a shift that inflamed Moscow's insecurities about declining influence and sparked its annexation of Crimea in March.The supplies will help to ease gas shortages in China, the world's second-largest economy, and curb reliance on coal.The agreement calls for Russian government-controlled Gazprom to supply state-owned China National Petroleum Corp. with 38 billion cubic meters of gas annually, Gazprom spokesman Sergey Kupriyanov told The Associated Press. That would represent about a quarter of China's current annual gas consumption of nearly 150 billion cubic meters.The contract is worth a total of $400 billion, Gazprom CEO Alexei Miller told Russian news agencies. That figure is greater than the GDP of South Africa. Gas is due to begin flowing to China as early as 2018.The U.S. treasury secretary, Jacob Lew, appealed to China during a visit last week to avoid taking steps that might offset sanctions. However, American officials have acknowledged China's pressing need for energy.The contract is ""particularly important"" at a time when Europe has threatened to cut gas imports and reduce its dependence on Russia because of the Ukraine crisis, said Alexander Lukin, a deputy head of the Russian Diplomatic Academy under the country's Foreign Ministry, quoted by the RIA Novosti news agency.""We will be able to show to Europe that we have other customers,"" Lukin said.Alexei Pushkov, a Kremlin ally who is head of the international affairs committee of the Russian parliament's lower house, said on Twitter: ""The 30-year gas contract with China is of strategic significance. Obama should give up the policy of isolating Russia: It will not work.""""I think it is very plain that Russia would like China to join with it as a counterforce to US strength and  dominance,`` Carlin Romano, a former Russian correspondent now based in Beijing told CBC News.""I think China is wary of that. I think China does want good relations with the U.S.,"" he added.CNPC announced it had signed a deal but it gave no details.Putin met Tuesday with Chinese President Xi Jinping while gas negotiations continued in private.The Russian leader's visit is a ""major step toward a strategic partnership of the two nations,"" said Mikhail Margelov, head of the foreign affairs committee in the upper house of the Russian parliament, according to RIA Novosti.The Ukraine crisis and Western sanctions on Russia had raised expectations Moscow would compromise to secure the gas deal.The price appears to be closer to the level Russia wanted, according to analyst Xizhou Zhou of IHS Energy. In exchange, the two sides dropped a requirement for prepayment that was a feature of Chinese purchases of Russian oil, he said.""This higher price level reflects China's willingness to pay more for cleaner fuel,"" said Zhou in a report.China and Russia have been negotiating the deal for more than a decade but had been hung up over the gas price.""Gazprom is under increasing geopolitical and competitive pressure to diversify its market toward the East, while China's gas market remains supply constrained as demand continues to surge,"" said Zhou.Russia will invest $55 billion in fulfilling the contract while China will invest $22 billion, Putin told Russian reporters in Shanghai. He said the gas price would be based on a formula linked to that of oil and oil products.Plans call for building a pipeline to link China's northeast to a line that carries gas from western Siberia to the Pacific port of Vladivostok. The development of a gas center on the Pacific will allow Russia to export to prosperous markets in Japan and South Korea."

They arrest Tibetan Buddhists simply for possessing the Dalai Lama’s photograph.""And they prevent Uighur Muslims from providing religious education to their children or fasting during Ramadan.""Kerry said North Korea, Iran and Russia also stand out for their repression of religious freedom. Turkmenistan was added to the list of countries of particular concernThe report underscores ""a major challenge"" around the world, Kerry said.Kevin and Julia Dawn Garratt 'all right,' Chinese officials tell sonBennet said the case of a Canadian couple detained over allegations they stole China's state secrets is a consular matter.""[Foreign Affairs] Minister Baird engaged with his Chinese counterparts on the case.

Trump's latest tweets create another twist in U.S.-China trade talks | CBC News,"A high-level Chinese delegation will meet with U.S. officials in Washington on Tuesday for the second round in discussions to head off a trade war, writes Saša Petricic.",2018-05-14T13:59:01.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/trump-china-us-trade-talks-petricic-1.4661639,"With a couple of tweets, U.S. President Donald Trump may have brightened the mood of this week's trade talks between China and the United States.But he's also increased confusion here in Beijing. In this months-long stand-off, does this latest twist from Trump create breathing room or a bargaining chip?A high-level Chinese delegation led by President Xi Jinping's top economic adviser, Vice-Premier Liu He, will meet with U.S. officials in Washington on Tuesday. This is the second round in so-far fruitless discussions to head off a trade war between the world's two biggest economic powers.Trump has pushed for tough measures to force China to reduce a record $375-billion US trade deficit in 2017 and to punish Beijing for what Washington calls theft of intellectual property by Chinese technology companies. Specific targets for U.S. action are set to be finalized next week.So, what to believe from Trump now? A sunny Sunday tweet saying ""be cool, it will all work out!"" Or previous dark threats from Trump that China is engaging in ""unfair,"" ""stupid trade"" that ""cannot continue?""China and the United States are working well together on trade, but past negotiations have been so one sided in favor of China, for so many years, that it is hard for them to make a deal that benefits both countries. But be cool, it will all work out!Notably, Trump is now promising a possible reprieve for Chinese cell phone maker ZTE, which is on the verge of being wiped out by U.S. legal action.In a second tweet, he said he's instructed officials to ease restrictions recently imposed on ZTE so it can ""get back into business, fast.""""Too many jobs in China lost,"" Trump wrote. ""Commerce Department has been instructed to get it done!""President Xi of China, and I, are working together to give massive Chinese phone company, ZTE, a way to get back into business, fast. Too many jobs in China lost. Commerce Department has been instructed to get it done!The big Shanghai company announced last week that it had ceased ""major operating activities"" after the U.S. Commerce Department banned American companies from selling to the firm for seven years. This, as punishment for ZTE breaking an agreement reached after it was caught illegally shipping U.S. goods to Iran.ZTE's 75,000 employees make phones and telecommunications equipment shipped to 160 countries, using key American components such as microchips and operating systems unavailable from China.The ZTE case is technically separate from Washington's broader trade crackdown, but in China, it has become a symbol of what many consider U.S. bullying.""The U.S. should be aware that it must become more cooperative and constructive in the trade talks with China,"" said the China Daily, the country's official English-language newspaper, in a Monday editorial.""It should bear in mind that the outcomes of dialogue should be mutually beneficial and China will not accept its interests being damaged,"" the newspaper said, adding that Washington must ""cast away its unilateral mentality.""Online in China on Monday, reaction to Trump's latest comments was skeptical.""This is Trump's strategy,"" said one comment on Weibo, China's popular (and officially monitored) microblogging platform. ""I hit you when I want to, I save you when I want to.""Another user said with Trump's unpredictability, ""I foresee a tough trip for Chinese negotiator Liu He.""Indeed, increased tensions over trade — and the specific case of ZTE, which highlights gaps in China's technological know-how — have piqued nationalists, including President Xi.Insiders have told western media organizations he is ""irate"" over ZTE's predicament, especially since he has marked his leadership with an emphasis on a ""rising China,"" ready and able to take its rightful place as a world leader.The first round of trade talks in Beijing only seemed to push the sides farther apart.The U.S. delegation, led by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, left a list of demands that was quickly leaked and circulated on Chinese internet.Among other things, it insists China reduce the trade deficit by $100 billion US in the next year and another $100 billion US the year after. It calls for an end to all government subsidies to advanced manufacturing industries, including microchips and artificial intelligence technology. And it demands that Beijing accept U.S. restrictions on Chinese investments in sensitive industries without retaliation.Chinese observers who understand official thinking say Beijing will push back against U.S. ""ultimatums.""""You cannot threaten the biggest market in the world with a trade war,"" says Ding Yifan, senior researcher of the National Strategy Institute at Beijing's Tsinghua University. ""You cannot win a trade war with the biggest market in the world. It's ridiculous,"" he says with a laugh.Economic simulations suggest even the most drastic U.S. moves would result in a 0.8 per cent drop in China's GDP, from 6.8 to six per cent, says Ding.""It's not so much. We can bear this kind of loss,"" he says.Economist Maiojie Yu from Peking University's National School of Development says if Washington does go ahead and impose sweeping trade measures, including tariffs, China's immediate strategy should be two-fold: First, to retaliate by matching the measures, and second to turn to other suppliers, especially European, to make up for shortages in chipsets and other technology.""If the U.S. will not sell chipsets, other European countries will do that,"" Yu says. ""They are almost an exact substitute.""""In the short run, this may have some harm to China's chip industries,"" he says, ""but in the long run, this gives pressure to these industries … they should work on their own innovation.""Yu says it would take about a decade for Chinese companies to come up with domestic alternatives.That is Plan B. For now, both sides say publicly — including in tweets — that a deal to avoid a trade war is still possible."
Yukon mining project partners with China | CBC News,A Yukon mining project wants to outsource design and procurement work to Beijing. The Canadian CEO says the idea could reduce costs by 40%,2014-10-22T22:10:09.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/yukon-mining-project-partners-with-china-1.2809333,"Copper North Mining is planning for work in the Carmacks area. The company has announced a firm in Beijing will help design a process to help it recover copper, gold and silver.The project is at the feasibility study stage but Chinese workers will help design the mine and ship equipment to Canada.He says this approach could reduce costs by as much as 40 per cent.""What (Copper North Mining) is doing is getting them to do the detailed design engineering. We oversee it here in Canada then we get the procured equipment in China. We have it delivered and then our Canadian engineering firm, JDS Energy and Mining Inc, does the construction management, mining, earth works, and the other parts of the project.""Meade says Chinese engineers would provide ""about half"" of the work at the feasibility stage with Canadian engineers hired to do the rest. The project would see also savings as it would obtain its equipment directly from Chinese suppliers.   The Beijing General Research Institute of Mining and Metallurgy is a state-owned enterprise. Its English web site is inactive but shows a large industrial complex that has been operating since 1956. Meade says the Chinese engineers would not visit Yukon as temporary foreign workers. Instead, they would be visiting the country with business visas. Workers at the Beijing General Research Institute of Mining and Metallurgy would be hired as outsourced employees by Copper North while they work in China. ""In most cases, it's quite unlikely through the immigration laws that Chinese engineers and workers would be allowed into Canada. And this arrangement does not provide for that. All the construction and all the work will be done by Canadians,"" Meade says.He adds that equipment design work is not usually found in Canada. ""Certainly if we weren't acquiring the equipment from China it would be US and some other country. We don't really fabricate a lot of mining equipment inside Canada,"" he says.Meade defends the project's model which would split work between Chinese and Canadian engineers.""I think it has to be a give-and-take. Yes, some engineering groups in Canada may wish they had that work but they have to understand these projects are competing against projects all over the world. A loss of a few engineering hours in the early part of our project is a pretty good trade-off if it allows you to build a mine and create 10 or 20 years of employment,"" he says.""Without these kinds of adjustments and reductions in cost, these projects will not get built.""  "
'Wild West of aviation': Edmonton pilot ready for wild air race in China | CBC News,"For air racing pilot Scott Holmes, the fastest motorsport in the world is pure “hair on fire” excitement.",2018-11-18T00:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/edmonton-pilot-air-race-china-1.4906791,"Update Nov. 18: Holmes placed seventh in the races. The original story appears below.For air racing pilot Scott Holmes, the fastest motorsport in the world is pure ""hair on fire"" excitement.And he's ready for his next adrenalin rush.The Edmonton pilot will be competing this weekend at the Air Race 1 China Cup, racing against seven other pilots — wing tip to wing tip — at speeds of over 450 kilometres per hour, just 10 metres above the tarmac.It's like NASCAR in the air where there is zero margin for error, Holmes said in a phone interview Wednesday from Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province.""We're all jockeying for the lead. You're in your zone. Nothing else matters, right from when the engine starts and you close the cockpit, to the end of the race.""The five-kilometre circuit at Hannan Municipal Airport is designed to challenge even the most experienced pilots.""The only thing that matters is the person you're trying to pass because if you screw up, or you make a mistake, or you stop thinking about that, you could hit and the consequence of that at 50 feet are terrible.""The race, from  Nov. 16 to 18, will be the first event of its kind ever to be held in China — and it comes with its own set of perils.""Especially in Asia, it's a bit like the Wild West of aviation,"" said Holmes, who will be flying his purpose-built Cassutt airplane named Outlaw.""They don't have a lot of the typical rules and laws and best practices that we've built in North America over the years. So we have to kind of use our best judgment in a lot of situations.""Smog is expected to make visibility extremely poor for the pilots, Holmes said. And they will by flying perilously close to a military base.""The normal course that we fly in is in Reno, Nev., which is a big open desert,"" Holmes said.""We're flying in China and it's over like rice paddies and very tall trees and the river, the Yangtze River, is right beside us.""They told us if we fly east of the river, that's the military zone, and we don't exactly know what's going to happen.""There's a lot of unknowns in this race that we're a little bit concerned about.""Holmes, 29, is the only Canadian competitor in the race. He's also the youngest and has the least flying hours of the 13 race competitors.Although Holmes, a chemical production engineer and University of Alberta graduate, has had his pilot's licence since he was 17, he's relatively new to the sport.He was invited to compete in Air Race 1 after competing at the 2017 National Formula One Air Racing Championships in Reno, his first professional race.Holmes admits he and his pit crew may be at a disadvantage but said he is looking forward to learning from his veteran competitors.""I think I'm the youngest by quite a bit in this race, actually. I think about that every day,"" Holmes said.""And what's worse is almost everybody is an airline pilot with 20,000 hours so my 350 is not even comparable.""""We're in good company."""
Canada seeks strategic allies as U.S.-China trade war dominates APEC | CBC News,"The leaders from the 21 countries represented at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit found a colourful welcome in Papua New Guinea, but the high-stakes trade conflict between the U.S. and China was spelled out in black and white as soon as talks got underway Saturday.",2018-11-17T13:05:42.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/apec-summit-saturday-us-china-trade-1.4910224,"The leaders from the 21 countries represented at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit found a colourful welcome in Papua New Guinea, but the high-stakes trade conflict between the U.S. and China was spelled out in black and white as soon as talks got underway Saturday.Before the leaders even gathered for their first family photo, Chinese President Xi Jinping and U.S. Vice-President Mike Pence gave back-to-back speeches to an APEC CEO Summit taking place in Port Moresby to coincide with the leaders talks — an audience keenly aware of how disruptive the hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs applied over the last year have been to global supply chains, at a risk to both investment decisions and consumer confidence.Anyone hoping for a conciliatory tone from the U.S. in President Donald Trump's absence was quickly disappointed.""We hope for better, but the United States ... will not change course until China changes its ways,"" Pence told the CEOs.Pence made no apologies, emphasizing instead the military and infrastructure investments the U.S. was making in the region — investments that compete with the now highly visible presence of China.This strategic game between the world's two biggest economies is evident in Port Moresby, the capital of APEC's poorest country. Signs identify new infrastructure as ""China Aid"" and advertise the ""co-operation and peace"" it's meant to signal in both English and Chinese.The road to Papua New Guinea's seat of government is newly paved by the Chinese. A Chinese investment also helped build the Hilton Hotel where the APEC leaders enjoyed their gala dinner Saturday night.Pence tried to portray what the U.S. is doing in the region as more honourable than the Chinese initiatives.""We have a principled approach that stands in stark contrast to other nations,"" he said, saying others offer opaque loan terms for unsustainable projects that come with strings attached.""Do not accept foreign debt that compromises your sovereignty,"" Pence warned. ""Be just like America, and put your country first.""""We don't offer constricting belts or a one-way road,"" the American leader said, in words chosen to reference a centrepiece of Chinese foreign policy: its ""belt and road"" initiative to build land and sea infrastructure that positions the massive Chinese market at the centre of trading networks across Europe and Asia.In a speech to the same audience, Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said Russia is willing to work with China on this initiative.One of the joint outcomes from last weekend's visit to Beijing by Finance Minister Bill Morneau and International Trade Diversification Minister Jim Carr was a commitment from Canada to send a ""high-level"" delegation to the 2019 Belt and Road Forum for International Co-operation.Canada hasn't previously attended this Chinese-organized event. A spokesperson for Carr said this ""high-level"" delegation is unlikely to include Canada's prime minister.In a contrast that would have seemed unimaginable even two years ago, it has fallen to the Chinese president to make the case for multilateralism and rules-based trade, in comments supportive of efforts to reform the World Trade Organization.Xi said that erecting trade barriers is against the trend of history. ""Old practices"" like unilateralism and protectionism won't solve problems, he said. China's setting its sights on ""post-2020 co-operation.""""History has shown that confrontation, whether in the form of a Cold War, hot war, or trade war will produce no winners,"" Xi said, calling for conversation instead.""He's trying to mend fences here, and then you have Vice-President Pence coming in ... and taking an incredibly hard tone against China,"" said Jonathan Pryke, director of the Pacific Islands program at the Lowy Institute, a non-partisan Australian think-tank.""It's worrying where this is all leading, because it doesn't seem like there is much room for conversation or middle ground to be found.""Championing rules-based trade is one of Trudeau's priorities for APEC.All three of the bilateral meetings the Canadian prime minister has scheduled are with partner countries in the Comprehensive and Progressive Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) — the 11-country Pacific Rim trade deal that takes hold Dec. 30.The first country Trudeau met with Saturday — Malaysia — has yet to ratify the CPTPP. Canada is urging Prime Minister Mahathir bin Mohamad's government to do so and start realizing its benefits.The two leaders also discussed liquid natural gas (LNG) development on Canada's West Coast. Malaysian-owned Petronas is an investor in the project.On Sunday, Trudeau will meet with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison.Pryke thinks a change in government has erased the hard feelings Australia voiced after Canada wouldn't commit to the CPTPP at last year's summit.This year, the two countries are caught in the middle of the heated rhetoric of the U.S.-China confrontation.""It's quite disturbing for a lot of middle powers who have ... relied on the U.S. to protect the liberal order that the U.S. helped create,"" he said. ""It's worrying to see that they're retreating from that narrative pretty aggressively.""That makes an APEC focused on trade and economic integration important.""But it also makes it so much harder to get anything done, because the biggest powers in the room aren't all that interested in liberalization and integration,"" he said.""We have to rely less on our relationships with the big players and we have to work more closely with people in the middle,"" Pryke said.Trudeau's other meeting Saturday was one Canada organized with leaders from Pacific Island nations.Part of Canada's commitment at the Paris Climate Conference was $2.65 billion to help small island states. As part of Canada's G7 presidency, it's been talking to small island states about ways to finance climate-resistant infrastructure in the developing world, Trudeau said before the meeting.""Increasing sea level has diminished the land we have to live on, increasing the salinity of our water that impacts on our food security,"" said Baron Waqa, the president of Nauru, an island country in Micronesia. ""The disappearance of our land could threaten our very sovereignty."""

The entire process was videotaped, and the birds were then loaded into sealed vehicles for the trip to Tiananmen Square, the newspaper said.A similar report appeared in the Beijing News, and the People's Daily tweeted about it in English: ""10,000 pigeons go through anal security check for suspicious objects Tue, ready to be released on National Day on Wed.""The reports — which did not say what the suspicious materials might be — drew amused and derisive responses from some Chinese readers, and many news sites, including the Beijing News website, later deleted the reports. However, the Jinghua Times report and the People's Daily tweet were still visible as of midday Wednesday.Members of the Chinese public responded with sarcasm because they see in the bird searches their own plight in what they consider an oppressive society with tight surveillance, censorship and judicial injustice, independent columnist Zhang Ping said in an editorial that was circulated on social media under his pen name, Changping.""The liberty and dignity of citizens are increasingly vulnerable, and can be expropriated at any time, like with the pigeons,"" Zhang wrote. ""They have to go through the pains and insults of the rude anal check and yet they must appear peaceful and happy on the screen of the state broadcaster.""The notched-up security measures reflect heightened concern about violence following a string of attacks blamed on separatist militants from the country's ethnic Uighur Muslim minority, as well as bus explosions and random slashing attacks attributed to disgruntled individuals.Last October, three Uighurs in a vehicle rammed through crowds in front of Tiananmen Gate in central Beijing and set off explosives in an attack that killed themselves and three bystanders.Beijing authorities also are sending police helicopters to monitor highway checkpoints, ring roads within the city, major intersections and areas with heavy traffic, including popular tourist spots such as the Great Wall and the Summer Palace, the Beijing News said. Additionally, the capital has mobilized 850,000 citizen volunteers to help keep a lookout in the city of about 20 million people, the newspaper said."
China's Comac to deliver 1st homegrown jets | CBC News,A state-owned aircraft maker said Wednesday it is ready to deliver China's first homegrown regional airliner and should complete a bigger plane in 2018.,2014-05-21T19:02:39.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/china-s-comac-to-deliver-1st-homegrown-jets-1.2649784,"A state-owned aircraft maker said Wednesday it is ready to deliver China's first homegrown regional airliner and should complete a bigger plane in 2018.The first two of the ARJ21-700 regional jets have been completed for a Chinese carrier Chengdu Airlines, and are coming to the end of the certification process, according to Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China Ltd. The company said it has 252 orders.China launched the ARJ21 project in 2002 in an attempt to break into the Western-dominated aircraft market. The plane was promised for 2007 but delivery was pushed back due to technical problems. The Chinese Civil Aviation Authority had hoped to partner with the FAA to get international certification for the plane, but that has not yet taken place.China is expected to become one of the world's biggest aircraft markets over the next two decades. Boeing Co. forecasts total demand at 5,580 planes worth a total of $780 billion.The ARJ21-700 can seat 78 to 90 passengers depending on its configuration, with a range of 2,225 to 3,700 km. Comac said it successfully completed test flights in North America in March and April and has flown 13,000 km. The company is targeting China's domestic market and flights to Southeast Asia. ""We first want to develop our business in China and then gradually we will go to the international market,"" Comac executive Tian Min told reporters at Comac's assembly and manufacturing centre in Shanghai. Comac's larger C919 is a single-aisle jet meant to compete with Boeing and Airbus Industrie. It can seat up to 168 passengers and has a planned range of 4,000 to 5,100 km.  The C919 is an official initiative ""for China to re-capture the value in aircraft manufacturing that currently goes offshore to Airbus and Boeing,"" said industry analyst Will Horton of CAPA Centre for Aviation. ""With such a large objective, accomplishments will come gradually.""The company has received 400 orders from 16 customers, including aircraft leasing company GE Capital Aviation Services. Low cost carrier Ryanair and British Airways have signed memorandums of understanding about their intention to purchase planes, Tian said. He wouldn't disclose price but said developers were focused on controlling costs. Most orders have come from China's state-owned airline industry under government instructions to support the program. ""Global aviation remains pessimistic on the C919, given the ARJ21 delays,"" said Horton. On May 15, the first front fuselage of a C919 was delivered by a supplier to Comac, Tian said. He said the plane will be assembled in the second half of 2014, its maiden flight is due at the end of 2015 and the first delivery to a customer is slated for 2018. Longer term, Comac is cooperating with Russia to build a next-generation wide-body plane. The two sides signed a memorandum of understanding on Tuesday during Russian President Vladimir Putin's visit to China. Tian said Comac is working on a feasibility study with Russia. From its beginning in 2008, Comac has focused on developing the two passenger planes. It has grown from 3,800 employees to 8,300."

3D dinosaur fossil eggs found in China | CBC News,"A spectacular fossil find in China — a prehistoric egg extravaganza from 120 million years ago — is providing unique insight into the lifestyle and gender differences of pterosaurs, the flying reptiles that lived alongside the dinosaurs.",2014-06-06T18:15:38.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/3d-preserved-pterosaur-eggs-found-in-china-1.2667497,"A spectacular fossil find in China — a prehistoric egg extravaganza from 120 million years ago — is providing unique insight into the lifestyle and gender differences of pterosaurs, the flying reptiles that lived alongside the dinosaurs.Until now, only four pterosaur eggs had ever been found, and all were flattened during the process of fossilization.But Chinese scientists said on Thursday they had unearthed five pterosaur eggs preserved beautifully in three dimensions at a site in northwestern China that also includes no fewer than 40 adult individuals of a newly identified species that lived in a bustling colony near a large freshwater lake.""This is definitely the most important pterosaur site ever found,"" said paleontologist Zhonghe Zhou, director of the Chinese Academy of Sciences' Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology.The creature, Hamipterus tianshanensis, had a crest atop its elongated skull, pointy teeth for catching fish and a wingspan of more than 3.5 metres.The five oblong eggs were ""pliable"" with a thin, hard outer layer marked by ""cracking and crazing"" covering a thick membrane inner layer, making them resemble the soft eggs of some modern snakes and lizards, said paleontologist Xiaolin Wang, another of the researchers.""They are the best-preserved pterosaur eggs ever found,"" Wang said.The site was remarkable for what it reveals about how pterosaurs lived. At least 40 male and female individuals have been identified, and there may be hundreds in all, Wang said.The site indicates pterosaurs lived in large colonies, in this case nesting near the lake and burying eggs in moist sand to prevent them from becoming desiccated, Wang said.""One of the significant (aspects) of this discovery - hundreds of individuals and eggs together from one site - is that it confirmed that pterosaurs were gregarious, and the population size is surprisingly large,"" Zhou said.The fossils illustrated important sex differences in pterosaurs. For example, males possessed distinctly larger head crests.""In Hamipterus, size, shape and robustness are decided by the gender,"" Wang said, adding that this contradicts a previous notion that ""sexual dimorphism in pterosaurs was only reflected in the absence or presence of the crests.""The site, discovered in Xinjiang province in 2005, was preserved probably after the Cretaceous period creatures perished together in a large storm, Zhou said.Pterosaurs were Earth's first flying vertebrates, with birds and bats appearing much later. They thrived from about 220 million years ago to 65 million years ago, when they were doomed by the asteroid that also killed the dinosaurs.Knowledge about pterosaurs has been spotty, with their fragile skeletons not lending themselves well to fossilization. Little has been known about their behavior.""I have been truly amazed by the abundance of bones and the number of eggs as well the great potential of more discoveries from the site,"" Zhou said.The genus name, Hamipterus, means ""Hami wing,"" honoring nearby Hami City. The species name, tianshanensis, refers to the nearby Tian Shan mountains."
China formalizes easing of 1-child policy | CBC News,"China on Saturday formally allowed couples to have a second child if one parent is an only child, the first major easing of its three-decade-old restrictive birth policy.",2013-12-28T15:36:14.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/china-1-child-policy-officially-eased-1.2477858,"China on Saturday formally allowed couples to have a second child if one parent is an only child, the first major easing of its three-decade-old restrictive birth policy.First announced by the ruling Communist Party's leadership in November, the decision was officially sanctioned by the standing committee of China's top legislature, the National People's Congress, the official Xinhua News Agency reported.Implemented around 1980, China's birth policy has limited most couples to only one child, but has allowed a second child if neither parent has siblings or if the first born to a rural couple is a girl.Demographers and policy makers have estimated the easing would benefit some 15 million to 20 million Chinese parents — mostly in cities — and result in one million to two million extra births per year in the first few years, on top of the 16 million babies born annually in China. They say the easing is so incremental that the extra births are not expected to strain resources such as the health care and education.China has credited the restrictive policy with managing its population growth and improving the economy, but critics say it is a violation of human rights.China is the world's most populous country with 1.35 billion people."
Kim Jong-un meets China's Xi Jinping in Beijing visit | CBC News,"North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping sought to portray strong ties between the neighbours and long-time allies despite a recent chill, as both countries on Wednesday confirmed Kim's secret trip to Beijing this week.",2018-03-27T13:17:21.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/china-north-korea-kim-reports-1.4594724,"North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping sought to portray strong ties between the neighbours and long-time allies despite a recent chill, as both countries on Wednesday confirmed Kim's secret trip to Beijing this week.China's official Xinhua News Agency said Kim made the unofficial visit to China from Sunday to Wednesday at Xi's invitation in what was in his first trip to a foreign country since he took power in 2011.Xi held talks with Kim at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing and he and his wife Peng Liyuan hosted a banquet for Kim and his wife Ri Sol-ju, Xinhua said. They also watched an art performance together, the news agency said.Official reports from both countries depicted in effusive terms warm ties between the two leaders in what analysts said appeared to be an effort to downplay recent tensions in relations over Kim's development of nuclear weapons and long-range missiles.In these reports, ""Kim reaffirms the traditional friendship between the two countries as if nothing had ever happened, when the relationship had plummeted to unprecedented lows,"" said Bonnie Glaser, an Asia expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.Ties in recent months have frayed as China supported tougher UN sanctions on North Korea and suspended imports of coal, iron ore, seafood and textiles. Pyongyang last year seemingly sought to humiliate Beijing by timing some of its missile tests for major global summits in China, while its state media accused Chinese state-controlled media of ""going under the armpit of the U.S."" by criticizing the North.Xi hailed Kim's visit as embodying the importance with which the North Korean leader regarded ties with China.""We speak highly of this visit,"" Xi told Kim, according to Xinhua.For China, the visit also reminds other countries that Beijing remains one of North Korea's most important allies and is a player not to be sidelined in denuclearization talks. It also projects to the Chinese public that Xi is firmly in charge of steering Beijing's relations with North Korea in a way that favours China's interests.""Here is Xi Jinping saying, 'Don't worry, everything is going to be great',"" Glaser said.The NationalAnalysts say Kim would have felt a need to consult with his country's traditional ally ahead of his planned meetings with South Korean President Moon Jae-in and U.S. President Donald Trump in the coming weeks. China would also not want Kim's first foreign meeting to be with someone other than Xi.""China was clearly not comfortable with the idea of Kim meeting with Moon and Trump before having ever met with Xi,"" said Paul Haenle, director of the Carnegie-Tsinghua Center for Global Policy in Beijing.""Beijing has significant interests and huge stakes in any outcomes of upcoming summits and did not want to be on the sidelines as a spectator"" as important diplomatic events occurred, Haenle said.Kim was described by Xinhua as saying that his country wants to transform ties with South Korea into ""a relationship of reconciliation and co-operation."" The two Koreas are still technically at war because their 1950-53 war ended in an armistice, not a peace treaty.Kim also said that North Korea is willing to hold a summit with the United States, according to Xinhua.North Korea's official Korean Central News Agency published Kim's personal letter to Xi dated Wednesday, where he expressed gratitude to the Chinese leadership for showing what he described as ""heartwarming hospitality"" during his ""productive"" visit.Kim said the first meeting between the leaders will provide a ""groundbreaking milestone"" in developing mutual relations to ""meet the demands of the new era."" Kim also said that he's satisfied that the leaders confirmed their ""unified opinions"" on mutual issues.""For the North Koreans, it is in their best interests to enter any meetings with Moon or Trump having shored up and repaired to a certain extent their relations with Beijing,"" Haenle said.The North's diplomatic outreach this year follows a tenser 2017 when it conducted its most powerful nuclear test and tested three intercontinental ballistic missiles designed to target the U.S. mainland.The developments are being interpreted as the North being desperate to break out of isolation and improve its economy after being squeezed by heavy sanctions.China remains North Korea's only major ally and chief provider of energy, aid and trade that keep the country's broken economy afloat.In a speech at a banquet in China, Kim described the traditional allies as inseparable ""neighbouring brothers"" with a relationship molded by a ""scared mutual fight"" to achieve socialist ideals, according to KCNA.In addition to the trip being his first abroad as leader, his talk with Xi was his first meeting with a foreign head of state.Kim's father, late North Korean leader Kim Jong-il, visited China several times during his rule, lastly in May 2011. He died the following December.""It's most proper that my first overseas trip would be the capital of the People's Republic of China as it's also one of my noble duties to value the North Korea-China friendship as I do my own life and extend it [for another generation],"" said Kim, according to the agency.Past visits by Kim Jong-il to China were surrounded in secrecy, with Beijing only confirming his presence after he had crossed the border by train back into North Korea."
China confronts Japanese ships near disputed islands | CBC News,China says ships from its newly formed coast guard confronted Japanese patrol vessels in waters surrounding East China Sea islands claimed by both sides.,2013-07-26T07:52:55.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/china-confronts-japanese-ships-near-disputed-islands-1.1395430,"China says ships from its newly formed coast guard confronted Japanese patrol vessels Friday in waters surrounding East China Sea islands claimed by both sides.  The State Oceanic Administration that oversees the service says four of its ships ""sternly declared"" China's sovereignty over the islands called Senkaku by Japan and Diaoyu by China, and demanded they leave the area. The uninhabited archipelago is controlled by Tokyo but also claimed by Beijing.  It was not clear if any action resulted from the Chinese declaration. Such sovereignty declarations are usually made by hailing Japanese boats by radio and loudspeaker, as well as flashing shipboard signs.  Ships from Chinese civilian agencies have maintained a steady presence in the area since tensions spiked in September following Japan's purchase of some of the islands from their private owners.  Those vessels are being replaced by ships from the coast guard, which was formally inaugurated on Monday and merges the resources of four former agencies. China says the move was intended to boost its ability to enforce its maritime claims, upping the stakes in an increasingly tense competition for marine territory and resources in waters off its eastern and southeastern coasts.  Chinese coast guard ships have also been spotted this week at Mischief Reef off the western Philippine coast, according to a confidential Philippine government report obtained by The Associated Press. China occupied the vast reef in 1995, sparking protests from rival claimant Manila.  China says virtually the entire South China Sea and its islands belong to it, a claim based on alleged historical precedents that are strongly contested by the Philippines, Vietnam and others.  While Beijing has mainly used civilian agencies to patrol its claims, the new coast guard gives it greater latitude to do so by centralizing operations in a single body. The body is nominally under civilian control, but closely coordinates with the increasingly formidable Chinese navy that recently added an aircraft carrier to its fleet.  Coast guard ships are mainly repurposed naval or commercial vessels and are equipped with light armaments such as machine guns and deck cannons, unlike in the past when most of China's patrol craft had no weaponry.  Japan has already expressed renewed unease about China's military and maritime activity near the disputed islands, and on Friday released a defense paper calling for an increase in its surveillance capability, possibly including the use of drones capable of wide-range, high-altitude monitoring around the clock.  The paper also proposed creating a marine force to defend the disputed East China Sea islands."
'Wasted': What happens when China no longer wants our trash? | CBC Radio,Adam Minter says the world has a real problem now that China won't take much of the low-grade recycling waste we've been sending it for years.,2018-01-12T22:59:01.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/radio/day6/episode-372-china-s-waste-ban-syrian-cuisine-oprah2020-the-colour-of-2018-letterman-returns-and-more-1.4479480/wasted-what-happens-when-china-no-longer-wants-our-trash-1.4479601,"Welcome to the second instalment of 'Wasted', a Day 6 series about garbage and what we do with it. In this week's episode, we're talking about recycling.We all feel better about our trash when we know some of it's being recycled — but you might not realize where it goes once the recycling truck pulls away. Today, most Canadian households have access to recycling. Companies across the country pick up, sort and process the recyclable waste.But there are materials that can't be recycled here in Canada. In some municipalities, up to 80 per cent of the recyclables collected are sold and shipped to China.China is the world's biggest importer of recycled materials, unloading the burden from countries like Canada and the United States.In 2016, Chinese manufacturers imported over 163 million metric tonnes of waste materials from developed countries, including the U.S., U.K., and Japan, making for an industry worth nearly $90 billion US.But as of January 1, 2018, China will no longer import much of the plastic and paper we have been shipping there for decades.In July 2017, China announced big changes banning imports of 24 categories of recyclables and solid waste by 2018.                         China's campaign against yang laji, or ""foreign garbage,"" applies to plastics, textiles and mixed paper.But given that China has long been the dominant market for recycled plastic in particular, there is global concern that much of the waste the country currently imports will have nowhere else to go.""It all comes down to something we don't necessarily associate with the environment and recycling, and it's manufacturing,"" explains Adam Minter, the author of Junkyard Planet: Travels in the Billion-Dollar Trash Trade. A columnist for Bloomberg View, Minter has travelled China documenting its recycling efforts.""China is the world's manufacturing hub,"" Minter says. ""So as the world's biggest maker of things, China imports more raw materials of all kinds — oil to ore — and that includes recycling.""Now, China is increasingly replacing all that imported recycling with material collected from its own growing internal market.""China is very keen to boost its domestic recycling industry,"" Minter says.""China's getting rich, and as you get rich, you throw away more stuff. As you throw away more stuff, you generate more for your own recycling.""So there is a feeling that the Chinese recycling companies would like to stop competing against [other countries'] recyclables ... and have [that market] to themselves.""There's another reason China is looking to lower its intake of foreign trash, according to Minter.""This is an industry that has an image problem,"" he says. ""I think we're all familiar with the images we've seen of folks not only in China, but in developing countries, going through recycled materials from the developed world — places like Canada.""""Those are emotionally very provocative images. And they seem to have really set off some of the outrage, not only within the general public within China, but especially among China's top leadership.""        While the recycling industry in China is mainly privately held, the primary material industry — the firms that make use of the recycled plastics to manufacture new goods — is largely state-owned.As a result, some Chinese recyclers believe the ban is also an effort by the government to push out private players.In 2011, Minter interviewed a family business in China that makes a living by recycling Christmas lights sent to China from the West, turning the plastic into a range of products, including the soles of slippers.""They're representative of a larger group of private entrepreneurs who import things that are difficult to recycle in places like Canada,"" he says.""If they cannot get this material that they recycle — in this case, Christmas tree lights — into China, they're going to see their revenues go down, they're going to have to lay off employees, and ultimately they may have to shutter their business.""In general, you're going to see a lot of private players in China's recycling industry go under, simply because they're highly dependent on the import of scrap recyclables from the developed world — places like Canada.""Since China is reliant on using recycled materials in manufacturing to cut costs, the import ban could also have wider implications for the environment if Chinese companies can no longer access the same amount of recyclables.""China still needs raw materials ... and there is still some recycling that will be able to be imported, but it's not going to be sufficient to meet their needs,"" Minter says. ""So already we are seeing China turn to what are called 'virgin' materials.""Recently, Minter spent time with paper recyclers in the city of Chengdu who are considering importing virgin pulp — a product that Canada exports — because they could not access recycled paper.""Not only will this raise their costs, but it will also incur a greater cost on the environment,"" he says.""One thing I always tell folks is that recycling is not good for the environment — it's a less-worse thing to do for the environment. It uses energy, it uses raw materials; but even so, the worst recycling is still better for the environment than the best virgin-materials processing.""     In the wake of China's decision, plastic and paper have been piling up in developed countries as they scramble to figure out what to do with that waste they used to ship to China.""In the near- to mid-term, it doesn't present many good choices,"" Minter says. ""They can choose to landfill or incinerate — in a sense, that could be less expensive. [But] it's going to mean that you're going to see more virgin material used in the places that manufacture the things that we all buy in developed economies, and that's because China is going to need those raw materials.""China and some environmental groups suggest the transition could be good for the environment over the long term, but Minter says that's unlikely.""It's hard to make long-term projections, but in the short- to medium-term, this recycling ban — and again, not all recycling is banned from China imports at this point — but in general, it's going to be very bad for the environment.""If anything, the import ban may force developed countries to rethink how recycling fits into their wider waste-management plan.""I think it really is time for folks to ... get over this notion that by putting something in their bin, they've done something good,"" he says. ""If you want to do something good for the environment, the best thing you can do is consume less.""""At an individual level, if you are really concerned about what this ban is going to do, the best thing you can do is stop taking pride in how much stuff you put in your recycling bin. You should start taking pride in how little is in that bin and in your waste bin.""         To hear the full interview with writer Adam Minter, download our podcast or click the 'Listen' button at the top of this page.Click here for Part One of 'Wasted,' our series about trash — how we generate it, what happens to it, and how we can generally be better at dealing with garbage."

Space experts agree the Chinese can no longer be left out.""I think right now a lot of people see it as kind of crazy to co-operate with the Chinese, but I think it's the next logical step,"" Hadfield recently told The Canadian Press.China sent its first astronaut into space in 2003 and Hadfield noted the country's ambitious space program aims to eventually put an astronaut on the moon.On Dec. 15, a Chinese Chang'e 3 rocket landed a rover on the lunar surface, making China the third country to do so after the United States and the former Soviet Union.It was the world's first soft landing of a space probe on the moon in nearly four decades.He also pointed out that China launched an experimental space station in 2011. It will be replaced with a more permanent one which will be completed in 2020.A Chinese astronaut said in September his country is willing to open its space station to foreign astronauts and even train them for such missions.China was barred from participating in the current orbiting space station, largely because of U.S. objections over political differences.Hadfield added that after the Russians launched the Mir Space Station in February 1986, other nations dropped in for a visit during its 15 years in orbit.NASA says on its website that Mir hosted 125 cosmonauts and astronauts from 12 different nations before it was deorbited and sunk into the ocean in 2001.Hadfield, who became a Canadian astronaut in 1992, visited Mir in November 1995 on the U.S. Space Shuttle Atlantis. He was the only Canadian to ever board the Russian space station.""If you predicted in 1989 that I would fly on an American shuttle to go build a Russian spaceship, people would have said you were crazy,"" said Hadfield, who last March became the first Canadian to command the International Space Station.""So I think looking forward, there's a great opportunity to include the Chinese in the world space program — the international space program.""Hadfield said a logical progression would be to include as many countries as possible in an international mission beyond Earth — ""hopefully including China and India and the other countries that have launch capability and then progress to the next stepping stone, the next natural waypoint out to space, which is the moon.""Iain Christie, executive vice-president of the Aerospace Industries Association of Canada, says China's presence in space cannot be ignored. The association represents the interests of more than 700 aerospace companies across Canada.""I think China is back where we were in North America 50 years ago,"" he said in an interview from Ottawa. ""They're excited about space, they're not spending their time justifying why they're in space, they're spending their time justifying why they're not doing more.""I am hopeful that their enthusiasm for space becomes infectious to the rest of us.""Christie said decisions will have to be made in the coming years.""We're going to have to decide what to do about engaging with China in space — whether it's to be more collaborative or more competitive,"" he said. ""I don't know which one we'll choose.""Walt Natynczyk, the new president of the Canadian Space Agency, was in China in September to attend the annual International Astronautical Congress in Beijing. It was described as an opportunity to visit some major space actors in the country.Meantime, as Natynczyk continues work on a long-term space plan, Hadfield said Canada must look at where the world's space program is headed.""Canada needs to choose what makes sense to us,"" he said. ""There's so much technology that we need in power generation, in navigation, in communications, in environmental recycling — there's all sorts of technical issues that we need to solve that will also have use for us here back in Canada.""Hadfield attracted worldwide attention with his dramatic photos of the Earth, his tweets and his Space Oddity video during his space station visit which began when he blasted off in December 2012. He returned to Earth in mid-May 2013. The David Bowie cover has had close to 20 million views on YouTube."

""It will only lead to serious consequences and negative impact.""Han didn't mention Trump by name or refer directly to the dispute with Washington, but the country's newly appointed economy czar warned Saturday that Beijing will defend its interests. The government issued a $3 billion US list on Friday of U.S. goods including pork and stainless steel pipes it said might be hit by higher tariffs.The Commerce Ministry said those charges were linked to Trump's approval earlier of higher tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. But a bigger battle is brewing over Trump's approval Thursday of a possible tariff hike on $30 billion US of Chinese goods in response to what Washington says is Beijing's improper acquisition of foreign technology.Global financial markets have sunk on fears Chinese retaliation might prompt other governments to raise import barriers, depressing global trade.Han appealed to other governments to ""co-operate with each other like passengers in the same boat"" and ""make economic globalization more open, inclusive, balanced and beneficial for all.""However, he also emphasized that China's income per person still is low, suggesting Beijing is unlikely to offer significant concessions to Washington.Han repeated promises that planned Chinese market-opening would create new opportunities for foreign companies. Business groups have welcomed reform pledges but complain Beijing is moving too slowly, making it unclear whether additional promises will mollify Washington, the European Union and other trading partners.In a phone call Saturday with U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, Vice Premier Liu He said Beijing is ""ready and capable of defending its national interest and hopes both sides will remain rational,"" according to the official Xinhua News Agency.In a speech to the economic forum, Apple CEO Tim Cook acknowledged tensions in Western societies that fuel demands for import controls and said companies must take action to spread the benefits of globalization more widely.""Not everyone has benefited like all of us in this room have from technology and globalization, and we all must help to address this disparity,"" said Cook, a co-chairman of the event. ""Their cause must become our cause.""The annual forum, which brings together corporate leaders with Chinese economic officials, usually is used to showcase Beijing's plans. This year, those include ambitious promises to open financial markets and give entrepreneurs and foreign companies a bigger role in China's state-dominated economy."

Along came the Lifeline Express, a private Hong Kong-based foundation that deploys hospital trains around the country, on which medical professionals perform free cataract operations. With contributions from Zhao QianSee more photos on Instagram: @sasapetricic""The world is a blur, and I can't wait to see better.""For 76-year-old Tang Jin Mian, the trip from her village was far and the wait was long. But the promise of getting her sight back brought her here: a medical service that offers relief from cataracts to China's aging rural population.Each of four trains goes to a different part of the countryside for several weeks at a time and sees more than 2,000 patients a year. This train is parked on an unused railroad siding in southern China, near the city of Guilin.Aboard this train between 30 and 40 cataract operations are performed every day. China has the world's largest population of people with cataracts. Many of them are in remote areas, so exact figures are hard to come by, but estimates put the number well into the tens of millions of people.In one specially equipped train carriage, patients get tests done then get diagnosed by nurses and prepared for surgery in two operating theatres. Most are in their 60s and 70s.Even getting to the trains isn't always easy. Cai Jing Zhen has to carry his mother on his back because she can neither see nor walk properly. ""It's a big problem,"" he says. ""These are seniors who need doctors and clinics nearby, and there's a huge shortage in rural China.""Patients spend the night in train compartments, watched by nurses. The founder of Lifeline Express says the high number of cataract sufferers in China reflects decades of health care shortages and uneven distribution of resources today. ""China is actually very poor,"" says Nellie Fong. ""There is richness in a very small group of people living in major cities. The rest of the country is still very, very poor.""The trains provide specialized training for nurses and doctors, some of whom are then posted to new rural clinics. ""I really feel I'm making a difference for these patients,"" says nurse Wang Chang Qi. ""It's what I saw myself doing at school, where my role model was Florence Nightingale.""The operations themselves take just minutes. Doctors remove the cataract-clouded lens in the patient's eye and replace it with a clear synthetic lens. On this train, the doctors are all Chinese, but the program has hosted many foreign specialists — including Canadian doctors — who operate and teach.Once the operation is done, the dreaming begins. ""I want to be free to climb mountains and go hunting again,"" says Xu Fang Neng, pictured at left, closest to the window. ""I am a dancer,"" says Jiang Su Zhen, in the red coat. ""I hope to be dancing better and better now.""Patients are usually back home within a day or two. About half a million more Chinese get cataracts every year, and most can't afford the $1,000 or so it costs for the operation at a hospital — if there is even one nearby. Aboard the trains, the operation is free.For Xiong Zhi Lian, near-blindness meant years of poverty as the lenses in both eyes gradually clouded with cataracts and the jobs faded away. He's just returned home to his room in the isolated village of Bao Gu Tang. ""It's great to see things more clearly already,"" he says, adding he will start looking for work right away. ""And then, I will look for a wife."""
These Montreal students have 22 days to build an energy-efficient home in China | CBC News,"Team MTL faces 21 other university teams, in marathon competition to build the home of the future, at the Solar Decathlon in Dezhou, China.",2018-07-22T17:30:39.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/team-mtl-energy-efficient-home-china-1.4757015,"As the sun was rising on another long, gruelling, hot day in Dezhou, China, Ben Wareing tried to stay upbeat and focused on the task ahead: finishing building an entire house, from the ground up, with just 10 days left to go in the Solar Decathlon.And not just any house — a ""net zero energy"" home, designed to consume 80 per cent less energy than a traditional home and to produce enough energy through solar panels to power the home for a year.So, not a simple summer project.""It's extremely well-insulated. It's airtight. We have high-performance doors and windows,"" said Wareing, a McGill PhD student and the architecture lead of Team MTL, the only Canadian team in the competition.""We've been very careful with the design of the orientation of the home.""The team hopes their design, inspired by both Montreal row houses and traditional Chinese siheyuan courtyard architecture, will be enough to beat out 21 other teams, all made up of university students.The team designed and built in Montreal, before disassembling and shipping to China in pieces. They say their modular design makes Team MTL's home special among their competitors.Rémi Dumoulin, a masters student in engineering at Concordia and the engineering lead for the project believes its design also includes ""more innovative"" features to store energy produced by solar panels.""Say, that the electrical grid is already producing more power than it needs at a given time of the day. We can offset that moment … and sell back to the grid when it really needs the energy back,"" said Dumoulin.He believes homes like this could ""in the near future"" be commonplace on the streets of Montreal, as the technology becomes more affordable.The long, narrow house, has a courtyard dividing it into two units, designed to give the occupants some flexibility in how they want to use the space.""It could operate as a granny flat, or an Airbnb rental, or a live-work space,"" said Wareing. ""It was very important to us to ensure that the home remains relevant throughout its life and that it could adapt to the needs of its dwellers.""The team has had its share of setbacks, between the 40-degree heat, a torrential downpour that came at an inopportune moment, and a customs issue that left the team without tools for the first four days of the competition.""The shipment was held up. There were a few layers of bureaucracy to negotiate,"" Wareing said.""That was quite traumatizing,"" he added with a laugh.In the end, fellow teams came to their aid by lending them equipment until their shipment came in.""It's just such an adventure for us,"" said Dumoulin.""We're still going to need a big push to get there,"" said Wareing. ""But we're about on track."""

China hints at retaliation as U.S. says $50B in tariffs are back on | CBC News,China's government accused the Trump administration of hurting its credibility by acting erratically on trade and vowed Wednesday to fight back if Washington goes ahead with a threatened tariff hike.,2018-05-30T17:09:42.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/china-tariffs-trade-u-s-trump-1.4684091,"China's government accused the Trump administration of hurting its credibility by acting erratically on trade and vowed Wednesday to fight back if Washington goes ahead with a threatened tariff hike.A foreign ministry spokeswoman complained the U.S. decision to renew a threat to raise duties on a $50 billion list of Chinese goods conflicts with an agreement in mid-May aimed at settling that dispute. Treasury Steven Mnuchin said then that the conflict was ""on hold"" after Beijing promised to buy more U.S. goods to help narrow its multibillion-dollar trade surplus with the United States.The spokeswoman, Hua Chunying, declined to say whether Tuesday's announcement might disrupt plans for Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross to visit Beijing for talks starting Saturday. The Commerce Ministry didn't respond to questions about the status of the meeting, but the American Embassy said a delegation of trade, agriculture and treasury officials had arrived in the Chinese capital to make preparations.Hua gave no indication of whether Beijing planned to act on its own threat to retaliate by raising duties on a $50 billion list of American goods including beef and soybeans.""Every flip-flop and U-turn of a country will be simply depleting and squandering its own credibility,"" Hua said at a regular briefing.""We do not want a trade war, but we are not afraid of one. We will fight back,"" she said. ""We will definitely take forceful measures to defend our legitimate interests.""The White House announcement said it also would impose curbs on Chinese investment and purchases of high-tech exports.Asian financial markets tumbled on renewed worries about a U.S.-Chinese trade spat. China's main market index fell 2.5 per cent and Japan's benchmark lost 1.5 per cent.The White House's latest tariff action focuses on advanced technologies, including those such as robots and electric cars that China has said it wants to develop under its ""Made in China 2025"" program. The White House said a list of products would be announced June 15.Trump's surprise announcement reflects his frustration at criticism of his earlier deal with Beijing, Eurasia analysts said in a report. They said he appears less concerned that he needs Chinese support for his proposed meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.""Trump is going on offence, reverting to his earlier instincts on China and re-empowering the trade hawks in his Cabinet,"" Eurasia Group said. ""This dynamic makes it likely that both tariffs and investment restrictions will go into effect.""The American Chamber of Commerce in China said companies are uneasy about the threat of export and investment controls but see them as a possible way to make progress on longstanding complaints about market access and investment curbs.As a result of Trump's tariff threat, Washington is in very intense negotiations with Beijing ""in a way that we haven't been for so many years,"" said the chamber chairman, William Zarit. He said companies hope Beijing can be persuaded to ""level the playing field"" by easing curbs on foreign investment and business activity in its state-dominated economy.""I wouldn't say we are in favour of, specifically, export controls, investment restrictions,"" Zarit said at a news conference. But he said American companies want equal treatment, ""and this seems to be one of the ways to do that.""Also Wednesday, the Chinese Cabinet announced it planned to complete work by July 1 on another measure sought for years by its trading partners — a ""negative list"" that would make clear what is off-limits to foreign investment, leaving the rest of the economy open.Foreign companies are frustrated by a system that requires them to wait for Chinese regulators to declare individual lines of business open to them.Trump has focused on pressing Beijing to narrow its trade surplus with the United States, but Zarit said American companies see other issues as higher priorities.As Chinese companies expand abroad, the United States, Europe and other trading partners are pressing Beijing to ease controls that keep their companies out of industries including banking, insurance, telecoms and health care.""China's success means that it can no longer credibly defend protectionist policies on the grounds that it is still a 'developing country,""' the American chamber said in a report Wednesday.The tariff threat is a ""very powerful"" negotiating tactic, said Lester Ross, chairman of the American chamber's policy committee. However, he said tariffs are a tax on American consumers and a blunt tool to address ""very complex problems that hamper trade and investment relationships.""Analysts in the United States suggested the newly confrontational stance also might be aimed at appeasing congressional critics of a deal the Trump administration made Friday that allowed Chinese telecom giant ZTE Corp. to stay in business.ZTE agreed to remove its management team, hire American compliance officers and pay a fine. That would be on top of a $1 billion penalty ZTE paid for selling high-tech equipment to North Korea and Iran in violation of U.S. sanctions.In return, the Commerce Department lifted a seven-year ban on ZTE's purchase of U.S. components that it imposed earlier in May. Trump said last month the ban threatened too many Chinese jobs and he wanted to get the company back in business.Chinese leaders have promised piecemeal trade-related changes including allowing full foreign ownership in their auto industry by 2022.However, American companies have ""major concerns"" about unfair conditions, and the recent moves haven't done enough to alleviate those concerns, said the American chamber's Ross.European companies also complain they are blocked from acquiring most assets in China while Chinese companies are on a global buying spree."

During the second Opium War of 1860, British and French troops destroyed the imperial palace and pillaged its treasures, including the bronzes.The rabbit and rat sculptures turned up in 2009 as part of a vast Christie's art auction after the death of French fashion designer Yves Saint Laurent. China disputed the auction but when it failed to stop the proceedings, a Chinese collector successfully bid for the two pieces and then refused to pay, claiming his defiance as a ""patriotic act."" The heads reverted back to Saint Laurent's partner.The Pinault family says it bought the bronze heads from a private collector.The rabbit and rat sculptures will join five other zodiac heads returned to China previously and on display in museums: the ox, monkey, tiger, pig and horse. The whereabouts of the final five — the dog, snake, sheep, rooster and dragon — are currently unknown.The powerful Pinault family controls a massive portfolio of companies. Kering, which recently changed its name from PPR, owns luxury fashion brands such as Gucci, Stella McCartney and Yves Saint Laurent.Meanwhile, billionaire patriarch François Pinault owns international auction house Christie's, famed Bordeaux vineyard Château Latour as well as French and Swiss publications. The Pinault family, which first announced its donation of the two bronze zodiac heads in April, has recently ventured into the Chinese market."
Foreign worker debate highlights 'anti-China bias' | CBC News,"The use of temporary workers from China at a northern B.C. coal mine has sparked a court fight, duelling versions of events, a federal review and a great deal of discussion.",2012-11-25T18:45:34.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/foreign-worker-debate-highlights-anti-china-bias-1.1168032,"The use of temporary workers from China at a northern B.C. coal mine has sparked a court fight, duelling versions of events, a federal review and a great deal of discussion.And that's good, says Victor Wong of the Chinese-Canadian National Council.But the issue around HD Mining International Ltd.'s decision to bring in the foreign workers for its Murray River coal mine near Tumbler Ridge, B.C., also highlights an ""anti-China bias"" that threatens to descend into plain, old-fashioned racism, he said.""It has allowed some of the more racist views to come to the surface,"" Wong said as the controversy made headlines last week.""That's unfortunate because this is a serious issue to address. I shouldn't have to work out a response to racism as opposed to working out a response to whether the temporary foreign worker policy is an appropriate policy and whether it's being properly applied in this case.""HD Mining has been granted permits for 201 temporary foreign workers. Sixty miners are set to arrive in mid-December; 17 arrived earlier this month.The International Union of Operating Engineers Local 115 and the Construction and Specialized Workers Union Local 1611 have filed an application for a judicial review by the Federal Court, saying there are Canadian workers who can fill those jobs.On Saturday, the legal and political troubles swirling around the plan to bring in the workers prompted another company, Canadian Dehua International Mines Group, to wind down work at its Wapiti River coal project, near the Murray River mine.Canadian Dehua, which is also a minority shareholder in HD Mining, issued a statement saying the shut-down, effective Sunday at midnight, was ""forced"" on the company because of a ""deluge"" of concern from Dehua investors, a result of the temporary foreign worker controversy at HD.Energy and Mines Minister Rich Coleman is attempting to downplay the closure of the Wapiti River coal project, issuing a statement that claims the closure is temporary and noting many mines close for the winter.The unions say HD offered wages that were $10 to $17 an hour lower than the going rates and no benefits. They also claim the mine advertisements said workers had to speak Mandarin — claims the company denies.The company filed an appeal Friday of a court ruling that granted the unions the right to pursue that application, which would have forced the federal government to hand over internal labour market opinions that concluded there is a labour shortage, and therefore a need for the foreign workers.The United Steelworkers Union filed a separate complaint with the provincial mines ministry and the mine inspector alleging the temporary miners don't speak English well enough to understand their right or safety rules.Jody Shimkus of HD Mining didn't want to speculate on whether issues of race are involved.""I would certainly hope that that's not the case,"" she said.Brian Cochrane, business manager of the Operating Engineers, said it has no place in the discussion.""Countries that don't have great records with respect to mining practices and safety records, that gives us some concern,"" Cochrane said.""But primarily, we want to make sure our Canadian standards, safety standards that we fought for long periods of time are upheld and that we manage to grow and build the safety standards and the work opportunities for Canadians.""Wong said the perception of China certainly comes into play.""There's always some human rights thing that they do, and it's magnified when it's reported in the West,"" he said. ""We have our own problems here and we don't tend to talk about our own problems.""China's rising position of power in the world and its growing presence in Canada is perceived as a threat, he said.The real problem is the federal temporary foreign worker program, Wong said.""These types of policies, they tend to be exploitative. The worker is really at the mercy of the employer,"" he said.The government has created a system rife for fraud and exploitation, Wong said, and Jim Sinclair of the B.C. Federation of Labour agrees.""They have no rights,"" Sinclair said.He said temporary workers face the double jeopardy of losing their jobs and being sent home if they complain.""You get fired and you get sent home, so it's tough. The boss has way too much power in these circumstances,"" Sinclair said.Human Resources Minister Diane Finley has announced a review of the program in light of the controversy surrounding the Murray River mine."

Hong Kong fears pro-China brainwashing in education | CBC News,"The Hong Kong government calls it national education. But parents, teachers and pupils in the former British colony call it ""brainwashing"" and fear it's a ploy by Beijing authorities to indoctrinate the city's young into unquestioning support of China's Communist Party.",2012-09-07T15:46:21.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/hong-kong-fears-pro-china-brainwashing-in-education-1.1296013,"The Hong Kong government calls it national education. But parents, teachers and pupils in the former British colony call it ""brainwashing"" and fear it's a ploy by Beijing authorities to indoctrinate the city's young into unquestioning support of China's Communist Party.Plans by the government to introduce the classes have triggered mass protests and hunger strikes, the latest sign of the widening gulf between Beijing and the freewheeling semi-independent southern Chinese financial center, 15 years after Britain handed it back to China.The dispute deepened as classes started this week, with activists including a handful of hunger-strikers camping out in front of Hong Kong government headquarters in a bid to force officials to drop plans to introduce the subject in primary and secondary schools. They've been joined each evening by thousands of protesters wearing black.A local TV station fanned the flames when it called the activists a ""destructive faction"" controlled by London and Washington. The rising tensions forced the city's Beijing-backed leader, Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying, to call off his trip to a high-profile Asia-Pacific summit this weekend in Vladivostok, Russia.The growing opposition to the new curriculum threatens to undermine the chances of pro-Beijing candidates in elections Sunday for the city's legislature, when for the first time more than half the seats will be chosen by the public. Leung insisted the government had no intention of brainwashing, and reiterated Thursday that a group he set up to listen to public views would consider all options, including dropping the new curriculum entirely. But activists slammed the move as a hedging tactic ahead of the vote.The protesters are afraid of what they see as underhanded attempts to indoctrinate the city's next generation with Beijing-style nationalist education classes used in schools all over China to inculcate support for the Communist government. Many believe Leung, who became the city's leader in July after being picked by an elite, pro-Beijing committee, has close ties to the Chinese leadership.""Those who are opposed aren't against becoming more familiar with China, but they are against being made to mindlessly flatter China,"" said Ben Leung, an 18-year-old secondary school student who has joined the protests with a half-dozen friends for the past few evenings. ""We're afraid of this so that's why we need to take this step.""Many Hong Kongers are people who have either fled mainland China in past decades or have relatives who did. Surveys show a shrinking number identify themselves as Chinese citizens. They are increasingly uncomfortable with Beijing's growing influence on the city, its stunted democratic development and an influx of wealthy mainland Chinese that is driving up property prices.Residents take pride in the city's high degree of autonomy, separate legal system and civil liberties not seen in mainland China such as freedom of speech. Hong Kong was allowed to keep them when Britain handed the territory back to China in 1997 after more than a century of colonial rule.The new curriculum has been on the cards for years but fears rose earlier this year that it could be used for ""brainwashing"" after a pro-Beijing education group published a pamphlet that extolled the virtues of one-party rule. The government stressed that the booklet, called ""The China Model"", was not part of designated teaching material.Senior government officials have repeatedly denied claims that the classes aim to impose a certain mindset.""The government isn't brainwashing, it doesn't want to brainwash, and it will not brainwash, with this subject,"" Leung Chun-ying said Thursday.The government is encouraging schools to begin moral and national education classes this year but is not making it a required subject until 2015. According to curriculum guidelines, students will learn about China's political leaders, the efforts and contributions they have made and the difficulties and challenges they face. They'll also learn how to ""speak cautiously,"" practice self-discipline and get along well with others in a rational and respectful way.""What worries students, parents and the public at large is that a lot of the material that may be used as national education is seen as attempts to brainwash young minds in Hong Kong,"" said Willy Lam, a veteran China watcher and professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. It's seen as ""an attempt by Beijing to impose Chinese values of nationalism patriotism onto Hong Kong so that Hong Kong's high degree of autonomy might be impaired.""In mainland China, ""political education"" classes are required for students all the way up to university. ""A big chunk of it is indoctrination, with at least some kind of crude propaganda about the glory of the nation, the achievements of the Communist party,"" and reasons why people should follow the party's instructions, said Lam.The chairman of a pro-Beijing group inflamed the debate further when he suggested that opponents should indeed ""wash their brains.""""A brain needs washing if there is a problem, just as clothes need washing if they're dirty and a kidney needs washing if it's sick,"" said Jiang Yudui, chairman of the Beijing-friendly China Civic Education Promotion Association of Hong Kong, according to news reports. Jiang's comments in July came at the same time that tens of thousands, including many parents pushing their children in strollers, took to the streets to protest against the plan."

How is China choosing its new leaders? | CBC News,"Given China's powerful economy and increasing military clout, there is heightened international interest in the country's upcoming change in leadership. The handover of power, which begins at the meeting of the 18th National Party Congress in Beijing on Nov. 8, is both complicated and enigmatic.",2012-11-08T10:31:11.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/how-is-china-choosing-its-new-leaders-1.1230975,"Given China’s powerful economy and increasing military clout, there is heightened international interest in the country’s upcoming change in leadership.The handover of power in China, which begins at the meeting of the 18th National Party Congress in Beijing on Nov. 8, is both complicated and enigmatic.The Chinese government is a one-party system run by the Chinese Communist Party. Like Russia, China has both a president and a premier (also referred to as prime minister).The president, currently Hu Jintao, is the country’s head of state and ""paramount leader.""The premier, currently Wen Jiabao, is the chief administrator, overseeing the day-to-day operations of the nation.After the 41-year reign of Mao Zedong, which ended in 1976, the party leadership took steps to impose a term limit for the country’s highest office. It was during Deng Xiaoping’s tenure as paramount leader (1978-1992) that the presidency was capped at two five-year terms.Every five years, the party holds a congress that sets the policy agenda until the next congress. In addition to electing a new president and premier, the 18th congress will determine the make-up of the party’s central committee (currently 371 members), the Politburo (25 members) and the Politburo’s standing committee (nine members), which comprises the most powerful people in China.It is believed that once the 2012 congress adjourns — which could be more than a week from now — Xi Jinping will emerge as China’s new president and Li Keqiang its new premier. But because the party elite is deliberately unforthcoming and the congress itself is a secretive affair, nobody can say for sure.What we do know is that the rise to power involves a lengthy apprenticeship.Anyone who aspires to hold the highest office in China must first become a delegate at the party’s national congress.Most of the approximately 2,000 delegates are elected at the various rungs of government, from the township level up to county, city and prefecture. These elections take place in between party congresses, and are voted on by the approximately 70 million official members of the Chinese Communist Party.Leadership candidates are groomed for decades. In order to expand their knowledge and to give them a breadth of managerial experience, candidates are assigned to a variety of administrative positions and locales across this country of 1.3 billion people.Xi Jinping, who joined the Communist Party in 1974, has held a selection of posts, including deputy secretary of a CCP committee in Zhengding County in Hebei province, deputy governor of Fujian province and party chief in Shanghai.  But a candidate’s rise to power depends as much on making alliances within the party as building an impressive portfolio. During their apprenticeship, candidates develop not only their administrative skills but a base of support within the party that could help them achieve a future leadership role.The final step prior to making the highest office is serving on the Politburo Standing Committee (PSC), the most powerful group in the country.Hu Jintao brought Xi Jinping onto the PSC in 2007, a move that many observers saw as indicative of Xi’s presidential future.In lieu of democratic elections, leadership change in China involves an elaborate succession plan.Because it is an autocratic state that puts a great emphasis on honour, the country has had to contend with ""the successor’s dilemma,"" says Yongjing Zhang, a professor in the Graduate School of Public and International Affairs at the University of Ottawa.Zhang says that if the presumptive successor is seen as too aggressive or self-aggrandizing, he could ""threaten the ruling base of the current leader."" He points to Lin Biao, who died in a mysterious plane crash in 1971 after what appears to have been a thwarted attempt to topple Mao Zedong (through assassination).Inversely, ""If the successor is too weak when he assumes power, then he won’t be able to maintain his power stably,"" says Zhang, citing the case of Hua Guofeng, who was handpicked by Mao to succeed him in 1976, but was largely seen as ineffectual and was ousted in 1981.Since the 1980s, the party has made an effort to avoid volatile candidates by aiming for consensus when choosing the next leader.Integrity and outward appearances are important considerations in the nomination of a Chinese presidential candidate. In the run-up to the leadership vote, the nominal candidates are expected to avoid controversy of any kind, which is why the Bo Xilai affair has been so scandalous. A former party chief in Chongqing who was once tipped for the top job, Bo was disgraced this year after becoming implicated in the death of British businessman Neil Heywood (and a subsequent cover-up).Bo was expelled from the party in September after being accused of abuse of power and taking bribes. His wife received a suspended death sentence for the murder.Zhang says that honour and not giving offense to the older generation are important principles in Chinese culture, and the leadership process reflects that.""When [then-president] Jiang Zemin introduced [current president] Hu Jintao to the press in 1992, he said, ‘This is a young man,’ not ‘This is the young man,’ in the standing committee of the Politburo,"" Zhang points out.By hinting publicly at the identity of his successor, Jiang would have risked affronting other members of the party elite, says Zhang. By the same token, while media speculation has focused on Xi Jinping as the country’s next president, none of the current party leaders have publicly confirmed that.Given the party elite’s reluctance to announce the next leader prematurely, China watchers have come to read the signals.Juan Wang, a political science professor at the McGill University, says Xi’s growing visibility in high-profile domestic and international meetings is a hint that he is likely to be the next leader.She says there are even subtler signs.""When you see in the news the person who walks [into a room] first, that’s a sign of the ranking of the people. So you start to get a signal that he’s going to be the next leader,"" says Wang.Wang adds that there are different factions among the members of the party elite based on family ties, the offices they served or the region they’re from.But when it comes to announcing the new leader and the new political agenda, the party must present a united front.""Regardless of these factions, what happens in the end, there has to be a consensus, a publicized consensus,"" Wang says.""Nobody dares to have a different voice in public.""[IMAGEGALLERY galleryid=3356 size=large]"

China eyeing timberland on Vancouver Island | CBC News,The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday that China is preparing to invest about $100 million in timber assets mainly on Vancouver Island.,2012-11-06T16:35:32.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/china-eyeing-timberland-on-vancouver-island-1.1161006,"The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday that China is preparing to invest about $100 million in timber assets mainly on Vancouver Island.The Journal said China’s government wealth fund, the China Investment Corp., is negotiating with Toronto-based Brookfield Asset Management for a 12.5 per cent stake in Island Timberlands, which owns about 254,000 hectares of forest land.Without identifying its sources, it said a deal could be announced as early as this week.Island Timberlands is jointly owned by a subsidiary, Brookfield Infrastructure Partners, and other institutional investors.BIP shares were up two cents at $34.42 US on the New York Stock Exchange at mid-morning Tuesday.It holds a total of more than one million hectares of forest lands in North and South America.CIC manages China’s massive foreign exchange reserves and the Journal has previously reported that it has been in talks with Brookfield for assets that would hold on to their value in times of inflation.The central banks of the U.S., Europe, Canada and others have been embarking on various program aimed at stimulating their economies by keeping interest rates low, raising concerns of eventual inflation.The report comes as the Harper government considers whether to approve a proposal from the Chinese state-owned energy giant, CNOOC, for Calgary based-Nexen, which has assets in Canada’s oilsands and conventional oil and gas properties in Canada, the North Sea and the Gulf of Mexico.Yesterday, the government announced it was extending its deadline for its review of the net benefits to Canada of the $15.1-billion proposal to Dec. 10."
China fires senior government official in corruption probe | CBC News,The head of the commission that oversees China's major state-owned companies was fired Tuesday in a spreading corruption investigation that appears to be an effort by the country's new leaders to tighten control over government industries.,2013-09-03T00:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/china-fires-senior-government-official-in-corruption-probe-1.1354019,"The head of the commission that oversees China's major state-owned companies was fired Tuesday in a spreading corruption investigation that appears to be an effort by the country's new leaders to tighten control over government industries.The Communist Party dismissed Jiang Jiemin from his positions as director and deputy party chief of the cabinet's commission that runs state companies, the official Xinhua News Agency said Tuesday, two days after officials announced an investigation into Jiang.Jiang formerly was chairman of the state-run China National Petroleum Corp., which has been the target of a sweeping graft investigation that also has netted four top executives in recent days. They include three executives at CNPC's listed subsidiary PetroChina.As a full member of the party's Central Committee, which is made up of its top 200 members, Jiang is the most senior official to fall since new leader Xi Jinping took power in November. Xi has made fighting widespread graft a key campaign of his leadership so far, with promises to target both junior and high-level officials.The probe suggests that Xi and Premier Li Keqiang are making a stab at tackling the powerful state-owned industries and their allies who reformers say have hamstrung the government.""The state conglomerates, they are empires unto themselves. They have too much money and too much power,"" said Willy Lam, an expert on party politics at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.""This could be a signal that the Xi Jinping and Li Keqiang leadership is finally trying to discipline them and keep a tighter rein over the conglomerates.""A prominent Chinese newspaper, the 21st Century Business Herald, cited unidentified ""insiders"" Tuesday as saying Jiang had been close to now-disgraced politician Bo Xilai. Bo, whose downfall was triggered by a scandal involving his wife's murder of a British businessman, stood trial for corruption and abuse of power late last month.The newspaper said when Jiang was at CNPC, he built oil refineries in places where Bo held leadership positions, including Liaoning province and the megacity of Chongqing, to enhance Bo's ""political performance."" Calls to CNPC's spokesman's office rang unanswered.Also Tuesday, some state media outlets, including the People's Daily, reported that Zhang Shuguang, the former head of the transport bureau at what was then the Railways Ministry, has been charged with accepting more than 47 million yuan ($8.1 million) in bribes between 2000 and 2011.Unconfirmed news reports also earlier said China's leaders have taken the unusual step of endorsing a corruption investigation into Zhou Yongkang, a former security czar and CNPC general manager with a power base in the oil industry.The probe into China's oil giant also has extended to one of the energy industry's richest self-made entrepreneurs, Hua Bangsong, chairman of Shanghai-based Wison Engineering Services Co., which is a PetroChina supplier.Wison said that Hua was ""assisting the relevant authorities"" in their investigations.The company, which provides engineering and construction services to the oil industry, said its board of directors ""is convinced that factual circumstances will be clarified.""Wison tried to distance itself from PetroChina, a major customer, after recent news reports on their business relationship. It said PetroChina's first-half contract revenue was insignificant.Wison ""operates legally and completed the necessary compliance check"" required to list its shares on the Hong Kong stock exchange, the company said in a statement to the exchange posted late Monday.Hua, who founded Wison in 1997, is worth $1.2 billion US, according toForbes."
Tibet self-immolation protests against China on rise | CBC News,"People setting fire to themselves in Tibet has become an almost daily occurrence, a dire form of protest against what many in the autonomous territory call an oppressive Chinese influence.",2012-12-20T19:26:30.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/tibet-self-immolation-protests-against-china-on-rise-1.1240335,"People setting fire to themselves in Tibet has become an almost daily occurrence, a dire form of protest against what many in the autonomous territory call an oppressive Chinese influence.In this video report, CBC News Beijing correspondent Catherine Mercier travelled undercover into the picturesque Himalayan, and mainly Buddhist, area which borders with China to the north. The disputed traditional Tibetan homeland stretches 2.5 million square kilometres and has been claimed by the Chinese for centuries.According to advocacy groups, since 2009 almost a hundred people have set themselves on fire in protest of the Chinese administration in Tibet, and are reported to have government informants heavily monitoring monasteries.The rate of people choosing self-immolation was almost daily last month. The Chinese government blames the Dalai Lama, the spiritual leader of Tibet's government-in-exile in India.The Tibetan government has denied any claims of its involvement, saying the Chinese forced the confessions. In a monastery where self-immolation had occurred, Mercier spoke to several people who agreed only to speak off camera, saying they would continue to protest. Punishment for anyone caught denouncing the Chinese can be severe.Reports say that monks are being forced into re-education sessions where they must pledge loyalty to the Communist Party. Mandarin has also crept its way into the school system in place of the Tibetan language. But the people of Tibet are resistant to the changes, fighting to preserve their culture, and willing to sacrifice their lives to do it."
China replaces leading politician amid public scandal | CBC News,China's Communist Party replaced one of the country's most powerful politicians Thursday after weeks of speculation following a trusted aide fleeing to a U.S. consulate.,2012-03-15T05:29:52.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/china-replaces-leading-politician-amid-public-scandal-1.1148587,"China's Communist Party replaced one of the country's most powerful politicians Thursday after weeks of speculation following a trusted aide fleeing to a U.S. consulate, a move that set off a public scandal affecting the country's looming once-a-decade leadership transition.The move to replace Bo Xilai appears to effectively end the public career of one of China's most highly ambitious and unusually flamboyant leaders, whose professional tribulations had dominated political discussions in recent weeks.Once considered a candidate for a seat on the party's all-powerful Politburo Standing Committee when new members are selected during this fall's major leadership transition, Bo was replaced as Chongqing city Communist Party secretary by Vice Premier Zhang Dejiang, the official Xinhua News Agency said Thursday in a one-sentence report.Bo's removal will likely spur further competition for seats on the Politburo Standing Committee. But it should also put to rest lingering speculation over his fate that had prompted near-obsessive attention from China watchers and overshadowed the just-concluded annual session of the National People's Congress, China's legislature.Zhang, Bo's replacement in Chongqing, is an economics specialist who served for many years in the vibrant provinces of Zhejiang and Guangdong.It wasn't clear if Bo had resigned or been forced out and there was no immediate word on whether Bo remained on the party's 25-member Politburo.Bo's replacement was likely prompted by the scandal surrounding Wang Lijun, his hand-picked chief of police and the enforcer behind a controversial crackdown on Chongqing's gangs and the politicians and policemen who protected them.The campaign won Bo national attention and praise among his constituents, resulting in 2,000 arrests, 500 prosecutions and 13 executions, including that of the former director of the city's Judicial Bureau over bribery, rape, extortion and gang-related charges.But it also drew criticism for ignoring due process at a time when the government is at least paying lip service to calls for strengthened legal guarantees, albeit highly selectively. It also appeared to especially target private businesses, fueling a sense of insecurity among China's entrepreneurial class that is spurring large numbers of them to move abroad.Bo also gained notoriety for a citywide campaign to revive Mao-era communist songs and stories, dredging up memories of the chaotic Cultural Revolution, although Bo claimed he wasn't motivated by politics and only wanted to boost civic pride.Both campaigns fizzled after initial bursts of positive publicity — along with Bo's political prospects.Ties between Bo and Wang appeared to fray amid reports of an investigation into Wang's former subordinates at his former posting in the northeastern city of Tieling. Transferred to a minor city government post, Wang drove to the U.S. consulate in the nearby city of Chengdu on Feb. 6 in an apparent bid to gain political asylum, staying there overnight before leaving and being taken into custody by investigators from the State Security Ministry in Beijing.Wang's present location is unknown, although Xinhua said Thursday he has been removed from his remaining post as one of Chongqing's vice mayors.The announcement comes just after the close of the annual session of the legislature and underscores how party leaders dealt with Bo's troubles behind the scenes while trying to project an image of unity for the public. Bo sparked new rumours by missing a key meeting of the body last week, but sprung back last Friday with a public appearance at which he admitted to mistakes but defended his record in Chongqing.If Bo is stripped of his Politburo seat, it would be the first time a member of the collective leadership has been removed since 2006 when Shanghai's party secretary, Chen Liangyu, was purged and later sentenced for corruption. Chen's removal was seen as a well-orchestrated move by President Hu Jintao to consolidate his power and remove a rival midway through his 10-year term.Unusual for party infighting, Bo's undoing unfolded in public. Wang's trip to the U.S. Consulate was first rumoured on the Internet and, after the U.S. State Department confirmed the visit ,the government was forced to follow suit.Still amid the rumours of political intrigue, no public explanation has been offered of what led to the rupture between Bo and Wang, a trusted aide for much of the past decade, and what transgressions led to Bo's removal. Premier Wen Jiabao offered the bluntest criticism of Bo and the affair on Wednesday telling reporters that Chongqing leaders ""must seriously reflect on the Wang Lijun incident and learn lessons from this incident.""""The public is still in the dark as to what really happened and what has been found in the investigation,"" said Liu Shanying, expert on public administration from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. ""What should Mr. Bo reflect on? His hiring decision? If it was only a firing decision, the consequences wouldn't have been like this. But what else did Premier Wen imply? The public is still puzzled."""

How tankers are avoiding tariffs in the trade war and shipping U.S. ethanol to China | CBC News,The journey of a tanker full of U.S. ethanol to Asia illustrates a broader shift in global trade since U.S. President Donald Trump ignited a trade war with China last spring.,2019-02-07T17:41:56.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/reuters-shipping-ethanol-1.5009665,"In June, the High Seas tanker ship loaded up on ethanol in Texas and set off for Asia.Two months later — after a circuitous journey that included a ship-to-ship transfer and a stop in Malaysia — its cargo arrived in China, according to shipping data analyzed by Reuters and interviews with Malaysian and Chinese port officials.At the time, the roundabout route puzzled global ethanol traders and ship brokers, who called it a convoluted and costly way to get U.S. fuel to China.But the journey reflects a broader shift in global ethanol flows since U.S. President Donald Trump ignited a trade war with China last spring.Although China slapped retaliatory tariffs up to 70 per cent on U.S. ethanol shipments, the fuel can still legally enter China tariff-free if it arrives blended with at least 40 per cent Asian-produced fuel, according to trade rules established between China and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), the regional economic and political body.In a striking example of how global commodity markets respond to government policies blocking free trade, some 88,000 tonnes of U.S. ethanol landed on Malaysian shores through November of last year — all since June, shortly after China hiked its tax on U.S. shipments. The surge follows years of negligible imports of U.S. ethanol to Malaysia.In turn, Malaysia has exported 69,000 tonnes of ethanol to China, the first time the nation has been an exporter of the fuel in at least three years, according to Chinese import data.Blending U.S. and Asian ethanol for the Chinese market undermines the intent of Beijing's tariffs and helps struggling American ethanol producers by keeping a path open to a major export market that would otherwise be closed.""Global commodity markets are incredibly creative in finding ways to ensure willing sellers are able to meet the demands of willing buyers,"" Geoff Cooper, head of the Renewable Fuels Association, said in a statement to Reuters. The group represents U.S. ethanol producers.In at least two cases examined by Reuters, including that of the High Seas, blending of U.S. ethanol cargoes with other products appeared to have occurred in Malaysia before the cargoes were shipped on to China, according to a Reuters analysis of shipping records and interviews with port officials.Chinese merchants, including the state-backed oil company Unipec, notified Chinese authorities about the unusual activity last summer — which represented competition they had not anticipated under the tariff scheme, according to two industry sources.Unipec's parent company, Sinopec, did not respond to requests for comment. A spokesman for China's General Administration of Customs declined to comment.Norazman Ayob, deputy secretary general of the Malaysian trade ministry, confirmed that Malaysia exported ethanol to China this year. The ministry was unable to confirm whether it had been mixed with U.S. fuel, he said, but noted such blending would be legal under the ASEAN-China pact.Malaysia has no track record of significant domestic ethanol production, so it is unclear where the ethanol blended with the U.S. product originates.Additional U.S. ethanol has flowed in unusual volumes to other destinations since Trump's trade war began, including other ASEAN member nations the Philippines and Indonesia, according to shipping and trade data, though Reuters could not confirm its final destination.The High Seas cargo ship was among the first to engage in the rising U.S.-to-Malaysia ethanol trade, according to shipping data from financial information provider Refinitiv and bills of lading from the ports.It loaded 25,000 tonnes of ethanol in Texas City on June 23 and then another 10,000 tonnes in Beaumont on June 27.Some of the ethanol was produced by Green Plains Inc., one of America's top ethanol producers. Green Plains spokesman Jim Stark confirmed the loading of the company's product in Beaumont but said it could not confirm the cargo's ultimate destination.At the time it left Texas, the shipment was owned by units of SOCAR Trading SA, the marketing arm of the State Oil Company of Azerbaijan Republic, according to the bills of lading.The shipment was initially destined for the Philippines.But after it crossed through the Panama Canal and reached the waters near Singapore in mid-August, the High Seas transferred its cargo to the QUDS, another tanker, according to the Refinitiv data.Vincent Mohy, general counsel for SOCAR, said that the firm sold all of the U.S. ethanol at the time of the transfer to the QUDS and that it made clear to the buyer the fuel originated in the United States. Mohy declined to name the buyer.The QUDS landed in the Malaysian port of Kuantan days later and took on another 12,074 tonnes of ethanol before heading to the Chinese port of Zhoushan and emptying its hold by the end of the month, according to the shipping data, a Chinese port official and two Malaysian port officials.According to one of the Kuantan port officials and a source in the Malaysian government, the cargo on the QUDS was sold by Malaysia's Rich Greenergy Sdn Bhd to China's Zhanjiang Industry Petrochemical Company Limited."

Surveys suggested that the 40,769 eligible voters were most interested in improving poor infrastructure and boosting an economy that depends on fishing and annual grants from Denmark.The social-democratic Siumut party won 27 per cent of votes, down from 34 per cent four years ago. That sets the stage for coalition talks with either the left-wing Inuit Ataqatigiit (IA) party or Demokraterne, which emerged as the third biggest party with 20 per cent, taking votes from both Siumut and IA.Greenland, a part of the Kingdom of Denmark but with self-rule since 2009, relies on fishing and annual grants from Denmark.Investors from China to Canada were said to be watching Greenland's election for signs of the political will to get a flagging mining programme on the island back on track.Greenland is hoping rising commodity prices can help attract foreign investment and get its fragile economy up to speed to realize the goal of independence.Hype about a possible mining boom in Greenland after it achieved self-rule from Denmark in 2009 faded in a morass of red tape and a commodity price slump around five years ago. It left the economy reliant on fishing and grants from Denmark.But with the country's sole producing mine starting up last year — a ruby pink sapphire mine operated by Norway's LNS Group — and Canada's Hudson Resource's anorthosite project due to begin operations this year, locals are again hoping more investments will follow.Improved access to and from the Arctic island as the ice melts, and a more favourable investment climate, would go some way to alleviate the barriers to business of perpetual winter darkness and temperatures reaching as low as minus 50 Celsius.Chinese interest in Greenland comes after Beijing laid out its ambitions to form a ""Polar Silk Road"" by developing shipping lanes opened up by global warming and encouraging enterprises to build infrastructure in the Arctic. ""A new government led by Kielsen and Siumut but without IA will create more openness towards attracting investments, including from China,"" said Rasmus Leander Nielsen, assistant professor at the University of Greenland in Nuuk.""IA is more skeptical. They want mining activity, but have more emphasis on the environment,"" Nielsen said. "

However, we have the confidence to conquer all forms of invasion,"" Xi told government leaders and current and retired PLA members gathered at the hulking Great Hall of the People, the seat of the legislature that sits beside Tiananmen Square.""We absolutely will not permit any person, any organization, any political party — at any time, in any form — to separate any piece of Chinese territory from China,"" Xi said to applause.""No one should expect us to swallow the bitter fruit of damage to our sovereignty, security and development interests.""Xi made no reference to any specific conflicts or disputes during his address, which focused largely on the PLA's growth from a scrappy guerrilla force fighting Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalists and Japanese invaders into one of the world's most powerful, if largely untested, militaries.However, China is currently engaged in a weeks-long border standoff with Indian forces near the countries' disputed border high in the Himalayas, with Chinese spokesmen demanding that Indian troops withdraw to avoid a clash potentially worse than the brief but bloody war the two fought in the region in 1962.China has also long been embroiled in a contest with Japan over East China Sea islands, as well as with five other governments over competing claims to territory in the strategically vital South China Sea. Beijing also threatens to use force to conquer Taiwan if peaceful enticements prove insufficient. China considers the self-governing democratic island Chinese territory.In his speech, Xi also emphasized that the military's highest loyalty is to the ruling Communist Party, underscoring the PLA's key role as regime preserver through crises such as the bloody suppression of 1989 pro-democracy protests at Tiananmen Square. Top Chinese leaders have consistently rejected calls to make the PLA loyal to the government and people instead.""The people's army will resolutely safeguard the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and our country's socialist system, resolutely safeguard national sovereignty, security and development interests, and resolutely safeguard regional and world peace,"" Xi said.The speech followed a parade Sunday at a training ground on the edge of the Gobi Desert during which Xi donned fatigues and declared that the military has the ""confidence and capability"" to ensure China's sovereignty, security and national interests.Xi, who commands the PLA as chairman of the central military commission, has frequently spoken of his ""China Dream"" to restore China to a leadership position in international affairs with a modern, far-reaching military force to match.The parade at the Zhurihe base in Inner Mongolia featured troops and advanced weaponry, and was another forceful indication of Xi's iron grip over the PLA and every other political power base within the party ahead of a pivotal congress this autumn that will award him a second five-year term as leader.That followed similarly high-profile military reviews in Beijing in 2015 and Hong Kong in June. Last week, Xi bestowed newly created ""Aug. 1"" honours on servicemen in a further elevation of the armed forces' stature.Xi and his predecessors engineered a radical upgrading of the PLA's capabilities through years of double-digit percentage increases in the defense budget, making China the world's second-largest military spender after the United States, although growth has slowed alongside a cooling of the overall economy.That has also spurred a global role for the PLA, which was formerly overwhelmingly preoccupied with securing China's territorial integrity.Alongside its blue-water navy, China is building its first overseas military base in the Horn of Africa nation of Djibouti, and Chinese ships held drills last month with Russia's navy in the Baltic Sea, more than 10,000 km from their home ports."
Can China help de-escalate tensions between the U.S. and North Korea? | CBC Radio,"As the U.S. faces a potential nuclear standoff with North Korea, president Donald Trump's latest tweets show his patience is wearing thin with China and has issued an ultimatum - fix it, or the U.S. will.",2017-04-12T14:55:36.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/radio/thecurrent/the-current-for-april-12-2017-1.4066128/can-china-help-de-escalate-tensions-between-the-u-s-and-north-korea-1.4066295,"Read story transcriptAmerican warships are heading for waters outside North Korea, but what the plan is for those ships is unclear.But what is not ambiguous is North Korea's intentions. The state media warned of nuclear attacks on American targets at any sign of aggression from the U.S.Some analysts believe the linchpin in defusing this escalating standoff is China.U.S. President Donald Trump has put pressure on the Chinese government to help discourage North Korea's nuclear program.North Korea is looking for trouble. If China decides to help, that would be great. If not, we will solve the problem without them! U.S.A.This latest aggressive tweet by Trump asserting his threats is alarming to University of Alberta professor Wenran Jiang.""This is very serious because just after these tweets the Chinese president Xi Jinping barely finished the summit with Trump last week … and basically tells him that the Chinese will not pursue anything other than a peaceful solution and is willing to work with the United States,"" Jiang tells The Current's guest host Piya Chattopadhyay.""And so this is not something China takes lightly. Therefore we need to monitor the situation in a very, very high alert situation here."" ""China does not have total control of North Korean regime. Yes, China is providing lifelines to North Korea for its survival, for his economic you know activities but that does not translate to the whole control of the behavior, of the regime, or Kim Jong-un,"" he says.""China has a troubled relationship with North Korea. China doesn't like nuclearization of North Korea at all but it has limited options.""Jiang explains China does not think the North Korean nuclear crisis is a threat: it's primarily an issue between North Korea and the U.S.""So China does not want to take the blame.""Jiang says at the same time, China does not want to be perceived as the puppet by Washington to force regime change.Anthony Ruggiero, a senior fellow at the Washington think tank, Foundation for Defense of Democracies, adds that while it's clear China does not to control North Korea's behaviour, they do hold a lot of leverage.""I think about 90 per cent of [North Korea's] trade is from China that suggests that it's a large amount of leverage. I would just dispute that the trade will equal lifelines.""He tells Chattopadhyay that more robust sanctions could be the solution since it's clear China is allowing North Korea to evade sanctions.""We had a case in September of Chinese banks doing millions of dollars of transactions through the United States for six years and that's not the only examples,"" he says.""Things like that would be easy for the United States to close those loopholes if the Chinese are not willing to do that.""But Jiang disagrees tougher sanctions will be the way out of this, saying China doesn't want to deal with what could lead to a regime collapse.""That will not be in the interest of anybody other than the United States and Western preference.""Listen to the full segment at the top of this post — including tracking the human rights abuses in North Korea.This segment was produced by The Current's Lara O'Brien and Sam Colbert."
China busts massive child trafficking networks | CBC News,"Chinese police arrested 608 suspects and rescued 178 children in busts of two separate child trafficking networks, authorities say.",2011-12-07T00:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/china-busts-massive-child-trafficking-networks-1.1013610,"Chinese police arrested 608 suspects and rescued 178 children in busts of two separate child trafficking networks, authorities said Wednesday.   The Ministry of Public Security said prosecutors were preparing cases against the suspects, suggesting that charges have yet to be filed.Its statement posted online said 5,000 police across 10 provinces co-operated for six months on the investigation and moved in to arrest the suspects last week.   Child trafficking is big problem in China, where traditional preference for male heirs and a restrictive one-child policy has driven a thriving market in baby boys, who fetch a considerably higher price than girls. Girls and women also are abducted and used as labourers or as brides for unwed sons.   Tens of thousands of children go missing every year, though the exact numbers of victims are difficult to obtain.   The rescued children will be put into orphanages while authorities try to reunite them with their families, the ministry said. It didn't give the age range of the abducted children or other specifics.   An investigation into a traffic accident in south China's Sichuan province in May led police to the first ring, which was allegedly selling children abducted or bought in Sichuan to buyers in central China's Hebei province and elsewhere. The ring had links to at least 26 gangs nationwide, it said.   The second ring was uncovered in August and was based in southeast China's Fujian province and led by a female suspect identified as Chen Xiumei.   The statement said police have cracked more than 7,000 gangs or rings that sold women or children since a special campaign against human trafficking started in April 2009. It said 18,518 children and 34,813 women have been rescued."
China's pollution temporarily slowed climate change | CBC News,"Scientists have come up with a possible explanation for why the rise in Earth's temperature paused for a bit during the 2000s, one of the hottest decades on record.",2011-07-05T13:50:43.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/china-s-pollution-temporarily-slowed-climate-change-1.1010478,"Scientists have come up with a possible explanation for why the rise in Earth's temperature paused for a bit during the 2000s, one of the hottest decades on record.The answer seems counterintuitive. It's all that sulphur pollution in the air from China's massive coal-burning, according to a new study.Sulphur particles in the air deflect the sun's rays and can temporarily cool things down a bit. That can happen even as coal-burning produces the carbon dioxide that contributes to global warming.""People normally just focus on the warming effect of CO2 (carbon dioxide), but during the Chinese economic expansion there was a huge increase in sulphur emissions,"" which have a cooling effect, explained Robert K. Kaufmann of Boston University. He's the lead author of the study published Monday in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.But sulphur's cooling effect is only temporary, while the carbon dioxide from coal burning stays in Earth's atmosphere a long time.Chinese coal consumption doubled between 2003 and 2007, and that caused a 26 per cent increase in global coal consumption, Kaufmann said.Now, Chinese leaders have recognized the effects of that pollution on their environment and their citizens' health and are installing equipment to scrub out the sulphur particles, Kaufmann said.Sulphur quickly drops out of the air if it is not replenished, while carbon dioxide remains for a long time, so its warming effects are beginning to be visible again, he noted. The plateau in temperature growth disappeared in 2009 and 2010, when temperatures lurched upward.Indeed, NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, have listed 2010 as tied for the warmest year on record, while the Hadley Center of the British Meteorological Office lists it as second warmest, after 1998.Sulphur's ability to cool things down has led some to suggest using it in a geoengineering feat to cool the planet. The idea is that injecting sulphur compounds very high into the atmosphere might help ease global warming by increasing clouds and haze that would reflect sunlight. Some research has concluded that's a bad idea.Using enough sulphur to reduce warming would wipe out the protective Arctic ozone layer and delay recovery of the Antarctic ozone hole by as much as 70 years, according to an analysis by Simone Tilmes of the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado. This is the ozone layer that is high above Earth and protects against harmful UV rays, not the ground level ozone that is a harmful pollutant.""While climate change is a major threat, more research is required before society attempts global geoengineering solutions,"" said Tilmes.Overall, global temperatures have been increasing for more than a century since the industrial revolution began adding gases like carbon dioxide to the air. But there have been similar plateaus, such as during the post-World War II era when industrial production boosted sulphur emissions in several parts of the world, Kaufmann explained.Atmospheric scientists and environmentalists are concerned that continued rising temperatures could have serious impacts worldwide, ranging from drought in some areas, changes in storm patterns, spread of tropical diseases and rising sea levels."

"140,000 live Canadian lobster sold to China in 24 hours | CBC News","Chinese buyers snapped up more than 140,000 live Canadian lobsters within 24 hours last week through a Beijing-based online retailer, and the demand can only grow, says a New Brunswick supplier.",2017-07-20T20:04:42.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/canada-lobster-sales-bay-shore-jd-1.4212600,"Chinese buyers snapped up more than 140,000 live Canadian lobsters within 24 hours last week through a Beijing-based online retailer, and the demand can only grow, says a New Brunswick supplier.The live lobsters came from a variety of sources for the sale July 14 on jd.com, one of the largest e-commerce websites in the world.According to a news release from the company, the surge in lobster purchases was part of a sale promoting fresh food from Canada, which also included cherries and blueberries among the offerings.""They want 10,000 pounds a day,"" said Nathan Song, director of the New Brunswick-based Bay Shore Lobster Ltd., one of the suppliers for the website. ""The first stage of the promotion is five days a week, so that's around 50,000 pounds from just us.""Song, who was born in China, said the country has recently emerged as a lucrative market for lobster. Restaurant owners and home chefs alike hold Canadian lobster in high regard, so much so, they are willing to pay a heavy premium on shipping, he said.""The people in China like the live ones,"" Song said. ""They believe if they are alive and are of good quality, they are from Canada. So people will pay more money than for other countries' [lobsters].""Normally, Bay Shore catches enough lobster to have a year-round supply, but with the Chinese demand, the company in Back Bay could sell out by October, Song said.Premier Brian Gallant paid a visit to executives of the website, which is host to 236 million active users, in Beijing last October to promote New Brunswick-based food products.The Canadian promotion coincides with an event at JD headquarters, where a ""Canadian fresh food pavilion"" is serving samples of lobster, blueberries and cherries. At the end of July, JD will be holding seminars in Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver for businesses interested in selling products through jd.com.Song said it is no secret China is a powerful buyer, but the opportunity for wider distribution there is often forgotten about.""We have 1.4 billion people, and the live lobster market is only open to about five per cent of the main country now,"" he said. ""There is lots of opportunity to open an even wider market.""China is the second biggest importer of Canadian lobster next to America. Demand for the crustacean in China has more than quadrupled since 2011, going from buying about $27.5 million worth of lobster that year to about $162.8 million in 2016.Geoff Irvine, executive director of the Lobster Council of Canada, said exports of lobster to China have rapidly increased ""in the last six or eight years,"" although there are some catches to the success.""There's a debate in the Canadian industry about the profitability of the e-commerce channel,"" Irvine said. ""The demand is good, but they don't return the best prices. It's a volume market, not a value market.""However, Irvine said, if a facility is able to produce high volumes of lobster, China's burgeoning middle class can provides the demand for a huge supply of Atlantic Lobster."
China's disappeared: Some of the people who vanished at the hands of the Chinese state in 2018 | CBC News,"It's not uncommon for individuals who speak out against the government to disappear in China, but the scope of the ""disappeared"" has expanded since President Xi Jinping came to power in 2013.",2018-12-31T01:14:21.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/china-disappeared-2018-1.4962007,"It's not uncommon for individuals who speak out against the government to disappear in China, but the scope of the ""disappeared"" has expanded since President Xi Jinping came to power in 2013.Not only dissidents and activists, but also high-level officials, Marxists, foreigners and even a movie star — people who never publicly opposed the ruling Communist Party — have been whisked away by police to unknown destinations.The widening dragnet throws into stark relief the lengths to which Xi's administration is willing to go to maintain its control and authority.Here's a look at some of the people who went missing in 2018 at the hands of the Chinese state:China threatened ""grave consequences"" if Canada did not release high-tech executive Meng Wanzhou, shortly after the Huawei chief financial officer was detained in Vancouver earlier this month for possible extradition to the U.S.The apparent consequences materialized within days, when two Canadian men went missing in China. Both turned up in the hands of state security on suspicion of endangering national security, a nebulous category of crimes that has been levied against foreigners in recent years.Former Canadian diplomat Michael Kovrig was taken by authorities from a Beijing street late in the evening, a person familiar with his case said. He is allowed one consular visit a month and has not been granted access to a lawyer, as is standard for state security cases.Also detained is Michael Spavor, who organizes tours to North Korea from the border city of Dandong. China has not said whether their detentions are related to Meng's, but a similar scenario unfolded in the past.A Canadian couple was detained in 2014 on national security grounds shortly after Canada arrested Su Bin, a Chinese man wanted for industrial espionage in the U.S.Like Spavor, Kevin and Julia Garratt lived in Dandong, where they ran a popular coffee shop for nearly a decade. They also worked with a Christian charity that provided food to North Korean refugees.While Julia Garratt was released on bail, her husband was held for more than two years before he was deported in September 2016 — about two months after Su pleaded guilty in the U.S.Fan Bingbing was living the dream. Since a breakthrough role at the age of 17, Fan has headlined dozens of movies and TV series, and parlayed her success into modelling, fashion design and other ventures that have made her one of the highest-paid celebrities in the world.All this made her a potent icon of China's economic success, until authorities reminded Fan — and her legion of admirers — that even she was not untouchable.For about four months, Fan vanished from public view. Her Weibo social media account, which has more than 63 million followers, fell silent. Her management office in Beijing was vacated. Her birthday on Sept. 16 came and went with only a handful of greetings from entertainment notables.When she finally resurfaced, it was to apologize.""I sincerely apologize to society, to the friends who love and care for me, to the people, and to the country's tax bureau,"" Fan said in a letter posted on Weibo on Oct. 3.Fan later admitted to tax evasion. State news agency Xinhua reported that she and the companies she represents had been ordered to pay taxes and penalties totaling 900 million yuan ($130 million US).""Without the party and the country's great policies, without the people's loving care, there would be no Fan Bingbing,"" she wrote, a cautionary tale for other Chinese celebrities.Xinhua concurred in a commentary on her case: ""Everyone is equal before the law, there are no `superstars' or `big shots.' No one can despise the law and hope to be lucky.""Unlike most swallowed up by China's opaque security apparatus, Meng Hongwei knew exactly what to expect.Meng — no relation to the Huawei executive — is a vice minister of public security who was also head of Interpol, the France-based organization that facilitates police cooperation across borders.When he was appointed to the top post, human rights groups expressed concern that China would use Interpol as a tool to rein in political enemies around the world.Instead, he was captured by the same security forces he represented.In September, Meng became the latest high-ranking official caught in Xi's banner anti-corruption campaign. The initiative is a major reason for the Chinese leader's broad popularity, but he has been accused of using it to eliminate political rivals.Xi pledged to confront both high-level ""tigers"" and low-level ""flies"" in his crackdown on graft — a promise he has fulfilled by ensnaring prominent officials.Meng was missing for weeks before Chinese authorities said he was being investigated for taking bribes and other crimes. A Chinese delegation later delivered a resignation letter from Meng to Interpol headquarters.His wife Grace Meng told the AP that she does not believe the charges against her husband. The last message he sent her was an emoji of a knife.Lu Guang made his mark photographing the everyday lives of HIV patients in central China. They were poor villagers who had contracted the virus after selling their own blood to eke out a living — at a going rate of $7 a pint, they told Lu.A former factory worker, Lu traversed China's vast reaches to capture reality at its margins. He explored environmental degradation, industrial pollution and other gritty topics generally avoided by Chinese journalists, who risk punishment if they pursue stories considered to be sensitive or overly critical.His work won him major accolades such as the World Press Photo prize, but his prominence likely also put him on the government's radar.This November, Lu was travelling through Xinjiang, the far west region that has deployed a vast security network in the name of fighting terrorism. He was participating in an exchange with other photographers, after which he was to meet a friend in nearby Sichuan province. He never showed up.More than a month after he disappeared, his family was notified that he had been arrested in Xinjiang, according to his wife Xu Xiaoli. She declined to elaborate on the nature of the charges.In the past, the political activists jailed in China were primarily those who fought for democracy and an end to one-party rule. They posed a direct ideological threat to the Communist Party.This year, the party locked in on a surprising new target: young Marxists.About 50 students and recent graduates of the country's most prestigious universities convened in August in Shenzhen, an electronics manufacturing hub, to rally for factory workers attempting to form a union.Among them was Yue Xin, a 20-something fresh out of Peking University. Earlier this year, she made headlines by calling for the elite school to release the results of its investigation into a decades-old rape case.This time, she was one of the most vocal leaders of the labour rights group, appearing in photographs with her fist up in a Marxist salute and wearing a T-shirt that said ""Unity is strength"" — the name of a patriotic Chinese communist song.Yue, a passionate student of Marx and Mao Zedong, espoused the same values as the party. She wrote an open letter to Xi and the party's central leadership saying all the students wanted was justice for Jasic Technology labourers.Her letter quoted Xi's own remarks: ""We must adhere to the guiding position of Marxism."" Yue called Marx ""our mentor"" and likened the ideas of him and Mao to spiritual sustenance.Nonetheless, she ended up among those rounded up in a raid on the apartment the activists were staying at in Shenzhen. While most have been released, Yue remains unaccounted for.She has been missing for four months."
Winnipeg's recycling firm needs $1.5M more to meet China's new recycling rules: report | CBC News,The firm responsible for processing all of Winnipeg’s recycling is asking for the city to up its contract by $1.5 million over two years so it can keep sending materials to China for recycling.,2018-01-26T23:15:10.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/winnipeg-recycling-spending-emterra-1.4506356,"The firm responsible for processing all of Winnipeg's recycling needs the city to up its contract by nearly $1.5 million over two years so it can keep sending materials to be recycled in China, according to a city report.If the city doesn't foot the bill, it will have nowhere to export nearly 60 per cent of recyclable paper products — about seven per cent of all recycling and worth about $3.8 million in revenue — says the report, slated to be submitted to the policy committee responsible for the file on Feb. 1.""It's frustrating in a way, because it's not a cost we planned for,"" said Coun. Brian Mayes (St. Vital), the chair of the city's standing policy committee on water and waste, riverbank management and the environment.""On the other hand … if we did nothing then we're just going to come out behind. To me, yeah, it is pretty straightforward that this [additional funding] is the best option.""According to the report, Emterra, the company that handles the processing of Winnipeg's recycling, would use the roughly eight per cent funding boost to bring on additional staff to sort and monitor materials and tackle enhanced equipment maintenance.Without those changes, it won't be able to process recycling to level of new standards set by China that took effect on Dec. 31, 2017.Cities across North America have been struggling to meet the new, more stringent standards, which crack down on recycling shipments contaminated with unusable garbage.China had previously been refusing shipments for months, causing a backlog of materials to build up in some cities that rely on exporting recyclable material there.By this month, Calgary had already stockpiled five million kilograms of recycled waste since October. The City of Halifax wound up burning 300,000 kilograms of film plastics after seeking approval to divert the material to the landfill.Winnipeg generates roughly 30,000 tonnes of old newspapers and mixed-paper materials per year, according to Mark Kinsley, supervisor of waste diversion for the City of Winnipeg.Switching to another export market isn't an option, the report notes, because domestic and other foreign mills are either unwilling or unable to take on new suppliers and have tightened their own quality requirements.""There isn't the same capacity anywhere else in the world,"" Kinsley said. ""That's why everybody is working hard to meet the new [specifications] so that material will still continue to make its way to China.""If the request is approved, Mayes said the increase would have no impact on property taxes or garbage and recycling fees, at least in the short run.The city would strive to find the cash within its existing operating budget, he said, and could get as much as 80 per cent back from its industry funding partner, Multi-Material Stewardship Manitoba.Due to the structure of the MMSM's funding agreement with Winnipeg, that money would flow within a few years, Mayes added, so Winnipeg would still need to find a way to cover the cost until then.""It's like a three-year rolling average they use to calculate payments, so it's always a little behind. But we don't have the luxury of time here to do nothing,"" Mayes said. ""We don't want to be stockpiling or burning [materials].""According to the report, the city would likely have to provide an additional estimated $694,371 for 2018 and $538,984 for 2019, on top of roughly $226,000 to cover 2017 expenses, for a total increase of $1,459,167.The 2017 change wouldn't require a budget adjustment for that year.The actual numbers aren't clear yet because they're based on fluctuating amounts of recycling, market values and global economies.The report will be presented to committee next week. After that, it will proceed to the executive policy committee and city council."

It was then given the name ""canola"" using ""can"" from Canada.In the decades since, it's become a major crop for Canadian farmers.But 43,000 canola producers are now facing market uncertainty and dropping prices after their largest seed customer, China, barred shipments from two major Canadian canola companies — Richardson International and Viterra — saying they had found pests in some shipments. With a population of 1.4 billion, China buys 40 per cent of Canada's canola seed, worth about $2.7 billion.""The Chinese market for seed is larger than the next three major markets combined: the United States, Mexico and Japan,"" said Canola Council of Canada president Jim Everson.When news of the ban on Viterra was announced, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau defended the quality of Canadian canola and said he may send a high-level delegation to China in an effort to resolve the bans on Canadian canola.A push for Canadians to buy more cooking oil is encouraging for farmers, but won't have a real impact  — for two reasons.One, Canada's population of about 37 million is far too small to consume enough canola products to offset the loss of the Chinese market. Two, there isn't a problem selling refined canola oil. The challenge is selling raw seed.""We can't eat our way out of this problem,"" Richard Gray, a professor of agricultural economics at the University of Saskatchewan, said.Canada's 14 crushing and refining plants are already working at capacity, or nearly so, churning out canola oil and meal. The largest customer for those products is the United States, and the oil often ends up back on Canadian store shelves as an ingredient in food products, such as potato chips.It would be impossible for Canadian processing plants to suddenly absorb and process millions of tonnes of extra raw seed that was rejected by China, no matter how eager Canadians are to snap up canola products. Still, it's worth the effort, says an award-winning Saskatchewan chef.Dale MacKay, a former winner of Top Chef Canada and Saskatoon restaurateur, ditched olive oil and butter in favour of canola oil in his restaurants years ago. He said he prefers the lighter, more neutral flavour of canola oil and its ability to withstand high temperatures without burning.In light of the recent trade dispute with China, MacKay said it's time for more casual cooks to buy local.""Anytime we can go local, we will, to support our farmers,"" MacKay said. ""That goes for lentils, beans, pulses, really anything our farmers are farming, we try to promote.""Brian Innes, a vice-president with the Canola Council of Canada, says the food processing industry is so integrated in North America, with canola being shipped over the border multiple times for processing and packaging, that Canadian consumers shouldn't get too hung up on the address listed on a bottle of canola oil.""They can rest assured that most of the canola oil, whether it's labelled a product of Canada or not, most of it is coming from Canada,"" Innes said.  There are some smaller private labels that carry that ""Canada Brand"" to certify it's grown, processed and bottled in CanadaIn central Alberta, Pleasant Valley Oil Mills crushes 60 tonnes of canola every day. All of it is purchased directly from local farmers. The company is automating its bottling line, so it's not producing its cold-pressed canola cooking oil for store shelves at the moment, but it is providing canola oil for dog food, such as that sold by Champion Petfoods.Pleasant Valley's president, Kyle Makila, appreciates the ""buy Canadian"" movement and says it's an opportunity to educate consumers about the health benefits of low-cholesterol canola oil, which Agri-Food Canada says has ""the least saturated fat of any culinary oil.""While there are many non-food uses of canola, found in everything from cosmetics to printing inks and biofuels, it would be difficult for Canadian consumers to source canola in those products.But producers and canola boosters are grateful for the support at a time when it's hard to determine what the next year will look like.Innes says the Canola Council of Canada appreciates that Canadians want to buy more product, even though it can't offset the loss of the Chinese market.""It's not going to save the market, but it is important, because we need to understand the value of canola to our country,"" he says. ""So efforts around raising awareness … those are wonderful efforts."" Innes says Canadians can put pressure on the federal government to resolve the issue with China."

When they had to travel, they walked.""I had to go with her,"" said Chan. ""It was a lot of walking but I really enjoyed visiting the relatives.""Besides the dinner, Chan said that in his region there were ten days of festivities, each with a theme specific to a certain animal or valued commodity and each with a certain menu.Some years, a lion dance troupe would arrive at their village to perform — his community couldn't afford a troupe of their own.During the celebrations, the younger generations would go to their elders and wish them good health and long life. The elders in turn would wish the children strength and good fortune, before giving them good luck red packets. The packets would contain money, usually copper coins with which they could buy candies and fire crackers.With files from North by Northwest"

Dylan dumps tour after China denial | CBC News,Bob Dylan's tour of eastern Asia has been cancelled after Chinese officials refused to let him perform in Beijing and Shanghai.,2010-04-04T15:40:06.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/dylan-dumps-tour-after-china-denial-1.906000,"   Bob Dylan's tour of eastern Asia has been cancelled after Chinese officials refused to let him perform in Beijing and Shanghai.Jeffrey Wu of the Taiwan-based promoters Brokers Brothers Herald said China's Ministry of Culture is likely wary of a counterculture figure like Dylan in the wake of an incident by Icelandic singer Bjork.Two years ago, Bjork caused an uproar when she shouted pro-Tibet remarks at a concert in Shanghai.The dates in China would have marked the 68-year-old Dylan's first concerts in mainland China.He did manage a slate of shows in Japan through out March, ending the month with a concert in Seoul on March 31st, before abandoning the rest of his east Asia tour with more stops in South Korea,Taiwan and Hong Kong. Wu told the South China Morning Post that all those dates are now scrapped.""The chance to play in China was the main attraction for him. When that fell through everything else was called off,"" Wu told the newspaper.""What Bjork did definitely made life very difficult for other performers. They are very wary of what will be said by performers on stage now.""'Bjork shouted ""Tibet! Tibet!"" after performing a song called Declare Independence at her Shanghai concert.The British band Oasis was denied entry in 2009 and ruled ""unsuitable"" for Chinese audiences because the lead guitarist and songwriter, Noel Gallagher, had appeared at a Tibet freedom concert 12 years earlier.Dylan first made a name for himself with politically charged tunes including The Times They Are A-Changin' and the anti-war anthem Blowin' in the Wind.China has insisted that Tibet has been part of its territory for 700 years and invaded shortly after the 1949 communist revolution. China's rule over Tibet has brought condemnation from foreign governments and activists."
"China installs weapons systems on artificial islands, U.S. think-tank says | CBC News","China appears to have installed weapons, including anti-aircraft and anti-missile systems, on all seven of the artificial islands it has built in the South China Sea, a U.S. think-tank reports.",2016-12-14T15:48:26.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/china-weapons-systems-artificial-islands-1.3895829,"China appears to have installed weapons, including anti-aircraft and anti-missile systems, on all seven of the artificial islands it has built in the South China Sea, a U.S. think-tank reported on Wednesday, citing new satellite imagery.The Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative (AMTI) said its findings come despite statements by Chinese leadership that Beijing has no intention to militarize the islands in the strategic trade route, where territory is claimed by several countries.AMTI said it had been tracking construction of hexagonal structures on Fiery Cross, Mischief and Subi reefs in the Spratly Islands since June and July. China has already built military-length airstrips on these islands.""It now seems that these structures are an evolution of point-defence fortifications already constructed at China's smaller facilities on Gaven, Hughes, Johnson and Cuarteron reefs,"" it said, citing images taken in November.""This model has gone through another evolution at [the] much larger bases on Fiery Cross, Subi and Mischief reefs.""Satellite images of Hughes and Gaven reefs showed what appeared to be anti-aircraft guns and what were likely to be close-in weapons systems (CIWS) to protect against cruise missile strikes, it said.Images from Fiery Cross Reef showed towers that likely contained targeting radar, it said.AMTI said covers had been installed on the towers at Fiery Cross, but the size of platforms on these and the covers suggested they concealed defence systems similar to those at the smaller reefs.""These gun and probable CIWS emplacements show that Beijing is serious about defence of its artificial islands in case of an armed contingency in the South China Sea,"" it said.""Among other things, they would be the last line of defence against cruise missiles launched by the United States or others against these soon-to-be-operational air bases.""AMTI director Greg Poling said AMTI had spent months trying to figure out what the purposes of the structures was.""This is the first time that we're confident in saying they are anti-aircraft and CIWS emplacements. We did not know that they had systems this big and this advanced there,"" he told Reuters.""This is militarization. The Chinese can argue that it's only for defensive purposes, but if you are building giant anti-aircraft gun and CIWS emplacements, it means that you are prepping for a future conflict.""They keep saying they are not militarizing, but they could deploy fighter jets and surface-to-air missiles tomorrow if they wanted to,"" he said. ""Now they have all the infrastructure in place for these interlocking rings of defence and power projection.""The report said the installations would likely back up a defensive umbrella provided by a future deployment of mobile surface-to-air missile (SAM) platforms like the HQ-9 system deployed to Woody Island in the Paracel Islands, farther to the north in the South China Sea.It forecast that such a deployment could happen ""at any time,"" noting a recent Fox News report that components for SAM systems have been spotted at the southeastern Chinese port of Jieyang, possibly destined for the South China Sea.China has said military construction on the islands will be limited to necessary defensive requirements.The U.S. has criticized what it called China's militarization of its maritime outposts, and stressed the need for freedom of navigation by conducting periodic air and naval patrols near them that have angered Beijing.U.S. president-elect Donald Trump, who takes office on Jan. 20, has also criticized Chinese behaviour in the South China Sea while signalling he may adopt a tougher approach to China's assertive behaviour in the region than President Barack Obama."

China goes from red-alert pollution to green energy | CBC News,"China has a reputation for lung-choking smog — a country that runs on coal, where smokestacks at outdated steel factories belch black air. But tackling pollution has become a national priority, and the pace of change is often mind-boggling.",2016-10-27T17:17:14.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/china-pollution-green-energy-1.3823786,"The city of Foshan is in the middle of China's manufacturing heartland. It may be big and noisy, factories gushing consumer products and pollution, but its new city bus glides along almost silently, producing no pollution at all.The bus runs on hydrogen fuel cells, unique Canadian technology made in Burnaby, B.C., by Ballard Power Systems, now installed in engines produced locally by a Chinese partner and investor. Ballard has a contract for 300 buses in two cities here.The buses go much farther and take much less time to refuel than the battery-powered electric buses which share the roads here, says Ballard. On today's test run, things are going smoothly. And in today's China, the opportunities are growing quickly.""People do see very serious air quality issues in Beijing and probably 50 other cities in China, particularly last year when you had the red alerts. These issues are driving real change,"" says Ballard president Randy MacEwen, as we stand near a bus stop.China puts more than 300,000 new urban buses on the road every year. MacEwen figures that within a decade, 60,000 of those will run on hydrogen fuel cells. Canadian cities use none.But here, tackling pollution has become a national priority, and the pace of change is often mind-boggling.""The difference in the political and social structure here in China means that the speed of government — and the speed of business and the speed of market adoption — is unlike anywhere else in the rest of the world,"" says MacEwen.Starting with government subsidies that cover up to 60 per cent of the cost of each fuel cell bus.China has a reputation as a country where coal is king and smokestacks at outdated steel factories belch black air, and that is still true in many places around the country.But China's growing middle class has been unusually vocal in its complaints about toxic air in cities like Beijing, which can see day after day of lung-choking smog.A survey by the Pew Research Center this past spring found that seven out of 10 people in China felt air and water pollution are a big problem — either a really, or moderately, big one. And fully half of those surveyed said air pollution should be reduced even if that means slower economic growth.The outcry seems to have been heard at the top political levels.Chinese observers say that's one reason China's parliament ratified the Paris agreement on climate change, despite the accord's ambitious targets. The move was announced jointly with the United States with much fanfare just before the G20 summit last month. Canada ratified the agreement one month later.Under the deal, China commits to increasing its share of energy use that comes from non-fossil fuels to 20 per cent, from about 10 per cent in past years. It also promises that its carbon emissions will peak by 2030 and then gradually decline.That's a far cry from previous climate change negotiations, where China argued it should not be expected to make sacrifices like these because its economy is still developing.In a speech at the summit, Chinese President Xi Jinping said that for him, ""green mountains and clear water are as good as mountains of gold and silver.""""To protect the environment is to protect productivity, and to improve the environment is to boost productivity,"" Xi said. Experts say that has become a priority for the president. There is a recognition that China has ""bigger responsibilities and also capabilities than other developing countries,"" says Wang Tao, a Beijing-based energy and climate expert with the Carnegie-Tsinghua Center for Global Policy.""Xi Jinping has higher ambitions in achieving goals of climate change because he is more proactive in international affairs, and he also wants to see China emerge as a more respected and active international player,"" he says.That may explain China's booming wind and solar energy sectors, spurred on by billions of dollars in subsidies from Beijing.But the development hasn't been entirely trouble free.Those subsidies have been unpredictable and unevenly implemented. Green energy firms have also found themselves sidelined by the coal industry at times. It still has enormous political clout in China and consists largely of state-owned firms, with long-established connections.Still, the move away from fossil fuels is real.A study by the environmental group Greenpeace found that last year, all of China's additional energy needs were met by green energy, as its growth outstrips the use of coal and oil. In fact, the level of coal-generated electricity has declined for three years in a row.Meanwhile, wind turbines have been going up at an average rate of one every single hour. China is already the largest producer of solar panels in the world.Based on this, Li Yan from Greenpeace in Beijing says China is capable of meeting its Paris accord commitments, despite being the world's biggest energy user and emitter of greenhouse gasses.""No one can use China as an excuse of not taking action anymore,"" she says."

Shipments remained reduced Wednesday.State media have said no more oil is leaking into the sea, but the total amount of oil spilled is not yet clear.Greenpeace China released photos Wednesday of inky beaches and of straw mats about two square metres in size scattered on the sea, meant to absorb the oil.Fishing in the waters around Dalian has been banned through the end of August, the state-run Xinhua News Agency reported.""The oil spill will pose a severe threat to marine animals, and water quality, and the sea birds,"" Huang Yong, deputy bureau chief for the city's Maritime Safety Administration, told Dragon TV.At least one person died during cleanup efforts. A 25-year-old firefighter, Zhang Liang, drowned Tuesday when a wave threw him from a vessel, Xinhua reported.Officials, oil company workers and volunteers were turning out by the hundreds to clean blackened beaches.""We don't have proper oil cleanup materials, so our workers are wearing rubber gloves and using chopsticks,"" an official with the Jinshitan Golden Beach Administration Committee told the Beijing Youth Daily newspaper, in apparent exasperation.""This kind of inefficiency means the oil will keep coming to shore.… This stretch of oil is really difficult to clean up in the short term.""But 40 oil-skimming boats and about 800 fishing boats were also deployed to clean up the spill, and Xinhua said more than 15 kilometres of oil barriers had been set up to keep the slick from spreading.China Central Television earlier reported an estimate of 1,360 tonnes of oil has spilled. That would amount roughly to 1.5 million litres — as compared with 356 million to 697 million litres in the BP oil spill off the U.S. coast.China's State Oceanic Administration released the latest size of the contaminated area in a statement Tuesday.The cause of the explosion that started the spill was still not clear. The pipeline is owned by China National Petroleum Corp., Asia's biggest oil and gas producer by volume.Friday's images of 30-metre-high flames at China's second largest port for crude oil imports drew the immediate attention of President Hu Jintao and other top leaders.Now the challenge is cleaning up the greasy plume.""Our priority is to collect the spilled oil within five days to reduce the possibility of contaminating international waters,"" Dalian's vice-mayor, Dai Yulin, told Xinhua on Tuesday.But an official with the State Oceanic Administration has warned the spill will be difficult to clean up even in twice that amount of time.Some locals said the area's economy was already hurting. ""Let's wait and see how well they deal with the oil until Sept. 1, if the oil can't be cleaned up by then, the seafood products will all be ruined,"" an unnamed fisherman told Dragon TV. ""No one will buy them in the market because of the smell of the oil."""

China puts to death more people than any other country.However, human rights groups estimate at least 90 per cent of transplanted organs come from executed prisoners.The country's Health Ministry and the Red Cross Society of China this week launched a national organ donation system to reduce the reliance on death row inmates and encourage donations from the public, the China Daily newspaper reported.Condemned prisoners are ""definitely not a proper source for organ transplants,"" the report quoted deputy health minister Huang Jiefu as saying.He has publicly acknowledged that most transplant organs are taken from executed prisoners but only with prior consent.Foreign medical and human rights groups have long criticized China's organ transplant trade as being opaque, profit-driven and unethical. Critics say death row prisoners might feel compelled to become donors.Voluntary donations in China remain far below demand, partly because of cultural bias against organ removal before burial. About 1.5 million people in China need transplants, but only around 10,000 operations are performed annually, Chinese health officials say."

They were to marry Friday and stage a wedding banquet for 40 friends and family.The timing of the date was no accident. The Beijing Olympics began at 8:08 p.m. local time, on the eighth day, of the eighth month, of the year 2008.And, as Gao explained: ""Everybody knows eight is a lucky number in China.""Beijing residents have been in a frenzy to link themselves to the number in any way possible. They're planning events as large as childbirth and mundane as picking a cellphone number around the date.The belief is based on Chinese language and culture. The number (ba ) sounds like ""fortune"" in some Mandarin dialects. Double and triple eights are believed to double and triple your fortune.""Getting married on this day will bring us good luck,"" says Zhao, who demurely hides her face when asked what attracted her to her future husband.""I plan to have a celebration every year on Aug. 8. I will always remember the Olympics.""While Gao hoped the lucky wedding day would help his clothing business and his hunt for Olympic basketball and table tennis tickets, his bride-to-be had wishes of a more personal nature.""I would like to start a family next year. I want to have a boy and girl,"" Zhao said.Many others in Beijing clearly did not want to wait, targeting Aug. 8 as a possible birthday for their new additions.""We are very busy. We are very happy because many newborns will come into the world,"" said Dr. Li Shaofen at Beijing's Jishuitan Hospital. ""Women who have babies this year feel very happy and feel they have good luck.""Indeed, Dr. Zhang Yunping, director of the Maternal and Child Hygiene Hospital of the Haidan District in Beijing, told the Reuters news agency that his hospital delivered 30 babies between midnight and 1 p.m. Friday. Twenty of them were by caesarean sections, he said, a fairly typical ratio in China.   But Zhang also told Reuters that his hospital refused some parents seeking to take nature in their own hands and schedule caesareans for August 8.Women interviewed by CBC News at Jishuitan hospital who expected to give birth on Friday claimed they did not specifically choose that date, but felt it would be fortunate if they had their babies that day.""We're having our baby in August. We feel very happy, because China is [staging] the Olympic Games,"" said pregnant mother Zhang Li.A surge in newborns might be the talk of the hospitals, but some of the 08-08-08 buzz in mobile-mad China has been around cellphone numbers.Unlike in Canada, where most cellphone numbers are assigned with the phone, many people in China prefer to pay extra for a custom phone number. Cellphones can be bought for as little as $10 in Beijing, but a lucky phone number can ring you up more than $3,000. (The average income for urban workers in Beijing is around $5,500.)A local man, Zhang Jianyun, reportedly paid $2,788 earlier this year for the cellphone number 2008-0808. And a cellphone with six consecutive eights reportedly sold for $6,750 last year in eastern China.along ""Cellphone Street,"" a strip of Beijing stores offering the latest Samsungs and Nokias, buying a mobile has become much more complicated these days, said cellphone clerk Jin Ying.""The last four numbers of a cellphone are the most important,"" Jin said.You have to negotiate the price of the luckiest numbers with the store, which has hundreds of phone numbers for sale, all catalogued in books. Numbers ending in 6888 and 1888 would set you back more than $3,000.You can also take your chances at getting a lucky number from an automated machine at the state-run China Mobile chain.But try for 2008 and you're out of luck. It's been sold out for months."

Former Philippine president in Hong Kong to ease tensions over South China Sea | CBC News,Former Philippine president Fidel Ramos says he wants to focus on points of common interest with China such as tourism and commercial fishing as part of efforts to smooth relations with Beijing roiled by the South China Sea dispute.,2016-08-09T06:39:45.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/phillipines-fidel-ramos-envoy-china-south-sea-1.3712924,"Former Philippine president Fidel Ramos says he wants to focus on points of common interest with China such as tourism and commercial fishing as part of efforts to smooth relations with Beijing roiled by the South China Sea dispute.Ramos spoke with reporters Tuesday in Hong Kong, where he said he plans to meet old friends with links to officials in Beijing.Current Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has asked the 88-year-old Ramos to act as his special envoy to pave the way for talks with Beijing after an international arbitration tribunal invalidated China's expansive territorial claims in a case put forward by the Philippines.China has denied Philippine fishermen access to traditional grounds lying within the Philippines' 370-kilometre exclusive economic zone, an area Ramos implied the countries could share.Meanwhile, Japan's foreign minister summoned China's ambassador Tuesday and lodged a protest over the increased number of Chinese vessels in waters near disputed islands in the East China Sea.The move by Fumio Kishida comes as the number of Chinese coast guard ships around the islands has nearly quadrupled over the past few days to as many as 13, a record number since China started sending ships to the region in September 2012 after Japan nationalized the islands' ownership.Kishida told Chinese Ambassador Cheng Yonghua that the ships must leave the area, saying their presence has escalated tensions between the countries. He said their repeated infiltration and unilateral attempt to change the status quo were unacceptable.The Japanese Coast Guard said at least two of the 13 Chinese vessels have been in the Japanese territorial waters around the islands despite repeated warnings for them to leave. Gun batteries were seen on several of the ships, officials said.Cheng told reporters as he left the ministry that the increase in the China's coast guard fleet was to oversee the increased activity of the Chinese fishing boats. ""Please understand that it's an effort by the Chinese side to avoid further complications to the situation.""Cheng said both sides need to make efforts through diplomatic dialogue to keep the situation under control. The ambassador also reiterated China's territorial claims to the islands.Hundreds of Chinese fishing boats have also been seen accompanying the coast guard vessels, just as a fishing season in the East China Sea opens.China also claims Japan-controlled Senkaku islands and calls them the Diaoyu islands.Relations between Japan and China have long been strained over their wartime history, a sensitive topic during the summer because of end-of-the-war anniversaries.Japanese media reports say the recent escalation in China's activity around the disputed islands may be seen as a warning against planned visits by members of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's Cabinet to Tokyo's Yasukuni Shrine, which honours war criminals among the war dead, for the Aug. 15 anniversary to mark the end of World War II."
Trudeau hosts China's premier while imprisoned Canadian remains behind bars | CBC Radio,The lawyer for the family of a dual Canadian-Chinese citizen jailed for the past decade says it's difficult to watch Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and the Chinese's premier hob-knobbing in Ottawa.,2016-09-22T21:50:42.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/radio/asithappens/as-it-happens-thursday-edition-1.3774309/trudeau-hosts-china-s-premier-while-imprisoned-canadian-remains-behind-bars-1.3774317,"Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is meeting with China's Premier Li Keqiang this week in Ottawa. The official visit comes just weeks after the prime minister's own visit to China. And it's the first such visit by a Chinese leader to Ottawa in more than six years. On the agenda for their meetings are trade and growing economic ties.There's also been a lot of talk about an extradition treaty between the two countries.But for the family of Huseyin Celil — a dual Canadian-Chinese citizen imprisoned in China since 2006 — seeing the two leaders together has stirred up deep and difficult emotions. Their hopes, that Celil's case might also be on the table, are thin.Chris MacLeod is the lawyer for Celil's family. He tells As It Happens host Carol Off that they are feeling very frustrated.CAROL OFF: Mr. MacLeod, does Canada's new diplomatic dance with China change anything for your client, Huseyin Celil?CHRIS MACLEOD: Well, we certainly hope so. He's been in jail now in China without communication with his family and without the Canadian government having access to see him directly. So we hope the channel has changed. The jury's out. I remain optimistic that Prime Minister Trudeau, [Foreign Affairs Minister Stephane] Dion and Consular Services have done a huddle and are working hard on the Celil case.CO: And what is Mr. Celil's wife Kamila saying about this? Does she see hope now that these connections are being made with China?CM: I think Kamila and the children are exasperated. They're extremely frustrated. They've done a remarkable job remaining hopeful. But no clear progress has been made.CO: He has been in prison in China for 10 years. Can you tell us why he has been incarcerated there?CM: That's a million dollar question. China says it's for terrorist-related allegations. I personally believe that when he was in Canada he was very active with the Uighur community. He spoke for the Uighur people. He went to neighbouring Uzbekistan with his wife to visit Kamila's family. [Celil] went to renew his visa. There was an alert and he was detained and transferred to China.CO: We just saw Kevin Garratt released from China. He was there for two years. Why do you think that Kevin Garratt was released, but it still seems so difficult for Mr. Celil to be released?CM: Garratt's a Canadian citizen who does not have any ties to China like Celil did. So [the cases are] entirely different. Celil's been tortured. We don't know if he's had a significant trial; we weren't allowed in the room. If that's how they're going to treat a Canadian, what's going to happen with an extradition where they're now asking for the return of Chinese nationals who've come to Canada? I want to watch this situation very carefully."
North Korea nuclear tests present dilemma for ally China | CBC News,"China's support for the North Korean regime goes back to the 1950s and the Korean War, but a Chinese economic and political analyst says North Korea should not count on that continuing indefinitely, in light of Pyongyang's latest nuclear test.",2016-09-10T14:27:59.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/north-korea-nuclear-china-1.3756624,"As UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon spoke, you could hear the disappointment in his voice. ""I do not simply understand why they are continuing like this.""Hours earlier, North Korea's nuclear weapons test had shocked the world. But his disappointment is personal. As the United Nations' top diplomat, he has spent a decade trying to convince Pyongyang to abandon its nuclear program. As a South Korean, he knows the nervousness that program triggers.""It's a deeply disappointing concern for this act of provocation, continuing against such an honest appeal and urging by the international community,"" he said.Appeals, inducements or threats… nothing seems to have worked.Not even some of the toughest sanctions the UN Security Council has applied against any country, implemented in March. Those were meant to severely limit trade with North Korea, and choke off the money and supplies Pyongyang needs to continue its nuclear program.Instead, North Korea's technology seems to be improving. So much so that U.S. nuclear weapons experts say stopping it is no longer a realistic option.The only possibility is to freeze it, says Siegfried Hecker, the former director of the U.S. Los Alamos National Laboratory, the heart of the American nuclear weapons program.""My best estimate at this time is that they may have enough bomb fuel for 18 bombs, with a capacity to make six to seven more annually. That, combined with the increased sophistication they surely achieved with this test, paints a troublesome picture,"" Hecker told a Stanford University publication after North Korea's previous test in January.Friday's test was the fifth in a decade, and the most powerful for the team of scientists assembled by North Korea's reclusive dictator, Kim Jong-un.North Korea says its aim is to become a nuclear power, one with the means to threaten the United States with weapons powerful enough to wreak havoc, small enough to shoot overseas on the tip of a missile.With each test, North Korea sends a message to its people that it is strong, and a message to the world that it is defiant, says Xiaohe Cheng, the deputy director of Renmin University's Centre for China's International Strategic studies in Beijing.""It's saying it will defy, ignore, challenge the Security Council's authority,"" he says.And, it continues to threaten the United States and South Korea.The North Korean people are ""always ready to retaliate against the enemies,"" it said on state TV after Friday's blast. ""It is part of practical countermeasures to the racket of threat and sanctions against [North Korea] kicked up by the U.S.-led hostile forces who have gone desperate.""Maybe not desperate, but many countries are certainly frustrated with Pyongyang, including North Korea's most powerful traditional ally, China.Beijing says it is ""firmly opposed"" to its continued tests. ""We strongly urge the DPRK [North Korea] to honour its commitment of de-nuclearization,"" it said in a statement shortly after Friday's detonation.But China's role in this dilemma has been complicated.On one hand, China doesn't want North Korea (which it refers to as Democratic People's Republic of Korea or DPRK) to become a nuclear power, says Renmin University's Cheng.""This would encourage other countries in northeast Asia to follow its steps to pursue their own nuclear weapons,"" he says — such as South Korea and Japan.The standoff has already increased tension between Beijing and Washington, over the Amercians' recent commitment to station a sophisticated system of radars and defensive missiles in South Korea. The U.S. says it's meant to protect the American ally from North Korean aggression. China says it will interfere with its own defences.On the other hand, China's support for the North Korean regime goes back to the 1950s and the Korean War. The Chinese Communist Party has strong practical and ideological ties with the ruling Workers' Party of Korea.The last thing China wants is to see a messy regime change, especially on its borders. Its concern is that since North Koreans have sacrificed so much for this nuclear program, Pyongyang must not seem to be ""forced"" to abandon it. Otherwise, Kim Jong-un could be so weakened that his government could fall.NewsFor the same reason, China has tried to soften the blow of UN sanctions by continuing to buy and sell goods that are allowed or that fall into a grey zone. In fact, 90 per cent of North Korea's trade is with China.Some even accuse China of turning a blind eye to an elaborate system set up over the past few years by Pyongyang to evade sanctions and to continue to purchase fuel and other technical supplies for its nuclear program.Research by John Park at Harvard University found that North Korean state enterprises ""operate inside of China … Most are attracting more sophisticated Chinese business partners who act as middlemen in transactions designed to evade sanctions.""Cheng says China is cracking down now, but it could be doing more to influence the leaders of North Korea. ""China has more leverage on DPRK and China certainly could do more to punish DPRK, if DPRK is continuing its provocation,"" he says. It would likely take even tougher UN resolutions to push China in that direction, the kind that are now being debated by the Security Council, he adds.And throughout, North Korea has been confident it can count on China's support. Sometimes, like this week, it has even sent messengers to brief Chinese officials about developments. Sources have told CBC that two senior government officials travelled to Beijing to give China a heads-up the night before this latest nuclear test.Cheng says Kim Jong-un shouldn't continue to assume that.""I think the decision makers in Pyongyang have to think hard before they make further nuclear and missile provocations. China's tolerance of DPRK's bad behaviours is limited,"" he says.""Don't push China too hard."""
PM Justin Trudeau will travel to China for an official visit | CBC News,Prime Minister Justin Trudeau will travel to China for an official visit from Aug. 30 – Sept. 6 where he will also take part in the G20 leaders' summit in Hangzhou on Sept. 4.,2016-08-18T15:42:43.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/pm-justin-trudeau-china-visit-g20-1.3726320,"Justin Trudeau heads to China this month on a visit that's expected to lay the groundwork for his approach to Canada's sometimes-bumpy relationship with the world's second-biggest economy.The prime minister's week-long tour, from Aug. 30 to Sept. 6, will stop in Beijing, Shanghai, Hong Kong and Hangzhou for the G20 leaders' summit.Trudeau has signalled his intention to deepen business ties with China, as his government looks to make inroads into the rapidly expanding Asian markets. The push could one day lead to a free-trade deal, something China has said it would like to pursue.But Trudeau will also have to carefully balance any pursuit of business ambitions in China with concerns over human rights in the country.He has already been forced to deal with one high-profile irritant between the two countries.In June, he expressed his ""dissatisfaction"" with China after its foreign minister publicly berated a Canadian journalist. In doing so, Trudeau also said he would take a stand with China on human rights.During a news conference in Ottawa, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi criticized a journalist who asked about his country's human rights record. Visibly upset, Wang said the question reflected ""arrogance,"" and was ""full of prejudice"" and ""irresponsible.""In response, Trudeau said he would continue to bring up human rights concerns ""every chance we get,"" even as his Liberal government worked to expand its economic relationship with China.""The fact is the way Canada has always engaged best in the world is to be active and vocal about the things that we are concerned about and disagree on, while at the same time looking for common ground that will be of mutual benefit for all of our citizens,"" Trudeau said.He also said he raised the case of a Canadian, Kevin Garratt, who has been jailed in China on espionage charges. Trudeau said Garratt was ""in prison for espionage without any evidence to support the allegations and accusations.""More recently, Canada weighed in last month on the ongoing South China Sea dispute with a thinly veiled call to China to abide by an international ruling that has angered Beijing.China, however, appears to still have high expectations of the Trudeau government.Trudeau had a positive exchange last year with Chinese President Xi Jinping during his first foreign trip after the Canadian election. When they met in Turkey at the G20, the Chinese leader praised Trudeau's father, Pierre, for establishing diplomatic relations with the People's Republic in 1970.During his Ottawa visit, Wang praised past Liberal governments of Jean Chretien and Paul Martin for advancing relations with China. He did not mention the previous decade under Stephen Harper's Conservative government.Harper got off to a frigid start with China in 2006 when he said he would not back away from criticizing their human rights record. He also said he would not sell out Canada's values for the sake of the ""almighty dollar.""But later in his prime ministership, Harper worked to forge stronger business ties with China.During a visit to China in late 2014, Harper announced the opening of new trade offices in some of China's fastest-growing areas. He also said a half-million Canadian jobs depended upon Canadian-Chinese trade.Trudeau said in a statement Thursday that the upcoming trip will create new opportunities for Canadian businesses and the economy, which has been stuck in a slow-growth rut.""I will strive for a closer, more balanced relationship between Canada and China, one that unlocks the untapped potential in our two countries' commercial ties, and advances important issues like good governance, the rule of law and the environment,"" said Trudeau, who was invited by Chinese Premier Li Keqiang.China and its exploding middle class, offer considerable business potential for Canadian firms.The statement also said G20 leaders will consider measures on how to lift global economic growth and investment, and reinforce the global financial system."
China introduces facial recognition technology to dispense toilet paper | CBC News,"​Fed up with the theft of toilet paper from public bathrooms, tourist authorities in China's capital have begun using facial recognition technology to limit how much paper a person can take.",2017-04-03T16:33:27.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/china-facial-recognition-toilet-paper-1.4052888,"Fed up with the theft of toilet paper from public bathrooms, tourist authorities in China's capital have begun using facial recognition technology to limit how much paper a person can take.The unusual move — part of a ""toilet revolution"" — is another step in China's vast upgrading of public facilities.Bathrooms at tourist sites, notorious for their primitive conditions and nasty odours, are a special focus of the campaign, a response to a vast expansion in domestic travel and demands for better-quality facilities from a more affluent public.""Today in China, people are highly enthusiastic about tourism, and we have entered a new era of public tourism,"" said Zhan Dongmei, a researcher with the China Tourism Academy. ""The expectation of the public for the toilet is becoming higher.""At Beijing's 600-year-old Temple of Heaven, administrators recognized the need to stock the public bathrooms with toilet paper, a requirement for obtaining a top rating from the National Tourism Authority. But they needed a means of preventing patrons from stripping them bare for personal use — hence the introduction of new technology that dispenses just one 60-centimetre section of paper every nine minutes following a face scan.""People take away the paper mostly because they are worried they can't find any when they want to use it the next time. But if we can provide it in every toilet, most people will not do it anymore,"" Zhan said.Launched two years ago, the revolution calls for at least 34,000 new public bathrooms to be constructed in Beijing and 23,000 renovated by the end of this year. Authorities are also encouraging the installation of Western-style sit-down commodes rather than the more common squat toilets. Around 25 billion yuan ($4.8 billion) 4 856 315 000 has already been spent on the program, according to the National Tourism Administration.The ultimate target, Zhan said, ""is to have a sufficient amount of toilets which are clean and odourless and free to use.""At Happy Valley, the largest amusement park in Beijing, around 4 million annual visitors rely on 18 bathrooms, each of which is assigned one or two cleaners who must make their rounds every 10 minutes on busy days.""People come here to have fun, but if the toilets are disgusting, how can they have a good time here?"" said Vice General Manager Li Xiangyang. ""It is the least we should do to offer a clean and tidy environment for tourists to enjoy both the tour of the park and the experience of using our toilets.""Going a step further, the financial hub of Shanghai even opened its first gender-neutral public toilet in November in order to boost convenience and efficiency.""Women are stuck waiting in longer lines for stalls than men, and it is fair for men and women to wait in line together,"" Shanghai resident Zhu Jingyi said after using the facility.Zhan said the toilet revolution is about 90 per cent complete, but warned that it has yet to be won.""We can't accept the situation that a lot of investments have been made to build toilets and they turn out to be unsanitary and poorly managed,"" he said."

This is a huge challenge for us, but it also brings a lot of profit for our business, and especially for Vancouver,"" said Zhu.In the short term, Zhu said the new status means Chinese tourists will likely come to Vancouver for the 2010 Winter Olympics in February, but in the long term, Zhu estimates a huge spike in tourism all over the country.""I think the estimation was more than $100 million every year in tourism revenue,"" he said.B.C. Premier Gordon Campbell welcomed the news, saying it was something his government had been working towards for a long time.""It should mean real economic opportunity for our tourism industry in British Columbia. It will be a real boost at a time when we come out of the 2010 Olympics,"" said Campbell, who heard the news while in Toronto.Zhu said he first started working on getting Canada approved destination status while living in Beijing 12 years ago.But he and his colleagues were convinced the policy would not change during Harper's current trip to China because Canada's relations with China have soured over recent years.On Thursday in Beijing, Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao reminded Harper that a Canadian prime minister had not visited in five years — a duration he called ""too long.""Chinese newspapers have also adopted a mixed tone toward Harper's visit, with one touting Harper's arrival as a sign that ties between the two countries may ""thaw,"" while another article described Harper's visit as ""late"" but ""still welcome.""Meanwhile, the Chinese Foreign Ministry has called on Canada to deport accused smuggler and billionaire Lai Changxing, who has taken refuge in Vancouver for the last nine years after fleeing China.According to the Prime Minister's Office, nearly 160,000 Chinese travellers visited Canada last year. Chinese visitors had the highest average length of stay in Canada — 28 nights — and spent more than visitors from any other country, nearly $1,650 each.According to a Conference Board of Canada survey, approved destination status is expected to boost the yearly rate of travel to Canada from China by up to 50 per cent by 2015."

""I think on both sides, more regular visits would make sense,"" he said.In an earlier meeting, Chinese President Hu Jintao also pointed out twice that it was Harper's first visit. Harper said it has been five years since a Chinese leader visited Canada.Despite the gentle proddings, Harper's visit to China seemed to be producing results. In a joint communiqué, the countries said China will bestow the label of ""preferred tourist destination"" on Canada, a move that will make it easier for Chinese tourists to visit Canada.China will also open a consulate in Montreal.The statement only briefly mentioned the issue of human rights, saying the two sides agreed they had ""distinct points of view.""""We always make sure when we bring up these matters — whether they relate to particular cases that you’re aware of in the newspaper that have been discussed from time to time, or whether they’re broader questions such as the situation in Tibet — we always bring these up in a way that is frank, at the same time in a way that is respectful of Chinese sovereignty,"" Harper said.Relations between Canada and China have been cool in recent years as Harper has pressed the Chinese government to improve its record on human rights.In their joint communiqué, the leaders pledged to keep discussing human rights, trade and investment, and to co-operate on ""green"" technology.Commenting on the scolding from the Chinese leadership, Liberal Leader Michael Ignatieff said it was as though Harper ""had received a slap in public"" and that it will cost Canada jobs.""He lost face today,"" Ignatieff said. ""And in that culture, losing face is very important and I do think it's cost Canada economic opportunity today.""Liberal foreign affairs critic Bob Rae charged that Canada has paid a price for four years ""of not just living on the margins, but actually, deliberately disregarding China.""""This was a deliberate decision on [Harper's] part to ignore the relationship and to assert that it had no particular importance for him, and I think we’re now paying a very, very heavy price for that decision,"" Rae told reporters on Parliament Hill.In another development, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman called on Canada to deport Lai Changxing, who is accused by China of running a smuggling empire that netted him more than $10 billion. Changxing has taken refuge in Vancouver for the last nine years after fleeing China.Chinese newspapers have taken a somewhat mixed tone toward Harper's visit.On Wednesday, the government-run China Daily ran a story touting Harper's arrival as a sign that ties between the two countries may ""thaw,"" while another article described Harper's visit as ""late"" but ""still welcome.""An editorial in the Global Times, a publication of the country's Communist Party, accused Harper of criticizing the Chinese government to appease his electoral base and of turning ""a cold shoulder to China."""

Once we have to start cleaning this stuff down to one per cent, it just plugs the whole system up and it's going to cause backlogs in canola shipments, wheat shipments, barley shipments — any sort of grains that we export,"" he said. China is insisting on this lower dockage rate to reduce the possible spread of a fungal disease called blackleg. But Lynn Jacobson, the president of the Alberta Federation of Agriculture, said Canada has blackleg under control.""Their stated reason that, you know, it's to control blackleg is I guess somewhat of a false argument,"" he said. Jacobson is worried the backlog will affect prices, with desperate farmers eager to offload their crop. One group that could benefit from those lower prices are domestic crushers, who turn the seeds into oil. ""If there's less seed in China for processors, and there may be somewhat less, it opens up an opportunity for those of us who are exporting canola oil itself,"" said Steven Bank, the CEO of Sunora Oil, whose second largest market after the U.S. is China.Prime Minister Justin Trudeau will be in China from Aug. 30 to Sept. 6, culminating in a G20 leaders summit. The canola trade with China is worth around $2 billion."

"Canada, China agree to extension in canola dispute, says Trudeau | CBC News","Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says existing ""dockage"" rules with China on canola exports have been extended beyond a Sept. 1 deadline as the two countries continue to negotiate a long-term solution.",2016-08-31T05:00:09.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/trudeau-canola-export-regime-china-1.3742341,"Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says existing rules with China on canola exports have been extended beyond a Sept. 1 deadline as the two countries continue to negotiate a long-term solution.​The two countries disagree on the level of ""dockage"" — foreign material such as weeds, other crops and detritus — that should be considered acceptable in Canada's canola exports to China.The Chinese government had given Canada until Thursday to cut the level of foreign material in its deliveries by more than half.Trudeau made the announcement about the extension in Beijing, where the canola dispute was expected to dominate the trade agenda during his high-level meetings and the G20, which gets underway later this week.""We're happy to reassure Canadian farmers that (at) the Sept. 1 deadline we will be able to continue with the current regime of canola and we (will) work together very closely towards a long-term solution in the coming days and weeks ahead,"" Trudeau said.Government negotiators in China said Tuesday they were working hard to resolve the dispute involving billions of dollars worth of canola shipments.International Trade Minister Chrystia Freeland previously said the issue was of ""absolute importance"" to the Canada-Chinese trade relationship.""As everyone knows, this was something that was a very difficult issue for our canola growers, for our canola exporters and we were very, very pleased to be able to achieve today, and hear directly from the Chinese premier, that Canadian canola shipments can continue tomorrow, Sept. 1 and onwards, under current terms,"" Freeland said Wednesday after the extension was announced.She said the two sides have also agreed to work towards a long-term agreement on rules for Canadian canola shipments. Freeland added that Canada hopes to achieve this in the coming days and weeks.China's ambassador to Canada, Luo Zhaohui, has stated that Canada has been inflexible and unfair in its approach to talks that began about seven years ago over Chinese concerns about rules for the make-up of canola shipments.Luo said China buys 87 per cent of its canola from Canada because of its good quality and production. But he warned China can always look elsewhere for the product, if necessary.Canada will also apply to join the China-backed Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), the bank's president Jin Liqun said on Wednesday, making it the latest ally of the United States to join the new international development bank.The $100-billion US multilateral institution, seen as a rival to the Western-dominated World Bank and Asian Development Bank, was initially opposed by the United States but attracted many U.S. allies including Britain, Germany, Australia and South Korea as founding members.""This is really for us, as a new government, the earliest possibility at which we could indicate our interest,"" Canadian finance minister Bill Morneau said in response to a question asking why Canada was only applying to join the bank now.Politics""We believe the bank is clearly showing that it's going to be a highly effective multilateral institution,"" he added.Morneau, who is travelling with Trudeau in China, did not specify how much money Canada would put into the new bank.""The Canadians' decision to join this bank will greatly strengthen the management of this institution,"" Jin told reporters. ""We can see that the U.S.'s attitude towards AIIB is showing signs of changing, as it's encouraging the World Bank to cooperate more with the AIIB,"" Jin added.Canada's application must be in by the end of September 2016. The government then has until the end of the year to ratify a deal and hammer out how much it will invest.The bank's governors could decide on new members early in 2017, according to Canadian government documents, which also indicated that the size of Canada's share would be decided at that time.Japan and the United States are the most prominent nations not represented in the bank. The United States said in April it is not presently considering an investment in the AIIB.After meeting with Trudeau, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang told reporters through a translator that Canada and China will launch a feasibility study on an eventual free-trade deal.A senior Canadian official later said the two counties have ongoing technical discussions on free trade, but stressed that there are no negotiations under way at this point.""This year marks 45 years of diplomatic relations between Canada and China,"" Trudeau said as he stood beside Li in Beijing's Great Hall of the People, which overlooks Tiananmen Square.""My father, Pierre Elliott Trudeau, played an important role in establishing a partnership between our two countries when he was prime minister. So, I'm very happy to be extending that effort now.""The countries also agreed to hold annual meetings between the Chinese premier and the Canadian prime minister on a range of issues, including national security and the rule of law.Trudeau also said the two sides will take steps to improve trade and investment, boost tourism, expand cultural exchanges and addressing climate change.Li said on Wednesday that a Canadian citizen detained in China for two years on suspicion of spying would be treated humanely, and his case would be handled in accordance with the law.In January, China indicted Canadian citizen Kevin Garratt on charges of spying and stealing state secrets. He was detained in August 2014 near China's sensitive border with North Korea.Li did not mention Garrett by name but it is rare for a top Chinese leader to comment publicly on such a highly sensitive subject.Asked about the Garratt case, Li told a joint news conference with Trudeau that China and Canada would continue to communicate on the matter.Trudeau said the foundation of a good relationship is the ability to be frank and open about issues that can be worked on together. He said he has ""highlighted a number of consular cases"" every time he's had the opportunity to sit down with Chinese leaders.Among those cases, he noted that he always raises the case of Garratt.Trudeau himself has indicated in the past that there's no evidence to support the accusations against Garratt. The prime minister did not say what China has told him about Garratt's case.Garratt's family said on Wednesday they were ""extremely frustrated and disappointed"" with the lack on progress in freeing him.""Kevin should be released to allow the two countries to move forward to develop stronger ties and cooperation on many levels,"" the family said in a statement released by their Beijing-based lawyers."
China's provocative art scene emerges from the shadows | CBC News,Raymond Saint-Pierre on China's new and provocative art scene,2008-08-13T16:36:58.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/china-s-provocative-art-scene-emerges-from-the-shadows-1.761784,"Raymond Saint-Pierre is one of Radio-Canada's best known and most travelled foreign correspondents, having been based for extensive periods in Washington, London, Paris and Beijing (from 1996-2001). His current assignment is with Une Heure sur Terre, an international news documentary show.The moment we landed, I was in shock. During my five years in Beijing, I'd become accustomed to the old airport of the Chinese capital: overcrowded, too small, lagging about a century behind its modern equivalents in Hong Kong and Singapore.The new one is ultra-modern, vast and stunning, not unlike many of the other developments in this country, including its provocative contemporary art scene. When CBC/Radio-Canada suggested we former correspondents return to China (joining Michel Cormier, the incumbent), I thought it was an excellent idea.I was particularly interested in two subjects: The explosion of contemporary art in China and the incredible development of Macau, which was just a tiny Portuguese enclave when I first arrived in the country in 1996.I had heard about works by contemporary Chinese painters that were being auctioned for millions of dollars, and I was keen to see what Xin Dong Chen, whom I'd met in the 1990s, would have to say about it.I'd made the acquaintance of this unique individual when his spouse, Caroline Puel, a correspondent for the magazine Le Point in China, had invited us to their house for dinner. And what a house! All the rooms were filled with paintings by young Chinese artists.Every wall was covered in works depicting the Maoist era and the new consumption craze, with plenty of irony, even cynicism. The colours were bright, sometimes fluorescent: Mao wearing lipstick, Communist symbols adorning fake Coke or Marlboro ads.Xin Dong Chen wanted to publicize the works of the highly talented young artists, but there were very few private art galleries in Beijing and the Propaganda Department (which still exists) would not allow him to display such daring pieces.Even in the late 1990s, the average Chinese person had few opportunities to discover this modern art. So Xin Dong Chen sold paintings to savvy foreign collectors. On trips to Europe, he would sometimes roll up the canvases and put them in his luggage, selling them cheap to foreign buyers.When I caught up with him on this trip, I discovered that things have certainly changed.He now owns three art galleries and has become well known, so much so that when French President Nicolas Sarkozy went to Beijing a few months back, it was Xin Dong Chen who showed him around Dashanzi, an immense complex that, until recently, served as a military factory and is now occupied by dozens of art galleries.I attended an auction of Chinese paintings with Xin Dong Chen. The Chinese are now the ones buying up modern art pieces, and it is not rare to see one going for millions of dollars.But Xin Dong Chen remains an idealist. In his galleries, he still shows works that test the limits of what the Propaganda Department deems acceptable. He still promotes Chinese contemporary art. And he's organized exhibitions of the works of some 40 Chinese painters, in Moscow and Athens.What also surprised me upon arrival back in Beijing was to see busloads of average Chinese visiting the art galleries in Dashanzi, snapping pictures of the most audacious sculptures and paintings.They obviously liked to see artists testing the level of tolerance of the authorities. (I was wondering whether they felt they had to go and grab as many pictures as possible, for fear the Propaganda Department might close the place down.)But contemporary art also appears to be seen by many here as in investment, or a kind of lottery: They are betting that some new, unknown artist will become big and make everyone rich. Many patrons, in fact, visit the National Arts Academy and try to buy all the works of some students.I realized Chinese people were really getting interested in contemporary art when I visited the Beijing Silk Market. You can buy anything there, from designer jeans to a North Face winter coat. The only certainty is that everything is fake — and cheap.Just for fun, I asked a few shop owners whether I could buy paintings from some of the better known contemporary artists, the ones that sell for hundreds of thousands of dollars at auctions.Sure enough, in about a dozen shops, I was offered hand-painted ""authentic copies"" of works by Zhang Xiaogang (who shows at London's Saatchi Gallery), Zeng Fanzhi and Yue Minjun, known for his paintings of grotesquely smiling people.If forgers bother to reproduce these works, it means there is real consumer demand for this kind of art.As for Macau, I became very attached to this former Portuguese colony in southern China. I travelled there in 1991 as a tourist, and was seduced by the mix of cultures: Chinese and Portuguese living together; Chinese fare with a European flair.I'd covered the handover of Macau in December 1999. At the time, the Portuguese population was concerned their culture would disappear. That hasn't happened. A far greater upheaval in the lives of Macau's residents has been the proliferation of casinos.Macau is a vast construction site, home to some of the world's biggest buildings, where gambling revenues have outstripped those of Vegas.Contemporary art, high-stakes gambling Vegas-style — this is not the China the world often sees.Before leaving, I took a stroll around the neighbourhood in Beijing where I lived from 1996 to 2001. In the late 1990s, I witnessed the opening of new Japanese, Korean, German and even French shopping malls where one could buy real jeans and real Western products, not cheap, low-quality knock-offs.Chinese shoppers also discovered paraphernalia associated with Christmas and other exotic celebrations like Halloween. Now, just a few years later, these malls are dwarfed by the new towers that are overshadowing everything. They already look outdated, ready to be torn down to make way for taller, bigger, more modern buildings.When I was a correspondent in China, I felt, every day, like a student who never stops learning, discovering and marvelling. That hasn't changed: China never ceases to amaze."
"China starts 2017 engulfed in smog, issues pollution alerts | CBC News","Heavy smog that blanketed parts of China over the weekend cleared somewhat on Monday, with flights in Beijing back to normal, but it was likely only to be a brief respite with more choking smog expected to return to the wintry north within 24 hours.",2017-01-02T16:41:10.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/china-new-year-smog-1.3918388,"Heavy smog that blanketed parts of China over the weekend cleared somewhat on Monday, with flights in Beijing back to normal, but it was likely only to be a brief respite with more choking smog expected to return to the wintry north within 24 hours.Weather forecasts on Monday showed the smog would return to Beijing and nearby Tianjin city on Tuesday. It was expected to persist until Thursday in Hebei, the heavily industrialized province that surrounds the capital, and Henan and Shandong provinces, as the region battles freezing temperatures.Severe pollution is forecast to persist in the region for three to seven days, the official Xinhua news agency reported.Authorities have been issuing smog alerts across the north since mid-December, prompting orders for hundreds of factories to scale back production or close outright and for restrictions on motorists to cut emissions.Pollution alerts are common in northern China, especially during winter when energy demand, much of it met by coal, soars.Electrical generating plants burn coal and much of the heavy industry, including steel-making, is concentrated in northern provinces.A pollution index that measures the average concentration of small breathable particles, known as PM2.5, dropped to just over 100 micrograms per cubic metre in Beijing early on Monday from more than 500 on Sunday night. The safe recommended level of PM2.5 is 10 micrograms per cubic metre, according to the World Health Organization.A customer service staff member at the Beijing Capital International Airport said flights were returning to normal on Monday after smog on Sunday caused hundreds of flights to be cancelled. On Monday, the Beijing government maintained its orange alert for heavy pollution and a ban on heavy-duty construction trucks from using the roads.An orange alert is the second-highest level in a four-tier pollution warning system adopted by Beijing when China, worried that its heavy industrial past was tarnishing its global reputation and holding back development, declared a ""war on pollution"" in 2014.Despite that declaration, public anger is mounting about pollution and what many Chinese see as government talk, but little action, to end it. That anger has occasionally spilled over into protests.China's educated middle-class is increasingly intolerant of the bad air, which some blame on lack of enforcement by government. There is also pressure on China to move generation away from coal to meet its climate change commitmentsLate on Sunday, the Ministry of Environmental Protection said 62 northern cities had issued yellow, orange or red alerts.Some highways to Beijing and Tianjin were re-opened as motorists headed home at the end of the long weekend, state television reported later on Monday. But 20 highways remained closed in Shandon province, as heavy smog persisted.State television also reported that some factories in Hebei province's heavy industry hub of Tangshan, including a coal-fired power plant of Datang Power International, and several steel mills, were found to be violating the curb on operations.The latest bout of air pollution began on Friday. China has struggled to tackle the problem effectively after decades of breakneck economic growth, much of it based on heavy industry and the coal-fired power sector."
China's billionaires club of entrepreneurs embarks on cross-Canada tour | CBC News,"A group of powerful Chinese business leaders set off on an eight-day Canadian tour Sunday that will connect them with Canada's corporate and political elite, including Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.",2016-10-16T21:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/china-billionaires-club-canada-tour-1.3807693,"A group of powerful Chinese business leaders set off on an eight-day Canadian tour Sunday that will connect them with Canada's corporate and political elite, including Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.This will be the first visit to Canada by the exclusive China Entrepreneur Club — often referred to as the billionaires club. It's made up of 50 top Chinese firms that earn a combined $585 billion of annual gross income.The group's swing across Canada comes as the bilateral relationship steams ahead at an increasing rate, with help from a Trudeau government that has shown more openness to the Asian superpower.The tour will take place only a few weeks after an exchange of high-level official visits — Trudeau's recent trip to China which was followed by Chinese Premier Li Keqiang's stay in Canada.During those meetings, Trudeau promoted his government's goal of broadening Canada's economic links with the Asian superpower. He made commitments that included the launch of exploratory talks on free trade with the world's second-biggest economy.At the same time, Trudeau brought up Canada's concerns with Chinese leaders about their government's approach to human rights, rule of law, governance and corruption.The China Entrepreneur Club is now hoping to deepen ties with Canada even further. Canada's relationship with its second-largest trading partner was considered inconsistent under the previous Conservative government.Maggie Cheng, the club's secretary-general, said the visit comes at a time of growing opportunities for both countries.""We have a large population and we are in a very long process of urbanization. And the consumer market is growing as well, and it will grow for a very long time,"" Cheng said in a phone interview through an interpreter.""I think the private companies in China have now grown into a (size) that can use a larger resource partner to further improve the Chinese market.""China is increasingly interested in Canada's agriculture, energy and fisheries industries, she said.Cheng also believes the recent visit by the youthful Trudeau caught the attention of China's younger generation, which she says is a large market with considerable buying power.Canada's business community is set to roll out a red carpet for the visiting club members, according to a program of the visit prepared by the group.During stops in Montreal, Ottawa, Toronto and Vancouver, the delegation will have audiences with a who's who of Canadian leaders, in addition to Trudeau.The list includes chief executives of some of Canada's biggest banks as well as former prime minister Jean Chretien, Ontario Premier Kathleen Wynne, Quebec Premier Philippe Couillard, Andre Desmarais of Power Corp., Alain Bellemare of Bombardier, Cirque du Soleil's Daniel Lamarre, Mark Machin of the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and Bank of Canada governor Stephen Poloz.In September, Trudeau kicked off his first official trip to China by appearing at a Beijing event hosted by the club. Jack Ma, founder of e-commerce giant Alibaba and the club's chair, led a question-and-answer session with Trudeau.Ma will not join the Chinese delegation on its cross-Canada trip. But the tour will include a dozen club members, including president Ma Weihua, Tsinghua Holdings Co. chair Xu Jinghong, Far East Holding Group Co. chair Jiang Xipei and Central China Real Estate Ltd. chair Frank Wu.Delegations from the club have already visited the United States, the United Kingdom, Belgium, France, Singapore, Australia, Germany and Italy.Sarah Kutulakos, executive director of the Canada China Business Council, hopes the visit will show Canadians who may have suspicions about Chinese companies that these entrepreneurs are similar to others around the world.She said in an interview that there were strict criteria to join the club and firms had to meet a certain standard in several areas, including corporate social responsibility and philanthropy.The visit will not only widen channels for business opportunities; it's also expected to provide learning experiences for both sides, Kutulakos said.""They're really the vanguard of where the Chinese economy is going,"" said Kutulakos.But one expert in Canada's ties to China said there are likely deep links between many of these entrepreneurs and the Chinese leadership.""In China, it's really very difficult to achieve great wealth unless you have a strongly collaborative, mutually beneficial relationship with the Chinese Communist Party's decision makers,"" said Charles Burton, a former diplomat who is now a political scientist at Brock University.Burton said the club may try to create a subtle lobby within Canada that encourages Canadian business leaders to press their government to make economics the priority in the relationship, rather than concerns over sensitive issues like human rights and cyber security."
Toronto becomes 1st hub to trade China's 'people's money' in North America | CBC News,"After stock markets closed on Monday, Toronto became the first trading hub in North America for China's currency, known as the renminbi or yuan.",2015-03-23T17:29:46.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/toronto-becomes-first-renminbi-trading-hub-in-north-america-1.3005726,"After stock markets closed on Monday, Toronto became the first trading hub in North America for China's currency, known as the renminbi or yuan.Chinese government dignitaries, Federal Finance Minister Joe Oliver and his Ontario compatriot Charles Sousa attended a ceremony in Toronto Monday evening to formally announce the first conversion from yuan to Canadian dollars.The announcement makes Toronto the first such trading hub in the Americas that has permission to be a clearinghouse for Chinese renminbi (which means ""people's money"" in Chinese). There are currently only a handful of such hubs outside China, including Paris, London, Moscow, Singapore, Tokyo, Seoul and Sydney, Australia.In practical terms, such hubs make it easier to do business with China because without one, Chinese money has to first be converted into a currency like the U.S. dollar before being again converted into loonies to make investments here, or even pay for supplies.""What the hub does is it provides the potential to get a good price,"" says David Watt, the chief economist of HSBC. ""It sets up a way for Canadian businesses to call their local banker and say ""we've got a deal to import Chinese material and we'd like to pay for it in RMB not U.S. dollars.""The hub eventually will allow people on both sides to take out that middle man and convert renminbi directly into Canadian dollars and vice versa.""It should give Canadian businesses the confidence to increase trade.""Watt says China is moving faster on full convertibility of the renminbi and could loosen rules further by the end of the year.The Canadian hub is likely to attract business from Central and South America, as well as the U.S. and Canada, he said in an interview with CBC’s The Exchange with Amanda Lang.""It does create opportunities for Latin American companies to do some of their trading in renminbi through Toronto as well because it’s the same time zone, active pricing, so you no longer have to worry about market dead zones in trading [with] other countries,"" Watt said.It's a huge market that Canadian businesses are eager to be more active in. And the hub could give them a leg up on the billions of dollars that are already flowing between the U.S. and China.""Bilateral trade between China and the U.S. alone is worth more than $550 billion US per year,"" director Michael Burt with the Conference Board of Canada said recently. ""If even a small share of these transactions pass through Canada, they could generate considerable transaction fees for Canadian financial institutions.""""Canadian financial institutions may benefit by providing associated services, such as yuan-denominated accounts, and the issuing of yuan-denominated securities.""​Australia signed a similar deal to become a yuan trading hub in 2013. The two countries have since signed a free trade deal.Next to the U.S., China is Canada's second-largest trading partner, but Canada is only China's 21st-largest, with $77 billion in bilateral trade between the two countries last year. Ottawa says trade between Canada and China supports more than 470,000 jobs in Canada a year, which was about 2.67 per cent of total Canadian jobs.The renminbi has become a major world currency relatively quickly. Roughly a decade ago, it was not widely held outside of China due to strict regulations Beijing imposed on where it could be used. From there, it has grown to be one of the most-traded currencies in the world along with the U.S. dollar, the euro, the yen, the British pound, the Canadian dollar and the Swiss franc."
Miss World Canada denied entry to China for pageant | CBC News,"Miss World Canada was barred from entering China on Thursday to take part in this year's pageant in the southern island province of Hainan, a friend of the outspoken Chinese-Canadian contestant said.",2015-11-26T12:25:30.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/anastasia-lin-miss-world-canada-china-1.3337822,"Canada's outspoken Miss World contestant said she was barred Thursday from entering China to take part in this year's pageant in the southern island province of Hainan.Chinese-born Anastasia Lin said she was unable to board her connecting flight from Hong Kong after a Chinese official told her by telephone that she would not be granted a visa on arrival.Lin, an actress and resident of Toronto, is an outspoken critic of Chinese religious policy and a follower of the Falun Gong meditation practice, which was outlawed by China's ruling Communist Party in 1999.""If they start to censor beauty pageants — how pathetic is that?"" Lin told The Associated Press in Hong Kong.I'm in Hong Kong, but the Chinese government has barred me from getting the next flight to Sanya for Miss World. <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/AfraidOfABeautyQueen?src=hash"">#AfraidOfABeautyQueen</a>In a pre-departure statement, Lin said denying her entry would mean China was trying to prevent her from speaking out about human rights issues.Dressed in black leggings and a belted tan trench coat, Lin was approached by several fellow travellers in the Hong Kong airport arrival hall who wanted to take her photo.Lin, who moved to Canada from China when she was 13, told a U.S. congressional hearing in July that tens of thousands of Falun Gong practitioners have been killed so their organs could be harvested and sold for transplants. The 25-year-old also plays an imprisoned Falun Gong practitioner in an upcoming Canadian movie, The Bleeding Edge.Lin said that after she won the Canadian title, Chinese security agents visited her father who still lives in China in an apparent attempt to intimidate her into silence. Although she hadn't received an invitation letter from organizers, and therefore was unable to obtain a Chinese visa, she said she decided to travel to China anyway in hopes of obtaining a visa on arrival.""The Chinese government has barred me from the competition for political reasons. They are trying to punish me for my beliefs and prevent me from speaking out about human rights issues,"" Lin said in her prepared statement.After landing in Hong Kong early Thursday on a flight from Toronto, Lin was told by airline staff at check-in that she needed to speak to an official in Hainan's provincial capital of Sanya. She said the official, who identified himself only by his surname, Chen, seemed to be attempting to verify her identify. After telling her she wasn't eligible for a visa, the man refused to give a reason then abruptly hung up the phone, she said.""To prevent me from even stepping into Chinese territory, I think this is what they're trying to do. I really don't see where this insecurity comes from,"" Lin told The Associated Press. ""I think that's the real harm when people watch this and learn a negative lesson. I hope people see courage and hope in the story, not simply just being denied."""
Scientific evidence of mythical great flood found in China | CBC News,"Legend says that China's first dynasty, the Xia, began after the sage King Yu tamed the waters of a massive flood that swept away villages and overran mountains. Now, for the first time, scientists have found archeological evidence that the flood may actually have happened.",2016-08-05T14:40:15.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/china-ancient-flood-1.3708724,"A great flood at the dawn of Chinese civilization was said to have swept away settlements, the water rising so high that it overran hills, mountains and even heaven itself. It was the sage King Yu who tamed the waters by building ditches, the legend went, thus earning a mandate to rule and laying the foundation for China's first dynasty, the Xia.But until now, scientists could not pin down evidence that the flood, or Yu, or even the Xia Dynasty ever existed outside of the origin myths passed down through millennia.Now a team of researchers led by Wu Qianlong, a former Peking University seismologist, say in a study published this week in the journal Science that they've indeed found evidence that a flood submerged a vast swath of the country almost 4,000 years ago, possibly lending weight to a longstanding — though controversial — theory that the Xia Dynasty did exist as China's first unified state.""No scientific evidence has been discovered before"" for the legendary flood, Wu told a telephone news conference.Using radiocarbon dating of bones and soil samples along the Yellow River, Wu's team established that an earthquake triggered a huge landslide, damming the waterway in 1920 B.C.The researchers pinpointed the date chemically from the skeletons of children in a group of 14 victims found crushed downstream, apparently when their home collapsed in the earthquake.The researchers deduced that for six to nine months about 15 trillion litres (4 trillion gallons) of water built up behind a wall of rock and dirt — about half the size of Lake Mead behind Hoover Dam — near Jishi Gorge in today's Qinghai Province. When the dam broke, it tore through the gorge at 500 times the Yellow River's average discharge and submerged the North China Plain that is considered the cradle of Chinese civilization.The flood on Asia's third-longest river would have been among the worst anywhere in the world in the last 10,000 years and matches tales of a ""Great Flood"" that marks the start of Chinese civilisation with the Xia dynasty.The flood would have predated by several centuries the first written records kept on oracle bones. Historical texts from about 1,000 B.C. first mentioned a legendary Xia ruler, Yu, who had devised a system of dredges to control a great flood that spanned generations. He was said to have been based around Jishi Gorge, according to various texts, and his ability to combat natural disasters and earn a heavenly mandate to rule established him as a model for generations of subsequent Chinese rulers.His legend was later immortalized in some of the best-known historical texts of Chinese antiquity, including the Bamboo Annals of 300 B.C., and the Records of the Grand Historian by the Han Dynasty court official Sima Qian in 94 B.C. But the legend has been hotly debated in modern times.Over the past century, China scholars have doubted whether the Xia truly existed, or whether it was truly an expansive, unified state rather than simply many smaller states that were mish-mashed together by ancient Chinese political thinkers to justify a tradition of centralized power.The evidence of a massive flood in line with the legend ""provides us with a tantalizing hint that the Xia dynasty might really have existed,"" said David Cohen of National Taiwan University, one of the authors.In the 1980s, archaeologists discovered buildings and bronze remains at Erlitou village in Henan Province that were carbon dated to about 1900 B.C.

The United States has said it is willing to negotiate with the North if the country commits to get rid of its nuclear weapons, which Pyongyang has refused to do.The U.S. Department of Justice is preparing as early as this week to announce legal action against Chinese firms suspected of providing financial assistance to Pyongyang, the Journal reported, citing officials familiar with the matter.The report said DoJ prosecutors visited Beijing twice last month to make their Chinese counterparts aware of alleged criminal activities being committed by Hongxiang Industrial. It said police in Liaoning, the northeastern border province of China, had started a probe into the firm's alleged long-term involvement in ""serious economic crimes.""Certain assets related to the company, its founder and top executive Ma Xiaohong, and some of her relatives and associates, have been frozen by the Chinese authorities in recent weeks, according to the government and corporate filings cited in the report.Representatives of the U.S. Department of Justice, Chinese Government and Hongxiang Industrial were unavailable for immediate comment. The White House said Obama and Li also discussed in New York the U.S.-China economic relationship and its importance to the global economy.""The President encouraged China to accelerate its continuing efforts to address industrial excess capacity, foster an environment conducive to innovation, and advance an orderly transition to a market-determined exchange rate,"" the statement said.It said Obama also urged Beijing to establish a level playing field for all firms to compete fairly in China and that he and Li discussed the importance of achieving progress in negotiation of a U.S.-China Bilateral Investment Treaty and of a World Trade Organization Environmental Goods Agreement.The statement added that the two leaders discussed climate issues and pledged to continue working toward bringing the Paris agreement into force as early as possible and to reach a market-based measure to reduce international aviation emissions."

We will do everything we can to support her in this difficult time.""SARFT's edict also excludes the actress from Chinese awards shows as well as the producers of the film.  In addition, discussions about the film and Tang on web forums have been deleted, according to Hong Kong newspaper Oriental Daily.The move comes just as the Asian Film Awards announced that Tang would be a presenter.  It's not known whether the awards, set for March 17 in Hong Kong, will be affected by the decree.Chinese authorities have been exercising stricter controls over film, media and the web over the past few years.They have banned talent shows, cosmetic programs and any shows deemed to be overtly pornographic or sexual on television and radio.Recently, they limited the broadcast of foreign cartoons on primetime television as well as anything that touches upon horror, crime and the supernatural in film.

Justin Trudeau acknowledges Canadian human rights issues as China trip ends | CBC News,"Prime Minister Justin Trudeau wrapped up his time in China today by sharing details of his meetings with President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Keqiang, saying he acknowledged criticisms of Canada's human rights.",2016-09-06T05:31:40.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/trudeau-hong-kong-cemetery-war-dead-1.3749280,"When Justin Trudeau raised concerns directly with China's political elite about their human-rights record, he says he also acknowledged that Canada isn't perfect.The prime minister shared more details Tuesday about his high-level talks last week with Beijing, sessions that included face time with President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Keqiang.Trudeau told a business luncheon in Hong Kong that he brought up his concerns in those meetings, ranging from consular cases, rule of law, governance and corruption.""(I) talked about the challenges, but also talked about the fact that Canada is not immune to criticisms on human rights, either,"" he said during an on-stage interview during the event, hosted by the Canadian Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong.""The perspective that a lot of countries have is, 'Well, you know, foreign countries or foreign observers shouldn't be criticizing what are internal matters to us.""'He said he pointed out how a United Nations rapporteur put out a ""scathing report"" a few years ago on Canada's treatment of Indigenous Peoples, of missing and murdered aboriginal women and girls and other challenges.Trudeau's Hong Kong event came on the last day of his eight-day official visit to China, a trip that also included stops in Beijiing, Shanghai and Hangzhou for the Group of 20 leaders' summit.His primary goal of the visit was to strengthen commercial ties with the Chinese regime. He repeated his argument Tuesday that Ottawa's connection to China was ""hot and cold"" when the Conservatives were in power.With Canada struggling through an extended period of weak growth, the government sees expanding the relationship with China — the world's second-largest economy — as a key to helping the economy.But getting tighter with China poses challenges at home. Trudeau has had to address widespread concerns about the Chinese regime's handling of human rights.On Tuesday, his interviewer asked him how he balances the two.She noted, for example, that public opinion polls have suggested Canadians are cool to the idea of pursuing free trade with the Asian superpower.""I don't know if I like the word balance because balance does make it sound like you're making a trade-off,"" Trudeau replied.""I don't think you have to choose, I think you have to be very up front and frank about doing that in a very thoughtful, respectful way, but in a constructive way.""Politics NewsHis appearance Tuesday in Hong Kong followed a landmark election result in the southern Chinese city over the weekend that saw a group of young pro-democracy activists win seats in the local legislature.The activists, who helped lead huge pro-democracy street protests two years ago, intend to change the rules on how the city is governed by China's leaders. It could set off a fresh showdown with Beijing.Asked how Canada might engage with China on behalf of Hong Kong, Trudeau was cautious.""I'm going to use a line that I've been able to use a few times regarding our neighbours to the south: Canada will work with whoever gets elected and forms government in foreign jurisdictions,"" he said.Trudeau says Canada will work with whoever is elected in foreign government (crowd laughs as he makes Trump joke).Andrew Work, editor-in-chief of Hong Kong's Harbour Times, said it is ""hugely important"" that Trudeau was in the city shortly after the election to see its vibrant democracy first hand.""Canada is an influential nation with 300,000 Canadians living in Hong Kong,"" said Work, a Canadian who has lived in the Chinese city for 20 years.When it comes to working with China, this week Trudeau left the door open to allowing more investment from the country's state-owned enterprises.On Monday, he said he would listen if China raises its long-held concerns with him over Canada's restrictions on investment by foreign, state-owned enterprises. He elaborated on the topic Tuesday.""We need to draw in global investment as a way of being able to properly develop our resources in ways that are going to create a lot of jobs in Canada,"" Trudeau said during the on-stage exchange with Bloomberg TV anchor Angie Lau.""Yes, we have to think about it in terms of what are the benefits, what are the labour standards, what are the environmental impacts?. But I don't think that anyone can imagine that we would do better by closing ourselves off from the world.""Earlier Tuesday, Trudeau visited the mountainside Sai Wan War Cemetery to pay homage to Canadian soldiers who died after fighting to defend Hong Kong from a Japanese invasion during the Second World War.There are 283 Canadians buried at the cemetery, 107 of whom were never identified.Trudeau also met with billionaire businessman Li Ka-shing, chairman of CK Hutchison Holdings, to discuss investment opportunities at his cavernous office on the 70th floor of a Hong Kong tower.The prime minister also held a meeting with Leung Chun-ying, chief executive of Hong Kong, at his residence.Politics News"

They just told us they were following orders from the minister of state security,"" Wang told As It Happens host Carol Off.""This is more agonizing than not giving me the visa at all. It just feels extremely insulting and almost purposeful.""Wang's father is Wang Bingzhang, a pro-democracy activist who got his doctorate at McGill University in the 1980s.He was abducted by Chinese agents during a trip to Vietnam in 2002 and sentenced to life in prison on espionage and terrorism charges.She last saw him in 2008. When she tried to visit him the following year on a visa, she was denied entry to the country, and has been fighting to get back to him ever since. Then last year, she finally broke through the red tape, securing a visa on compassionate grounds.But that was before the arrest of a Chinese telecommunications executive in Vancouver on Dec. 1 sent Canadian-Chinese relations spiralling.Meng Wanzhou, the CFO of Huawei, was arrested last month at the request of the United States, which wants her extradited to face fraud charges.China has since detained two Canadians, Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, accusing them of endangering China's national security, in a move widely seen as retribution for Meng.""It must be a factor in the decision making,"" Wang said of the diplomatic tensions. ""But at the same time, this exact situation happened to me in 2009.""Global Affairs Canada says it is providing consular assistance to Wang, but noted in an emailed statement that ""every country or territory decides who can enter or exit through its borders.""""Our former parliamentary secretary has met with Wang Bingzhang's family to discuss his case, and we remain in contact with the family,"" spokesperson Guillaume Berube said. Wang said she spent the past few months arranging the trip, hoping to introduce her father to his 11-month-old granddaughter.""This was supposed to be the first time that I see my father after 10 years,"" she said.""I had imagined a very profound moment where I could be in a room with my father and my brother and my daughter.""And he was expecting her, she said.Wang wrote him a letter about her plans, she said, and her half sister told him about the visa during a visit in December. ""The whole point was to lift his spirits, and I feel like this will just crush him,"" Wang said.""Another part of me just feels really terrible about all this because my father doesn't get visits very often. He only sees family members once or twice a year, and I can only assume that he was looking forward to this as much as I was.""Wang said she worries this was her last chance to see her father.The 71-year-old has served most of his sentence in solitary confinement, where she says he has suffered several strokes, asthma attacks and declining mental health.""The first thought that I had when they told me that I wasn't going to be able to go was I just wondered if I would ever see my father again,"" she said.""I have to believe that I will.""Written by Sheena Goodyear.

And in 2007, they moved to Dandong, a city near the North Korean border where they ran a popular coffee shop. ""We would get people from embassies who were in North Korea.

What they didn't know at the time was that the dinner was a set up.""We got to the restaurant, the couple met us and the daughter wasn't there.

And finally they said, 'Well you're accused of being a spy and we want to investigate.'""Julia and Kevin were each held in solitary confinement for the next six months.

China's Gobi Desert source of rare dinosaur find | CBC News,"Left on their own by adults, a group of young dinosaurs sank into the mud beside a lake and died 90 million years ago in what would become the Gobi Desert, scientists said Monday.",2009-03-16T12:43:52.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/china-s-gobi-desert-source-of-rare-dinosaur-find-1.818867,"Left on their own by adults, a group of young dinosaurs sank into the mud beside a lake and died 90 million years ago in what would become the Gobi Desert, scientists said Monday.The well-preserved fossils, excavated by a team of Chinese and American scientists, offer a rare bounty of clues about how this herd of ostrich-like sinornithomimus lived — and died.Two life-sized models of the sinornithomimus were put on public display for the first time Monday in Hohhot, capital of north China's Inner Mongolia region.""This is a very exciting discovery, because 99.9 per cent of the time, we find a group of skeletons that died at different periods due to unknown causes,"" said Paul Sereno, a University of Chicago professor on the excavation team. ""The other 0.1 per cent of the time, scientists consider themselves lucky to find small herds that have been well-preserved after floods or volcanic eruptions, similar to that of Pompeii.""Italy's famous city of Pompeii was buried — its way of life frozen in time — in the volcanic eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD.Sereno, a paleontologist, helped lead the 2001 expedition that uncovered the fossilized remains of the 25 young sinornithomimus near Suhongtu, a tiny, remote village in the Gobi Desert about 600 kilometres west of Hohhot.The position of the dinosaur bones suggests they were looking for water on the edge of a lake, got stuck and died as the mud engulfed them, Sereno said in a telephone interview. Their hip bones were found at odd angles, indicating scavengers tugged at their carcasses. Crablike organisms were also found surrounding the skeletons, a clue that tells scientists they were covered in water shortly after death, which helped preserve them.Tan Xinwei, a paleontologist from the Inner Mongolia Department of Land and Resources who also worked on the expedition, said the findings tell researchers that ""the youngsters were left to fend for themselves while the adults were preoccupied"" with hatching eggs or building nests.The two-legged, feathered dinosaurs reached about 1.2 metres tall as adults and scavenged for small plants by jutting out their long necks in an ostrich-like fashion, Sereno said.Xu Xing, a professor at the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology in Beijing, called the findings ""an important discovery"" that could only have happened under a unique set of circumstances.""Without the correct environmental conditions, these fossils would not have been found in nearly pristine condition — uncrushed or worn down,"" said Xu, who was not involved with the project.The bones were spotted in 1978 by a Chinese geologist and first excavated by a Sino-Japanese team some 20 years later. That team named the dinosaurs sinornithomimus, or ""Chinese bird mimic.""It wasn't until 2001 that researchers were able to unearth all 25 skeletons and examine their findings.The sinornithomimus skeletons were brought to the University of Chicago for research and preservation but will return to China by the end of the year.The 10-member expedition and research team included scientists from the University of Chicago, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Montana State University, the University of Michigan and Inner Mongolia's Department of Land and Resources. It was financed by the National Geographic Society."
"Big Brother collecting big data — and in China, it's all for sale | CBC News","Inside China's Great Firewall, the internet is designed to gather information. And there's an industry of private and state-owned high-tech enterprises serving it.",2017-01-11T10:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/china-data-for-sale-privacy-1.3927137,"Living in China, it's safe to assume pretty much everything about you is known — or easily can be known — by the government. Where you go, who you're with, which restaurants you like, when and why you see your doctor.Big Brother doesn't even need to be watching with his own eyes.There is an entire network — the internet inside China's Great Firewall — designed to gather the information. And there's an industry of private and state-owned high-tech enterprises serving it.""You could go so far as to make the argument that social media and digital technology are actually supporting the regime,"" says Ronald Deibert, the director of The Citizen Lab, a group of researchers at the University of Toronto's Munk School of Global Affairs. They study how information technology affects human and personal rights around the world.The lab has taken apart popular apps like WeChat, a messaging app that also does financial transactions designed specifically for the Chinese market by private software giant Tencent. It's used by more than 800 million people here every month — virtually every Chinese person who is online.Deibert's team found it contains various hidden means of censorship and surveillance. Among other things, the restrictions follow Chinese students who study abroad.Chinese authorities ""have a wealth of data at their disposal about what individuals are doing at a micro level in ways that they never had before,"" Deibert says.""What the government has managed to do, I think quite successfully, is download the controls to the private sector, to make it incumbent upon them to police their own networks,"" he says.And now it seems, the data these firms collect is for sale.An investigation by a leading Chinese newspaper, the Guangzhou Southern Metropolis Daily, found that just a little cash could buy incredible amounts of information about almost anyone. Friend or fiancé, business competitor or enemy … no questions asked.Using just the personal ID number of a colleague, reporters bought detailed data about hotels stayed at, flights and trains taken, border entry and exit records, real estate transactions and bank records. All of them with dates, times and scans of documents (for an extra fee, the seller could provide the names of who the colleague stayed with at hotels and rented apartments).All confirmed by the colleague. And all for the low price of 700 yuan, or about $140 Cdn.Another service provided live tracking of a colleague using his mobile phone, sending pinpoint locations in real time. This too was surprisingly accurate.There are countless ads for services like these online, and some seem more reliable than others. But the reporters at the Southern Metropolis Daily had no trouble getting solid, confirmed information.Much of the data seems to come from companies like telecom providers and hotels. But some is likely only available from government sources, information on driving infractions and border crossings.In all cases, it seems the data is routinely collected, sorted and cross-referenced — and almost certainly tracked by government officials.In fact, Beijing recently unveiled an ambitious plan to assign every citizen a so-called ""social credit"" score. Modeled on the score banking institutions give for your financial reliability, this one would measure your social ""trustworthiness"" using data collected from every online interaction.Every picture posted, every comment made, every driving infraction or incident of rowdiness would go into a central database that would spit out a single number that would determine how far you could be trusted to hold a job or travel or even get married.That raises the question, would that massive database also be publicly available?The approach is a far cry from what many Western governments still consider an appropriate balance between privacy and ""national security,"" the vague catch-all phrase that China's Communist leaders use to justify crackdowns against anything that they consider politically threatening.  ""I would say it's a very big issue,"" says The Citizen Lab's Deibert. ""It is in contrast to the data minimization philosophy – collect only what you need and keep it for only as long as you need to use it, then delete, delete, delete.""Technically, privacy is protected by the constitution and the law in China, but when the Southern Metropolis Daily contacted the police with the results of its investigation, there was no comment.In a system where every citizen's information is collected and traded at every level — in an apparent data free-for-all that involves government officials as well as so many private corporations — it's hard to tell who isn't allowed to know."

Then in the fourth year, students will finish their training at MSVU. ""While we're doing those three years in China, a significant number of courses have to be taught by Canadian faculty,"" said Michael Whalen, a business, tourism, and hospitality management professor at Mount Saint Vincent. Whalen helped setup the joint degree program. ""At full operation we'll actually teach in China each year 17 courses. We're looking at a considerable investment in time, faculty and resources to do this.""     Those courses will be taught online by Mount Saint Vincent professors for eight weeks. Those professors will then be expected to go to China and teach classes in person for a minimum of two weeks. ""Part of their interest in this is having their students in front of a 'real Canadian professor',"" said Whalen. ""Learning how to learn in a Canadian classroom and a western classroom, listening to the language, being able to practice their own English, asking questions — these kinds of things.""    The Mount has permission from the Chinese government to recruit 100 students per year into the program which launches in September. Whalen said the university hopes the new joint degree will strengthen its overall tourism program and attract new students. ""We see this as a way of working in part to replace those Canadian students that aren't going to be there because of the demographic issues in Atlantic Canada and the fewer number of students graduating from our high schools.""     In the long term, the program could also help bolster tourism to the province as Chinese students arrive to study in Nova Scotia, said Whalen.  ""This is going to be a tremendous asset for us. These people will hopefully have been impressed by their stay here, by the quality of the tourism infrastructure that we have in the province and they'll be the ones running programs, running companies in China and think, 'oh yeah, why don't we send a plane load of tourists to Nova Scotia'.""      ""I think there are huge spin offs here,"" said Whalen. "

""What I also tried to suggest is that I understand there are consequences from his freedom of speech and we will have to live with those consequences.""Among those consequences: CCTV said it would not show the games between the Los Angeles Lakers and Brooklyn Nets, who will play Thursday in Shanghai and Saturday in Shenzhen. Basketball is wildly popular in China and those two teams — largely because of LeBron James starring for the Lakers and Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba's co-founder Joe Tsai now owning the Nets — almost certainly would have been a huge television draw.""We're strongly dissatisfied and oppose Adam Silver's claim to support Morey's right to freedom of expression,"" CCTV said in a statement. ""We believe that any remarks that challenge national sovereignty and social stability are not within the scope of freedom of speech.""The broadcaster is also reviewing all its cooperation and exchanges involving the NBA, said the statement posted to CCTV Sports' official social media account.The NBA is not the first major corporation to deal with criticism from China over political differences. Mercedes-Benz, Delta Air Lines, hotel operator Marriott, fashion brand Zara and others also have found themselves in conflicts with China in recent years.Silver is going to Shanghai on Wednesday and said he hopes to meet with officials and some of the league's business partners there in an effort to find some sort of common ground. He said he hopes Chinese officials and fans look at the totality of the impact of the three-decade-plus relationship between the league and their country, and urged them to see his response while acknowledging there are political differences between the countries.""I'm sympathetic to our interests here and our partners that are upset,"" Silver said. ""I don't think it's inconsistent on one hand to be sympathetic to them and at the same time stand by our principles.""Silver said the NBA did not expect CCTV to cancel plans to show the Lakers-Nets games. ""But if those are the consequences of us adhering to our values, I still feel it's very, very important to adhere to those values,"" Silver said.The rift between China and the NBA started late last week when Morey tweeted a now-deleted image that read: ""Fight for Freedom. Stand with Hong Kong,"" in reference to months of pro-democracy demonstrations in the semiautonomous Chinese territory that has been mired in escalating violence between protesters and law enforcement.Efforts were quickly made to defuse the impact; Rockets owner Tilman Fertitta said Morey does not speak for the Rockets, and Morey returned to Twitter on Monday in an effort to clarify his meaning. But damage was clearly done: At least one Chinese sporting goods company said it was no longer cooperating with the Rockets, NBA streaming partner Tencent — which has a $1.5 billion contract with the league over the next five seasons — said it would not show Rockets games and a sports news website in China said it was no longer covering the team.Further complicating the matter is this: China's best-known basketball player is Hall of Famer Yao Ming, who spent his NBA career with the Rockets. Yao is now the president of the Chinese Basketball Association, which has said it is suspending its relationship with the Rockets as part of the response to Morey's tweet. The CBA also canceled plans to have the G League affiliates from Houston and Dallas play preseason games in China later this month.""I'm hoping that together Yao Ming and I can find an accommodation,"" Silver said. ""But he is extremely hot at the moment, and I understand it.""A ceremonial NBA Cares event for an educational centre in Shanghai with the Nets was canceled Tuesday, though the Nets participated in other events as scheduled. The Lakers were arriving there Tuesday. Silver said NBA Cares would still honor its bigger mission surrounding that event, including providing a gift of new computers.""How can it be possible to carry out exchanges and cooperation with China without knowing China's public opinion?"" Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman Geng Shuang said Tuesday. ""NBA's cooperation with China has been going on for quite a long time, so for what should be said and what should be done, they know best.""Silver also released a statement before his news conference, saying ""those who question our motivation"" should know that the NBA's stance is about more than business. Many U.S. lawmakers have called for the league to take action — some even suggesting the games in China should be canceled by the NBA.""We are not apologizing for Daryl exercising his freedom of expression,"" Silver said. ""I regret — again, having communicated directly with many friends in China — that so many people are upset, including millions and millions of our fans. At the end of the day, we come with basketball as an opportunity to sell dreams, sell hopes ... that we are causing disruption in people's lives and that we are causing disharmony, that's something I regret."""
Translating her stepmother's essays on China's Cultural Revolution revealed a lost history to Madeleine Thien | CBC Radio,"The author of Do Not Say We Have Nothing discusses Katherine Lou’s memoir, The Unceasing Storm.",2018-06-18T14:00:17.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/radio/thenextchapter/full-episode-june-18-2018-1.4704378/translating-her-stepmother-s-essays-on-china-s-cultural-revolution-revealed-a-lost-history-to-madeleine-thien-1.4709218,"A few years ago, Katherine Luo published a book of essays in China, about living in China during the Cultural Revolution. The Unceasing Storm: Memories of the Chinese Cultural Revolution has now been translated into English, thanks to Luo's stepdaughter, the writer Madeleine Thien. In 2016, Thien won the Governor General's Literary Award for fiction and the Scotiabank Giller Prize for her novel, Do Not Say We Have Nothing.""Katherine is, or was, the partner of my father, who passed away in December 2017. It's been quite emotional working with her through the final process of putting the book into the world. The Cultural Revolution was the culmination of politically strict campaigns that targeted different classes of society in China. In The Unceasing Storm, Katherine describes what happened to her during these years, first as a university student, then as a singer and performer in the Central Academy of Drama and the Red Army Opera Troupe. As the political repression intensified in force, Katherine and many of her colleagues were also sent to re-education camps. She tells the story of China in the 1980s — how what she hoped for her country was dashed during the 1989 Tiananmen demonstrations and the massacre outside of Tiananmen Square.""""Katherine and I spent a long time talking about the beliefs she held as a young woman and the pain of having to reassess everything she had believed in. She recounts what happened when ideology took over this very idealistic generation — a generation of young people who were really committed to sacrificing whatever it took to create a more just society. My feeling is that she wrote The Unceasing Storm because she understood that she was growing older and that this generation was passing. What they had seen and heard, what they had tried to create — was being lost to the rewriting of history that is so present in 20th-century China.""Madeleine Thien's comments have been edited and condensed.  "

It is projected to grow to $100 billion.Japan and the U.S., which wield much of the power in the World Bank and Asian Development Bank, opted not to invest. Canada also demurred.The U.S. government had objected that the bank would undercut existing institutions such as the World Bank and might allow looser lending standards.But much of the West and Southeast Asia ignored U.S. objections and is on board, including Australia, Britain, Germany and South Korea.Representatives of 50 countries took part in a signing ceremony for the AIIB in Beijing on Monday, while an additional seven nations, such as the Philippines and Thailand, attended as they are still negotiating on the issue.China, which believes its weight on the international stage does not match its economic importance, hopes the new bank will grow to the stature of the Asian Development Bank and World Bank.The plan is that money from the AIIB will be loaned to build ports, roads and cities throughout Asia, and that China's engineering firms will bid on the work, expanding their global expertise.Lou Jiwei, China's minister of finance, called the launch of the AIIB a ""win-win for Asia"" at the bank's signing ceremony, saying he thought the bank would start operating toward the end of the year.China has the largest voting share on the bank's board — 20.06 per cent – giving it potential veto power on projects.India will be the second-biggest shareholder with a possible 10-15 per cent stake, while Russia and Germany are the third and fourth biggest member states.The AIIB will be a test of China's ability to run a multilateral organizationUntil now, China has tried to build its sphere of influence by throwing money around, as in Africa, or using threats, as in Southeast Asia.But running  a transparent, socially conscious development bank that promises to meet the shortfall in Asian infrastructure funding will take a more subtle approach.China will have to work with many other institutions and levels of government and create approvals processes that aren't hampered by bureaucracy.Jin Liqun, a former Chinese deputy finance minister, is to lead the bank until a CEO is formally appointed."

Canada-China currency deal expected to sharply increase trade | CBC News,"Canada and China have signed a reciprocal currency deal aimed at fostering far easier trade between the Canadian dollar and the Chinese yuan, also known as the renminbi.

It makes Canada the first country in the Americas to have a deal to trade in the renminbi.The signing of the deal was announced in Beijing today by Premier Li Keqiang and Prime Minister Stephen Harper.""It's a great boon for the Canadian business community, both importers and exporters, because they can now do business in China with the currency and not have to go through multiple financial exchange transactions,"" Stewart Beck, president and CEO of the Asia Pacific Foundation of Canada, told CBC News.""So the pundits are saying it could double maybe even triple the level of Canadian trade between Canada and China,"" he said.Authorized by China's central bank, the deal will allow direct business between the Canadian dollar and the Chinese yuan, cutting out the middle man — in most cases, the U.S. dollar.Canadian exporters forced to use the American currency to do business in China are faced with higher currency exchange costs and longer waits to close deals.""It's something the prime minister has been talking about. He wants Canadian companies, particularly small- and medium-sized businesses, doing more and more work in China, selling goods and services there,"" said CBC's Catherine Cullen, reporting from Beijing.Jason Henderson, head of global banking for HSBC Canada, calls the deal great news for Canada, given that China is the second largest economy in the world after the U.S.If Canada is to maintain the standard of living that it enjoys today, he adds, it needs to tap into the Chinese market. The currency deal is the first step on that path.The prime minister raised his concerns about the three-month imprisonment of Kevin and Julia Garratt with Premier Li during a closed-door meeting at the ornate Great Hall of the People, a spokesman for Harper said.Harper didn't reiterate those concerns publicly when Li, the second most powerful man in China, was asked about the fate of the Garratts during a post-meeting news conference.""We have discussed a full range of issues in our bilateral relationship in a frank, open and friendly manner,"" Harper said in remarks to the media.Li, meantime, said they ""talked about the rule of law and human rights.""As for the Garratts, the premier added: ""As for individual cases, I want to reiterate that as China continues to build a country under the rule of law, I believe that judicial authorities should be able to handle cases in accordance with the law.""The Garratts have lived and worked in China for 30 years and were running a coffee shop near the North Korean border when they were detained in August on suspicion of spying. They haven't been charged but have been repeatedly interrogated.Their son, Simeon, was in China in recent days, timing his visit to Harper's. He has demanded the Chinese release his parents, but said he hasn't been able to glean much new information about their plight, nor has he been allowed to visit them.""If there's anybody out there that's going to be able to help my parents, it's him,"" Garratt told CTV, referring to Harper.The Canadian government hasn't formally demanded the release of the Garratts.But the couple's detention was among a series of irritants between Canada and China that almost scrubbed Harper's third visit to the country. The Chinese detained the Garratts just days after Canadian officials publicly accused them of cyber-espionage.Harper's trip to China, his third official visit, has largely focused on trade and economic issues.During meetings Saturday, Canada and China signed more than 20 commercial deals, valued at more than $1 billion.Among the biggest agreements signed includes a deal for Bombardier to sell more than $1 billion in aircraft to China Express Airlines. An Air Canada-Air China joint venture is also valued at more than half a billion dollars.The Prime Minister's Office said in a statement the deals ""are a testament to the significant growth taking place in the bilateral commercial relationship.""""Several sectors stand to benefit from these agreements, including sustainable technologies, aerospace, transportation, construction, mining, energy, infrastructure, agri-food, and information and communications technologies sectors,"" the statement said.It said trade between Canada and China supports more than 470,000 jobs in Canada a year, which was about 2.67 per cent of total Canadian jobs in 2013.A look at some of the other agreements and initiatives announced during Stephen Harper's visit to China:  "

U.K. tolls out red carpet for China's President Xi Jinping | CBC News,"Chinese President Xi Jinping hails the ""bright future"" of closer relations with Britain, addressing lawmakers as part of a pomp-laden visit during which about $60 billion in deals are expected to be signed.",2015-10-20T11:19:47.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/china-uk-jinping-tuesday-1.3279622,"Chinese President Xi Jinping on Tuesday hailed the ""bright future"" of closer relations with Britain, addressing lawmakers as part of a pomp-laden visit during which trade deals worth about $60 billion are expected to be signed.Britain rolled out the red carpet for Xi, who was honoured with a 41-gun salute and given a ride in a gilded carriage with Queen Elizabeth before addressing lawmakers from both Houses of Parliament.A few dozen protesters calling on Prime Minister David Cameron to raise human rights with Xi were outnumbered by the thousands of China supporters thronging The Mall, one of London's most famous avenues, as Xi rode with the Queen for a private lunch.""China-U.K. relations will certainly embrace an even brighter future,"" Xi, 62, told assembled lawmakers including Cameron and opposition Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn. His words were translated into English.""It is fair to say that China and the U.K. are increasingly interdependent and are becoming a community of shared interests,"" said Xi, who quoted Chinese proverbs, William Shakespeare and English statesman Francis Bacon in his speech.Xi's welcome was steeped in pageantry, underlining the growing importance of China to Britain: Cameron hopes the visit will cement a lucrative place for Britain as Beijing's closest friend in the West.Hailed as the start of a ""golden era"" in Sino-British relations, the visit, which will seal £30 billion ($60.2 billion Cdn) in deals, has been criticized by activists who accuse Cameron of turning a blind eye to rights abuses.It has also ruffled feathers among some of Britain's traditional allies, such as the United States, where Xi's visit last month was tainted by friction over cyber-theft and Beijing's moves in Asian maritime disputes.Police made sure the few dozen protesters had little chance of disrupting a carefully choreographed ceremony which included Xi accompanying the Duke of Edinburgh, the Queen's husband, to inspect the guard of honour before leading the procession.Those protesting against China's human rights record were kept far from the procession, with their banners all but eclipsed by ""I Love China"" flags.Shouting ""Don't trade away human rights"" and ""China: Buying U.K.'s silence on Tibet,"" protesters expressed support for the Falun Gong, the spiritual sect banned as a cult in China, and called for independence for the people of Tibet.Others took aim at what they called Xi's crackdown on civil liberties since he took power in 2012. The visit ""shows that England is not giving a damn about human rights,"" said Aisha Nahmmacher, 24, from south London.But they were drowned out by supporters who banged drums and held portraits of Xi as they took photographs outside Buckingham Palace, where Xi and his wife will stay as guests of the Queen.For Britain, the four-day state visit is the culmination of a three-year charm offensive to attract investment in infrastructure, nuclear power and the government's planned transformation of northern England.One deal expected to be signed during Xi's visit is a plan for two state-owned Chinese utilities to invest in a £16 billion ($32.1 billion Cdn) nuclear power project being built by French utility EDF at Hinkley Point in southwest England.Britain said more than £30 billion ($60.2 billion Cdn) worth of deals would be signed during the visit, creating some 3,900 jobs.Britain has won praise from China for its discretion in dealing with human rights issues by raising them behind the scenes, a policy London says is more effective than hectoring Beijing publicly.A visit to China last month by finance minister George Osborne sealed the deal, with influential Chinese tabloid the Global Times praising his ""etiquette.""Cameron has said he will not duck sensitive issues such as the impact of cheap Chinese imports on struggling British steel-makers, however, and main Labour leader Corbyn has promised to raise rights when he meets Xi on Tuesday.Xi may express China's hopes that the European Union remains united — a thorny subject for Cameron, who has pledged to renegotiate Britain's relationship with the European Union before a referendum to be held by the end of 2017.But any such sour notes, including Prince Charles's decision to not attend a state banquet, are unlikely to spoil a visit that has been long in the making.Britain was the top destination for Chinese investment in 2014, according to law firm Baker & McKenzie. This year, it became the first Western nation to join the China-led Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank after Washington had pressed allies not to join.In a pointed commentary before Xi's arrival in Britain, Global Times suggested that critics were jealous. ""Apparently the concept of a 'golden era' between the two countries has made some people uncomfortable,"" it said in an editorial.""This has hurt the twisted dignity of those who still consider the West the centre of the world."""
Trudeau pushing free trade deal with EU at G20 summit in China | CBC News,Concerns about the impact of protectionist sentiments on key Canadian trade talks led senior government members to dedicate some of their scarce face time to the issue Sunday with G20 peers.,2016-09-04T12:45:45.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/canada-g20-summit-opens-1.3747937,"Concerns about the impact of protectionist sentiments on key Canadian trade talks led senior government members to dedicate some of their scarce face time to the issue Sunday with G20 peers.With the two-day summit taking place after Britain's vote in June to exit the European Union and before the U.S. presidential election in November, observers expect G20 leaders to mount a defence of free trade and globalization and warn against isolationism.Prime Minister Justin Trudeau himself was expected to discuss the subject when he met with European leaders on the margins of the G20 leaders' summit in China, International Trade Minister Chrystia Freeland said.Freeland, who is also in Hangzhou, noted that growing movements against trade liberalization have complicated always-delicate talks with the United States on softwood lumber.These attitudes, she added, have also affected Canada's push to sign a free trade deal with the European Union, also known as CETA.""The prime minister is using his time here — it's very valuable, lots of European countries [are] of course members of the G20 — to push for CETA to get it over the finish line,"" said Freeland.Trade lawyer Larry Herman, of Herman and Associates, who is following the softwood trade talks said in an email Sunday that pockets of CETA opposition in various countries ""seem to be gaining strength.""Herman said softwood talks have been further complicated by the fact the existing agreement expires Oct. 15 — right in the middle of the U.S. election campaign.He believes Ottawa should work towards an extension until 2017, because finalizing a deal in the campaign would become politically charged.​Canada's chief negotiator in the softwood talks recently said the two sides remain far apart on several key issues.Freeland said she discussed the issue Sunday in Hangzhou with U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman and expects to meet him again in about 10 days. She said the sides are engaged in detailed negotiations.Trudeau, who took part in the official opening events Sunday with fellow G20 leaders, used the summit as a way to convey his message about the need for freer trade.He warned a crowd at a G20-related event Saturday that isolationism does nothing to create economic growth.Earlier Sunday, Trudeau held a bilateral meeting with President Idriss Deby Itno of Chad, chair of the African Union.The leaders discussed deepening their countries' ties, security issues, women's rights and Canada's interest in engaging more in Africa, said a statement released by Trudeau's office.Chinese President Xi Jinping also said the global economy is being threatened by rising protectionism and risks from highly leveraged financial markets at the opening of the G20 summit.His warning on Sunday followed bilateral talks with Barack Obama that the U.S. president described as ""extremely productive,"" but which failed to bring both sides closer on thornier topics such as tensions in the South China Sea.The global economy has arrived ""at a crucial juncture,"" Xi said, in the face of sluggish demand, volatile financial markets and feeble trade and investment.""Growth drivers from the previous round of technological progress are gradually fading, while a new round of technological and industrial revolution has yet to gain momentum,"" he said.G20 countries are set to agree in a communique at the end of the summit that all policy measures — including monetary, fiscal  and structural reforms — should be used to achieve solid and sustainable economic growth, Japanese Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Koichi Hagiuda said.""Commitment will be made to utilizing all three policy tools of monetary and fiscal policies and structural reforms to achieve solid, sustainable, balanced and inclusive growth,"" Hagiuda told reporters on the sidelines of the summit.Xi also called on G20 countries to match their words with actions.""We should turn the G20 group into an action team, instead of a talk shop,"" he said.But some of the G20 leaders have begun drawing battle lines in disputes over issues ranging from trade and investment to tax policy and industrial overcapacity."

South Korea has announced it found parasites in Chinese kimchi. Health and welfare officials are calling for the tightening of food safety rules. It's the latest salvo in a kimchi crisis that has gripped the two Asian nations since last month, when South Korea banned kimchi imports from China after finding parasites normally found in human feces in Chinese brands. China, in turn, banned some South Korean food products. Kimchi is made by fermenting cabbage with radishes, red pepper, garlic and ginger. Chinese Foreign Minister Li Zhaoxing called for calm Friday, saying kimchi was his favourite dish because it was healthy. He said the dispute could be solved with some ""flexibility and creativity."" The Korea Food and Drug Administration said Thursday it had discovered parasite eggs in 16 brands of kimchi from China. The products accounted for almost five per cent of the kimchi market in South Korea. The tainted kimchi contained the eggs of roundworm, normally found in dogs and cats. Restaurants in South Korea are now sporting signs stating they do not use kimchi from China. But others say they prefer the Chinese brands because they cost only one-quarter of the Korean brands. Kimchi imports from China are up 30 per cent for the first 10 months of the year, compared to the same period in 2004, according to the KFDA. "
Studies warn 1 in 3 young men will die from tobacco use in China | CBC News,"Smoking is expected to kill more than 2 million Chinese a year by 2030, and most of those victims will be men, according to new studies on tobacco use in China.",2015-10-09T12:25:35.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/china-smoking-deaths-1.3264150,"Research published in the medical journal The Lancet says one in three of all the young men in China are likely to die from tobacco, but that the number can fall if the men quit smoking.The studies, conducted by researchers from Oxford University, the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and the Chinese Center for Disease Control, show that two-thirds of the young men in China start to smoke, mostly before age 20, and that half of those will eventually be killed by tobacco unless they stop permanently.The research, involving two studies 15 years apart and including hundreds of thousands of people, says the number of tobacco deaths, mostly among men, reached 1 million by 2010 and will hit 2 million by 2030 if current trends continue.But researchers say the trends could be stemmed if the smokers quit.""The key to avoid this huge wave of deaths is cessation, and if you are a young man, don't start,"" said co-author Richard Peto, from the University of Oxford.Smoking rates have dropped significantly among men in developed countries. Smokers number roughly 17 per cent of the population in Canada and the United States.In China, the percentage of smokers among Chinese men has been on the rise in recent decades as cigarettes have become easily available.As more Chinese people start to puff at younger ages, researchers expect the proportion of male deaths attributed to smoking to increase.Around the world, tobacco kills up to half of its users, and more than 5 million deaths annually result from direct tobacco use, according to the World Health Organization.However, with tobacco an important source of revenue for the Chinese government, Beijing's efforts to control tobacco use have in the past been compromised. Also, many people in China find it difficult to kick the habit in a culture where smoking has become so ingrained.The Chinese government runs cigarette maker China National Tobacco Corp., supplying nearly all tobacco products for  the country's 300 million smokers.""It is difficult, because there is a lot of pressure at work, so I smoke to alleviate the tension,"" Beijing office worker Wei Bin, 32, said in an interview.""At the same time our country does not provide good support for people who want to quit. I have tried electronic cigarettes, but I think that is perhaps worse,"" Wei said.Some people are showing growing signs of awareness of the health risks.""Three years ago, I used to smoke, but now I realize it is bad for health and also the environment, so I quit,"" office worker Ma Huiwei, 35, said in downtown Beijing.The research published in The Lancet shows that the number of young men smoking in China has increased, and the percentage of all male deaths in China that can be attributed to smoking is rising, while younger generations of Chinese women have become less likely to smoke compared to those born in the 1930s.Yet, researchers also worry that this downward trend among Chinese women might be reversed as other studies have shown more young women taking up smoking recently."

Poaching them is rare, but panda parts are believed to fetch high prices on the black market because of their rarity.China Central Television said forest police in Yunnan province recovered panda skin, meat, bones and an internal organ from the poachers and vendors. If convicted, the suspects could be jailed for years.Authorities told the official Xinhua News Agency that one suspect, identified by his family name of Wang, set up a trap after he found his sheep had been killed by wild animals in December. After he found the trap was broken and his brother spotted footprints of a wild animal, the two men tracked down the panda and killed it, according to the media report.The men sold 35 kilograms of giant panda meat and its four paws for 4,800 yuan ($800 US) to one buyer, and that the parts were sold again to others, Xinhua said.A recent census shows the wild panda population grew by 268 to a total of 1,864 in China since the last survey ending in 2003.The World Wide Fund for Nature has said poaching, a traditional threat to wild pandas in China, has declined but economic development has become a major threat. Hydropower plants, roads, and mining projects disrupt the animal's natural habitat.Still, Chinese officials say poaching rare animals and smuggling their parts remain a problem and that authorities are stepping up efforts to crack down on acts endangering rare animals."
'China's Warren Buffett' missing as anti-corruption probe widens | CBC News,"One of China's top entrepreneurs, the chairman of the conglomerate that owns Club Med and other businesses in Europe and the United States, is missing, a news report said Friday, a possible sign that an anti-corruption campaign is widening beyond state companies.",2015-12-11T10:55:45.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/guo-guangchang-tycoon-missing-1.3360430,"One of China's top entrepreneurs, the chairman of the conglomerate that owns Club Med and other businesses in Europe and the United States, is missing, a news report said Friday, a possible sign that an anti-corruption campaign is widening beyond state companies.Fosun International employees were unable to contact Guo Guangchang after midday Thursday, the magazine Caixin said on its website. It cited messages on social media that Guo was last seen with police at an airport in Shanghai.China is in the midst of a three-year-old anti-graft crackdown led by President Xi Jinping that has snared dozens of executives at state-owned companies in oil and other industries. A court cited Guo in August as being linked to a supermarket chain chairman who was jailed for corruption.A series of figures in China's securities industry have disappeared or been detained since August after authorities launched an investigation following a plunge in Chinese share prices in June.Fosun, China's biggest privately owned conglomerate, and its pharmaceutical unit suspended trading of their shares Friday in Hong Kong. They cited the pending release of an announcement with ""inside information.""Phone calls to Fosun's media and investor relations departments weren't answered.If Guo is under investigation, that suggests authorities are extending scrutiny beyond state-owned enterprises, increasing uncertainty for investors, said Ronald Wan, CEO of investment banking at Partners Capital International in Hong Kong.""A lot of companies will be on the investigation list and it will alert all the investors,"" he said.Wan said the government should clarify Guo's status.""If he is really getting caught in some sort of serious trouble, at least the group can have some sort of contingency plan and work out a solution to how the company can be run,"" said Wan.Guo, 48, is one of China's biggest investors abroad. Fosun, which he co-founded in the 1990s, has businesses in real estate, steel, mining and retailing.The Financial Times dubbed him ""China's Warren Buffett"" for following the legendary American investor's approach of using the cash flow from insurance operations to buy other businesses.Fosun won a bidding war this year to take over Club Mediterranee, the French resort operator. Last year, it paid 1 billion euros for Portugal's biggest insurance company, Caixa Seguros. In the United States, it owns Meadowbrook Insurance Group Inc., 20 per cent of insurer Ironshore Inc. and the 60-story office tower at 1 Chase Manhattan Plaza in New York City.Guo has a net worth of $7.8 billion, according to the Hurun Report, which follows China's wealthy.He denied earlier he was the target of a graft investigation.A court in Shanghai said in August he had ""inappropriate connections"" with the chairman of a state-owned supermarket chain, Wang Zongnan, who was sentenced to 18 years, according to Caixin. The court ruled he misused 195 million yuan ($31 million) of Shanghai Lianhua Supermarket Holdings Co.'s money to help two other companies invest in real estate.The court said Wang misused his position ""to seek benefits for Fosun Group,"" according to Caixin. In exchange, the court said, Guo sold two villas to Wang's parents at low prices.Fosun denied any impropriety and said the villas were sold at market prices.In China's state-dominated economy, many entrepreneurs make deals with officials or state industry managers to gain government licenses, contracts or financing, said Zhang Tianyu, a specialist in corporate governance at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.""This is how some entrepreneurs get into trouble once they have an anti-corruption campaign,"" said Zhang.Zhang said that in a series of deals in Shanghai, Fosun has bought stakes of less than 50 per cent in state-owned companies but gained management control. He said that unusually favourable arrangement reduced the amount of capital Fosun had to tie up in the company while making it a partner of state managers.""What we guess is that someone should be helping him to make these transactions,"" said Zhang. ""Without more evidence, we don't know who this is. A politician, or maybe a group of people."""

Australia and Russia are also big suppliers of coal to China, but Indonesia, another big supplier, is exempt from the tariffs because it has a free-trade agreement with China.Global coal prices have slumped a miners brought on new supply in the past few years, assuming rapid growth of China's coal imports. Prices are now at 111 a tonne, down from $156 a tonne a year earlier.Teck reported a sharp drop in earnings in the second quarter because of  “significantly” lower coal prices.In the U.S., Morgan Stanley analysts downgraded the entire coal sector.

Lou faces ban in China over 'Summer Palace' | CBC News,The director of the only Chinese film in competition at the Cannes Film Festival could be barred from film-making in China for showing the work.,2006-05-21T16:58:40.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/lou-faces-ban-in-china-over-summer-palace-1.585541,"The director of the only Chinese film in competition at the Cannes Film Festival could be barred from film-making in China for showing the work.Lou Ye violated the country's distribution rules by submitting his film Summer Palace for screening before it had been cleared by state censors, Chinese authorities say.The State Administration of Radio, Film and Television rejected Summer Palace last Tuesday, long after the film had been officially entered in competition and a screening scheduled at Cannes.The reason given by the bureau was that the print had lighting and sound flaws, according to one of the producers of the film.But it's far more likely the subject matter that has Chinese censors worried.The film contains graphic sex scenes and takes place against the background of student protests in 1989 that culminated in the massacre at Tiananmen Square.Lou says he had an obligation to the film's backers and cast to bring the film to international notice, although Beijing had not yet approved it.Chinese director Wong Kar-wai is chairman of the Cannes jury this year, but Summer Palace is the only Asian film among the 20 in competition for the Palme D'Or.The film is primarily a love story, not a political statement, Lou told Reuters, claiminghe set the film in 1989 ""only because I was a student at university then and I was in love.""The film is a personal epic that covers a period from 1987 to 2001, with the Tiananmen protests falling at the most intense time inthe heroine's personal struggle. Chinese actress Hao Lei stars as a tempestuous young women who seeks love again and again but never finds fulfillment for long.China has warned its 50-member press contingent at the 2006 Cannes festival not to cover sensitive subjects, especially Summer Palace, according a report from Screen magazine.After the screening of Summer Palace last Thursday, Lou said he is willing to change the film to get approval to show it in China.""I would agree to removing any scene they want,"" he said. Shanghai-born Lou is keen to have mainland Chinese see the film because it explores the many changes in personal morality and social norms that mark the last 30 years in Chinese history.""During shooting, I always forget about what's banned and what's allowed. Now it has become an issue and I will have to find a way of improving my way of working,"" he said.Lou said that a synopsis of the film had been submitted to the censors' office in 2004, and that ""normally on that basis, a film can be approved.""Lou was previously barred from making films for two years for his 2000thriller Suzhou River, which was produced without official approval. Chinese censors can bar filmmakers for even longer periods.Other contenders for this year's top award at Cannes are Sophia Coppola's Marie Antoinette; Volver by Spanish director Pedro Almodovar and U.K. master Ken Loach's The Wind that Shakes the Barley."

The country's health department issued the new rules on Monday, a week after a government report said 70 per cent of civets tested in the southern province of Guangdong were carrying the virus believed to cause SARS. The new rules ""prohibit the slaughter, cooking and selling of wild animals like civet cat"" and are meant to promote and ""advocate civilized dietary habits,"" said the Beijing Daily. The civets, which are related to the mongoose, are considered a delicacy and are often on the menu in many wild-game restaurants in parts of China. Following the initial discovery of SARS in Guangdong in 2002, Chinese officials barred restaurants from serving the small carnivorous mammal, which has a cat-like body and weasel-like face. Earlier this year, China drowned and electrocuted thousands of the animals over fears the virus it carries may jump to humans. The slaughter followed China's first confirmed case of SARS since the disease was contained in July, 2003. SARS has killed 774 people around the world, including 44 people in Canada. "

Lee said Peter Garratt requested privacy so he can spend a few quiet days with his mother.The detention of the Garratts came amid a crackdown on Christian groups aiding North Korean refugees along the border.Hong said both have been charged with stealing secrets and spying and Kevin Garratt has been moved from residential surveillance to the more serious status of criminal detention.""Kevin Garratt and Julia Garratt are under suspicion of undermining China's state security,"" Hong said.

"Occupy Hong Kong, China's coming pro-democracy showdown: Patrick Brown | CBC News","China's attempt to reinterpret the rules governing Hong Kong has sent tens of thousands into the streets in a protest with echoes of Tiananmen and an anthem — 'Do you hear the people sing? — straight out of Les Misérables, Patrick Brown writes.",2014-07-10T09:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/occupy-hong-kong-china-s-coming-pro-democracy-showdown-1.2701630,"We have seen this before — Chinese students calling their rulers to account, capturing the imagination of ordinary people with their infectious idealism and drawing huge crowds out onto the streets to challenge the all-powerful Communist Party.In 1989, students in Beijing took their demands to Tiananmen Square, the political heart of China. In 2014, the students of Hong Kong have focused on Central, the business district that is the territory's economic engine.In two huge demonstrations over the past month, Hong Kong students have called on Beijing to keep its promise to extend democracy by allowing the election of Hong Kong's head of government through universal suffrage — instead of by what's essentially a stacked deck.The first of these was an elaborate mock referendum in which almost 800,000 people, one-fifth of Hong Kong's electorate, took part.The result was heavily in favour of a general election to choose the next chief executive in 2017. Under the present rules, the only votes are cast by a committee of 1,200 people selected largely on the basis of their unqualified support for Beijing.The current chief executive, Leung Chun-Ying, is known contemptuously as ""689"" — for the number of people on the committee who voted for him in 2012.The second demonstration was a march to the Central financial district on July 1, and was one of the biggest street demonstrations since China took control of Hong Kong on that date in 1997.Broadcasting from Hong Kong then, as British sovereignty ended and Chinese rule began, I reported over the din of the fireworks that many were greeting their transition from British colonial subjects to citizens of the Peoples' Republic with confidence and enthusiasm, while others had misgivings.Beijing had promised to maintain Hong Kong's institutions, rights and freedoms unchanged for 50 years. I was among those who had doubts that the Communist Party politburo would keep its word.As the years passed, and the Chinese government seemed, by and large, to stick to its promise of ""one country, two systems,"" it was a pleasure to have some of those doubts removed. Now they're back.One of the world's most amazing cities, with a magical combination of orderly administration and commercial genius, Hong Kong also has a strong contrarian streak.In Hong Kong, the right to protest is vigorously exercised, and numerous demonstrations, big and small, on an astonishing variety of issues are a part of city life, and a litmus test of Beijing's tolerance.But China's reaction to the planned student referendum was to issue a lengthy position paper, laying out Beijing's interpretation of the Basic Law that is the equivalent of a constitution for Hong Kong. It was necessary, China said, to correct ""a lopsided and confused understanding"" of what is meant by one country, two systems.As China now says, the promise of ""a high degree of autonomy"" meant only such autonomy as the central government is willing to allow, and that will not include an open election for chief executive.Beijing is willing to allow more people to vote, it has said. But it will retain control of which candidates are allowed to run.In other words, elections are fine so long as the result is predetermined.What's more, candidates must be ""patriotic,"" which in the Communist Party's lexicon excludes anyone who does not support the party.One of the most interesting windows into the opaque world of what China's leaders are thinking is a website called Weiboscope run by the Journalism and Media Studies Centre at Hong Kong University.It tracks which posts on the microblogging services known as Weibo, mainland China's versions of Twitter, are being deleted by the censors.Since Weiboscope measures what people on the Chinese mainland are forbidden to read and discuss, it is a strong indication of which issues the Communist Party feels are most threatening to its rule.As hundreds of thousands of people followed student leaders out on to the rainy streets of Hong Kong on July 1, Weiboscope's censorship index broke the record set by the previous most-censored event — the 25th anniversary of the Tiananmen massacre on June 4th.The censors were particularly concerned to stop circulation of the demonstrators' anthem, ""Do you hear the people sing,"" a jaunty revolutionary tune from the musical Les Misérables, with Cantonese lyrics.The most prominent of the student leaders is Joshua Wong, a 17 year old with a gift for deft smackdowns of the sycophants invited to debate him.He was born in the year of the handover, and while previous protests here were led by cautious lawyers, journalists or trade unionists who grew up as British colonial subjects, these demonstrations are something new.They are being led by young people who grew up as citizens of the People's Republic of China, standing up to claim their rights with all the fearless certainty of their predecessors at Tiananmen Square.They are also warning that they will bring the global economic powerhouse that is Hong Kong to a standstill if they are to be denied.With the Hong Kong government preparing to reveal details of its plans for the 2017 election, the stage is now set for a much more dangerous confrontation.Last week's protests ended peacefully on schedule just before Central opened for business.The organizers say that was a dress rehearsal for a full-scale Occupy Central movement if the election rules are to be rigged.In response, Beijing has begun warning that the protests are inspired by foreign, ""anti-China"" forces, an indication that it is not inclined to make concessions.No wonder the censors are working overtime."

China now has more than 2,300 people fighting the viral infection. Universities in Beijing have cancelled classes but told students not to leave campus. Students are being ordered to report to authorities daily to have their temperatures recorded. Worried migrant workers and university students are crowding train and bus stations, trying to get out of Beijing.

Strain over security zone evident during Biden visit to China | CBC News,"In a sharp rebuff to the United States, China accuses Washington of taking Japan's side in a tense clash over disputed islands in the East China Sea, underscoring rising regional friction as visiting U.S. Vice-President Joe Biden met with Beijing's leaders.",2013-12-04T11:13:27.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/biden-in-china-u-s-accused-of-siding-with-japan-in-island-dispute-1.2450243,"In a sharp rebuff to the United States, China accused Washington on Wednesday of taking Japan's side in a tense clash over disputed islands in the East China Sea, underscoring rising regional friction as visiting U.S. Vice-President Joe Biden met with Beijing's leaders.Emerging from a private meeting with President Xi Jinping that went considerably longer than scheduled, Biden appeared sombre and subdued. In a brief appearance before reporters in which he took no questions, Biden did not go into details on differences over China's newly declared restricted flying zone. Instead, Biden spoke more generally of a ""new model of major country cooperation,"" saying U.S.-China relations must hinge on trust and a positive notion of each other's motives.The awkward kickoff for a series of official meetings in Beijing followed Biden's speech earlier Wednesday urging young Chinese citizens to challenge orthodoxy and the status quo. The vice-president drew an implicit contrast between the authoritarian rule of China's government and the liberal, permissive intellectual culture he described in the United States.Neither Biden nor Xi made public mention of the clash over disputed territory that has pitted China against the United States and its Asian allies.An editorial in the state media China Daily charged, however, that Washington ""is turning a blind eye to Tokyo's provocations,"" calling that the ""root cause of the tensions."" It said that ""the United States is wrongly pointing an accusing finger at China for 'unilaterally' changing the 'status quo' in the East China Sea.""Biden told reporters after his initial talks with Xi that the relationship between the two major powers will significantly affect the course of the 21st century. If the U.S. and China can get that relationship right, the possibilities are limitless, he said to reporters who were allowed in briefly after the vice president met with Xi.Biden said he came to Beijing because complex relationships require sustained engagement at high levels. He said Xi's candor and constructive approach had left an impression on him.""Candor generates trust,"" Biden said. ""Trust is the basis on which real change — constructive change — is made.""Absent from Biden's public comments was any discussion of U.S. concerns over China's new air defence zone. Only a day earlier, Biden pledged to raise those concerns ""with great specificity"" with Xi and other Chinese leaders, adding that China's move was deeply concerning.""This action has raised regional tensions and increased the risk of accidents and miscalculation,"" Biden said in Tokyo Tuesday after meeting with Japanese President Shinzo Abe.Japan has been on edge for the past two weeks since China unilaterally declared any planes flying through the zone must file flight plans with Beijing. The airspace sits above tiny islands that are at the centre of a long-running territorial dispute between China and Japan.The U.S. refuses to recognize the zone, but Biden has avoided calling publicly for Beijing to retract it, wary of making demands that China is likely to snub. Rather, the vice-president hoped to persuade China not to enforce the zone or establish similar zones over other disputed territories.After meeting with Biden, Xi said the U.S.-China relationship had gotten off to a good start this year ""and has generally maintained a momentum of positive development."" But he said the global situation is changing, with more pronounced challenges and regional hotspots that keep cropping up.""The world as a whole is not tranquil,"" Xi said through a translator, adding that the U.S. and China shoulder important responsibilities for upholding peace. ""To strengthen dialogue and cooperation is the only right choice facing both of our countries.""Added Biden, ""The way I was raised was to believe that change presents opportunity.""In his speech earlier to young Chinese citizens waiting at the U.S. embassy to get visitor visas processed, the vice-president said: ""I hope you learn that innovation can only occur where you can breathe free, challenge the government, challenge religious leaders."" Biden told young Chinese citizens waiting at the U.S. embassy to get visitor visas processed.""Children in America are rewarded — not punished — for challenging the status quo,"" he said.Biden's comments were not immediately reported by Chinese state media and were not likely to be widely known in China.

"Journalists slam article claiming Russia, China cracked Snowden files | CBC News",Two journalists at the centre of the Edward Snowden mass-surveillance revelations say British claims that spies have been pulled from operations because Russia and China have cracked Snowden's files are full of contradictions and likely false.,2015-06-14T14:29:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/journalists-slam-article-claiming-russia-china-cracked-edward-snowden-files-1.3112907,"Two journalists at the centre of the Edward Snowden mass-surveillance revelations say British claims that spies have been pulled from operations because Russia and China have cracked Snowden's files are full of contradictions and likely false. Citing anonymous and unverified government sources, Britain's Sunday Times newspaper said in a report this weekend that Britain has pulled out agents from operations in ""hostile countries"" after Russia and China cracked secrets in the documents leaked by former U.S. National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden.Security service MI6, which operates overseas and is tasked with defending British interests, has removed agents from certain countries, the Sunday Times asserted, citing unnamed officials at the office of British Prime Minister David Cameron, the Home Office (interior ministry) and security services.But journalists Glenn Greenwald and Ryan Gallagher, who have worked with the Snowden files and reported on them, including for CBC News, said the Sunday Times article is full of contradictions and likely falsehoods.The newspaper provided no evidence aside from the anonymous sources to bear out the claims.Snowden downloaded tens of thousands of secret files from security agencies in the United States and Britain in 2013, and leaked details about mass surveillance of phone and internet communications. Some of the spy programs disclosed by his leaks have since been ruled illegal in both the U.S. and Britain.The United States wants Snowden to stand trial after he leaked classified documents, fled the country and was eventually granted asylum in Moscow in 2013.He ended up in Russia after leaving Hong Kong for Latin America, and although he said in 2013 that the encrypted files remained secure, Britain believes both Russia and China have cracked documents which contain details that could allow British and American spies to be identified, the Times report said, citing officials.British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond alleged Snowden had done a huge amount of damage to the West's ability to protect its citizens.""As to the specific allegations this morning, we never comment on operational intelligence matters so I'm not going to talk about what we have or haven't done in order to mitigate the effect of the Snowden revelations, but nobody should be in any doubt that Edward Snowden has caused immense damage,"" he told Sky News.But Greenwald, one of the journalists who first broke news of the files and was part of the team that won a Pulitzer Prize for reporting on Snowden's NSA revelations, said the Times article was ""filled with falsehoods.""Greenwald wrote on the The Intercept, the news website he co-founded, that the article ""gives voice to banal but inflammatory accusations that are made about every whistleblower from Daniel Ellsberg to Chelsea Manning.""""It offers zero evidence or confirmation for any of its claims,"" he writes. ""The 'journalists' who wrote it neither questioned any of the official assertions nor even quoted anyone who denies them. It's pure stenography of the worst kind.""Greenwald pointed to a U.S. Defence Department document, obtained by Vice News under access to information, that showed U.S. government officials have been keen to leak information to the media to try to discredit Snowden.An official at Cameron's office was also quoted in the Times piece saying there was ""no evidence of anyone being harmed"" — seeming to directly contradict another anonymous official in the same report who said Snowden had ""blood on his hands."" A spokeswoman at Cameron's office declined to comment when contacted by Reuters.A Home Office source told the newspaper that Russian President Vladimir Putin did not grant Snowden asylum for nothing.""His documents were encrypted but they weren't completely secure and we have now seen our agents and assets being targeted,"" the source said.Another journalist who worked extensively on the Snowden leaks, Ryan Gallagher, said that claim is unlikely to be true.""I've reviewed the Snowden documents and I've never seen anything in there naming active MI6 agents,"" Gallagher wrote on Sunday. He said the Times piece ""contains some pretty dubious claims, contradictions and inaccuracies.""  Greenwald also noted that Snowden has said ""unequivocally"" that he didn't take any classified files with him when he left Hong Kong, making it difficult to claim Russia would have gotten its hands on the cache of documents. Both Greenwald and Gallagher have co-written multiple articles about the Snowden files in collaboration with CBC journalists for CBC's website.British security agencies declined to comment to Reuters about the claims in the Sunday Times piece.The Russian and Chinese governments were not immediately available for comment.The revelations about the impact of Snowden on intelligence operations comes days after Britain's terrorism law watchdog said the rules governing the security services' abilities to spy on the public needed to be overhauled.Conservative legislator and former minister Andrew Mitchell said the timing of the report was ""no accident.""""There is a big debate going on,"" he told BBC radio. ""We are going to have legislation brought back to Parliament (...) about the way in which individual liberty and privacy is invaded in the interest of collective national security.""That's a debate we certainly need to have.""Cameron has promised a swath of new security measures, including more powers to monitor Britons' communications and online activity in what critics have dubbed a ""snoopers' charter"".Britain's terrorism laws reviewer David Anderson said on Thursday the current system was ""undemocratic, unnecessary and — in the long run — intolerable"".He called for new safeguards, including judges not ministers approving warrants for intrusive surveillance, and said there needed to be a compelling case for any extensions of powers."
Vietnam PM urges defiance but not violence amid anti-China riots | CBC News,"Vietnam's prime minister sent a text message to millions of citizens urging them to act in defence of the country's sovereignty following China's deployment of an oil rig in disputed waters, but said that ""bad elements"" shouldn't be allowed to engage in violence.",2014-05-16T16:26:55.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/vietnam-pm-nguyen-tan-dung-urges-citizens-to-defend-sovereignty-against-china-1.2645334,"Vietnam's Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung sent a text message to millions of citizens urging them to act in defence of the country's sovereignty following China's deployment of an oil rig in disputed waters but said that ""bad elements"" shouldn't be allowed to engage in violence.The message, sent late Thursday and Friday to subscribers via major state-owned cellphone operators, didn't directly condemn the riots that have broken out this week following China's decision to deploy the rig off the coast of central Vietnam on May 1. Vietnamese patrol ships sent to disrupt the rig are currently locked in a tense standoff with Chinese ships guarding it.Anti-China protests that started peacefully have ended in violence and vandalism, with 400 factories suspected of having links with China destroyed or damaged by mobs. One Chinese worker was killed and scores more injured at a huge Taiwanese steel mill that was overrun by a 1,000-strong crowd.""The prime minister requests and calls on every Vietnamese to boost their patriotism to defend the fatherland's sacred sovereignty with actions in line with the law,"" the text message said. ""Bad elements should not be allowed to instigate extremist actions that harm the interests and image of the country.""There were no reports of any new violence or protests on Friday.Vietnam's authoritarian leaders typically clamp down on public protests of any sort, but have allowed them this time. Preventing people from demonstrating would have given fuel to domestic critics of the government who already accuse it of being soft on Beijing.The government is also able to use the nationalist sentiment of its people to amplify its protests to Beijing. But violence that harms foreign investment and risks spinning out of control is unlikely to fit into this strategy, and the government will attempt to ensure that it doesn't break out again, most analysts say.London's Financial Times reported on Friday that Apple supplier Foxconn, a Taiwanese company that manufactures iPads and iPhones, was shutting down for three days because of safety concernsReporters and television stations have been permitted to cover the peaceful protests, something highly unusual and a clear sign of state sanction. But the violence and vandalism have been subject to a media blackout.Neither China nor Vietnam has shown any sign of compromise.Vietnam believes it has international opinion on its side, and took a boatload of foreign journalists this week to waters close to the rig to ensure maximum media coverage. Beijing, which insists it has done nothing wrong and says it won't withdraw the rig, reacted angrily.""It is clear that the aim of the Vietnamese side is to escalate the situation and create tension, or in other words, to generate a media hype and 'put up a show' in front of the international audience,"" the director general of the Foreign Ministry's Department of Ocean and Boundary Affairs, Ouyang Yujing, said in Beijing.China and Vietnam have tussled for years over competing territorial claims, as have the Philippines and China. But Beijing's desire for oil and gas, and its growing economic and military might, have seen it take an increasingly assertive stance to its claims in the sea, triggering increased tensions and incidents between it and claimant states.The anti-China violence on the streets is only inflaming the relationship further.China said its foreign minister, Wang Yi, called Vietnamese Foreign Minister Pham Binh Minh on Thursday and expressed Beijing's ""strong condemnation and stern protest"" over the violence against Chinese and other foreign nationals and businesses.""Vietnam has an inescapable responsibility for the actions of the lawless elements who attacked Chinese businesses and individuals,"" Wang said.The U.S. doesn't take a side in the disputes, but shares many of the concerns of Vietnam and the Philippines about China. It is seeking closer economic and military ties with both nations. It has described China's deployment of the rig as ""provocative.""In Washington, U.S. Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Martin Dempsey said after a meeting Thursday with his Chinese counterpart that in a world where information moves so fast, ""issues afloat quickly become issues ashore as we've seen today in Vietnam.""The chief of the General Staff of China's People's Liberation Army, Gen. Fang Fenghui, blamed Vietnam for the off-shore standoff, asserting that China was operating in its own territorial waters. He vowed that China would continue its oil drilling and would not allow Vietnam to disrupt it."

Tiny relative of Triceratops found in China | CBC News,"Fossils of dog-sized dinosaur, an early, distant cousin of the Triceratops, have been found in China, researchers say",2002-03-21T01:04:05.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/tiny-relative-of-triceratops-found-in-china-1.336063,"Fossils of a dog-sized dinosaur, an early, distant cousin of the Triceratops, have been found in China, researchers say. Paleontologists said the two newly discovered fossils will help them better understand the evolution of this family of dinosaurs. The dinosaur, Liaoceratops yanzigouensis, weighed only about three kilograms and was less than a metre long. The name refers to the site where the scientists found the fossils, in the village of Yanzigou in Liaoning province. The fossils' discovery is published in Thursday's issue of Nature. The plant-eating dinosaur had small horns and a ridge at the top of the skull, mere hints of the massive horns and frill that would adorn its descendant, Triceratops. ""This small, primitive dinosaur is actually more interesting to science in many ways than its larger, more famous relatives because it teaches us more about evolution,"" study co-author Peter Makovicky said in a statement. Makovicky, assistant curator of dinosaurs at The Field Museum in Chicago, worked with scientists at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing, led by Xing Xu. Makovicky said the fossil helps establish that the ceratopsians separated from another group of dinosaurs, the parrot-beaked dinosaurs or psittacosaurids, about 150 million years ago, in the early Cretaceous Period. The new dinosaur also shows that larger and more spectacular dinosaurs can evolve from smaller ancestors. ""We see this common pattern in many different groups of dinosaurs,"" said Makovicky. Makovicky said the dinosaur's horns and small frill may have been display features for attracting mates or discouraging predators. The frill may also have served as an attachment point for its large jaw muscles, Makovicky said. "
"In trade war between U.S. and China, Canada will take losses — but maybe some wins too | CBC News","While few are suggesting the good outweighs the bad in what's looking increasingly like a trade war between the world's two largest economies, that's not to say there won't be any individual winners and losers as the battles unfold. Here's a look at just a few of the possibilities.",2018-04-05T08:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/winners-losers-trade-war-1.4604878,"While few are suggesting the good outweighs the bad in what's looking increasingly like a trade war between the world's two largest economies, that's not to say there won't be any individual winners and losers as the battles unfold.Here's a look at just a few:There's likely no better barometer of the current trade tensions than the stock market. After staying on a nearly unbroken upward trajectory through 2017, volatility has been the name of the game in stock markets this year.Gains of more than 20 per cent last year on the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 are down by about half that since the end of January; the tech-laden Nasdaq is down by almost as much. There have been single-day losses in the triple digits this year.Much of the blame for the slump is being laid at the feet of U.S. President Donald Trump, who loved to take credit for hot markets on the way up. Investors don't like uncertainty — and the world's two largest economies making it harder and harder for them to do business with each other certainly qualifies. ""To paraphrase singer-songwriter Jimmy Buffett,"" as strategist Mark Grant with investment bank B. Riley FBR put it, ""there's been a change in latitude, so investors must change their attitudes.""For investors who had perhaps gotten used to double-digit returns, the prospect of a global trade war is serving as a good reminder that markets can sometimes go down, too.All this sabre-rattling is definitely pumping the brakes on expectations of higher interest rates. Prior to the last Bank of Canada interest rate decision (when the bank opted to stand pat) traders were betting there was about a 40 per cent chance of a rate hike this month. Today the likelihood is barely half that, at 22 per cent. Trade fears aren't the only factor, but they are clearly playing a role.And it's not just Canada. ""The [U.S.] Federal Reserve is going to change its tune,"" Grant said. ""It will not just be investors who have to do an about-face."" Against the backdrop of a trade war, it's reasonable to expect tough times ahead for the loonie. Trade analyst Raoul Leering with Dutch bank ING notes that smaller countries such as Canada and Mexico depend far more on American demand for their products than the other way around. ""Canada has much more to lose in a trade war … than the Americans,"" he said in a note to clients Wednesday.The loonie saw a brief surge this week on reports that NAFTA talks have turned optimistic. But the threat of a trade war has pushed it back down, along with the peso, as investors realize there are still risks on the horizon, says Scotiabank economist Derek Holt.""Which currency gains from trade wars? The currency of the country that started it,"" Holt says. And that isn't Canada.It's entirely possible that Canadians who export products on each country's verboten list might see some new markets emerge as the two countries build a tariff moat between themselves. After all, it's not as if the U.S. is suddenly going to need less steel, or China lose its voracious appetite for soybeans — which could benefit people like Dresden, Ont.-based soybean farmer Philip Shaw. He thinks there may be future opportunities for farmers to sell to China.Glen Lucas, general manager of the B.C. Fruit Growers' Association, said the Chinese tariffs will be disruptive but he, too, is optimistic that there may be some tiny gains to be had for Canadian growers.""I think it'll just cause market confusion and a lot of hassle for the producers to figure out where the products are flowing,"" he said. ""But I would expect that there would be a shift to markets that don't have tariffs,"" such as Canada, he said.Despite some gains on the margins, the general view is that trade wars are pretty much bad for everybody. ""It's not a good thing, period,"" is the blunt assessment from professor Walid Hejazi at the Rotman School of Management in Toronto. And he thinks Canada could suffer more than most because of how dependent we are on the U.S. economy. From softwood lumber to aerospace to supply management, every time Canada has a gripe on trade with the U.S. ""we find ourselves hostage to our one big trading partner,"" he says. So a trade war ""would be terrible for Canada, and terrible for the global economy.""Farmer and economist Shaw isn't quite so bleak, but he too would prefer ""that everybody could get along,"" as he put it. Despite any potential new markets opening, ""anything bad for the U.S. is bad for us,"" he says. Still, there is a chance — albeit a small one — that escalating trade tensions might turn out to be a good thing in the long term. ING's Leering notes that China has not set a date for implementing the $50 billion in tariffs it slapped on more than 100 U.S. goods. To him, that suggests it may be an empty threat and a negotiating tactic. CBC News""This means they still see room for extending the current negotiations, [and] it is likely that China will, in the end, cut its losses and be willing to give Trump something,"" he said.""The American president is playing a dangerous game but a potentially rewarding one.""Analyst Dan Flynn with the PRICE Futures Group in Chicago says the reforms the U.S. is pushing for will end up being good for both sides. ""You can expect China to not be a Barney Fife and shoot themselves in the foot,"" he said.U.S. demands that China modernize its intellectual-property and foreign-takeover rules are long overdue, Flynn says, and are ""big pluses long term.""""But the media could never admit that, of course, and the majority almost seem as if they want the U.S economy not to succeed … just to be spiteful,"" Flynn said in a quip sure to be a favourite of the U.S. president.While he's skeptical of an upside, Grant, too, acknowledges that the skirmishes in this trade war might not be all that bad.""I doubt the Trump administration will allow this trade battle to reach such a fevered pitch,"" he said, ""but I am concerned just how far President Donald Trump and his Art of the Deal might push things."""

Provincial Heritage Fair.Students representing 28 schools across the Island packed the halls at the Confederation Centre of the Arts in Charlottetown to display their 149 historical projects.Students from Grades 5 through 9 worked on projects in their own schools and were chosen to represent at the provincial fair.""Kids just come alive and it's a lot of fun and you can see the excitement when they come in,"" said Charlotte Stewart, coordinator of the Provincial Heritage Fair. ""The whole [Confederation] Centre is kind of buzzing with excitement here and it is great to see a lot of the community support.""Stewart has been coordinating the fair for the past 14 years and said that history is not the only thing the students are learning.""It's a great way to connect with your community with your family and learn about different resources that are out there for information,"" she said. ""Not just doing a Google search but using all sorts of different source materials and then getting that information together and being able to present it to other people."" It was a class effort at Tignish Elementary School. Students were assigned to find out more about historical moments and locations in their community. They would then model clay and paint the scene in a frame.""A lot of stuff we didn't know before about each landmark, so it was really cool,"" said Grade 6 student Stacy Handrahan.Anna Paquet, a Grade 9 student at Grace Christian School, decided to research the Spanish Influenza of 1918. ""This is what our ancestors went through, and it is important to understand what they have gone through in the past.""​Grade 5 student Kierra MacDougall, from Athena Consolidated focused on her own culture by researching her Métis heritage. ""I did that because I'm Métis, and I wanted to learn about my culture and also share it,"" said MacDougall. Grade 9 student Ben Zhou, from East Wiltshire Intermediate School, decided to research the popularity of Anne of Green Gables in China. He was inspired to look into the topic after reading a few of the Anne books. ​""After doing some research, I found it is so famous in China, and so many different versions have been translated,"" said Zhou. ""I was surprised, I was very surprised."" The heritage fair was personal for one student who presented a Second World War P.E.I. spy  —  his own great-grandfather.​""It was really interesting,"" said Grade 6 student Oscar Cormier from West Kent Elementary School. ""I knew some of it from family stories but I never knew that he parachuted for instance, I found that probably the coolest thing I discovered.""During his research Cormier also found that many of the records from his great-grandfather's spy days might have been destroyed.""I think that if we don't learn about the history, we'll make the same mistakes we made last time,"" Cormier said. ""But also, Camp X burned all their records. So we learn from our history but I don't think they wanted us to know too much.""There were a large number of judges walking around and assessing the student projects.Fifteen students will be selected to work on a video submission to compete nationally for a chance to go to Canada's History for Youth Forum in Ottawa."
Vancouver couple accused of spying in China held in near isolation | CBC News,"A Canadian couple accused of spying near China's sensitive border with North Korea has been kept in near isolation for more than 80 days, their son said, and they have repeatedly been denied access to legal counsel.",2014-10-24T09:49:07.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/kevin-and-julia-dawn-garratt-accused-of-spying-in-china-held-in-near-isolation-son-says-1.2811337,"A Canadian couple accused of spying near China's sensitive border with North Korea has been kept in near isolation for more than 80 days, their son said, and they have repeatedly been denied access to legal counsel.Treatment of the couple, who are being held without charge at a remote facility in the border city of Dandong, has seriously strained China's ties with Canada ahead of a planned visit by Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper for a multilateral summit next month in Beijing.Kevin and Julia Garratt were allowed to meet briefly for breakfast last week - the first contact they had with each other during their detention.""It's not their physical health I'm concerned about, it's more their mental health,"" said their son Simeon Garratt. ""You put anybody in a situation like that for 80 days, where you can't talk to anybody else and with no outside contact, and you don't know what could happen. It's not about food or water.""The Vancouver couple had opened a cafe called Peter's Coffee House in Dandong in 2008. State media has reported they are suspected of stealing national security secrets, but no formal charges have been made and it is unclear what exactly they are accused of.Kevin Garratt told a congregation in Canada last year that he ran a prayer and training facility frequented by North Koreans, many of whom became Christians before returning to the isolated country.Hundreds of Christian aid workers near the North Korean border have been detained or forced to leave in a crackdown this year.Both Kevin and Julia are under 24-hour surveillance by two guards. Canadian consular officials visit with them every two weeks, Simeon Garratt said. They are frequently interrogated, he said, though the subject of the questions is unknown.""Their daily routine is to wake up, have breakfast and wait to find out whether they'll be interrogated that day or not,"" he said.The Garratts' children communicate with their parents through written letters sent through Canadian consular officials. But not all of them get through. A coffee-maker and other supplies sent by the Garratt's younger son was also never delivered.Authorities have repeatedly denied the family's requests for access to legal counsel since the Garratts were detained August 4, according to a source with direct knowledge of the matter.The source added that authorities had said re-applying would almost certainly be fruitless.""They remain detained and isolated from their family and legal counsel, and in conditions that are nothing short of demeaning and withdrawn from meaningful human contact,"" the person said. ""Under such circumstances, any human being under the pressure of isolation could easily incriminate themselves.""The Canadian Embassy in Beijing could not be immediately reached for comment.It is unusual for foreigners to be charged with violating China's state secrets law - a serious crime that is punishable by life in prison or death in the most severe cases.In September, Canada ratified a foreign investment protection agreement with China after a two-year delay in a move that could help ease tensions with China."

Supreme Court since December 2018.Vancouver-based immigration lawyer Richard Kurland, who has followed the case closely, said he believes the leaks that prompted last week's news stories were intended to test the waters for a possible solution to a case that has wreaked havoc on relations between Canada and China.""It provides an opportunity for the politicians to poll the public,"" Kurland said.""If there's a tsunami of public opinion in favour of shutting this case down, Ottawa and Washington can very quickly come to an accommodation.""Meng, 48, who is Huawei's chief financial officer, was arrested at Vancouver's airport on Dec. 1, 2018, after arriving on a flight from Hong Kong on her way to Mexico City and Argentina.The United States wants her extradited to New York to face charges of fraud and conspiracy related to allegations she lied to an HSBC Holdings Plc executive in August 2013 about Huawei's control of a subsidiary accused of violating U.S. economic sanctions against Iran.Prosecutors claim that by relying on Meng's alleged lies to continue handling finances for the Chinese telecommunications giant, HSBC placed itself at risk of loss and prosecution.Meng has denied the allegations against her, but according to the Wall Street Journal, Meng's lawyers and the U.S. Department of Justice have been in discussions about entering into a deferred prosecution agreement — a legal instrument that could see the U.S. defer and later drop the charges.According to the report, ""Meng has so far resisted the proposed deal, believing she did nothing wrong.""CBC has not independently verified reports of the negotiations. Meng's Canadian legal team had no comment. The news appeared to catch Huawei's Canadian employees off guard.It wouldn't be the first time the subject of a deferred prosecution agreement has played a role in the extradition case. In court documents filed this summer, Meng's lawyers noted that HSBC paid a $1.9 billion US fine and entered into a deferred prosecution agreement in 2012 ""related to its own independent misconduct, including in relation to violations of U.S. sanctions law regarding Iran.""Two of the other banks named as victims in the case have also been subject to similar agreements.Kurland said evidence emerging out of the Vancouver extradition proceedings about alleged violations of Meng's rights have given her a relatively strong negotiating position.Meng is a co-defendant with Huawei in the case.Kurland said he thinks the U.S. might drop charges against her while reaching a deal with the company similar to one that saw another Chinese telecommunications firm, ZTE, pay $1 billion US in 2018 to settle sanctions-related allegations.""She should hold out,"" Kurland said. ""There's no reason to play her cards right now when President Biden is around the corner.""On Friday, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau refused to comment on the reports of a possible deal. He reiterated his concern for the safety of Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, two Canadians who have been imprisoned in China since days after Meng's arrest.WATCH | Diplomatic experts say Meng plea deal wouldn't guarantee return of Canadian detainees:  The NationalChina has accused the two men of spying, but has released no evidence to back up the claim. Most observers believe they were taken in retaliation for Meng.The RCMP officer who oversees the RCMP's Vancouver airport detachment is to continue his testimony Monday under cross-examination by veteran lawyer Richard Peck.Sgt. Ross Lundie is one of 10 RCMP and Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) officers expected to give evidence about Meng's arrest. The defence has accused the two agencies of conspiring with the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation to have customs agents question Meng without a lawyer for three hours before the RCMP arrested her and cautioned her of her rights.During that time, the CBSA also seized Meng's phones and gave the pass codes to the RCMP, allegedly by mistake. The defence has accused the RCMP of sending technical information about the devices to the FBI in violation of extradition law.In prior testimony, Lundie said it was his idea to have the CBSA question Meng for immigration purposes because they are the ""gatekeepers"" to Canada. He said he thought a previous plan to have police officers arrest Meng on the plane was a bad idea.The RCMP and CBSA witnesses have maintained that they were respecting each other's jurisdiction and were not directed by the FBI.The CBSA's chief of passenger operations for Vancouver, Nicole Goodman, is also expected to testify later this week. The Crown says it may want to call more witnesses to rebut some of the earlier testimony.Meng's lawyers plan to use the evidence gathered during these proceedings at a hearing next spring, where they will ask the judge to toss the case.At that time, the defence will also argue Meng is being used as a bargaining chip in a trade war between the U.S. and China and that the U.S. misled Canada about the strength of its case."

Dogs make new home in Ottawa after being saved from slaughter at meat festival in China | CBC News,"After travelling halfway around the world, 10 dogs rescued from a meat festival in China are getting settled at foster homes in Ottawa.",2016-12-24T00:16:52.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/dogs-from-china-make-home-in-ottawa-1.3911770,"After travelling halfway around the world, 10 dogs rescued from a meat festival in China are getting settled at foster homes in Ottawa.The dogs are part of a larger group of 110 dogs that arrived in Toronto on Thursday night after being rescued by Humane Society International late in the spring while en route to the Yulin dog meat festival.The organization worked with partner charities in China to intercept the dogs, according to Gabriel Wildgen, a campaign manager with Humane Society International Canada.The festival has been a target of animal rights activists since its inauguration. It officially launched in 2009 as a way to mark the summer solstice in China's Guangxi province.Wildgen said not all the dogs came from the same place, but that activists would often block trucks headed for the festival and pressure the dog meat traders to give up at least some of the animals before letting them continue on their way.""It's important to remember that the dogs that we've rescued from these trucks are the lucky few,"" Wildgen said.""They're really the ambassadors for the millions of dogs that are killed every year in China for the dog meat trade, and these dogs endure the worst kind of suffering imaginable.""On Friday, after dealing with months of red tape, the dogs destined for Ottawa homes arrived in the rural community of Carp where foster families were waiting to bring them home.Other dogs from the group stayed in Toronto or went on to Montreal.""They were held up by smog in Beijing.

"China in the oil patch, should we 'fear the dragon'? | CBC News","Two years ago, when it blocked the proposed takeover of Potash Corp., Ottawa promised clearer rules on what foreign companies could buy, Patrick Brown writes. With China's oil giant set to take over Calgary's Nexen, those rules are needed now.",2012-07-26T09:12:58.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/china-in-the-oil-patch-should-we-fear-the-dragon-1.1229528,"During his visit to China in February, Prime Minister Stephen Harper had two things on his mind: pandas and oil.For Canada, the trip was a success. Harper had his picture taken with two of China's cutest inhabitants, and told China's leaders often and loudly that Canada's oil and gas companies are open for business and for investment.His hosts indicated they are almost as keen to buy Canadian oil and gas as he is to sell it, and that Chinese companies will be delighted to take up his invitation to invest in Canadian natural resources.Fast forward to this week and China put its money where its mouth is with a$15-billion offer by the China National Offshore Oil Company to buy Calgary-based oil producer Nexen Inc.It's one of the biggest foreign takeovers China has ever attempted and one of the biggest in this country as well.So now Canada has to decide whether it really means what Harper said when he was in Beijing.The Investment Canada Act requires the minister of industry, in this case Christian Paradis, to determine whether any foreign takeover worth more than $330 million provides a ""net benefit"" for Canada.Luckily for Paradis, the provisions of the act are sufficiently vague that it allows him to decide pretty much whatever the prime minister tells him to.Having laid out such a large and inviting welcome mat back in February, it seems highly unlikely that Harper will want to slam the door in China's face, unless he wants to give back the pandas and have relations return to the deep freeze.In making its decision, Ottawa will be helped by the fact that CNOOC, which was rebuffed by the U.S. when it tried to take over Unocal for $18-billion in 2005, has done its homework this time.   As the first Chinese company to make important minority acquisitions in Canadian oil firms, CNOOC has seven years experience here already and is often said to have good connections in Ottawa, courtesy perhaps of Hill and Knowlton, the giant international PR firm that was hired to advise on the bid.What's more, by offering at least 61 per cent more for Nexen's shares than the previous day's closing price, CNOOC's bid is extremely generous and includes several promises that are clearly designed to satisfy the ""net benefit"" requirement.It will keep Calgary as the headquarters of operations for North and Central America; Nexen's current management will stay in place; CNOOC will list on the Toronto Stock Exchange; and CNOOC will invest heavily in existing assets.It will also be hard for opponents to portray the deal as a sell-off of Canada's birthright since only one third of the oil Nexen produces is from here.The rest is in the North Sea, the Gulf of Mexico, Yemen and off the coast of Nigeria, not places usually seen as part of Canada's heritage.On the face of it, this seems like the kind of deal that would normally sail through the review process. That is, if only CNOOC did not have the word China in its name, and was not owned and operated by the Chinese Communist Party.In a prescient research study, Fear the Dragon?, issued just last month, the Conference Board of Canada called for changes in the Investment Canada Act to make the review process more effective and transparent.The study also contains a section titled ""Dear China, we have trust issues,"" in which the authors cite a Harris-Decima poll taken in February around the time of Harper's China trip.""Just one in 10 respondents thought Chinese companies taking a majority controlling interest and/or taking over an existing Canadian operation is a good thing,"" the poll found.Clearly, it would seem that Canadians have greater concerns about China's economic ambitions than their federal government does, perhaps based on the way Beijing has tended to disregard workers' rights and environmental standards at home.Or perhaps it is based on the fear that large state-owned Chinese companies will use their muscle in the interests of China to the detriment of Canada; or that, when push comes to shove, the Chinese government will throw its weight about in support of their companies, demanding concessions from Canada on their behalf.In a column in her local newspaper, Island Tides, last week, the energetic Green Party leader Elizabeth May, recalled the old argument that stronger trade ties would promote political reform in China.""In the last few years, direct ownership of the Alberta oil sands by Chinese state-owned oil companies has gone from nearly nothing to over $12-billion,"" she wrote.""So back to that wonderful transmission of values through trade. It seems to be working,"" she added, in a slap at the Harper government. ""Canada is absorbing Chinese values respecting human rights, labour laws and environmental protection.""The counter-argument, made by the Conference Board, is that Chinese companies respect the rule of law in host countries, and deserve a clearer law here that will ""make them aware of Canadian sensitivities and requirements"" and ""balance Canada's desire for Chinese investment with the Canadian national interest.""So where is that law?Two years ago, Christian Paradis' predecessor as industry minister, Tony Clement, blocked the Australian mining company BHP Billiton from taking over Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan (for almost $40-billion).At the time he, and the prime minister, promised to draw up new guidelines so that foreign investors know exactly what they need to do to comply with Canada's ""net benefit"" rule.But that promise has not been kept, and the system remains almost as arbitrary and opaque as the one Canadian companies have to deal with when investing in China.Right now, China is seeking to turn its mountain of cash into greater ownership of resources, seeing these as a better investment for its economic future than U.S. treasury bonds and their almost zero return.In this regard, Canada is a natural place to look and China's leaders are sure to see this bid as a test case for more to come.Indeed, so will the many Canadians who have suspicions about the wisdom of the deal.Both sides would benefit from greater transparency and a wider airing of the issues involved.And before Canada makes a decision about whether to approve the deal, it would be nice to know just who made $30 million with what Reuters reports was ""a number of well-timed bullish bets"" on Nexen options last week, just days before the CNOOC deal was announced.The news agency quotes one stock analyst as saying, ""This is probably the most compelling and suspicious order flow I've seen in a takeover in several years."""
Typhoon Utor lands in China as Hong Kong shuts down | CBC News,Tens of thousands of people were evacuated as a powerful typhoon thundered into southern China on Wednesday after shutting down the bustling Asian financial centre of Hong Kong and sinking a cargo ship.,2013-08-14T05:16:16.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/typhoon-utor-lands-in-china-as-hong-kong-shuts-down-1.1414493,"Tens of thousands of people were evacuated as a powerful typhoon thundered into southern China on Wednesday after shutting down the bustling Asian financial centre of Hong Kong and sinking a cargo ship.Packing high winds and torrential rain, Typhoon Utor forced the closure of schools, offices, shopping centres and construction sites in cities along its path northwest across Guangdong province.More than 60,000 people were evacuated in the city of Maoming alone, while another 98,000 were moved to safety to the south on the island province of Hainan, where 26,000 fishing boats were also ordered to shelter in harbours. Flights and ferry services were suspended on the island, stranding thousands of travellers.There were no immediate reports of damage or injuries on the mainland due to the storm, which was packing sustained gale force winds of 145 kilometres per hour.In Hong Kong, offices, schools and courts were shut and the stock market halted trading, bringing an eerie calm to the normally busy southern Chinese commercial hub. More than 350 flights were cancelled or delayed, and bus and commuter ferry services were curtailed.Helicopter search and rescue teams from Hong Kong and Guangdong province rescued 21 crew members from the Trans Summer, a bulk carrier, after it started listing in waters southwest of Hong Kong, local broadcaster RTHK said.Six people in Hong Kong were reported injured. Strong winds blew down 21 trees, but otherwise the city emerged largely unscathed.[IMAGEGALLERY galleryid=4853 size=small]Utor was the world's strongest typhoon of the year before it crossed the Philippines earlier this week, leaving at least seven people dead and four missing. One woman in northeastern Isabela province was seen on camera being swept away by a raging river. Her body was found later.Dozens of fishermen were missing after the storm, but most have since returned home, officials said.Rescuers were still struggling to reach at least three isolated towns in the hardest-hit Aurora province, where the typhoon slammed ashore.""As of now, we don't have communication (with the three towns) and the roads are not passable, even to motorcycles, due to landslides, rockslides and uprooted trees,"" said Rey Balido, spokesman for the national disaster agency. He said authorities were taking alternate routes and that the Philippine air force would deliver relief goods."
"Fishing for tourists, and the changing face of rural China | CBC News","While China undergoes one seismic change after another, the country's rural areas are trying hard to hold on their traditions.",2013-09-01T00:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/fishing-for-tourists-and-the-changing-face-of-rural-china-1.1312905,"It is no exaggeration to say that China is experiencing seismic shifts. You can see this most clearly in the divide between the cities and rural areas. Urbanization rates have skyrocketed, with the urban population in China jumping from 17.9 per cent in 1978 to 51.3 per cent in 2011.With this trend comes the diminishing of traditional, resource-based living that used to be the lifeblood of small communities. So how are those rural communities that remain sustained? It's a question that obviously resonates here in Newfoundland and Labrador, too. As China speeds towards urbanization with its own brand of communism and capitalism, tourism has become big business, in part as a way to maintain some semblance of traditional rural lifestyles.But who are the tourists? China is far and expensive for many Westerners. What we discovered is that Chinese tourism benefits largely from the money - the yuan - of many of the 1.4 billion Chinese nationals who love to travel within their home country. This was on full display on a hot summer morning in the southern Chinese village of Xiatang in Yangshuo County.As we pull our bikes to the riverbank, we are swarmed with people shouting offers at us. ""Hello, bamboo rafting?""[IMAGEGALLERY galleryid=4949 size=small]We shake our heads, trying to figure out how we will find the stranger who is our contact at the Yulong River. He finds us first, walks up to us, and wordlessly hands us a cellphone. On the other end, we hear the voice of Amy, our hotel's manager. ""Leave your bicycles with him. They will be waiting for you at the other end.""We do as she asks, follow the man, and board our bamboo raft, traditionally used both by fishermen and farmers as a means of transporting their goods in this fertile river valley.We glide past the breathtaking scenery: rice paddies, blue skies, towering limestone karst peaks that dominate every viewpoint. There are moments when we are the only ones in sight.But during our two-hour trip, we are occasionally overwhelmed with the abundance of raft after raft after raft. Floating markets drift by, selling everything from beer and water to full meals. Armed with camera, computer and printer, nearby tents offer instant photo opportunities to dress up in traditional clothing and pose with cormorants, birds used to catch fish in the region.Later that same evening, we make our way to the larger Li River, into which the Yulong empties, to actually watch a fishermen use these cormorants to fish.This tradition is more than 1,000 years old and was once a staple of sustenance living.  Local fishermen harness a half-dozen trained cormorants to their rafts just after dusk. They use an archaic-looking lantern to draw fish near the surface of the river. The birds, whose snared throats prevent them from swallowing large fish, will dive on command, catch and hold onto the fish. In one hour, our fisherman catches 20 large fish. We watch in awe at his expertise and ingenuity. Mixed with the awe, however, is a little sadness as this man goes about his business now more so for spectacle than for any kind of sustenance.We are repeatedly struck by how tradition and modernity have become necessary bedfellows, and wonder if what was once rural China has been bastardized for the tourist dollar (or yuan). This is a question we have often asked ourselves, both home and abroad.We pose this same question to Jack Zhuo, a local guide who took us hiking into the Longji rice terraces in what are termed the ""minority villages"" a few hours away in Longsheng County.As a government-certified tour guide, he sees the changes in rural China as he takes Chinese nationals and foreigners alike through the countryside.They visit the terraced rice paddies, shop local markets, or view a ""long haired"" show that features the women of the Yao tribe and their elaborate hairstyles, fashioned from tradition that forbids women to cut their hair except once on their 18th birthday.As we gazed at the hilly rice fields that must be tended largely by hand, Jack told us that government subsidies help encourage people to stay in the countryside and continue traditional modes of living, which are a huge tourist attraction.He says this is to counteract the fact that most younger Chinese, by virtue of external influences such as the internet, would rather flee to the cities and live what they think will be an easier lifestyle than that of a farmer.Many tourists are looking for ""authentic experiences"" as a way to mark their journeys, us included.The more we travel, the less money we tend to spend on trinkets and souvenirs, putting our dollars towards more intangible experiences.And while we are well aware that our Canadian privilege means we will never truly live like a local, we feel that experiencing traditional and rural culture often brings us that little bit closer to an understanding of a country and its people.And if that glimpse of insight comes on a sunny morning drifting along a river in a bamboo raft, it can remain a powerful and evocative image of a country's past, present and future, and the complicated connections between them."
5 things to know about the Canada-China investment treaty | CBC News,The federal government has come under heavy scrutiny after signing an investment treaty with China without public consultation or debate. Here are 5 things to know about the deal before it comes into effect which could happen as early as next week.,2012-10-28T00:47:36.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/5-things-to-know-about-the-canada-china-investment-treaty-1.1183343,"The federal government has come under heavy scrutiny from opposition parties and critics alike after Prime Minister Stephen Harper signed an investment treaty with China, formally known as a Foreign Investment Promotion and Protection Agreement (FIPA), while at the APEC Summit in Vladivostok, Russia, on Sept.9, 2012.While details of the agreement were kept secret until the deal was tabled in Parliament on Sept. 26., now that the details have been revealed, the deal itself does not have to be debated in Parliament.That's because treaty making is a royal prerogative and can become law through a cabinet order in council after sitting in Parliament for no less than 21 days after being tabled.Currently, Canada has 24 FIPAs in force with countries like Russia, Argentina and the Czech Republic. FIPA negotiations have been concluded with eight countries, including China, while ongoing negotiations continue with another 12 countries.A FIPA is not a free trade agreement but rather a bilateral agreement intended to ""protect and promote"" foreign investment through legally-binding rights and obligations.Here are five things to know about Canada's investment treaty with China which is expected to be ratified next week:This FIPA is different from other FIPAs due to the sheer amount of investment China already has in Canada, said Gus Van Harten, an international investment law expert and associate professor at the Osgoode Hall Law School at York University, in an interview with CBC Radio's The House.Van Harten explained, the FIPAs Canada has in force are typically with countries who don't own major assets in Canada.However, under this treaty, Van Harten said Canadian taxpayers will assume ""more of the risks and more of the constraints"" than their Chinese counterparts to the degree that Chinese investments in Canada outpace Canadian investments the other way.According to Van Harten, the deal doesn't deliver on market access and investor protection.""We come out on the losing side on both,"" said Van Harten. ""We should insist on reciprocity. The treaty does not allow for market access except under the exisiting legal framework of each country.""The problem with that, Van Harten said, is Canada's legal framework is ""more open and less opaque"" than China's existing legal framework which will benefit China more than it will benefit Canada.Under this treaty, the investor-state mechanism is such that China could sue for decisions made by any level of government in Canada, if Chinese companies thought they were not being treated the same as Canadian ones.In other words, this deal could undermine the provinces ""bargaining power,"" said Van Harten because ""this very powerful arbitration process operates outside of the Canadian legal system and Canadian courts.""Arbitration would happen behind closed doors, said Van Harten and if the arbitrators found Canada at fault, Canadian taxpayers could be left footing the bill. Several countries have already faced stiff punishment under such treaties.This, according to Van Harten, also calls into question whether the treaty is unconstitutional or not.The Opposition New Democrats, Liberals and Greens are all calling on the federal government to study and debate the agreement instead of ratifying it and locking it in for the next 31 years without public consultation – as they can do.In an interview with CBC Radio's The House on Saturday, NDP MP Don Davies, who serves as the international trade critic, told host Evan Solomon that if the federal government ratifies the agreement as it is now, it will have ""frozen in time a very lopsided deal.""Davies said they have ""received 60,000 emails in the last two weeks from Canadians who are concerned about this deal.""The federal government insists ""this agreement includes reciprocal obligations"" and is good for Canada, said the Conservative MP who tabled the FIPA with China.Also in an interview airing on CBC Radio's The House, Deepak Obhrai, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Foreign Affairs, said this FIPA with China ""levels the playing field"" between the two countries. Obhrai told Solomon, this agreement ""give assurances to Canadian businesses that their investment in China is protected and they can do business in China because this is a deal that is open and treats our companies in each other's country on equal terms.""The question we should all be asking ourselves Van Harten said, is ""has Canada conceded something now that we were not prepared to concede under previous governments?""And according to Van Harten, the answer is ""it's quite possible."""
Why allowing 2 children in China may not give Beijing the baby boom it wants: Saša Petricic | CBC News,"China has lifted its ban on second children, but the end of the strict one-child policy may not give Beijing the population boost it wants to keep its economy growing or help those whose lives were ruined by the old system, the CBC's Saša Petricic writes.",2016-05-15T09:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/china-child-policy-1.3575682,"At one day old, the baby boy being bathed in the hospital sink doesn't have a name yet or any idea that he may be a trendsetter.And perhaps he will be among the first in what Beijing city officials hope to be a mini baby boom after China lifted its ban on second children late last year.His parents, the Wangs, are happy just to be allowed to have a little brother for their two year-old daughter, who hovers over him curiously. Neither of the parents had brothers or sisters.Not so long ago, China's strict one-child policy would have made his birth illegal. His parents would have been fined. He could have been shunned.""A second child is exactly what we always wanted,"" says father Wang Jue. ""We didn't want our daughter to grow up alone. I'm sure many other couples are considering it, but it's not an easy decision to have a second. Raising children is so expensive here.""That's why Beijing may see only an increase of 50,000 births this year, hitting a predicted total of 300,000 new babies for 2016.It's hardly the surge of many millions experts say the country needs to keep its economy growing. Since 2013, when the rules for having two-child families started loosening, the number of second children born has totalled 17.7 million.At that rate, China could have a labour shortage of between 126 million and 220 million workers as early as 2030, according to World Bank studies.The population is getting older quickly and the number of working-age Chinese can't keep up.That's a global trend that's been accelerated here by the one-child policy, says Yang Yao, the director of the China Center for Economic Research at Peking University.""China has compressed this 100-year or 150-year process into a matter of 30 or 40 years.… Boom!"" he says. ""Even if people have two children, I don't think that we can stop aging. No way.""When the one-child policy was introduced in the early 1980s, it was meant to prevent a population explosion. At the time, many Chinese families had five or six children.But experts now say it was an over-reaction that didn't anticipate the country's rapid urbanization and the trend toward smaller families.More and more, demographers and economists call the one-child policy a mistake.""Has that done good things for China in the long run? Probably the answer would be no,"" says Yang Yao.It's already reducing China's low-cost workforce advantage. A shortage of workers in some areas has led to higher wage demands and an annual 10 per cent increase in salaries overall, according to official Chinese numbers.But the one-child policy also came with a huge human cost. For years, men and women were subjected to forced sterilizations and abortions. And it created a generation of children who officially don't even exist.Living in the warren of back lanes that make up Beijing's older neighbourhoods, known as hutongs, Li Xue is one of these ""nobodies.""Twenty-two years ago, she was born as a second child. Officials told her parents they would have to pay a fine equivalent to about four years of their salaries.They could never afford it, so she was never registered as a Chinese citizen. She never received an ID card or ""hukou.""To this day, her birth certificate has a blank instead of her name.Li Xue points to that, as well as a pile of other rejection letters from Chinese officials.""Without a hukou,"" she says, ""I can't have a normal life. I could never go to school, never see a doctor, I can't work and I can't get married. It makes me very sad.""Sitting in their small, one-room apartment, Li Xue and her mother detail a lifetime spent challenging the system.They have confronted officials and taken them to court. They have researched the one-child law, looking for any opportunity to file complaints. They describe being harassed, followed and subjected to house arrest for their activism. Once, Li Xue's parents were even beaten by police.""They threw me to the ground,"" her mother says. ""They kicked us in the head and on our backs.""My family has suffered so much,"" she adds through tears.But none of this gave Li Xue her identity card. She is still illegal, officially a nobody.Recently, top Chinese officials promised that second children born under the old law would no longer be denied a hukou. But local officials in many parts of China still refuse to issue them or insist that the old fines need to be paid first.China may be eager for couples to take advantage of the new laws. It may be banking on bigger families to help the country's economy stay ahead.But experts say the change in policy has come too late to solve the problem. And those whose lives were ruined by the old system say nothing at all has changed for them."
Boy who had eyes gouged out in China goes home with prosthetics | CBC News,A six-year-old Chinese boy whose eyes were gouged out in an attack more than three months ago is discharged from a hospital in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen where he was successfully fitted with prosthetic eyes.,2013-12-12T14:05:42.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/guo-bin-boy-who-lost-eyes-in-attack-gets-prosthetics-1.2461100,"A six-year-old Chinese boy whose eyes were gouged out in an attack more than three months ago was discharged Thursday from a hospital in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen where he was successfully fitted with prosthetic eyes.Guo Bin — nicknamed Binbin — danced to music at a send-off ceremony at the C-MER Dennis Lam Eye Hospital, where he expressed gratitude and happiness.The prosthetic eyes look and move much like normal eyes, but do not restore vision. Doctors plan to fit Binbin with navigation sensors next summer that would allow him to get around on his own in familiar places.Police in the boy's hometown in northern China's Shanxi province say they suspect his aunt was the culprit in the attack, although they have not identified a motive. The woman has since committed suicide.On Thursday, the boy's mother said Binbin can put on his clothes, brush his teeth and climb stairs by himself, according to reports in Hong Kong media.""He has adapted well and is smart,"" mother Wang Wenli said before thanking the medical staff.The attack on the boy horrified the Chinese public and added to outrage over violence against children."

""The FDIC's intent to evade congressional oversight is a serious offence.""The report was released amid growing concern about the vulnerability of the international banking system to hackers and the latest example of how deeply Washington believes Beijing has penetrated U.S. government computers.The report did not provide specific evidence that China was behind the hack.Shane Shook, a cyber security expert who has helped investigate some of the breaches uncovered to date, said he did not see convincing evidence in the report that the Chinese government was behind the FDIC hack.""As with all government agencies, there are management issues stemming from leadership ignorance of technology oversight,"" Shook said.Speaking in Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang repeated that China opposed hacking and acted against it. People should provide evidence for their accusations and not wave around speculative words like ""maybe"" and ""perhaps"", he told reporters.""This is extremely irresponsible.""The FDIC, a major U.S. banking regulator which keeps confidential data on America's biggest banks, declined to comment.Gruenberg is scheduled to testify on Thursday before the committee on the regulator's cyber security practices.Washington has accused China of hacking computers at a range of federal agencies in recent years, including the theft of more than 21 million background check records from the federal Office of Personnel Management beginning in 2014.The compromise of the FDIC computers by a foreign government had been previously reported in May and some lawmakers had mentioned China as a possible suspect, but the report on Wednesday for the first time cited a 2013 memo by the FDIC's inspector general, an internal watchdog, as pointing toward China.""Even the former Chairwoman's computer had been hacked by a foreign government, likely the Chinese,"" the congressional report said, referring to Gruenberg's predecessor, Sheila Bair, who headed the FDIC from 2006 until 2011 when Gruenberg took over as acting chairman.Bair could not be immediately reached for comment.A redacted copy of the 2013 FDIC inspector general's memo seen by Reuters said investigators were unable to determine exactly which files had been extracted from agency computers. But a source familiar with the FDIC's internal investigation said the areas of the regulator's network that were hacked suggested the intruders were seeking ""economic intelligence.""In all, hackers compromised 12 FDIC workstations, including those of other executives such as the regulator's former chief of staff and former general counsel, and 10 servers, the congressional report said.It accused the FDIC of trying to cover up the hacks so as not to endanger the congressional approval of Gruenberg, who was nominated by President Barack Obama and confirmed by the U.S. Senate in November 2012.A witness interviewed by congressional staff said the FDIC's current head of its technology division, Russ Pittman, instructed employees not to disclose information about the foreign government's hack, the report said. The witness said the hush order was to ""avoid effecting the outcome of Chairman Gruenberg's confirmation,"" according to the report.Pittman could not immediately be contacted for comment.The report also provided details of data breaches in which FDIC employees leaving the regulator took sensitive documents with them. It said current FDIC officials have purposely concealed information about breaches that had been requested by Congress.U.S. intelligence officials believe Beijing has decreased its hacking activity since signing a pledge with Washington last September to refrain from breaking into computer systems for the purposes of commercial espionage. At the same time, Obama has acknowledged difficulties in keeping government information secure.In addition, Republican opponents have said that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server when she was secretary of state could have exposed classified information to foreign governments."
China's Hu leaves G8 summit over Xinjiang violence: report | CBC News,"Chinese President Hu Jintao has left the G8 summit in Italy to return to Beijing amid an outbreak of violence in the northwestern Xinjiang province, China's state-run Xinhua news agency reported early Wednesday.",2009-07-07T04:54:23.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/china-s-hu-leaves-g8-summit-over-xinjiang-violence-report-1.824376,"The move comes as officials in Xinjiang imposed a curfew overnight as part of a crackdown on protesters after Han Chinese clashed with Uighurs in the provincial capital on Tuesday.After bringing in riot police to break up multiple protests, the Xinjiang regional government announced that a curfew was to be imposed from 9 p.m. Tuesday to 8 a.m. Wednesday local time.The curfew is needed to ""avoid further chaos,"" said Xinjiang Communist Party secretary Wang Lequan.Riot police using loudspeakers appealed to about 300 marchers to stop their destructive behaviour as they threw rocks, smashed shop windows and knocked down food stalls run by ethnic Uighurs in Urumqi on Tuesday.Many of the protesters waved wooden sticks, pipes and shovels while chanting ""Unite"" and ""Modern society,"" according to eyewitness accounts.""They attacked us. Now it's our turn to attack them,"" a man in the crowd told Reuters.As the demonstrators entered a predominantly Muslim area and approached a mosque, police used tear gas to break up the crowd.The Han march followed an earlier protest by about 200 people from the Uighur minority that resulted in a standoff with security forces and blocked a main road.At least 156 have died in ethnic violence in the northwestern province of Xinjiang since Sunday.UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay said an extraordinarily high number of people had been killed and injured in the rioting, and she called for a full inquiry.""I urge Uighur and Han civic leaders, and the Chinese authorities at all levels, to exercise great restraint so as not to spark further violence and loss of life,"" she said. ""This is a major tragedy.""The European Union on Tuesday called for ""restraint on all sides,"" adding it ""deplores the loss of life and expresses its sympathy with the families of the victims.""Uighur expatriates also protested outside the Chinese embassies in Turkey and Norway on Tuesday.Protesters briefly scuffled with police in Ankara, and the Turkish Foreign Ministry summoned a top Chinese diplomat over the violence in China.In Oslo, at least two people were injured when roughly 100 Uighurs gathered outside the Chinese embassy. One received injuries while trying to scale the embassy fence.Protesters waved the Uighur national flag and shouted slogans such as ""Stop killing our brothers — stop killing our sisters.""The Uighurs — an ethnically Turkic, predominantly Muslim group — make up the majority in Xinjiang, a region in northwest China bordering Central Asia and Mongolia.Their relations have often been tense with the ethnic Han Chinese who predominate in the country. Many Uighurs feel they're discriminated against by the government in Beijing and a Uighur separatist movement has existed for decades.The protests started in the provincial capital of Urumqi on Sunday, when demonstrators gathered to demand justice for two Uighurs killed in June during a fight with their Han co-workers at a factory in southern China.The protests turned into the deadliest ethnic unrest in the region in decades.Speaking at a rally in Washington on Tuesday, exiled Uighur leader Rebiya Kadeer blamed the Chinese government for the violence. About 100 people chanted ""Shame on China"" as they marched to the Chinese Embassy.Chinese officials have blamed Kadeer, who heads the Uighur American Association (UAA), for inciting violence. Kadeer, who has lived in Fairfax, Va., since she was exiled from China four years ago, denies the charges."

"Decades until sex ratio falls in China, India: study | CBC News","Large parts of China and India will have an excess of young men by up to 20 per cent because of sex selection, say researchers who call on policy makers to address the causes.",2011-03-14T19:29:52.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/decades-until-sex-ratio-falls-in-china-india-study-1.1022567,"Large parts of China and India will have an excess of young men by up to 20 per cent because of sex selection, say researchers who call on policy makers to address the causes.A preference for sons in China, India and South Korea, combined with easy access to sex-selective abortions, has led to a significant imbalance between the number of males and females born in these countries, researchers say.In 2005 in China, ""it was estimated that 1.1 million excess males were born across the country and that the number of males under the age of 20 years exceeded the number of females by around 32 million,"" wrote Prof. Therese Hesketh of the UCL Centre for International Health and Development in London and her co-authors.The outlook for a generation of males entering their reproductive years in the next 20 years is ""grim,"" the team concluded in urging China to relax its one-child policy, especially in rural areas.It's also important to change the underlying problem of how girls are valued, the team argued. Historically, the sex ratio at birth or number of boys born to every 100 girls is about 105 boys for every 100 females.But after ultrasounds were introduced and sex selection became available in the mid-1980s, the gender ratio at birth in some cities in South Korea climbed to 125 by 1992, and was more than 130 in several Chinese provinces in 2005, researchers report in Monday's issue of the Canadian Medical Association Journal.Similarly in India, the gender imbalance is as high as 125 in Punjab, Delhi and Gujarat in the north but is within normal levels in the southern and eastern states of Kerala and Andhra Pradesh, the team said.A common pattern driving the change in China, India, and South Korea is that if the first- or second-born are girls then couples will often ensure the second or third child is a boy.The authors described potential consequences of high sex ratios, such as men who are unable to marry in societies where starting a family often drives social status and acceptance. They also assume that lack of opportunity to marry and have children will result in low self-esteem that could make men psychologically vulnerable.The researchers noted their ongoing work has found no evidence men are prone to aggression or violence, but their findings suggest most of these men do have low self-esteem and are inclined to depression.""This may be because there is not yet a large enough critical mass of unmated men to have an impact, or because the assumptions about male aggression do not apply in this context,"" they said.The team also pointed to potential pluses of sex selection, such as an increase in the proportion of wanted births, and placing a higher value on women as their numbers in society fall."

George Koekkoek said two of Liu's children are young and live with their father.Records show that Liu purchased a 2011 Toyota Yaris in September 2011 and was the sole buyer of a townhouse located on Huntingwood Drive in east-end Toronto in October of 2008.Koekkoek said investigators have searched Liu's home, as well as a motel in Scarborough that may be linked to her death. ""We are working on suspect information,"" he said.Police said that although what happened to Liu is horrific, it is ""an isolated case."" ""We have no reason to believe that this is anything other than an isolated case and that's the focus of our investigation thus far,"" Koekkoek said. ""We're satisfied to this stage that there's no threat or danger to the public safety. If we have information to the contrary, we'll be the first to advise.""The spa that Liu operated was known as Forget Me Not.Toronto Coun. Michael Thompson said city inspectors checked out the spa after receiving a handful of resident complaints about the business.When inspectors arrived at the business in mid-July the spa didn't appear to be operating,"" he said. Zoning and bylaw officials found nothing improper, but noted they had trouble finding Liu at the spa.""When our officers were able to speak to her she did inform them that she was in the process of selling her business,"" he said.Helen Savo-Sardaro, the building manager for the complex where the spa was located on Eglinton Avenue, told CBC News that police told her Liu left the spa at 5:30 p.m. ET on Aug. 10 — the day she disappeared.Savo-Sardaro said she knew the identity of the victim was when police revealed details about what they had found.""As soon as I heard it was yellow toenails, I knew it was her,"" she said.Savo-Sardaro was also a client at the spa. She said Liu ran a legitimate business and was very professional.Imran Bachcha, a pharmacist who works next door to the former spa, said police have requested access to the video recorded by on-site security cameras.Bachcha told CBC News that police were interested in whether the cameras covered the exterior of the pharmacy.They told him they were ""doing some major investigations regarding that missing woman,"" but Bachcha said they hadn't been back yet to get the tapes.Jong Soon Suh, the owner of a dry cleaning business located in the same complex for 18 years, said the former spa owner told her Liu was planning to leave Canada just months after opening the spa because her former husband had decided to relocate to China for work.Suh also said that she had become aware of Liu taking over the property in mid-May and was concerned with the spa because she never saw any customers enter and the front window was covered with a curtain.""The store never opened. There was no opening sign and nobody was in there,"" she said. ""When I passed by, the curtain was a little bit different shape than the other day. So I [kept] an eye on it and the next day it was a little bit different also … so that means someone gets in and gets out.""Suh said she had spoken with other business owners who also said they had never seen the spa open, while the previous owners had signs in front of the business to attract customers.Friends said that the evening Liu went missing she was scheduled to meet a prospective buyer.Shan Shanmugavadivel, a dentist at Rainbow Village Dental Office in the same complex, said he would see the previous owner in the parking lot, but never saw Liu in the area.""I saw a sign that said 'new management' but other than that I never met her and I never saw her,"" he said.Shanmugavadivel said that he rarely saw customers or employees of the spa entering or exiting the building."

Casino magnate promises to return looted sculpture to China | CBC News,Casino magnate Stanley Ho has paid $8.9 million Cdn for a bronze horse head from China's imperial palace and says he will return it to China.,2007-09-21T19:29:41.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/casino-magnate-promises-to-return-looted-sculpture-to-china-1.632814,"Casino magnate Stanley Ho has paid $8.9 million Cdn for a bronze horse head from China's imperial palace and says he will return it to China.""With this move, I hope to encourage more people to take part in preserving Chinese artifacts and to promote patriotism and nationalism,"" Ho said in the statement from auction house Sotheby's.Sotheby's released the statement Friday, saying it has cancelled a controversial auction of the bronze head scheduled for Oct. 9.In the past, there have been protests outside Hong Kong auctions featuring items from the palace, with protesters saying they were looted.The horse head is one of 12 animal heads that formed part of an elaborate water clock fountain designed by Jesuit missionaries for the summer palace in Beijing. Each animal is taken from the Chinese zodiac.In the second Opium War of 1860, British and French troops set the palace ablaze and plundered its treasures.In 2003, Ho, the man who built a gambling empire in Macau, bought a boar head from the same clock and donated it to Beijing's Poly Museum, an arm of the People's Liberation Army.After the palace was looted, the horse head was taken back to France and went into private collection, only resurfacing in 1989 in London.An unidentified Taiwanese collector paid $400,000 for the bronze relic in the 1989 London auction.Ho negotiated a private deal with the Taiwanese owner, paying the highest price ever given for a Qing Dynasty sculpture.Sotheby's said Ho planned to display the horse head in Hong Kong at a preview for other items in its sale of Chinese artifacts.It will then be displayed in his Grand Lisboa casino in Macau. Ho has not yet decided what Chinese museum will receive the artifact.The Chinese government welcomed Ho's announcement.Earlier this month, Xu Yongxiang, a buyer forthe Shanghai Museum, said the horse head was ""stolen property"" and should be returned to the Chinese government.Of the 12 animal heads from the fountain, only seven have been located.The Chinese government spent more than $4 million to buy back the tiger, ox and monkey heads at auctions. They are in the Poly Museum with the boar head.The rabbit and rat are part of a private European collection.During the Cultural Revolution, the Chinese smashed most of the cultural artifacts from their rich history."

The change is seen as a first step in eventually letting the yuan float freely. The United States and other trading partners have urged China to let its currency rise, arguing that keeping the value too low gives the Chinese an unfair competitive edge to their products in world markets. Canadian Finance Minister Ralph Goodale said the members of the G7 have been saying that increased flexibility in the Chinese exchange rate would benefit the Chinese economy and would contribute to greater stability in the global economy. ""It remains to be seen exactly how the new system will work and how much flexibility it will provide,"" Goodale said in a release. ""But this is an encouraging first step."" The U.S. administration also welcomed China's change of position. ""As we have said, reform of China's currency regime is important for China and the international financial system,"" said Treasury Secretary John Snow. The yuan will be revalued to 8.11 per U.S. dollar. Previously, the yuan had been pegged at 8.28 per U.S. dollar where it had been almost unchanged since the Asian financial crisis of 1997/98. ""It may be baby steps, but it is a long awaited adjustment that is needed in the global financial marketplace to help reverse the tremendous imbalances on trade and savings..."" said Aron Gampel, deputy chief economist at Scotiabank.

Alberta rescuers heading back to China after red tape cleared for entry | CBC News,Members of a determined Canadian rescue team from Alberta plan to return to China after initially being refused permission to enter the area devastated by a massive earthquake.,2008-05-21T13:56:03.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/alberta-rescuers-heading-back-to-china-after-red-tape-cleared-for-entry-1.703874,"Members of a determined Canadian rescue team from Alberta plan to return to China after initially being refused permission to enter the area devastated by a massive earthquake.Jet-lagged and disappointed, the searchers returned home from Hong Kong late Monday after waiting for a week because they couldn't get the necessary visas to travel to the stricken Sichuan province.Less than 12 hours later, leader Marcel Schur was told that Chinese officials have cleared up bureaucratic red tape and his team is free to travel to Sichuan to help look for survivors of the quake, which has claimed more than 40,000 lives.""We are waiting for confirmation, but the Chinese government has given us permission and has asked for us to come back there and join in the effort,"" Schur said Tuesday.""For us to be sure that we are going to be allowed in, we are going to ask for the visas to be issued in Calgary.""Dealing with Chinese officials last week was frustrating for the five men and three women on the team, who pay most of their own operating and travel expenses.Schur said it was hard to watch news reports on television about all the death and destruction as the Canadian searchers waited in vain for credentials. Officials estimate the quake destroyed the homes of five million people.""It was crazy. Everywhere you went they threw another loophole: 'You have to do this now. You have to do that,' "" he said.""It was pretty tough. Your hearts are just bleeding for these people.""The Canadian and British consulates finally advised the rescuers that the Chinese government was too bogged down to help, so they decided to leave.Schur and his colleagues are members of the Canadian Rescue Team, part of a larger group called American Rescue Team International.Doug Copp, a spokesman for the American organization, said the bureaucratic logjam also prompted a British rescue team to head back to the United Kingdom.Copp said team members have specialized training in what he called urban heavy rescue. Once in China, they will be deployed wherever the need is greatest.""We will do whatever it takes in order to save those children's lives,"" Copp said.The Chinese government has been working to set up temporary housing for victims of the May 12 quake. Officials say that 280,000 tents have been shipped to the area and 700,000 more ordered, along with 480,000 quilts and 1.7 million jackets for survivors.The Canadian team members, most of whom are from Red Deer, included brothers Marcel and Jamie Schur, Shawn Hare, Steven Steward, Randi Butler, Laurie Patterson, Ashley Johansson and Chad Reed.It was not immediately clear if all of the members would head back to China.Bev Sliger, who helps co-ordinate the team, told the Red Deer Advocate that other international rescuers have also failed to get permission to travel to the devastated region.""This is the first time anyone here from central Alberta has gone to do something like this. It's all kind of trial and error,"" she said.Foreign aide groups helping in Sichuan include a Russian mobile hospital and medical teams from Taiwan and Japan.Marcel Schur said members of the Canadian Rescue Team are determined to try again.""We all volunteer as search-and-rescue people here in Canada,"" he said. ""All we are doing is extending that to other people. They need help.""   "

Eight years ago, China admitted it took organs from those facing execution. Now, researcher and analyst Ethan Guttman says political prisoners, including members of Falon Gong and Uyghurs, are dying in Chinese prisons at the hands of surgeons harvesting their organs.Half a million dollars per body, multiplied by tens of thousands. That's the allegation. Retired Edmonton MP David Kilgour says that's what China is after when it executes prisoners of conscience and harvests their organs.Mr. Kilgour, along with Winnipeg human rights lawyer, David Matas, published a report on the alleged harvest in 2006. There was some outcry; there was skepticism. And not much action.Now, another researcher backs up the 2006 report with new research of his own. Ethan Gutmann believes members of Falun Gong, Uyghurs, Tibetans and Christians face the surgeon's fatal knife. And he says it's time countries like Canada take action.Ethan Gutmann documents his findings in his book, The Slaughter: Mass Killings, Organ Harvesting, and China's Secret Solution to Its Dissident Problem. This week, he is in Canada to address a parliamentary subcommittee on human rights. We reached him in Ottawa.We contacted the Chinese Embassy for a comment to Mr. Gutmann's allegations, but have not received a response.While some say the claims are incredible, others believe Ethan Guttman's research is a wake up call.

Chinese blast suspect arrested,,2001-03-23T00:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/chinese-blast-suspect-arrested-1.289043,"Authorities in China said on Friday they have arrested a man in connection with a string of explosions that killed at least 108 people earlier this month, and that he has confessed. Police had been searching for Jin Ruchao for a week before the blasts that ripped through four apartment blocks in the northern Chinese city of Shijiazhuang, on March 17. Jin is also a suspect in his girlfriend's murder. National newspapers and television stations had shown photographs of Jin. Jin was the main suspect of the police after the blasts. But police also believe he could have had help. Shijiazhuang is at the centre of China's textile industry, which has been hard hit recently by layoffs. The region struggles with widespread unemployment, corruption and organized crime. Another series of explosions injured 28 people in department stores and buses last September. "
Kim Jong-un the statesman? What his China visit reveals about how he's preparing to meet Donald Trump | CBC News,"Travelling on his mysterious green armoured train, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un's diplomatic route to his planned nuclear summit with the U.S. president wound its way first through Beijing. And with good strategic reason, experts say.",2018-03-28T23:44:10.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/north-korea-china-meeting-xi-kim-donald-trump-summit-1.4597945,"Travelling on his mysterious green armoured train, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un's diplomatic route to his planned nuclear summit with the U.S. president wound its way first through Beijing. And with good strategic reason, experts say.Kim's recent days-long visit to China, his first foray outside North Korea since taking power, was a surprise — one that's more than a mere diplomatic whistle stop. The journey is seen to have strengthened his hand ahead of crucial talks by reinforcing strong ties with the economic superpower. To the probable chagrin of American diplomats, experts say, Kim was able to assure that the Middle Kingdom will have a formidable seat at the negotiating table. It also presents challenges to U.S. President Donald Trump as it shows that isolation of North Korea has not succeeded, said Adam Mount, a North Korea and nuclear specialist at the Federation of American Scientists.""Frankly, I think that Kim Jong-un outflanked the Trump administration in making it to Beijing first,"" he said. ""It impresses upon the United States that Kim has other options to gain leverage. It raises the stakes for this meeting.""A date for the Trump-Kim summit is not yet set, though it's expected to happen before May. Kim has also secured a meeting with South Korean President Moon Jae-in for late April.""I'm sure they wanted to discuss and compare notes on how to talk to Donald Trump,"" Mount said of Kim's meeting with Xi.Beijing has over the years backed United Nations sanctions against Pyongyang over its nuclear and missile tests. But Kim's handshake with Chinese President Xi Jinping, shown on the front pages of Chinese newspapers, allowed Kim to play the role of legitimate statesman, while signalling the mending of frayed relations between North Korea and its only true ally.NewsAccording to a Chinese readout of the meeting, Xi told Kim, ""We speak highly of this visit."" The readout goes on to say that Kim personally informed Xi about upcoming Korean Peninsula talks ""out of comradeship and moral responsibility."" That statement was ""stunning"" to Mount as a remarkable display of support. One possible practical result of this?""If Donald Trump walks away from the meeting with Kim first, it's more likely China would lift sanctions,"" Mount said.Former U.S. State Department official Mintaro Oba, who worked on North Korea policy in the Obama administration, believes the advancements in North Korea's nuclear program and the number of high-level talks it suddenly has on the table have girded Kim's negotiating position with China as well.""Kim Jong-un is ticking a box before doing those summit meetings. He's tightening up unity so he has as many options going into other summits as possible,"" Oba said.Oba can make out the outlines of a diplomatic roadmap in Kim's political manoeuvring. What worries him, he said, is how little preparation he sees coming from Washington, where it seems to him that an integrated plan to take full advantage of a unique tactical opportunity is being taken less seriously. ""My best guess is that the United States doesn't have any real strategy for going into this,"" Oba said. ""A harsh assessment, but I think it's the right one ... It's just not clear they've figured out how to make the most use of this summit that kind of came out of nowhere.""Key staffing positions remain unfilled in the State Department. No new secretary of state has been confirmed yet by the Senate to replace Rex Tillerson.A broad framework with reasonable deliverables might start with setting up a communication hotline, the release of Americans detained in North Korea, and offers of humanitarian aid. Scoring small wins helps take control of the public narrative.""The U.S. needs to be raising this at lower levels with the North Koreans before the summit,"" he said. The White House has often claimed its apparent lack of planning is actually about playing its cards close to the vest. ""But there's a difference between giving away your negotiating position and managing public expectations before a summit,"" Oba said.The White House has framed Kim's surprise China trip as positively as possible, taking credit for the Kim-Xi meeting as ""a good indication"" that the U.S.'s ""maximum pressure"" policy against North Korea is working. The White House says it is ""cautiously optimistic"" about the development, and that the U.S.-North Korea summit is still on.Although Kim and Xi don't have a close friendship, mutual self-interest brings them together. North Korea and China both have reason to be concerned that the Trump administration could declare war. For China, that would risk driving millions of starving North Koreans to stream over its border.That the North Korean-U.S. diplomacy is beginning, not ending, with a high-level summit between the leaders is worrisome for some experts.""It's starting off at the highest levels you can get to, a meeting between two leaders of the countries,"" said Lisa Collins, a fellow with the Korea Chair at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""Normally, it's the reverse. You would build, step by step, a consensus or agreement, then it's signed off on by the two leaders.""One positive development for the Trump administration has been recent trade concessions from South Korea, which has agreed to set limits on exports of steel and open its auto market to U.S. imports in exchange for being exempt from steel tariffs. It's a timely win, said Harry Kazianis, Director of Defense Studies at the Center for the National Interest — particularly as the U.S. and South Korea need to smooth co-ordination and co-operation ahead of the few critical months in advance of talks with North Korea.The National""There was no way the U.S. was going to push some major trade action against South Korea, considering they've got this massive geopolitical crisis,"" Kazianis said. ""And there's no way there can be any daylight between Seoul and Washington right now, to risk any major ruptures with Seoul right now.""Kazianis expects a tough bargain, with the North likely proposing an end to the U.S.-South Korean alliance, withdrawal of U.S. troops from the Korean Peninsula, full recognition of North Korea as a legitimate state, billions of dollars in economic aid, and the ending of sanctions.""If this summit goes badly, we could be back at the brink of war again,"" Kazianis said. ""The challenge to putting all our eggs in the summit basket is, if this has problems, there is no diplomatic road to go down again."""
"Report says U.S. diplomats likely targeted in energy attack, unsure about Canadians | CBC News","A new report commissioned by the U.S. government suggests ""directed"" radio energy likely caused brain injuries to American diplomats posted in Cuba and China.",2020-12-06T21:45:51.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/us-diplomats-likely-targeted-in-energy-attack-1.5830651,"A new report commissioned by the U.S. government suggests ""directed"" radio energy likely caused brain injuries to American diplomats posted in Cuba and China.Yet the report by the National Academy of Sciences in Washington stops short of saying the same about Canadian diplomats and their families in Havana and instead leaves open the possibility of other causes.The report represents the latest attempt to explain the mysterious illness known as Havana syndrome that started causing headaches, dizziness and cognitive problems in American and Canadian diplomats in Cuba in 2016.Five Canadian diplomats and their families are now suing Ottawa for more than $28 million, saying the federal government failed to protect them, hid crucial information and downplayed the illness.Global Affairs Canada has previously acknowledged that nine adults and five children from diplomatic families developed unusual illnesses in Havana, with symptoms including nausea, dizziness, headaches and trouble concentrating.While the Canadian government has said it is trying to pinpoint the cause, speculation has largely focused on some kind of acoustic or microwave assault, an unknown contaminant such as a pesticide and even chirping crickets.The National Academy of Sciences report says the symptoms and features of what U.S. diplomats were experiencing were unlike any known disorder, ""including those with known infectious, inflammatory or toxic mechanism.""Rather, the report says, the diplomats' complaints of experiencing sudden pain, intense pressure in the face, a loud piercing sound in one ear and sudden dizziness and nausea were ""more consistent with a directed radio frequency energy attack.""WATCH | The Fifth Estate investigates what made the diplomats sick:The Fifth Estate""Studies published in the open literature more than a half century ago and over the subsequent decades by Western and Soviet sources provide circumstantial support for this possible mechanism,"" it later adds.Yet the report makes no such assertions on what happened to the Canadians. It instead leaves open the possibility that their illnesses were caused by a viral infection, exposure to a toxic chemical or some other factor.Paul Miller, the lawyer representing the Canadian diplomats suing the government, said that is because there are several errors in the report — including an assertion that the Canadians did not experience the same sudden pain and loud noise as their U.S. counterparts.""To suggest in any way that our clients did not have the perception of loud sounds or a sensation of intense pressure or vibration is just incorrect,"" Miller told The Canadian Press on Sunday. ""They all heard things to different degrees. One family heard it quite loudly and suffered pretty immediate injuries. Others heard it and felt unwell within a day or two.""If that information is corrected, you might see a different conclusion by the U.S. folks.""Miller noted that the U.S. researchers did not interview the Canadian diplomats. The report instead says it relied on a study by Halifax's Dalhousie University and available descriptions of the Canadians' symptoms and complaints.The Dalhousie study pointed to neurotoxins, such as pesticides used to kill mosquitos during the Zika epidemic, as the most likely reason. Miller's clients have disputed that finding, saying more people would have suffered the same symptoms if it were true.The U.S. report comes as the lawsuit between the Canadian diplomats and the federal government remains unresolved, with Miller hoping for a motion brought by the government to have the diplomats excluded heard by the court next year.Global Affairs Canada did not respond to requests for comment on Sunday."
Chinese media ignore Pope's funeral,China imposes media blackout on coverage of Pope John Paul II's funeral.,2005-04-09T00:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/chinese-media-ignore-pope-s-funeral-1.532985,"The funeral of Pope John Paul II made news around the world, but not in China. The state-controlled media blacked out all news of Friday's proceedings, with no reports or pictures. The only mention of the event concerned comments from the Chinese foreign ministry condemning Taiwan's president for going to Rome. The Vatican had tried to secure a Hong Kong visit for John Paul II in 1999, only to be rejected by Beijing. Some four million people in mainland China are members of the official church. But the Vatican says about eight million belong to the underground Catholic Church and remain loyal to the Pope. China broke diplomatic ties with the Vatican in 1951. Beijing says it won't move to establish ties until the Vatican cuts ties with Taiwan and vows not to use religion to interfere in China's internal affairs. "

The ministry is scrambling to distribute vaccines to counter the spinal disease, which has killed at least 16 people and infected more than 200 others in the past month alone. Cases of meningitis have been reported across China, with the exception of Fujian province in the southeast, Hainan in the south and Tibet. The worst hit provinces are Anhui, Henan, Hebei, Jiangsu and Sichuan. The ministry says 258 cases were reported in January alone and 546 cases since November last year. Hospitals and clinics have been ordered to step up disease prevention, surveillance and control operations in an effort to curb the spread of the outbreak. A vaccine is also to be distributed nationwide. Meningitis attacks the brain and the central nervous system. The disease is characterized by sudden onset of fever, intense headache, nausea and vomiting, stiff neck and shock, and sometimes death. "
"Bo Xilai, ousted Chinese politician, goes on trial","Disgraced Chinese politician Bo Xilai went on trial Thursday on charges of bribery, embezzlement and abuse of power, marking the ruling Communist Party's attempts to draw a line under one of its most lurid political scandals in decades.",2013-08-22T00:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/bo-xilai-ousted-chinese-politician-goes-on-trial-1.1347278,"Ousted populist Chinese politician Bo Xilai went on trial Thursday on charges of bribery, embezzlement and abuse of power, marking the ruling Communist Party's attempts to draw a line under one of its most lurid political scandals in decades.Bo entered the courthouse under police escort in the eastern city of Jinan, the court said, in closely choreographed proceedings held under extremely tight security, with police sealing off nearby roads with red and yellow traffic barriers and bundling some of the onlookers into a minivan.Though kept far away from the media, some of Bo's supporters gathered outside the perimeter, intermittently yelling out, ""He served the people!"" and ""He was a good cadre!""Once the powerful party boss in the megacity of Chongqing, the charismatic Bo became the most senior leader to fall from power in years after revelations emerged early last year that his wife had killed a British businessman.Bo's removal marked China's biggest upheaval in the leadership since the violent suppression of the Tiananmen Square pro-democracy protests in 1989. Bo's revival of the symbolism of Mao Zedong's radical era had unnerved China's previous leadership, although current leader Xi Jinping, installed last fall, has appeared keen to adopt his own brand of Mao-like tactics.Five of Bo's relatives attended the trial, the Jinan Intermediate People's Court said in a stream of posts on its Sina Weibo microblog, though the relatives were not identified. The postings were a rare display of openness for a high-profile political trial in China. Journalists from foreign media outlets were kept from the courtroom, but the court said 19 reporters were among the 110 people attending the trial.""All the seats are filled and all is in good order,"" the court said.The scandal was triggered last year when Bo's police chief, a top aide, fled to a U.S. consulate in a neighboring city, an event that embarrassed the party's leadership ahead of a key political transition. It would later emerge that the police chief had evidence of the Briton's murder, making the Bo family an international diplomatic liability for the leadership.Chinese authorities have released few details of the charges Bo faces, but analysts say they appear carefully calibrated to lay blame on Bo's individual actions and provide enough culpability to end his political career, while avoiding allegations that could expose the impunity with which top Chinese officials are believed to operate before they fall from favor.A person with direct knowledge of the case has said Bo is accused of accepting bribes amounting to more than 20 million yuan ($3.3 million) and embezzling 5 million yuan ($820,000) while he was posted to the eastern city of Dalian. The abuse of power allegation is related to his alleged attempts in Chongqing to block an investigation into the murder by his wife in late 2011 and his sacking of his police chief, reports say. A verdict of guilt is all but assured, because the outcome of such trials involving high-profile politicians in China are usually decided by backroom negotiations by politicians and handed down by the court. Bo's downfall also has been widely perceived as the result of his defeat in party infighting ahead of China's once-a-decade leadership transition last fall.""Bo Xilai's faction fell out of grace during the power struggle among top leaders,"" said Pu Zhiqiang, a prominent human rights lawyer based in Beijing. ""In reality, it does not matter what he is charged with ... because this is it is a political trial, which does not represent the spirit of law.""Bo's wife, Gu Kailai, confessed to killing Neil Heywood and was handed a suspended death sentence last year that will likely be commuted to life imprisonment. Bo's aide, Wang Lijun, was sentenced to 15 years' imprisonment for making his thwarted defection bid and helping Gu cover up the murder.Outside the court, one man held up a poster of Mao and said ""What I support is not Bo Xilai the individual, but his ideas on sharing wealth,"" before police pushed him away in attempts to prevent reporters from communicating with onlookers.That Bo enjoys residual popularity among some of the Chinese public underscores how effective the media-savvy politician was in portraying himself as a man of the people. He spoke often of tackling the burgeoning income inequality gap, and introduced housing and other social policies in Chongqing that made him beloved by the poor.Bo mobilized people in Chongqing to sing communist anthems, campaigns that resonated with people who've felt increasingly alienated from a party and government seen as corrupt and morally bankrupt.""Bo tapped into these ideas with the `red songs,' and invoked a certain kind of camaraderie and unity that has been missing,"" said Dali Yang, head of the University of Chicago Center in Beijing. ""He created in some way a moral universe that made people feel much more confident and hopeful in some ways, certainly in Chongqing.""Bo's Communist revival efforts had alarmed the consensus-minded elite in China's previous administration who were wary of the violent excesses of the Mao era and of any one politician gaining prominence. Nevertheless, the administration of current leader Xi has adopted hardline, Mao-like tactics including tight clampdowns on dissidents and the media and an ideological campaign urging cadres to purify themselves of corruption.Analysts have noted that none of the charges against Bo appear to involve the widespread human rights abuses alleged to have been carried out during his unfettered rule as Chongqing party chief, including during his much-publicized crackdown on the city's mafia gangs.Jinan resident Yu Ming, 46, questioned whether the trial would bring greater openness in China.""The real question are, did he not trample the law? Did he not violate human rights? We shouldn't just look at corruption alone,"" Yu said. ""What we are more concerned about is, after the Bo Xilai case is over, what direction will China go in? Will we have human rights? Will we have the right to vote?"""

The 14-year-old Karmapa Lama arrived in India earlier this week after a gruelling eight-day trek across the Himalayas. He left the Dalai Lama's headquarters early Sunday morning. Now he's moving to a new hiding place to escape growing media attention. The Karmapa Lama's escape from Tibet is an embarrassment for the Chinese government. It's been trying to groom the young religious leader to be loyal to China. The Karmapa Lama is the third-highest person within Tibetan Buddhism. His escape is seen as the most significant since the Dalai Lama and tens of thousands of Tibetans fled in 1959.

Some work in hospitals, some in long-term care homes, some are privately hired, but they all share one commonality. Since the beginning of COVID-19, they have been on the front lines of an international pandemic that has taken more than 1.4 million lives worldwide, including 12,000 in this country.The work they've done has been arduous and a risk to their personal safety and health, but they have persevered. The National talked to three nurses in three different provinces about their experiences, and these are their stories.Clarice Shen, 25, is an acute care nurse at Toronto's Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre. In January, just a year out of nursing school, she was caring for a patient who was exhibiting symptoms of a virus that didn't even have a name yet.He turned out to be the first patient to test positive with COVID-19 in Canada.""There was a lot of uncertainty, but as a team, we kind of came together and supported ourselves,"" Shen said.When it became clear the hospital needed to expand the intensive care unit, Shen volunteered to work in the ICU to support the staff there. She's been on 12-hour shifts in the ICU ever since.A number of the things she has experienced when dealing with COVID-19 patients were new to her.""From a nursing standpoint, the fact that a lot of patients with the virus get sick really, really fast — they can present to the hospital with very mild symptoms, and they can progress very, very quickly to the point where mechanical ventilation is needed — I was really taken aback. Because it is really traumatic to be put on a ventilator,"" Shen said.In her time in the ICU, Shen has helped care for dozens of COVID-19 patients and says most people don't realize how hard it is to be intubated.""I was caring for a patient on a ventilator and he had this thing where his body just on and off twitched, where his teeth would bite down on the ventilator. And his teeth were actually coming out, like, he bit off part of his tongue and his teeth were coming out, and there was blood everywhere,"" Shen said.As hospital rules changed, Shen has had to tell the families of seriously ill patients that they could no longer visit, or that they must cut visits short. She says she's tried to address the frustration she deals with daily by maintaining compassion.""I never imagined that I'd be in a position to tell someone 'you can't visit your loved one in the hospital,'"" Shen said.""I try to help them understand what it is that we're trying to do … helping them feel that I'm on their side, even though the situation might be really challenging.""And Shen has held the hands of many patients in the ICU while they passed. Too many times, she says, a patient's condition has worsened and they've succumbed to COVID-19 so quickly that their families couldn't get there in time.CBC NewsOne recent instance sticks in her mind, when she was at the bedside of a woman who died before her two daughters could get to the hospital. Shen was covering a break for the nurse who was the patient's primary care provider, so she didn't know the patient very well.""All I could really tell her is that I loved the colour of her nails, and that her hair was beautiful, and that her daughters loved her. So I eventually just told her over and over again that her daughters wished that they could be here,"" Shen said.""It's important she didn't feel alone. I mean, it's an honour and a privilege that I can be there for patients in their final moments.""As cases reach record highs in Toronto and the city finds itself in a second lockdown, Shen says she wishes people could see what she sees in one shift in the ICU. She thinks it would scare them as much as it does her, and help keep them vigilant against contracting or spreading the virus.""You know, last week you had two COVID patients in the hospital. And this week you have 15, and two waiting in the ER, and you have no beds in the ICU. And then you're trying to get people out of the ICU who would benefit, potentially, from a few more days of staying there, because you need that bed. So, that is scary for me,"" Shen said.Meaghan Thumath is a registered nurse who wears many hats.She works with homeless and marginalized communities in Vancouver's notorious downtown East side. She also teaches nursing, does clinical research, and participates in international deployments with The World Health Organization that have included work on Ebola and other outbreaks overseas.Since the outbreak of COVID-19, Thumath has been harnessing her experience to care for patients in Vancouver who are largely without other options.""Sometimes that can look like a homeless camp. Sometimes it's a single-room occupancy building that's owned by a private owner. Sometimes it's a homeless shelter, and sometimes it's a supported-housing facility,"" Thumath said. ""We find people where they are.""Thumath's patients are often dealing with many more issues than just possible exposure to COVID-19.""So we are seeing a sort of twinning of the overdose crisis as well as COVID-19. And then on top of that, people are still struggling with HIV, and Hepatitis C, and other infections,"" Thumath said.She points out that asking homeless people to self-isolate or quarantine when they are exposed to COVID-19 presents added challenges that most Canadians with a place to live can't begin to understand.Part of her job is also training shelter workers in best practices for when people with symptoms show up on their doorsteps.Thumath says she does the work, and takes the personal risks associated with it, because of how rewarding it is.""It's a huge honour, because people are so grateful for your help. I think if you can treat people with dignity, and be trauma-informed and understand sometimes people might be scared, generally people are extremely grateful,"" she said.CBC NewsThe personal risks she takes are significant. Thumath recently returned from a trip with the World Health Organization to South Africa, assisting with the pandemic response there.She was also part of the team that helped repatriate people from Wuhan, China, to Canadian Forces Base Trenton in the spring this year. It was on that assignment that Thumath contracted the virus herself.She says that experience helps her better understand what her patients are facing.The toll her work has had on her family is something that weighs on her as well. Thumath is married and has two children. She writes goodbye letters to them every time she is deployed somewhere in case she doesn't return.""I'm grateful to my husband for being supportive, but it does weigh on me,"" she says. ""That's the hardest thing — a drawer full of letters to them just in case I don't come back.""Shaye Fleming has been off work since September. That's when the 29-year-old caught COVID-19 while on a regular shift as a cardiac nurse at Calgary's Foothills Medical Centre.""It's been over two months now, and I'm just starting to feel a little bit back to normal,"" she said.""I still get quite short of breath, and this isn't like me, you know? I usually can run, walk, like, usually I'm quite active.""The ongoing impact of the virus has left Fleming frustrated, and feeling another emotion she says she wasn't expecting.""I've been experiencing a lot of anxiety with it as well. When you're young you think you'll be fine, and I was one of those people that wasn't worried about getting it. And so the fact that it has been a prolonged recovery period, and I'm lacking a lot of that stamina that I once had, yeah, it's been hard for sure,"" she said.Fleming has tried to return to work twice, but was unable to both times. Her symptoms have continued to be too debilitating.She hopes to try again this week. Not being able to go back to work has only added to her stress, she said.""I haven't been able to be there, and be a support for my co-workers and my colleagues,"" Fleming said. ""So, you know, that shame of not being able to go back to work when I felt like I should have been OK, that makes you feel pretty shameful as well.""As cases spike in Alberta and around the country, Fleming says she hopes people heed social distancing requirements and listen to public health officials. But she adds that regardless of how people approach the pandemic, nurses will always be there to care for them if they fall ill, even though providing that care means a risk to their own health.""We will care for your loved ones and for you, regardless of what you believe in and what you value at the moment during this pandemic,"" she said. ""Nurses will always be there for you.""CBC News"

Chinese astronauts blast off on historic mission,"China has launched its historic space docking mission, carrying the country's first female astronaut into space.",2012-06-16T00:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/chinese-astronauts-blast-off-on-historic-mission-1.1202532,"China launched its most ambitious space mission yet on Saturday, carrying its first female astronaut and two male colleagues in an attempt to dock with an orbiting module and work on board for more than a week.The Shenzhou 9 capsule lifted off as scheduled at 6:37 p.m. local time (1237 GMT) evening from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center on the edge of the Gobi Desert. All systems functioned normally and, just over 10 minutes later, it opened its solar panels and entered orbit.Female astronaut Liu Yang, 33, and two male crew members — veteran astronaut Jing Haipeng and newcomer Liu Wang — are to dock the spacecraft with a prototype space lab launched last year in a key step toward building a permanent space station.Two of the astronauts will live and work inside the module to test its life-support systems while the third will remain in the capsule to deal with any unexpected emergencies.China is hoping to join the United States and Russia as the only countries to send independently maintained space stations into orbit. It is already one of just three nations to have launched manned spacecraft on their own.Another manned mission to the module is planned for later this year, while possible future missions could include sending a man to the moon.[IMAGEGALLERY galleryid=2572 size=small]The program is a source of enormous national pride for China, reflecting its rapid economic and technological progress and ambition to rank among the world's leading nations.At a sending off ceremony for the astronauts, the ruling Communist Party's No. 2 official, Wu Bangguo, told the crew, ""The country and people await your victorious return.""The module, called Tiangong 1, is only a prototype, and the plan is to replace it with a larger permanent space station due for completion around 2020.That station is to weigh about 60 tons, slightly smaller than NASA's Skylab of the 1970s and about one-sixth the size of the 16-nation International Space Station.China has only limited co-operation in space with other nations and its exclusion from the ISS, largely on objections from the United States, was one of the key spurs for it to pursue an independent space program 20 years ago.China first launched a man into space in 2003 followed by a two-man mission in 2005 and a three-man trip in 2008 that featured the country's first space walk.In November 2011, the unmanned Shenzhou 8 successfully docked twice with Tiangong 1 by remote control.The selection of the first female astronaut is giving the space program an additional publicity boost.""Arranging for women astronauts to fly is not only a must for the development of human spaceflight, but also the expectation of the public,"" space program spokeswoman Wu Ping said. ""This is a landmark event.""Speaking Friday, Liu Yang said: ""We won't let you down. We will work together and successfully complete this mission."""

Moncton auction house sells rare teacup for $400 in online auction | CBC News,A Moncton auction house is on the lookout for more rare teacups after one known as the Aynsley teacup was sold for $400 during an online auction.,2020-10-25T11:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/nb-moncton-rare-teacup-online-auction-1.5770623,"Do you have an Aynsley teacup in your cupboard? A Moncton auction house is on the lookout for more rare teacups after an Aynsley teacup sold for $400 during an online auction. Key Auctions owner Jared Steeves said it has four large cabbage roses painted inside the cup and on the saucer. The rim and handle of the teacup are gold rimmed. The saucer is as well. Aynsley China was a producer of English bone china in London. ""At the 1920 mark they were miles ahead of most of the companies that came after them,"" Steeves said. ""The quality was there, the patterns and just that extra detail."" Steeves said they were surprised at the bidding for the teacup, which was auctioned on its own in a single lot. ""The internet brought the world a lot closer. The winning bidder is from New York."" Steeves said the buyer spotted it online during the week and followed it to the end. While his company has sold thousands of teacups in the 15 years he's been in business, Steeves said this sale was a record for Key Auctions in the cup and saucer category.After putting a post on the company's Facebook page asking for Aynsley, Royal Albert and Paragon cups and saucers with paintings inside the cup, many have posted pictures to see if what they have in their cupboards or china cabinets are of any value. ""We've been busy,"" said Steeves of comments and pictures he's looked at over several days. ""I think we have had some success."" Steeves said it takes a lot of work and a lot of calls to find the 'diamond in the rough', but he says they may have another one. ""When you get a painted saucer and a painted interior of a cup, that puts you in the ten per cent above the rest already.""  From there he said check for the maker such as Aynsley and Royal Albert. ""You've got some cups, feel free to send some pictures along."" Steeves said everything is worth something and some are worth more than others.  Those exceptions can be found in every category. ""Once in awhile you do find it."" "
Gold soars on European debt worries,Gold soared for a second day as markets worried about European debt and slowing Chinese growth.,2011-07-06T00:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/gold-soars-on-european-debt-worries-1.1086529,"Gold soared for a second day as markets worried about European debt and slowing Chinese growth.August bullion closed up $16.50 at $1,529.20 US an ounce. It has gained $36.50, or more than three per cent, in two days as investors buy the metal perceived to be a safe haven amid growing risks in the global economy.Canada exported $5.4 billion worth of gold in 2009.""The markets have continued to shed risk after Moody's downgraded Portugal's debt to junk status, which has everyone focusing on the rest of the (European) sovereign debt status,"" CanadianForex vice-president John Curran said.""Adding to the risk off scenario was China's interest rate hike overnight as officials there try to engineer a soft landing for a rocketing economy.""""That store of value that gold has as a currency type of investment, that is there,"" said John Kurgan, senior trader with futures broker Lind Waldock.""So rather than people really dumping on the euro and selling it or even buying the U.S. dollar, money is starting to come back into gold. Gold is winning out.""On Tuesday, Moody's cited concerns that Portugal will not be able to meet targets to reduce its deficit  due to the ""formidable challenge"" it is facing in cutting spending.It said the country will likely follow Greece in needing a second rescue package.Portugal took a $110 billion bailout from its European partners and the International Monetary Fund earlier this year after nervous investors began charging it unsustainably steep returns on loans.The downgrade led debt markets to push Portugal's borrowing rates higher and stocks lower on Wednesday.The yield in Portugal's auction of three-month Treasury bills was 4.926 per cent — up from 4.863 per cent on the same bills in mid-June and not far from the record 4.967 per cent on June 1.The yield on Portuguese 10-year bonds surged to 13 per cent, while the Lisbon stock exchange fell three per cent with banks recording the steepest drops.Spain and Italy were dragged into the downturn, adding new momentum to Europe's sovereign debt crisis.Madrid's main stock index fell 1.2 per cent and its bond yields rose. Spain, a much bigger country, until now has managed to dodge major fallout from the continent's fiscal woes.In Italy, stocks lost 2.4 per cent on concerns that spending cuts might not be enough to bring down its high debt.The idea that the crisis might grow to engulf larger economies is a looming threat for markets. Rescuing Spain and Italy would be many times more expensive than all the bailouts the EU has paid for so far.""The increasing risk is Italy gets caught up further in the contagion, and the bond market vigilantes dictate a more abrupt pace for its adjustment,"" said Alan Ruskin, an analyst at Deutsche Bank.At the same time, China raised a key interest rate for a third time this year as it tries to cool surging inflation. The benchmark rate for one-year loans will be raised 0.25 percentage points to 6.56 per cent after inflation hit a 34-month high of 5.5 per cent in May.The Chinese cabinet's planning agency said June inflation, due to be reported next week, is likely to exceed May's level due to a jump in food costs blamed on summer floods that damaged crops."

"McCallum says he tried to improve conditions for Kovrig, Spavor in Chinese prison | CBC News",One of Canada's most controversial ex-ambassadors to China says he repeatedly tried to improve the living conditions of Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor after their imprisonment in the People's Republic almost two years ago.,2020-11-25T01:09:05.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/chong-champagne-china-committee-1.5815179,"One of Canada's most controversial ex-ambassadors to China says he repeatedly tried to improve the living conditions of Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor after their imprisonment in the People's Republic almost two years ago. John McCallum also said Tuesday he regrets speaking about the October 2019 Canadian election in a meeting with Chinese officials in the months leading up to it. McCallum, the former Liberal cabinet minister who was fired as Canada's envoy to China in January 2019, was testifying at the special House of Commons committee on Canada-China relations. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau fired McCallum after he made a series of public comments that broke with the government's line following the arrests of Kovrig and Spavor. The two men were arrested nine days after Canada's arrest of Chinese high-tech scion Meng Wanzhou in December 2018 on a U.S. extradition warrant in what is widely viewed as retaliation by China. McCallum said that's when everything changed in Canada's relations with China. ""From that moment onwards, the top priority of the government and of myself as ambassador was to secure the release of the two Michaels,"" said McCallum, noting that he has been one of the few people to visit them in prison. ""On more than one occasion, I tried to convince the Chinese that if they were unable to release Kovrig and Spavor they should at least improve their living conditions. Sadly, as you all know, Canadian efforts in this area have so far been unsuccessful."" The committee has been examining Canada's relations with China, which have plummeted to an all-time low since December 2018.Earlier Tuesday, Conservative MP Michael Chong urged Foreign Affairs Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne to adopt a more consistent approach to getting tough with China. The Conservative foreign affairs critic told Champagne during a House of Commons committee meeting Tuesday that the government needs to show Canadians how it will deal with growing Chinese intimidation of Canadians within Canada. Chong said it is inconsistent for the government to be talking tougher on China, while Canada's current ambassador, Dominic Barton, is making speeches about the need to broaden trade with the People's Republic. ""I think it needs to be a lot clearer, a lot more consistent if Canada is going to have a clear, consistent voice with respect to China on the world stage,"" said Chong. Chong sponsored a motion that won approval in the Commons last week that calls on the government to decide within 30 days whether to allow China's Huawei Technologies to supply equipment for its next generation 5G internet network. Meng is a chief executive of Huawei. Champagne replied that Canada has taken a smart and firm approach with China lately that includes speaking out against its ill treatment of pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong and of ethnic Muslim Uighurs. ""Whether it comes to the Uighurs or whether it comes to Hong Kong, I've outlined places where we're going to challenge China, places where we're going to, for example, coexist with China,"" Champagne said."

"U.S. Congresswoman calls out Nike, Apple and Coca-Cola for lobbying against Uighur labour bill | CBC Radio",U.S. Democratic Congresswoman Jennifer Wexton says the onus should be on companies to prove their products weren't made using forced labour.,2020-12-02T22:55:13.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/radio/asithappens/as-it-happens-wednesday-edition-1.5825235/u-s-congresswoman-calls-out-nike-apple-and-coca-cola-for-lobbying-against-uighur-labour-bill-1.5825242,"Read Story TranscriptU.S. Democratic congresswoman Jennifer Wexton says the onus should be on companies to prove their products weren't made using forced labour. That's why she co-sponsored the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act and authored the Uyghur Forced Labor Disclosure Act, which aim to crack down on companies that profit off the persecution of Uighur Muslims in China.The UN estimates there are at least one million Uighurs in mass detention camps in the country's Xinjiang region, where they are forced into labour and so-called re-education programs. The Prevention Act would ban the use of products tied to the forced labour of Uighurs, while the Disclosure Act would force companies to report their ties to the Xinjiang region to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Both bills have passed through U.S. House of Representatives with bipartisan support and are now in the Senate.But some of the companies whose supply chains have ties to Xinjiang — including Apple, Nike, and Coca-Cola — are paying big money to lobbying firms to water down the bill, according to the New York Times.Coca-Cola told the Times it ""strictly prohibits any type of forced labour"" in its supply chain. Nike said it wasn't lobbying against the bill, but rather having ""constructive discussions"" with congressional staff about how to eliminate forced labour. Apple also denied trying to weaken the bill, stating that ""looking for the presence of forced labour is part of every supplier assessment we conduct and any violations of our policies carry immediate consequences, including business termination."" But Wexton says if these companies truly had nothing to hide, they would leave the bills alone. Here is part of her conversation with As It Happens host Carol Off. Just remind people what's going on in Xinjiang.Well, the Chinese government has been rounding up Uighur Muslims for years and putting them in camps and forcing them to work in factories, not just in Xinjiang but in other parts of China as well, solely for the crime of being Uighur. And it's horrifying and it needs to stop.There is evidence that they are being used in labour camps or in labour situations to manufacture, isn't [there]?Yes. And in fact, the Chinese Communist Party is building more and more of these camps and accelerating the use of them.The companies principally who are lobbying ... to have changes to your bills, are Apple, Nike, Coca-Cola [and] the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. What are they trying to do? What changes do they want to make to your laws? Well, I don't know, because they haven't come to me to try to make changes to my piece of legislation, but the word is that they're trying to water down some of the enforcement provisions while publicly proclaiming that they are very much against and condemning forced labour. They're going behind the scenes and trying to change the law.If they're against it, if they say that this is not in their interest, then why would they want to change your bills?Because it's going to impact their supply chains and make it harder for them to profit off of this forced labour. Which means that they're using the forced labour? If they're not using it, it wouldn't be a problem. But, you know, it appears that they are using it. And if they are auditing their supply chains the way they're supposed to, this legislation wouldn't be an issue. Is it also the case, though, that they just want more time ... to implement it, to change their supply chains in order to accommodate this?If they wanted more time, they can come to us and see about getting an extension of time to implement these rules and regulation. But, you know, as I said, they haven't approached me about it. How powerful are the lobbyists for these companies?They're quite powerful. I'm not particularly optimistic, but I know that we have a new administration coming in, in January. And I know that the incoming [Joe] Biden administration takes human rights very seriously. But we do know that the New York Times is reporting that there are millions of dollars being spent on the lobbying of Congress in order to alter these bills. Yes, and that means that there's a lot of money at stake for their profits...

"U.S. congresswoman calls out Nike, Apple and Coca-Cola for lobbying against Uighur labour bills | CBC Radio",U.S. Democratic congresswoman Jennifer Wexton says the onus should be on companies to prove their products weren't made using forced labour.,2020-12-02T22:55:13.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/radio/asithappens/as-it-happens-wednesday-edition-1.5825235/u-s-congresswoman-calls-out-nike-apple-and-coca-cola-for-lobbying-against-uighur-labour-bills-1.5825242,"Read Story TranscriptU.S. Democratic congresswoman Jennifer Wexton says the onus should be on companies to prove their products weren't made using forced labour. That's why she co-sponsored the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act and authored the Uyghur Forced Labor Disclosure Act, which aim to crack down on companies that profit off the persecution of Uighur Muslims in China.The UN estimates there are at least one million Uighurs in mass detention camps in the country's Xinjiang region, where they are forced into labour and so-called re-education programs. The Prevention Act would ban the use of products tied to the forced labour of Uighurs, while the Disclosure Act would force companies to report their ties to the Xinjiang region to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Both bills have passed through U.S. House of Representatives with bipartisan support and are now in the Senate.But some of the companies whose supply chains have ties to Xinjiang — including Apple, Nike, and Coca-Cola — are paying big money to lobbying firms to water down the bill, according to the New York Times.Coca-Cola told the Times it ""strictly prohibits any type of forced labour"" in its supply chain. Nike said it wasn't lobbying against the bill, but rather having ""constructive discussions"" with congressional staff about how to eliminate forced labour. Apple also denied trying to weaken the bill, stating that ""looking for the presence of forced labour is part of every supplier assessment we conduct and any violations of our policies carry immediate consequences, including business termination."" But Wexton says if these companies truly had nothing to hide, they would leave the bills alone. Here is part of her conversation with As It Happens host Carol Off. Just remind people what's going on in Xinjiang.Well, the Chinese government has been rounding up Uighur Muslims for years and putting them in camps and forcing them to work in factories, not just in Xinjiang but in other parts of China as well, solely for the crime of being Uighur. And it's horrifying and it needs to stop.There is evidence that they are being used in labour camps or in labour situations to manufacture, isn't [there]?Yes. And in fact, the Chinese Communist Party is building more and more of these camps and accelerating the use of them.The companies principally who are lobbying ... to have changes to your bills, are Apple, Nike, Coca-Cola [and] the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. What are they trying to do? What changes do they want to make to your laws? Well, I don't know, because they haven't come to me to try to make changes to my piece of legislation, but the word is that they're trying to water down some of the enforcement provisions while publicly proclaiming that they are very much against and condemning forced labour. They're going behind the scenes and trying to change the law.If they're against it, if they say that this is not in their interest, then why would they want to change your bills?Because it's going to impact their supply chains and make it harder for them to profit off of this forced labour. Which means that they're using the forced labour? If they're not using it, it wouldn't be a problem.

"'Modest' global growth, commodities weakness worry G20","Financial leaders from the Group of 20 nations said on Friday they were heartened by a recent recovery in financial markets, but warned that global growth was 'modest and uneven' and threatened by weakness in commodities-based economies.",2016-04-15T00:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/g20-imf-meeting-washington-1.3537311,"Financial leaders from the Group of 20 nations said on Friday they were heartened by a recent recovery in financial markets, but warned that global growth was ""modest and uneven"" and threatened by weakness in commodities-based economies.In a communique issued after their meeting in Washington, G20 finance ministers and central bank governors repeated their pledge to refrain from competitive currency devaluations, but offered no new initiatives to keep growth from stalling.The G20 officials took a slightly more positive view on financial markets, which they said had mostly recovered from sharp selloffs earlier this year and were in better shape since they last met in Shanghai in February.""However, growth remains modest and uneven, and downside risks and uncertainties to the global outlook persist against the backdrop of continued financial volatility, challenges faced by commodity exporters and low inflation,"" they said.The communique also pointed to Britain's possible exit from the European Union, geopolitical conflicts, terrorism and refugee flows as complications for the global economic landscape.The statement repeated G20 pledges to ""use fiscal policy flexibly"" to strengthen growth, job creation and confidence. It kept language that member countries ""will continue to explore policy options,"" adding that they would be ""tailored to country circumstances.""The G20 nations also maintained their previous pledges to consult closely on exchange rates.""We reaffirm our previous exchange rate commitments, including that we will refrain from competitive devaluation and we will not target our exchange rates for competitive purposes. We will resist all forms of protectionism,"" they said.The G20 gathering, the highlight of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank spring meetings in Washington, came amid growing pressure on richer nations to boost infrastructure spending, deregulate industries and spur employment.Earlier this week the IMF cut its 2016 growth forecast for the world economy, the fourth such move in less than a year.The meetings this week also coincided with weakness in a number of key commodity-based economies, particularly Brazil, which is enduring its worst recession in decades.After release of the so-called ""Panama Papers"" earlier this month stirred up controversy over global elites' widespread use of off-shore tax havens to shield their wealth, the G20 officials strengthened their pledge to implement measures to combat exploitation of tax law mismatches and improve tax information sharing.They said ""defensive measures will be considered by G20 members against non-cooperative jurisdictions"" if progress towards these goals is not made."
"Bi Fujian, Chinese TV anchor, caught on video criticizing Mao","China's main state broadcaster, CCTV, will investigate one of its anchors after a video of him insulting the founder of modern China, Mao Zedong, went viral on social media sites.",2015-04-09T00:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/bi-fujian-chinese-tv-anchor-caught-on-video-criticizing-mao-1.3025968,"China's main state broadcaster, CCTV, will investigate one of its anchors after a video of him insulting the founder of modern China, Mao Zedong, went viral on social media sites.Mao, who died in 1976, remains a divisive figure.His image adorns banknotes and his embalmed body attracts hundreds, if not thousands, of visitors a day to Beijing.While the ruling Communist Party has acknowledged Mao made mistakes, there has yet to be an official accounting for the chaos of the Cultural Revolution or the millions of deaths from starvation during the 1958-61 Great Leap Forward.In a brief statement released on its website late on Wednesday, CCTV said the remarks of its anchor Bi Fujian ""had a serious social impact"".""We will seriously handle the matter in line with related regulations and based on careful investigation,"" it said without elaborating.In the video, which is still circulating on social media sites, Bi sings parts of a Cultural Revolution-era opera called Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy, and then inserts his own comments, including that Mao lead the people to misery.Reuters was unable to contact Bi, and he did not respond to a request for comment left on his Weibo microblog. He last updated his microblog on Feb. 19.Mao has also become a potent symbol for leftists within the Communist Party who feel that three decades of market-based reform have gone too far, creating social inequalities like a yawning rich-poor gap and pervasive corruption.However, the decision to investigate Bi has generated much anger on the internet, with many people saying he should not be rebuked. On one Weibo poll, 80 per cent of respondents said Bi should not apologize.""Criticizing Mao in private is something that can still be hyped up? It's been done in public not only overseas but also in China,"" wrote prominent liberal economist Mao Yushi on his microblog.The Global Times, a tabloid published by the Communist Party's official People's Daily, said Bi, 56, was known for hosting a CCTV talent show. He has also hosted CCTV's Chinese New Year's special since 2011.The network is viewed by the government as an enormously influential and useful propaganda tool abroad, and at home where authorities keep a tight rein on domestic media.However, CCTV has faced allegations of corruption, and its staid format and repetitive programming means it has struggled to win over a younger audience which can easily access online racier content from Hong Kong, Taiwan, South Korea and the United States."

That could help stimulate demand for metals, a key export from Canada to China.There seemed little to account for the continued rise in oil prices but last week's news about the slowdown in oil production.However, a report from Bloomberg said that money has continued to pour into oil stocks and oil plays despite the drop in prices that took WTI from over $100 US to less than $50 last month.Investors have few alternatives as stock prices are back near their peaks. Many hedge funds and private equity investors are snapping up energy stocks because they've been beaten down by the market. Oil firms attempting to recapitalize to get through the downturn are having less trouble than expected finding investors.The TSX was up 52 points at 15412.The Dow rose 208 points or 1.2 per cent to 18034 and the S&P 500 was up 19 points at 2100.There have been dire reports in the past two weeks about a dismal earnings season for U.S. companies, with profits set to decline in a dismal first quarter.But some results that came in today defied those expectations. Financial institution Morgan Stanley saw its net income rise by 60 per cents to $2.3 billion US.However, Halliburton, the oilfield services company, saw a net loss of $643 million, or 76 cents a share as drilling declined. "

President-elect Joe Biden has said he will rejoin the global pact.",2020-11-22T20:43:04.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/trump-slams-paris-accord-biden-rejoin-1.5812002,"U.S. President Donald Trump railed against the Paris climate accord on Sunday, telling world leaders at the G20 summit that the agreement was designed to cripple the U.S. economy, not save the planet.President-elect Joe Biden, a Democrat who takes office in January, has said he will rejoin the global pact that the U.S. helped forge five years ago.Trump contended the international accord was ""not designed to save the environment. It was designed to kill the American economy.""""To protect American workers, I withdrew the United States from the unfair and one-sided Paris climate accord, a very unfair act for the United States,"" Trump said in a video statement from the White House to the Group of 20 virtual summit hosted by Saudi Arabia. His comments came during a discussion among the world's largest economies on safeguarding the Earth.Trump, who has worked to undo most of Barack Obama's efforts to fight climate change when he was U.S. president, said that since withdrawing from the climate agreement, the U.S. has reduced carbon emissions more than any nation.That is true, but not that remarkable. With its giant economy, the U.S. has far more raw emissions of climate-damaging carbon dioxide to cut than any other country except China.A more telling measure of progress in various countries is to look at what percentage of emissions a country has cut. Since 2005, the U.S. hasn't been even in the top 10 in percentage of greenhouse gas emission reductions.More than 180 nations have ratified the accord, which aims to keep the increase in average temperatures worldwide ""well below"" 2 C and ideally no more than 1.5 C, compared with pre-industrial levels. Scientists say that any rise beyond 2 C could have a devastating impact on large parts of the world, raising sea levels, stoking tropical storms and worsening droughts and floods.The U.S. formally exited the Paris pact on Nov. 4. On Saturday, it formally left the Open Skies Treaty, which permits 30-plus nations to conduct unarmed observation flights over each other's territory. Those overflights were set up decades ago to promote trust and avert conflict.The administration said it wanted out of the treaty because Russia was violating the pact, and imagery collected during the flights can be obtained quickly at less cost from U.S. or commercial satellites.During the discussions at the climate session, President Xi Jinping of China, the world's largest emitter, said the G20 should continue to take the lead in tackling climate change and push for the full implementation of the Paris accord.""Not long ago, I announced China's initiative to scale up its nationally determined contributions and strive to peak carbon dioxide emissions by 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2060,"" he said. ""China will honour its commitment and see the implementation through.""India's prime minister, Narendra Modi, said that ""climate change must be fought not in silos, but in an integrated, comprehensive and holistic way."""
Former Olympic hurdles champ Liu Xiang retires,"Former Olympic champion hurdler Liu Xiang confirmed his retirement on Tuesday, citing age and injuries 21⁄2 years after his last race.",2015-04-07T00:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/sports/olympics-sochi-old/liu-xiang-olympic-hurdles-champ-officially-retires-1.3023241,"Former Olympic champion hurdler Liu Xiang confirmed his retirement on Tuesday, citing age and injuries 2½ years after his last race.The 31-year-old Liu wrote in a lengthy statement on his microblog titled ""My Track, My Hurdle"" that he was ""truly unwell and old and can no longer run and jump with you.""""Although it's sad, although it's painful, I really have no other choice,"" Liu wrote.Liu became the first Chinese man to win Olympic gold in athletics at the 2004 Athens Games in the 110-metre hurdles, in a then-world record time. He set another world record in 2005, and won at the world championships in 2007.The Shanghai native hasn't competed since withdrawing at the London Olympics in 2012 after rupturing his Achilles tendon.He pulled out of the 2008 Beijing Games with a similar injury, and years of treatment have apparently failed to fix the problem.Given his experiences at the Beijing and London Games, Chinese sports officials said Liu would not return to competition before making a full recovery. However, Achilles injuries are difficult to heal, and many sprinters never return to their previous best.In his statement, Liu said he hoped to recover after London, but ""my foot told me no again and again, and there was no way it was going to be able to handle intense training and competition.""I hate my foot, I love my track and my hurdle so much, and if I hadn't injured my foot ... but then there are no 'ifs' in this world, I injured myself, and can only accept it silently.""Over his career, he became one of China's highest-earning sports stars, joining the elite ranks of former NBA star Yao Ming and tennis champion Li Na.Liu's plans to retire had been long expected, and were reported by a Shanghai newspaper last week.Regarding his future, Liu, who began hurdling at age 13, said he planned to ""begin a new journey"" by completing his education, and hoped to contribute to Chinese sports development, and increase China's international influence in the athletics world.Liu had already announced he did not expect to compete at the world championships in Beijing in August, although he said he hoped to ""take part in the event in another role."" Last month, he appeared at a promotional event for the competition but left without speaking to the media."

"Strong typhoon leaves 42 dead, 20 missing in Philippines | CBC News","Thick mud and debris coated many villages around Manila on Friday after a typhoon killed at least 42 people and caused extensive flooding that sent people fleeing to their roofs, officials said.",2020-11-13T21:54:47.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/philippines-typhoon-1.5801705,"Thick mud and debris coated many villages around Manila on Friday after a typhoon killed at least 42 people and caused extensive flooding that sent people fleeing to their roofs, officials said.Troops, police, coast guard and disaster-response teams rescued tens of thousands of people, including many who flooded radio and TV networks and social media with desperate pleas for help.Floodwaters receded and the weather cleared in many areas after Typhoon Vamco blew out into the South China Sea on Friday, but the military said it was still rescuing people trapped in some flooded communities.Amphibious assault vehicles usually used in counter-insurgency operations were deployed for the rescue work, military chief of staff Gen. Gilbert Gapay said in a meeting with disaster-response officials.""We'll continue to look for the missing, help in damage assessment,"" Gapay said.The national police reported that the death toll had risen to at least 42 with 20 missing. The government's main disaster-response agency, which waits for provincial reports and follows a laborious process of verifying casualties, reported a much lower death count, causing confusion.Among the dead were at least 12 villagers who were dug out from mud and rockslides in the northern provinces of Cagayan and Nueva Vizcaya, police said.After slamming into northeastern Quezon province, Vamco gained strength with sustained winds of 155 km/h and gusts of up to 255 km/h. It blew north of metropolitan Manila overnight Wednesday, toppling trees and power poles, swelling rivers, flooding residential communities and setting off landslides and storm surges.In hard-hit Marikina city in the capital region and the towns of Rodriguez and Cainta in nearby Rizal province, several villages were inundated by water that reached the second and third floors of many houses, prompting hundreds of residents to flee to their roofs and call TV and radio networks or post desperate messages on social media. The panic was exacerbated by widespread power outages and loss of internet access.Videos of Marikina showed a thick coat of muddy water covering roads and staining houses and cars. Residents carried appliances and furniture from their homes and used pails and shovels to remove the mud after the water receded.In a televised meeting of Cabinet and disaster-response officials Friday, a reporter asked where President Rodrigo Duterte was, prompting an annoyed response from his spokesperson.""The president's whereabouts should not be asked. That's foolishness coming from the opposition. The president is not missing. He is always with us,"" Harry Roque said, without offering any further details.<a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/RedCross?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#RedCross</a> Laguna Chapter helping residents of flooded areas in Sta.

Government offices were closed and most classes were suspended Friday.Vamco hit the Philippines on the heels of Typhoon Goni, one of the strongest typhoons in the world this year, which left more than 30 people dead or missing and damaged or destroyed 270,000 houses. Tens of thousands of people were still displaced when Vamco hit.The Philippines is hit by about 20 typhoons and tropical storms each year and also has active seismic faults and volcanoes, making it one of the world's most disaster-prone countries."

Fed signals interest rate hike firmly on the table for June,"The U.S. Federal Reserve will likely raise interest rates in June if economic data points to stronger second-quarter growth as well as firming inflation and employment, according to minutes from the U.S. central bank's April policy meeting released on Wednesday.",2016-05-18T00:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/federal-reserve-june-interest-rate-1.3587906,"The U.S.  Federal Reserve will likely raise interest rates in June if economic data points to stronger second-quarter growth as well as firming inflation and employment, according to minutes from the U.S. central bank's April policy meeting released on Wednesday.That view, expressed by most Fed policymakers at the last policy meeting, suggests the central bank is much closer to lifting rates again than Wall Street expects.In the wake of the news, the Canadian dollar sold off sharply against the U.S greenback. The loonie dropped 0.71 of a U.S. cent to close at 76.79 cents US. Prices for futures contracts on the Fed's benchmark overnight lending rate on Wednesday implied that investors only saw a 19 per cent chance of a rate increase next month.But members of the Fed's policy-setting committee said recent economic data made them more confident inflation was rising toward their two per cent target and that they were less concerned about a global economic slowdown, according to the minutes from the April 26-27 meeting.""Most participants judged that if incoming data were consistent with economic growth picking up in the second quarter, labor markets continued to strengthen, and inflation making progress toward the committee's two per cent objective, then it likely would be appropriate for the committee to increase the target range for the federal funds rate in June,"" according to the minutes.Some policymakers were wary about a slowdown in U.S. economic growth during the first quarter, when gross domestic product expanded at a two-year low of 0.5 per cent. But others argued that ongoing robust job growth suggested the economy was still on track and the growth data could be flawed.""Most pointed to the steady improvement in the labor market as an indicator that the underlying pace of economic activity had likely not deteriorated,"" according to the minutes.Some policymakers said they were concerned financial markets could be roiled by a possible British exit from the European Union in a vote next month or by China's exchange rate policies.At its April meeting, the Fed kept its target overnight interest rate in a range of 0.25 per cent to 0.50 per cent. The Fed hiked rates in December for the first time in nearly a decade.A global equities sell-off and the tightening of financial markets earlier this year largely due to concerns of a slowdown in China prompted the Fed in March to dial back rate hike expectations for the year.Even so, the Fed signaled at that time that it would likely increase rates twice this year. Investors have been betting on just one hike.""June is definitely a 'live' meeting for the next rate hike, but a super-cautious [Fed chair Janet] Yellen might well wait for more convincing evidence of a sustained pickup in the economy and a resolution of Brexit risks before pulling the trigger in July,"" said BMO Capital Markets senior economist Sal Guatieri. ""We still lean toward the latter."""

But human rights and pro-democracy advocates say Beijing's new national security law is undermining freedom in what is known as the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.""So if the Canadian side really cares about the stability and the prosperity in Hong Kong, and really cares about the good health and safety of those 300,000 Canadian passport holders in Hong Kong, and the large number of Canadian companies operating in Hong Kong SAR, you should support those efforts to fight violent crimes,"" Cong said.Cong also flatly rejected Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's assertion that China is engaging in coercive diplomacy by imprisoning two Canadian men in retaliation for the arrest of a Chinese high-tech executive on an American extradition warrant. Meng Wanzhou is living under house arrest in Vancouver while her case wends through a British Columbia court.In December 2018, China imprisoned Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor and charged them with undermining the country's national security. Cong said they are still undergoing a legal process in China but did not provide further details.He repeated his government's demand that Canada release Meng immediately but insisted her case and his government's prosecution of Kovrig and Spavor are not linked.""We will remain absolutely committed to working with our allies to ensure that China's approach of coercive diplomacy, its arbitrary detention of two Canadian citizens, alongside other citizens of other countries around the world, is not viewed as a successful tactic by them,"" Trudeau said earlier this week as the two countries marked 50 years of relations at one of the lowest points in Canada-China bilateral relations.Cong said Canada's efforts to get other countries to join its fight for Kovrig and Spavor is ""doomed to fail.""The European Union raised concerns about the two Canadians by name in the communique summarizing its recent summit with China.""We oppose any remarks that interfere in our internal affairs. And I would like to point out, there is no coercive diplomacy on the Chinese side,"" Cong said."

""People are taking some profits off of the larger run-up from the low.""A major catalyst for the gloom was weak trade data out of China, that showed exports plunged an alarming 25 per cent in February compared to the same time last year. Global demand weakened, but the numbers were dragged even lower by the Lunar New Year holiday which saw factory shutdowns.There were also signs of weaker domestic demand, too, as imports fell by 14 per cent.""Investors are voting with their feet and moving away from riskier assets,"" Scotiabank said after the Chinese trade data came out.That was bad news for oil, which had quietly been staging a rally for the last few weeks. Benchmark U.S. crude fell $1.66 cents, or 4.4 per cent, to $36.24 US a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. That came a day after WTI gained almost $2 to its highest level of 2016, at one point touching higher than $38.Gold was largely flat, changing hands  at $1,261 US an ounce.

Metal prices fell throughout 2015 as commodity markets were hammered by fears that China's growth would slow.  In other sectors there was much better news:The value of the Canadian dollar played a big role in some of the gains. The low loonie makes Canadian products cheaper.The depreciation of the Canadian dollar contributed to higher motor vehicle sales in 2015, as vehicles bound for the U.S. were priced in US dollars. A shift in the Ontario auto industry to making higher-priced vehicles also contributed to the increase.The figures show manufacturing growth is shifting to provinces such as Ontario and Quebec, while Alberta sales fell.For December, overall manufacturing sales were up 1.2 per cent to $51.6 billion."

"Wealthy would-be immigrants told to lie about their assets, intentions — even their identity | CBC News","Rich foreigners seeking Canadian residency through a controversial Quebec program are advised to hide questionable assets, lie about their intention to settle in the province and even adopt a new identity, in a hidden-camera investigation by Radio-Canada.",2018-09-21T09:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/quebec-immigrant-investor-consultants-hidden-camera-1.4832245,"LATEST UPDATES:Rich foreigners seeking to gain Canadian residency through a controversial Quebec program are being advised to hide questionable assets, lie about their intention to settle in the province and even adopt a new identity, according to a hidden-camera investigation by Radio-Canada.The investigation revealed that immigration advisers have counselled clients to do things such as change their name, shift funds to accounts in the Caribbean and not declare them to tax authorities or immigration agents.""We have a lot of clients who have a lot of assets who do this,"" said one consultant at one of the biggest firms in the industry in a conversation captured on hidden camera.The revelations pose troubling questions for the Quebec Immigrant Investor Program (QIIP), a special immigration track under which foreigners with at least $2 million in assets can get Canadian residency for themselves and their family if they agree to loan $1.2 million to the Quebec government.Rich investors get residency despite suspicions of dubious documents and assetsLast year alone, more than 5,000 people obtained permanent residency through the program. Typically, two-thirds of those accepted each year come from mainland China. However, most successful applicants through the Quebec program don't actually settle in the province.Radio-Canada's investigative program Enquête went undercover at the offices of five immigration consultancies and law firms in Hong Kong, the city where, up until last year, all Chinese QIIP applications were handled. Four other firms were called by phone. All these firms help candidates with their applications before they send them to the government.A Hong Kong chef was hired to pose as ""Mr. Chen,"" a supposed businessman whose $10-million fortune came from suspicious sources. Mr. Chen told the firms he made his money operating a plastic-bag factory, but some of the paperwork to prove this had been destroyed in a fire. He also said he ran a pawnshop that dealt only in cash and charged high interest rates and that he hadn't declared a chunk of his assets to Chinese tax authorities.""We've helped clients with even greyer areas,"" said an agent at Globevisa, one of the biggest immigrant-investor consultancies in the world.""We have seven passports. These are all legal. Two are European identities, others are Caribbean — there are five. Those are simply to get an identity in case you have to flee or if you want to hide your assets,"" said the consultant, who didn't know she was being recorded.""You change your name to Bruce Lee. You can use this Bruce Lee identity to hold this. They won't be able to check,"" the agent said.She claimed clients could use this scheme if they failed background checks.Watch the immigration adviser counsel ""Mr. Chen"" on hidden camera:The NationalIn a subsequent statement, Globevisa said there was ""practically no chance that your 'Mr. Chen' would have been taken on"" as a client.""No ... consultant wants to take on a case which is problematic and which has a high risk of failure,"" the firm said.At another firm, the Hong Kong offices of Harvey Law Group, founded by Canadian Jean-François Harvey, a representative tells Mr. Chen that ""it's normal"" to not declare all assets.""You want to disclose the minimum possible, right? Right. OK, yes, it's possible,"" she said on hidden camera:CBC News""We have a lot of clients like that. It's actually really normal.""She suggested acquiring status in a Caribbean jurisdiction so that Mr. Chen could camouflage part of his wealth — not only from Quebec's immigration officers but also from Chinese tax authorities.""[The] Caribbean passport also gives him a new TIN number — so a tax identity number. So that could be useful for him, too,"" she said on hidden camera.""One of the Caribbean [countries] does not have a treaty with China. So you get a new tax identity, but you don't need to declare to [the] Chinese government all those assets.""When Radio-Canada showed the footage of his employee explaining ways to get around the rules to Harvey, he expressed shock and dismay.""This is bad.... You've opened my eyes,"" he told Enquête. ""There's things being said here that shouldn't be.""But Harvey said that any potential client would have met with a lawyer after initially dealing with the employee. The lawyer would catch the problems with Mr. Chen's file at that point, he said.After seeing the hidden-camera footage, Harvey fired the employee caught on video, she told Radio-Canada.Several firms approached by Mr. Chen advised him not to declare some assets of questionable origin.But that goes against the rules of the Quebec Immigrant Investor Program, which requires applicants to list all their assets — and ostensibly rejects candidates whose wealth may not be legitimately sourced.Nor did it seem to matter to most of the Hong Kong-based advisers that Mr. Chen said he had no intention to actually take up residence in Quebec. Any permanent resident or citizen of Canada has the constitutional right to move anywhere in the country, but it is a requirement of the immigrant investor program that candidates declare a firm intention to settle in Quebec.""If they ask you, it's best if you don't answer so honestly. Don't tell them so plainly you don't plan to stay there,"" the Globevisa consultant advised.All but one of the consultants told Mr. Chen he could settle elsewhere in Canada, but that he should not disclose this intention to Canadian immigration authorities. Quebec immigration lawyer Hugue Langlais said Radio-Canada's hidden-camera footage shows the Quebec government should end the QIIP.""I'm a little uncomfortable to see that we have a program with major shortcomings that are known in the industry,"" he said.""I think the federal government did the right thing in 2014 in shutting down its program.

Rich investors granted Canadian residency despite suspicions of fake documents and dubious assets | CBC News,"Some rich foreigners seeking Canadian residency under a special Quebec program for wealthy investors couldn't point to the province on a map while others submitted fake documents or disguised their assets — yet many of them were still accepted for immigration, former civil servants say.",2018-09-20T09:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/quebec-immigrant-investor-program-civil-servants-1.4830231,"Some rich foreigners seeking Canadian residency under a special Quebec program for wealthy investors couldn't point to the province on a map, while others submitted fake documents or disguised their assets — yet many of them were still accepted for immigration, former civil servants say.The officials, charged with administering the Quebec Immigrant Investor Program (QIIP), say they were sometimes pressured into ignoring signs that applicants' fortunes were founded on corruption or other ill-gotten gains.""It's a program that has lots of gaps, that permits people with dubious or even illicit business to launder money through the program and to buy themselves citizenship inexpensively,"" said one former immigration officer.Numerous current and former civil servants in Quebec spoke to Radio-Canada's investigative program Enquête on condition of anonymity, revealing what they see as major flaws in an immigration program that has granted permanent residency to tens of thousands of people since it began in 1986.QIIP applicants must have at least $2 million in assets and agree to loan $1.2 million of that to the Quebec government interest-free for five years. The government invests the money and uses the interest to provide grants to small- and medium-sized businesses.""We were under a lot of pressure to approve applicants in order to meet annual financial targets,"" said one ex-bureaucrat.The federal government used to have a similar immigration track for rich investors seeking to settle in Canada, but shut it down in 2014 due to concerns about its effectiveness.The Quebec version still accepts 1,900 people a year, plus their family members, with two-thirds coming from mainland China. Last year alone, more than 5,000 people obtained their permanent residency through the program.All of the applications from China would've passed through Quebec's immigration office in Hong Kong, until it closed last year. The office was overwhelmed by the workload, with staff working 60 to 70 hours a week to keep up, according to the former officials who spoke to Enquête.The provincial government allotted seven hours to screen each application — including verifying that applicants had come by their fortunes honestly. But as one former immigration officer said: ""It takes time to do proper due diligence, and we didn't have it.""Officials' suspicions could be raised by any number of things, including copycat submissions.""The applicants were all heads of sales, then became assistant managers,"" the ex-bureaucrat said. ""The first time you have an applicant like that, you tell yourself, 'Why not.' Then you get 10, 20, 30 more from the same immigration consultant. It raises serious doubts about their back story.""In the early 2000s, the Quebec government hired an outside firm to help vet applications. It was found that more than 65 per cent of them contained forged documentation.And according to data obtained under Quebec's access-to-information law, from 2013 to 2017, a total of 1,783 immigrant investor applications were rejected by the province's officers in Hong Kong due to faked documents.But even as dodgy candidates were flagged, immigration officers say they felt pressure to overlook many applications with apparent shortcomings.One former bureaucrat recalled rejecting a candidate on suspicions their assets were corruptly obtained. His boss instructed him to be more lenient next time because corruption existed in Quebec too.Around the same time, the Charbonneau Commission was investigating corruption and collusion in Quebec's construction industry. ""It really shocked me to hear that,"" he said.Another civil servant said they were told by a senior official at Quebec's Immigration Ministry not to dig too deep into each applicant's background. Some immigration staff bowed to those pressures and accepted more applicants, the people interviewed by Enquête said, while others refused.In a statement, Quebec's Immigration Ministry said its vetting process is effective at maintaining the integrity of the immigrant-investor program. It said applicants and their assets are examined multiple times: by financial institutions that help recruit them, by governmental financial analysts, and by immigration personnel. The province also says the program has had important economic benefits, allowing for $695 million in grants to small- and medium-sized businesses since 2000 — which it says has translated into tens of thousands of jobs.But those numbers may be overly rosy.Grants from the Quebec Immigrant Investor Program are limited to a maximum of 10 per cent of a business's expansion or modernization project. Nevertheless, Investment Quebec, the provincial agency that administers the grants, counts all the jobs created or saved by the expansion projects it supports — meaning the employment gains seem to be inflated by a factor of 10.Investment Quebec maintains it's a standard method of calculating and it doesn't deem every one of those jobs to stem from its grants.Perhaps the most controversial aspect of QIIP is that while it's meant to draw wealthy investors to la belle province, the vast majority who have taken up residency in Canada under the program settle in other provinces.As part of the process, applicants have to sign two forms declaring their intention to reside in Quebec.But once in Canada, the law allows anyone to move freely. Data reported earlier this year by Global News shows that 85 per cent of Quebec's immigrant investors — since the program began in 1986 — have ended up in British Columbia and Ontario. Only 10 per cent remained in Quebec.""We're way off our immigration targets under this program,"" said Suzanne Ethier, who served as Quebec's associate deputy minister of immigration from 2005 to 2006.""We knew they weren't coming to Quebec and we also knew they weren't going to learn French,"" said one of the former bureaucrats who helped run the program.Quebec Immigration Minister David Heurtel told reporters in March that he wasn't fazed by this tendency. ""Even if an immigrant investor goes elsewhere in Canada, their money stays here,"" he said.Other provinces aren't so keen to welcome Quebec's immigrants, though, and to bear the costs of providing health care and education. Freedom-of-information records obtained by Enquête show the B.C. government complained to Quebec several times in 2015 and 2016Former federal immigration minister Chris Alexander, who served in Stephen Harper's last government, said he brought up the issue with his Quebec counterparts, and while they ""recognized there were problems, they weren't ready to move forward with any changes.""Quebec has since taken steps to retain more of its immigrant investors, Heurtel said, including prioritizing applicants from francophone countries and sending out videos and brochures promoting living in Quebec.But that hasn't been enough to alter how the program's critics see things.""The Quebec Immigrant Investor Program is a scam from start to finish. I think that everyone who's involved in the program knows that,"" said Ian Young, the Vancouver correspondent for Hong Kong's South China Morning Post newspaper and a seasoned observer of immigration patterns from China to Canada.""I think that includes policy-makers, the people who facilitate it and the immigrants themselves."""
Government quietly made 'back door' agreement with U.S. that could undermine treaty on plastic waste | CBC News,The Trudeau government quietly signed a protocol with the U.S. on October 26 that will allow Canada to continue to ship plastic waste to American waste brokers — opening a 'back door' that will allow it to evade the plastic waste shipping restrictions the federal government committed to under the Basel Treaty plastic ban.,2020-12-03T22:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canada-us-plastic-waste-basel-1.5827340,"Environmental groups are accusing the Trudeau government of acting in bad faith after it quietly signed a bilateral agreement with the U.S. that could allow it to evade some of its obligations to stop shipping plastic waste to poor countries around the world.The agreement — which was never publicly announced or gazetted — was signed on Oct. 26, 2020, the U.S. State Department told CBC News. Environment Canada declined CBC's requests to see the text. But experts on plastic waste say it runs counter to the spirit of the Basel Convention on plastic waste and appears to be designed to allow Canada to evade its obligations.""This is, in effect, a backdoor for Canada to offload its waste problems to the U.S., who will offload to the very countries potentially that the Basel Convention amendment is meant to stop,"" said Myra Hird of Queens University, a fellow of the Royal Society of Canada who represented Canada at the G7's microplastics summit last year.""It was not the spirit of the amendment and what we were proclaiming to sign on to.""The plastic waste amendments to the Basel Convention, which take effect on January 1, 2021, effectively limit nations to shipping plastic recyclables only to other signatory countries that are bound by the same rules.They also require prior informed consent from the receiving country.Canada accepted those amendments after a flood of negative publicity about Canadian plastic waste — much of it mislabelled as recyclable — being dumped in developing countries such as the Philippines and Cambodia.A dispute with the Philippines over the issue led to Manila recalling its ambassador to Ottawa, and only ended in May when the Canadian government paid to ship 69 containers of garbage back to Vancouver.Canada informed the UN on March 9 of this year that it ""supports and fully intends to comply"" with the ban.But the Trudeau government also sought to ensure it could use a loophole that allows countries to ship plastic waste to non-signatory nations if they do so under an existing bilateral agreement. The United States is one of only two countries never to ratify the Basel Convention; Haiti is the other. As such, the U.S. is not bound by the new rules on plastic waste. By signing the deal with the U.S. prior to ratifying the Basel plastic amendments, Canada keeps open the option of sending its waste to brokers south of the border.Once Canadian plastic waste enters the States, it can change hands several times. There is no reliable mechanism to track it and no way to ensure it is not re-exported to developing countries, where it often ends up in landfills or in the ocean.Environment and Climate Change Canada discussed the proposed agreement in a webinar with two environmental groups in September — the Canadian Environmental Law Association and Health and Environment Justice Support (HEJ Support) — thereby technically meeting its duty to consult. But most environmental groups that have consulted with the government on plastics say they were blindsided when they learned of the agreement at a U.S. State Department briefing three weeks after it was signed.""This was signed about five weeks ago now and it still is secret and no one has seen it, apart from those who signed it,"" said Kathleen Ruff, former head of the B.C. Human Rights Commission. She now heads Right On Canada, a group that campaigns against plastic pollution.Moira Kelly of Environment Canada confirmed the existence of the agreement to CBC News. ""In accordance with its obligations under the Basel Convention, Canada concluded an arrangement with the United States affirming that the waste subject to the arrangement and circulating between Canada and the U.S. is managed in an environmentally sound manner,"" she said.""This arrangement balances the need to manage the traded plastic waste in an environmentally sound manner in both Canada and the U.S. while reducing barriers to recycling, developing secondary markets and meeting domestic goals, such as recycled content. Maintaining circulation of these materials between Canada and the U.S. can also disincentivize exports overseas.""The Basel treaty amendments require any such bilateral agreement to meet standards as high as, or higher than, those in the treaty, which is legally binding.Kelly said the U.S.-Canada deal ""affirms"" that ""waste moving between Canada and the U.S. is managed in an environmentally sound manner."" When pressed on the meaning of the word ""affirms,"" however, Environment Canada conceded that the agreement with the U.S. is not legally binding.Hird said that makes all the difference.""If this bilateral agreement allows us to get around that in any way, then we're taking a step backwards, we're not taking a step forward,"" she said.""It's more of a pretence of complying, a gesture of complying,"" said Ruff. ""According to the legal experts we've talked to who are experts on the convention, it's a violation of the convention.""Although the Trudeau government has portrayed itself as a global leader in the struggle to control plastic waste, Canada is one of just three countries among the 188 Basel signatory nations that have yet to ratify the plastic ban amendments. The other two are China and Turkey.The government tabled the amendments in Parliament on Oct. 28. Kelly said ""the Government of Canada is working to complete the ratification process as soon as possible and we continue to aim for ratification on or before January 1.""People who work in the field question why Canada is the only developed country in the Basel Treaty not to ratify the plastic accords.""It's difficult to see that in any kind of good faith,"" said Hird. ""It's difficult to see this ratification, this delay in ratification as being justified at all, in terms of bureaucratic necessity. So I think, really, this will be seen by Canadians as stalling.""Ruff said the situation is an example of the yawning gap between government words and actions when it comes to protecting the environment.""I think one of the huge issues in the world is that environmental laws have not been taken seriously,"" she told CBC News. ""Everyone pays lip service to them, but when the rubber hits the road, too often we see governments not complying.""And this is exactly what seems to be happening right here, right now, with this arrangement with the United States.""WATCH: Plastic waste and supermarket shopping — a Marketplace reportMarketplace"

Leaked recordings reveal WHO's private analysis of pandemic | CBC News,"As the coronavirus exploded around the globe, scientists at the World Health Organization were sometimes privately frustrated by the mistakes made by some of their top donor countries but reluctant to say so publicly, leaked recordings of internal meetings show.",2020-11-11T21:41:22.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/who-pandemic-private-recordings-1.5798561,"As the coronavirus exploded around the globe, scientists at the World Health Organization (WHO) were sometimes privately frustrated by the mistakes made by some of their top donor countries but reluctant to say so publicly, leaked recordings of internal meetings show.After sharp criticism for not taking a stronger role in curbing the pandemic, the UN health agency holds its annual meeting this week under intense pressure to reform. WHO is also hoping that U.S. president-elect Joe Biden will reverse a decision by Washington to leave the organization made by the Trump administration in June.One of WHO's central dilemmas is that it has no enforcement powers or authority to independently investigate epidemics. Instead, the agency relies on behind-the-scenes talks and countries' co-operation.As the pandemic gained pace, WHO often shied away from calling out some of its biggest donors, including Japan, France and Britain. WHO scientists labelled some of their approaches ""macabre"" and ""an unfortunate laboratory to study the virus,"" according to dozens of leaked recordings of internal WHO meetings and documents from January to April obtained by The Associated Press.""By not speaking up when countries are doing questionable things, WHO is undermining its own authority while the planet burns,"" said Sophie Harman, a professor of international politics at Queen Mary University in London.Others said it would be politically unwise for WHO to be too outspoken unless countries give the agency more power.""If Tedros was to take a very aggressive stance toward member countries, there would be repercussions,"" said Suerie Moon, co-director of the Global Health Centre at the Graduate Institute of Geneva, referring to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.WHO spokesperson Farah Dakhlallah said that since the beginning of the coronavirus outbreak, ""WHO officials have had and continue to have, frank and open discussions with government counterparts. ""We are proud of an organizational culture that fosters candid discussions.""It's not unprecedented for WHO to publicly question its member states. It threatened to close its China office when the country was hiding cases during the SARS outbreak and loudly called for Nigeria to reverse its boycott of the polio vaccine in 2003.WHO's reticence to call out countries started with China, as the AP earlier reported. Despite a January meeting between Tedros and Chinese President Xi Jinping, information from Beijing was still sparse throughout February. Maria Van Kerkhove, WHO's technical lead for COVID-19, noted that the agency lacked ""enough detail to say what has worked and what hasn't.""WHO scientists soon grew concerned about Japan. On Feb. 1, a passenger who disembarked the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Hong Kong tested positive for the coronavirus. At the ship's next stop in Yokohama, authorities put all 3,711 people aboard under lockdown.WHO emergencies chief Michael Ryan told reporters at the time: ""Let's be careful here not to overreact."" But on Feb. 10, the case count nearly doubled overnight.""[That's] not surprising given the nature of the response of the investigation,"" Ryan said at an internal meeting, noting Japan had only assigned a small number of epidemiologists to investigate.Dr. Thomas Grein, WHO's chief of acute events management team, said they had failed to glean much information from their Japanese counterparts, calling it a ""very, very sensitive issue.""Although WHO was keenly aware the situation was deteriorating, scientists said the outbreak could help in understanding COVID-19 transmission.""[It's] unfortunate but a useful opportunity to study the natural history of the virus,"" Ryan said.In late February, the virus also gained a foothold in Italy, turning Europe into the epicentre of the pandemic.At WHO, Grein told his colleagues that WHO's efforts to get more detail about the spiralling outbreaks in Italy and elsewhere had ""spectacularly failed"" as officials worried about the lack of action taken across Europe.Yet on March 8, Tedros tweeted that ""the government & the people of Italy are taking bold, courageous steps aimed at slowing the spread of the coronavirus.""Lawrence Gostin, director of the WHO Collaborating Center on Public Health Law and Human Rights at Georgetown University, said WHO should be obligated to report when countries are not sharing data, saying it was dangerous for the agency to be ""flying blind.""WHO also complained in private about Western countries hoarding scarce pandemic supplies.""We had the terrible situation yesterday with [protective personal equipment] where all the supplies were requisitioned in France, and we lost access,"" Ryan told his colleagues.As countries across Europe adopted physical distancing measures and cancelled mass gatherings in early March, Ryan noticed one country did not: Britain.""There isn't a single sports event in Europe, and yet all of the Premier League matches in the U.K. are to go ahead,"" he said.Ryan described Britain's pandemic strategy as ""problematic"" after hearing the U.K.'s chief scientific officer say the country was aiming for herd immunity.""For that to happen, hundreds of thousands and millions of older people are going to become infected, and there is just going to be so much death,"" Ryan said.Still, he said the different approaches to tackling COVID-19 globally could prove to be ""a massive ecological study"" that would allow WHO to document what worked.""It's macabre in some ways, but it's reality,"" he said.Going forward, WHO's role trying to stop the pandemic will depend in part on the independent panel review. Harman, the expert from Queen Mary University, sympathized that WHO had enormous responsibility in the early months of COVID-19 but said even greater challenges loom now.""With the next wave of the pandemic, I think the time for quiet diplomacy has passed,"" she said."
Taiwanese in B.C. see hopeful signs that attitudes are softening toward island's push for sovereignty | CBC News,"Taiwan's top envoy in Vancouver says attitudes toward the island are shifting, and that many Canadian officials already treat him as if he represented an independent country — even though Ottawa doesn't formally acknowledge him as such.",2020-09-28T20:28:25.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/twitter-bio-change-taiwan-envoys-1.5740084,"Andy Chen is consul general for Taiwan in everything but name, he says.Taiwan's top envoy in Vancouver has the official title of director-general of the Taiwan Economic and Cultural Office because the island, a disputed territory claimed by the People's Republic of China, does not have a designated embassy or consulate in Canada.But Chen says attitudes toward Taiwan are shifting, and that many Canadian officials already treat him as if he represented an independent country — even though Ottawa doesn't formally acknowledge him as such.""Our [Canadian politician] friends call me 'director general,' and sometimes some other friends call me 'consul general,'"" said Chen, a career diplomat whose office provides consular services for the Western provinces, Yukon and Northwest Territories, such as processing visa applications for Canadians and legalizing official documents for Taiwanese. ""Even some of the consuls general in Vancouver from other countries [call me 'consul general']. They know my job description.""  MarketplaceBased on the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, an international treaty Canada ratified in 1966, ""consul general"" is reserved for top envoys from countries with full diplomatic ties with Canada stationed in cities other than Ottawa. Top envoys assigned to Ottawa bear the title ""ambassador.""Taiwan lost its diplomatic recognition with many countries along with its seat at the United Nations when the People's Republic of China joined the UN in 1971.For decades, Taiwanese across the globe — including around 40,000 in B.C. — have been pushing for the island to be recognized as a sovereign state and to once again be represented in the UN. Many hope the country's impressive management of the COVID-19 pandemic will help its bid for recognition.The island has kept the number of infections at around 500 out of its 24 million population, while China, where COVID-19 originated, has had more than 90,000 positive tests so far.Along with Chen's comments on how he's viewed by consuls general, Taiwan's search for recognition was given another surprising boost last week when Hsiao Bi-khim, the island's top envoy to Washington, D.C., changed her Twitter bio to ""Taiwan Ambassador to the US."" Sorry to disappoint so many supporters, but Taiwan Ambassador is what many call me and also my job description. My title remains Representative, Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office, when engaging with the US government.Taiwan's identity has always been a sensitive topic in China's foreign relations. Although Hsiao later tweeted that her official title is the Representative of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office, her new online ID triggered a fresh round of debates between Beijing and Taipei. In a statement to CBC News, the People's Republic of China's consulate in Vancouver says Taiwan is an ""inalienable part"" of China that is solely represented by its central government in Beijing. This doesn't reverberate with Taiwanese Canadians like Carol Pan, who lives in Vancouver and volunteers with Overseas Community Affairs Council, an organization affiliated with the Taiwanese government to arrange social activities for its citizens living in other countries. ""Taiwan has always been an independent country,"" Pan said. ""After the Second World War, the People's Republic of China never set foot on Taiwan.""Pan said Hsiao's self-identification as ambassador is ""wonderful"" and gives thumbs-up to Chen's being called ""consul general.""""We are hoping eventually some democratic countries can support Taiwan going to be recognized at first and then going to the United Nations,"" she said.In a statement to CBC, Global Affairs said Canada will continue to build people-to-people ties based on shared democratic values and respect for human rights."

The collection is too much for her to move alone, and she doesn't know how to use a computer to sell her valuables online.So she decided to donate her collection.She said heard on the news that Royal Canadian Legion branches in the province were struggling to keep their doors open, so she called Branch 1 in St. John's.""And I said, 'Oh my God, he probably won't take me seriously. Who got 500 Barbie dolls?'"" said Porter.Executives from the legion's branch visited Porter the next day. ""I don't think they knew what to say,"" she said, adding she loves to see the expression on people's faces when they first see her collection.Porter said an antique dealer estimates her collection is worth about $250,000.People have approached Porter in the past about buying some of her items, but she wasn't ready to sell. ""I wouldn't give you the hair off a Barbie doll over there, right?"" laughed Porter.Greg Grenning, president of Branch 1, says the donation will be a big help to the legion.""We're just struggling right now to keep our doors open,"" he said.Grenning said the legion relies on gatherings like weddings, dances and other social events to make money, which are limited now because of the COVID-19 pandemic.""This gesture has been fantastic, and whatever money we can raise will go toward our operating,"" he said.Grenning said they will also start an annual scholarship or bursary honouring Porter and her daughter.But for now, legion members will spend their time carefully packing Porter's collection into boxes, and numbering and itemizing each piece.Grenning said they will auction items on sites like eBay.""There's a lot of collectors out there who would like to have some of this stuff,"" said Grenning.""Whether we get $10,000 or we get $100,000, it's all it's something we don't have right now.… Whatever money we do get, it's so much appreciated, and [we] can't thank her enough for what she's doing.""While Porter finds it stressful to give away her collection, she said it was meant to be.""I prayed to God to bring someone to me so it could make my dream come true.""Read more from CBC Newfoundland and Labrador"

"Good storytelling is an underappreciated art — hear from Bernice Hune, one of Toronto's best | CBC Arts","For 35 years, Bernice Hune has told stories of Asian Canadian culture.",2020-08-28T15:30:09.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/arts/good-storytelling-is-an-underappreciated-art-hear-from-bernice-hune-one-of-toronto-s-best-1.5702755,"Did you ever hear the story about the opera singer who fled war-torn China in 1938?In a harrowing attempt to escape the conflict between China and Japan, she found her way out of the country and into Canada on an opera company tour. Her story does not end there, though. She landed in Canada only to learn that Chinese immigration was not allowed at the time because of the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1923 legislation, which banned Chinese people from entering the country.If you want to know how the tale ends, Toronto-based professional storyteller Bernice Hune can tell you. She knows the story intimately and can tell it a lot better than I can — because that opera singer was her mother.For the past 35 years, Hune has been telling early migration tales to anyone lucky enough to hear them. As a multidisciplinary artist, even when she has reflected on her paintings, she has realized she would often include stories and language on her canvases.Born in Chinatown, Hune has seen a wealth of change in Toronto. While facilitating arts education workshops in schools, she noticed cultural shifts in the demographics during the 1970s and beyond. Suddenly, more diverse groups were attending schools in the city, but the teaching staff remained predominantly white.In this video, musician and regular CBC Arts correspondent April Aliermo catches up with Hune to listen and learn from some of her richest stories.Good storytelling is an underappreciated art form and can be especially compelling when delivered from the perspective of our elders. Hune has crafted her narratives from what she refers to as ""community oral history"" and enhances them with personal objects connected to her own family.

We've been able to move forward on aboriginal partnerships and agreements. The whole development of the port itself, getting some stability from Genesee & Wyoming over the railway.""Cecil Clarke announces plans for Sydney port developmentCouncil is waiting on $500,000 in federal funding announced this past summer. ""The commitments are still in place, but the process is still ongoing,"" he said, adding that the length of the federal election campaign slowed discussions over the contribution agreement. Clarke also hopes to bring a Nova Scotia Community College campus downtown and a mixed-use facility to the waterfront. ""All of that will be put together and an economic model will come,"" he said. ""And then the design of what a building would look like and the footprint required for land will be put on top of that. I think that, hopefully, by the spring of next year we should have sense of where this project could be."" Clarke says the municipality started the year off in a difficult relationship with the province. He says he met with Premier Stephen McNeil, put their differences aside and asked for stability.""It was about the fact that we couldn't afford any more clawbacks on what we have to remit to the province,"" Clarke said. ""The premier provided that stability, so he followed up and he honoured what we committed to in our meeting and we were able to get through our budget process much better than the year previous."" He says the current budget sets up the future, but it's not yet where the municipality needs to be. Control of spending and having a contingency plan necessitated their austerity measures, Clarke says. ""Compared to when we started, with no reserve funds, we have now reestablished a reserve fund.""  Clarke said he hopes it will surpass $1 million in 2016.""We will be eyes wide open and will be mindful that we have a responsibility and a duty to not only get through a budget year but to be good stewards of the municipality."" "

How Ottawa's oldest businesses are toughing it out through COVID-19 | CBC News,"They survived such catastrophic events as the Spanish flu, two world wars and the Great Depression. How are some of Ottawa's most venerable businesses coping through the coronavirus pandemic?",2020-04-29T08:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/covid-19-small-businesses-survive-century-war-depression-but-virus-hard-blow-1.5546516,"They survived such catastrophic events as the Spanish flu, two world wars and the Great Depression.How are some of Ottawa's most venerable businesses coping through the coronavirus pandemic?CBC reached out to ask how they're doing.General manager Deek Labelle gave birth in mid-March and is safe at home with little Nathan while her ByWard Market baby, the Château Lafayette, remains closed.""The Laff,"" billed as Ottawa's oldest tavern, dates back to 1849, and is very much still alive and kicking.""It's hard to believe. The fact that it's still here and still surviving and thriving speaks volumes,"" Labelle said. ""I don't want to jinx it.""There have been hard times, she said, but nothing quite like this.""This is the hardest one we've ever endured. The smoking bylaw would be the closest second to it, for the severity of an overnight change."" To survive Ottawa's smoking crackdown, the venerable watering hole was severed in two, with half becoming a Quiznos franchise so the remaining bar could sustain itself.Unlike other establishments, The Laff hasn't stayed open for takeout or delivery during the pandemic.""The bar is the experience. You can't take that out,"" Labelle observed.Labelle hopes to reopen this summer and is considering applying for a larger patio so customers, when they return, can spread out and enjoy themselves like old times.""We just want to see our regulars again, our friends. These are people we see weekly, if not daily.""Jacques Marchand can trace his family's lighting and electrical business back three generations. ""My father's father's father,"" Marchand noted proudly. He's the fourth.Founded just 14 years after Thomas Edison unveiled the first practical incandescent light bulb, Marchand Electric has seen its share of history. Now, the company is trying to survive COVID-19.""We have experience with slowdowns before, and the trick … is to react quickly. You have to look at your costs and your staff. We had to lay some people off, unfortunately,"" Marchand said.A skeleton staff continues to work at the Algoma Road location. Retail sales have been limited to online purchases, but the store has been deemed an essential service because they supply to hospitals.There are already signs things are picking up: Marchand has recalled three of the six people he laid off. ""So we got the guys back working in the warehouse. They're also working on inventories and painting floors. Make-work projects. You have to retain these employees,"" he said.Marchand is also trying to convince clients to plan —  and order — ahead.""You've got a project coming up? Why don't we talk about it now instead of freaking out at the last minute, two months from now?""Sonia Fisher is a fourth-generation purveyor of quality men's clothing, a retail business established by her great-grandfather, Emerson Ralph Fisher, 115 years ago. It was ER Fisher who got the company through the Depression years. Part of company lore is that ""he did not lay off a single person,"" Sonia Fisher noted. Back then, the company reduced its hours, but stayed open.With COVID-19, things are different. Forced to close the Westboro store, Fisher has had to lay off 12 employees.""I didn't want to get the business in a situation where we were worse off five to six months down the road,"" she said.Most spring merchandise had already been delivered, but ""anything that hadn't arrived, we cancelled,"" Fisher said. They're already trimming back on their fall orders.""It'll take time for people to develop confidence again in the economy,"" Fisher said, ""so we are predicting a drop in sales over the next year.""Unlike other retailers, ER Fisher doesn't sell online. Personalized service has always been its brand. Now, Fisher admits it might be time to update that business model.""It's definitely something that we're going to be ramping up. It's a sore spot for me because I worry that I should have done it a little sooner.""McIntosh and Watts started out as a coffee and tea emporium, with deliveries made by horse and buggy.  ""We could have been Starbucks,"" jokes the company's fourth-generation president, Peter McIntosh, who's been selling china and tableware for 35 years.His grandfather, Grant McIntosh, was stationed in England during the Second World War and made connections at factories that made fine bone china, which he began exporting to Canada, far away from German bombs.""They adapted. They did everything they could to continue to function,"" McIntosh said. ""That's how you have to survive."" Fast-forward to 2020. The store on Industrial Avenue has been closed since mid-March, the company's online and wholesale business now operating out of McIntosh's home. ""We're adapting. We're working hard on the parts of our business we can continue to develop. We've just scaled everything back,"" McIntosh said.""Frisby the Vulcanizer"" was established by Don Frisby's great-uncle, George Frisby, upon his discharge after the First World War. The company survived the Great Depression, but Don Frisby said he never heard the stories about how they managed. ""They were ... men of very few words. All those guys did was work.""Deemed essential, the business has been allowed to stay open, but retail customers have been staying away and business is down 30 per cent. It's been a ""double whammy,"" Frisby said, arriving at what's normally one of his busiest seasons.He's responded by resetting his expectations.""My goal all along has been to keep as many people working as possible and to stay open and forget about being profitable. We just want to be able to keep functioning as a business,"" Frisby said.Of his 100 employees, just one has had a layoff notice. ""Our on-the-road salesperson, whom nobody wants to see. Poor guy,"" Frisby said.So why not let a few more go until this thing blows over?""Right from my great-uncle and my father and through to me, we've always understood ... that our customers and the people who look after our customers are the most important aspect of the business,"" Frisby said."

Elsipogtog collective's art finds new life after half a century | CBC News,Imagine finding out that the art you've been admiring at work every day — tapestries of familiar animals and lands — came from the imagination of a family member more than 50 years ago.,2019-09-22T11:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/elsipogtog-handicraft-collective-art-1.5288045,"Imagine going to work every day and getting the chance to admire the creations of local artists on the walls of your office.Now imagine finding out that the art you admire every day — tapestries of familiar animals and lands — was made by a family member more than 50 years ago.This is what happened to Starlit Simon, who works at the University of New Brunswick's Mi'kmaq-Wolastoqey Centre as a Mi'kmaq language teacher.""As it turns out, the designs came from my great uncle Michael William Francis,"" Simon said.""I did not know this. I've been working here, I think, about three to four years, went to school here, and the whole time these tapestries are here that my great uncle had made the designs for.""Her great uncle Michael Francis was part of the Micmac Indian Craftsmen, a group of artists from Big Cove First Nation, now Elsipogtog, who made prints and sold them all over as souvenirs for tourists.""I didn't realize that they were his artwork because he didn't do tapestries,"" Simon added.The tapestries that hang at UNB were made by renowned textile artist Ivan Crowell from designs by Francis and Stephen John Dedam.After the designs were created, they were silk-screened onto cards, teacups and other souvenir-like items at a workshop in Elsipogtog. ""These were sold by the hundreds of thousands across Canada,"" said John Leroux, manager of collections and exhibitions at the Beaverbrook Art Gallery. ""These were extremely popular."" It was Leroux and Emma Hassencahl-Perley, a curator at the Fredericton gallery, who told Simon her great uncle's art was hanging on the walls of UNB.The two curators were visiting the Mi'kmaq-Wolastoqey Centre as part of their research into the Micmac Indian Craftsmen for an exhibit coming to the gallery. Francis died in 1995 at the age of 72.Dedam, 80, who still lives in Elsipogtog, about 90 kilometres north of Moncton, said he didn't have an easy life growing up, and doing art was cathartic for him.Painting was a way for him to create and ""remain on a gentle stream,"" he said.""When you sit down and dream about something else, you know, you turn around and you make your own world. And you find that very peaceful.""Thinking back on the importance of the Micmac Indian Craftsmen, who produced art from 1962 to 1966, Dedam said he hopes their work influences young Indigenous artists who may be struggling as he did.""Art is very important because art doesn't get old, and it remains young as long as time,"" he said.The Micmac Indian Craftsmen workshop in Elsipogtog burned down in the late-1960s.Leroux and Hassencahl-Perley believe the fire and federal funding cuts were among the reasons for the demise of the collective, though the artists continued to create individually.Leroux and Hassencahl-Perley have been looking into the Micmac Indian Craftsmen for months in preparation for the Beaverbrook exhibit about the collective and the book that will accompany it. ""One of the things that Emma and I are really trying to focus on is that this appears to be really the initial stages of modern Indigenous art in Eastern Canada … and it's an incredible story that again seems to have been forgotten by a lot of people, except the ones who are involved with it.""And when they talk about it, there seems to be a lot of warmth.""Leroux recently acquired some of the Elsipogtog collective's china tea sets and hasty cards, small cards for birthday wishes and other brief messages, from eBay. He remembers seeing one particular card design at home when he was a child.The hasty cards featured art from Dedam and Francis on the front, accompanied by Mi'kmaq creation stories of Kluskap on the back. ""This is beyond just an Indigenous arts story,"" Leroux said. ""This is some of the most sophisticated and creative graphics being done in New Brunswick in the 1960s.""When you look at this, it's incredibly skilled. And to say that these were people that were dedicated to their craft and their culture, and could produce things that were being done as good as anyone. It was just in them, it was inherent and it's absolutely remarkable.""The Micmac Indian Craftsmen were also featured on the cover of the 1965 edition of an annual publication listing and describing artists in New Brunswick. ""All of the different craftspeople around New Brunswick, whether it's metalwork, woodwork, ceramics, they're all in here."" Leroux said. ""And on the very first page they actually have Micmac Indian Craftsmen.""In the book, the Elsipogtog artists are called the ""most progressive group of craftsmen.""""They say, 'They're doing the most modern of crafts based upon designs from legends that are centuries old,'"" Leroux said.Hassencahl-Perley didn't even know about the artists until she started this project.""Seeing it all come to light now, it's been really encouraging for me,"" she said. ""I think just in terms of looking at design and, you know, artists that were here before me and have kind of paved this path for me, to exist in this realm.""Leroux expects the Micmac Indian Craftsman exhibit and book will be ready for the fall of 2020."
N.S. retailers have high hopes for Christmas season after rough year | CBC News,"As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, businesses in Nova Scotia are finding ways to navigate the holiday season.",2020-11-17T10:00:56.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/nova-scotia-retailers-covid-19-christmas-season-1.5804142,"Some Nova Scotia retailers are hoping strong Christmas sales will make up for a year in which COVID-19 hammered many businesses' bottom lines.Halifax business professor Ed McHugh said Christmas revenue can account for more than half of a retailer's income.In a year where many local shops were forced to close, McHugh said the holiday season becomes critical.""There's a real desire out there and research showing people really want to spend local this year,"" he said.Steve Smith is the owner of Bungalow Beans. He sells coffee at the Cape Breton Farmers' Market, but also sells coffee beans and other sweets. He said buying local is especially vital right now.""The money that I make here in the farmers market goes back to the farmers market and it goes into my personal bank account that I spend here living in Cape Breton,"" he said. ""It doesn't go to the U.S., it doesn't go to China. It stays right here.""Smith said shopping in person offers the best experience for both independent retailers and the consumer.""I think if people are concerned about crowds, then shopping local is definitely the way to go,"" Smith said. ""The shops are smaller; you can ... get fewer people in the shops.""The Cape Breton Regional Chamber of Commerce is encouraging businesses to extend store hours over the coming weeks based on when consumers prefer shopping. CEO Kathleen Yurchesyn said studies have shown that most shopping in store happens after 6:00 p.m.She said retailers must adapt in other ways.""Businesses recognized that there's many people that can't come home for the holiday season, of course, with the Atlantic bubble,"" Yurchesyn said.For this reason, she expects that people who won't be able to visit home over Christmas and buy goods in store while here will instead do so online. If Nova Scotia retailers don't have an online presence, this will be problematic, said Yurchesyn.McHugh said as much as 20 per cent of shopping now happens online.""People enjoy the convenience of it,"" he said.Unless small retailers already have a solid online presence, he thinks online shopping is more beneficial to industry giants like Walmart and Amazon.Matt Rogers, the president of Bishop's Cellar in Halifax, said his business has already succeeded on that front. The downtown Halifax liquor store has used online sales for the past decade, but ramped up their efforts to send products online due to the pandemic.""This year, it has proven to be the way most intend to shop,"" Rogers said.The business purchased its own delivery truck this year to meet demand from online ordering.Rogers said web chats with workers at the store help people order products from the comfort of their home or office.MORE TOP STORIES"

""The activity [is] certainly a lot better than, you know, in the past years.""In the first 10 days after The Queen's Gambit was released, eBay reported a surge of over 270 per cent in searches for chess sets. Sklenka said that's good news for chess fans.""It's a fun game. It's an educational game,"" he said. ""And the good thing about it is, anybody can play all their lives. We have players from Grade 1 and right up to people into their 80s. So it's a very versatile game.""Sklenka said child prodigies are rare.""There's two or three from India right now. They're not even teenagers, and they're world-class players,"" he said.""There's a few around the world, but it just happens periodically that you have some real youngsters that are extremely good, and they will become top world-class players. Potentially one of them will be a world champion.""Sklenka said he hopes The Queen's Gambit is inspiring more girls and women to take up the male-dominated game.""There's a lot of women playing chess, there's more and more. And, you know, we've got to be realistic. It's still a male-dominated game, but there's a lot of good female players from around the country and the world,"" he said.Sklenka said there's a reason eastern European players, like the toughest opponents in The Queen's Gambit, do so well at chess. ""Russia, you know, the eastern European countries are supported by the government. And so it's easier for their talents to be developed,"" he said, adding that India, China and the United States, are coming up in the ranks.""Whereas in the Western world, yeah, we don't have as much support, if you will. But yeah, that would be one reason why maybe Russia is — Russia is doing so well in chess, because they do get the support from the government."" Sklenka is originally from the Czech Republic and grew up playing chess. But he said he's not one of the players who can close his eyes and see the next moves.""I certainly can't. And very, very, very few people can actually play chess blindfolded. But there are people that can … Timur Gareyev, whom I know, is a very good friend and a very good person. He's a world champion and he's played 48 games blindfolded, at the same time. And that's a world record, Guinness Book of World Records. So that's just totally unusual. The odd person can play maybe a game, perhaps two blindfolded.""Calgarians who are interested in learning more about chess, getting some lessons or joining the Calgary Chess Club, can find more information at Calgary Chess Club.The club, at 3359 27th Street N.E., isn't operating regular hours because of COVID-19. However, it is open Fridays from 7 p.m. to 9 p.m., with all COVID-19 measures in place.Listen to the full interview on the Calgary Eyeopener here:"
B.C. launches program to screen for early signs of lung cancer | CBC News,"B.C. is launching a new screening program to detect early signs of lung cancer, the province announced Monday. The program is the first of its kind in Canada and is expected to be up and running by spring 2022.",2020-09-14T19:16:52.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/b-c-lung-cancer-screening-1.5723483,"B.C. is launching a new screening program to detect early signs of lung cancer, the province announced Monday.The program is the first of its kind in Canada and is expected to be running by spring 2022, screening up to 20,000 patients a year at clinics across the province. Premier John Horgan said the program has been needed for ""a long, long time.""""At a time when we are dealing with the challenges of COVID-19, it's easy to forget that many families around the province are grappling with a cancer diagnosis. Cancer doesn't wait for global pandemics, and we know that early detection can save lives.""Six people die of lung cancer in B.C. every day. It's the most common cause of death from cancer in Canada and around the world, yet 70 per cent of lung cancers are only diagnosed when they reach advanced stages, Horgan said. Lung cancer kills more people than colon, breast and prostate cancers combined, according to Benoit Morin, president and chief executive officer of the Provincial Health Services Authority.The new screening program will use existing CT scanning technology and will mean more treatment options, faster recovery and better outcomes for patients, Horgan said. It's estimated that 300 people will be diagnosed each year through the screening program. ""These changes give people hope, give people opportunity to get early treatment because they got early diagnosis,"" Horgan said.The program will target adults between the ages of 55 and 74 who smoke or have a heavy smoking history. Lung cancer primarily affects people over the age of 50. The news conference came on a day two-thirds of B.C. is blanketed in thick smoke from wildfires burning out of control in Washington state, Oregon and California.Dr. Kim Chi, vice-president and chief medical officer of B.C. Cancer, said air quality and pollution are tied to cancer and other pulmonary illnesses.As global warming occurs, this will continue to pose a problem for the future, he said.""I think today's announcement around lung cancer screening is an important part of early detection and preventing and detecting cancers at an earlier stage where we can have increased change of curing and improving survival,"" Chi said. "

In July, PTA said it had issued a ""final warning"" to TikTok to remove ""obscene and immoral content.""The video-sharing app, which is owned by China's ByteDance, is the third-most downloaded app over the past year after WhatsApp and Facebook and has been downloaded almost 39 million times in Pakistan.The app was earlier banned by India and the United States for violating guidelines."

"Canadian foreign minister presses Chinese counterpart over Kovrig, Spavor in Rome visit: Ottawa | CBC News","Canadian Foreign Minister François-Philippe Champagne met his Chinese counterpart, state councillor Wang Yi, in Rome on Tuesday and urged Beijing to release two citizens of Canada it has detained, Ottawa said.",2020-08-26T09:59:58.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/champagne-detainee-china-1.5700096,"Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister François-Philippe Champagne met his Chinese counterpart, state councillor Wang Yi, in Rome on Tuesday and urged Beijing to release two citizens of Canada it has detained, Ottawa said.Champagne, in Europe on an official trip, met Wang in a hotel for 90 minutes. The two men previously held face-to-face talks in Japan in November 2019.Ties between the two countries deteriorated in December 2018 after Canadian police detained Meng Wanzhou, chief financial officer of Huawei Technologies, on a U.S. extradition warrant.Soon after, China arrested Canadians Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig, and in June charged them with spying. It also blocked imports of some canola seed.""Minister Champagne again reiterated that the cases of Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor remain a top priority … and that Canada continues to call on China to immediately release both men,"" Foreign Affairs said in a statement.Speaking Wednesday to CBC's Megan Williams in Rome, Champagne said the two sides ""obviously have a number of things where we disagree profoundly. But to the extent that we can talk, I think it's a positive sign of progress."" ""We're going to continue to engage and hopefully improve consular access [to Kovrig and Spavor]. This has been key in our discussions, to make sure that detainees would have access to their loved ones.""The Chinese Foreign Ministry said Wang told Champagne that Canada's unprovoked detention of Chinese citizens led to ""serious difficulties"" in the bilateral relationship. It added in a statement that Wang urged Ottawa to take action as soon as possible to remove impediments to the further development of China-Canada ties.Beijing's account of the meeting did not mention Huawei's Meng or Champagne's call for China to release Kovrig and Spavor.""Obviously, COVID is complicating access [to Kovrig and Spavor], but I did say that there's different ways you can go at it. I had offered before that one could even imagine virtual access,"" Champange told CBC News.WATCH | Champagne meets with Chinese foreign minister in Rome:CanadaThe meeting comes on the heels of a Federal Court decision denying Meng access to sensitive information contained in reports about her arrest produced by Canada's spy agency.The Huawei executive was seeking the documents in an effort to prove that she was the victim of a conspiracy between Canadian and American law enforcement.In a 35-page ruling released Tuesday, Judge Catherine Kane said Meng's lawyers had argued that they were looking for information about the planning of her arrest, interagency co-operation, the execution of the arrest and evidence gathering— but that none of that was contained in the blacked-out portions of the documents CSIS provided.""The information does not provide the 'missing pieces of the puzzle' that Meng seeks,"" Kane wrote.""The redacted information does not respond to or illuminate the allegations of abuse of process and is not the type of information that counsel for Ms. Meng noted would be relevant.""And even if it had been relevant, the judge said, she wouldn't have been inclined to release it anyway.""If any of the redacted information were marginally relevant — which it is not — the court would find that its disclosure would be injurious,"" Kane said.Canada's Foreign Affairs said Wang and Champagne also ""discussed the importance of global collaboration in the face of COVID-19, including the search for a vaccine,"" it said.Champagne also raised Canada's opposition to China over its treatment of Hong Kong, said a Canadian government official who requested anonymity given the sensitivity of the situation.Last month, Canada suspended its extradition treaty with Hong Kong following new Chinese national security legislation and said it could boost immigration from the former British colony. "

Huawei surveillance systems with facial recognition watch citizens in 50 countries | CBC News,Cameras equipped with facial recognition technology and created by Chinese telecommunications company Huawei are being rolled out across hundreds of cities around the world. They include countries with weak track records on human rights where Beijing has increased its influence through big business deals.,2019-10-16T13:32:27.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/chinese-snooping-tech-1.5322428,"When hundreds of video cameras with the power to identify and track individuals started appearing in the streets of Belgrade as part of a major surveillance project, some protesters began having second thoughts about joining anti-government demonstrations in the Serbian capital.Local authorities assert the system, created by Chinese telecommunications company Huawei, helps reduce crime in the city of two million. Critics contend it erodes personal freedoms, makes political opponents vulnerable to retribution and even exposes the country's citizens to snooping by the Chinese government.The cameras, equipped with facial recognition technology, are being rolled out across hundreds of cities around the world, particularly in poorer countries with weak track records on human rights where Beijing has increased its influence through big business deals.With the United States claiming that Chinese state authorities can get backdoor access to Huawei data, the aggressive rollout is raising concerns about the privacy of millions of people in countries with little power to stand up to China.""The system can be used to trail political opponents, monitor regime critics at any moment, which is completely against the law,"" said Serbia's former commissioner for personal data protection, Rodoljub Sabic.Groups opposed to Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic say police are leaking video of protests to pro-government media, which publish the images, along with the identities of participants. Vucic himself has boasted the police have the capability to count ""each head"" at anti-government gatherings.During a recent rally, protesters climbed up a pole and covered a camera lens with duct tape scrawled with the word ""censored.""Serbian police deny any such abuse of the Huawei system, which will eventually encompass 1,000 cameras in 800 locations throughout Belgrade. Huawei said in a statement that it ""complies with all applicable laws and regulations"" in Serbia and anywhere else it does business.While facial recognition technology is being adopted in many countries, spurring debate over the balance between privacy and safety, the Huawei system has gained extra attention due to accusations that Chinese laws requiring companies to assist in national intelligence work give authorities access to its data.As a result, some countries are reconsidering using Huawei technology, particularly the superfast 5G networks that are being rolled out later this year.Still, Huawei, which denies accusations of any Chinese government control, has had no trouble finding customers eager to install its so-called Safe Cities technology, particularly among countries that China has brought closer into its diplomatic and economic orbit.Besides Serbia, that list includes Turkey, Russia, Ukraine, Azerbaijan, Angola, Laos, Kazakhstan, Kenya and Uganda, as well as a few liberal democracies like Germany, France and Italy. The system is used in some 230 cities, exposing tens of millions of people to its screening.In a promotional brochure, Huawei says its video surveillance technology can scan over long distances to detect ""abnormal behaviour"" such as loitering, track the movement of cars and people, calculate crowd size and send alerts to a command centre if it detects something suspicious. Local authorities can then act upon the information they receive.In one case advertised on its website, the company says a suspect in a hit-and-run accident in Belgrade was later discovered in China with the help of face recognition data shared by the Serbian police with their Chinese counterparts.In view of the cybersecurity accusations levelled by the U.S. and international rights groups against Huawei, the relationship between China and countries that use the company's technology is coming under renewed scrutiny.China's influence in Serbia, a European Union candidate that Beijing views as a gateway to the continent, has significantly expanded in recent years through Beijing's global Belt and Road investment programs.The populist Serbian regime has been keen to develop closer ties and the country's fragile democracy allows China's economic interests to grow relatively unchecked, without raising too many questions about human rights, environmental standards or transparency.China's state investment bank has granted billions of dollars in easy-term loans to build coal-powered plants, roads, railroads and bridges. Chinese police officers even help patrol the streets of Belgrade, a security presence officially billed as assisting the growing number of Chinese tourists who visit the city.It's a similar story in Uganda, where China has invested heavily in infrastructure like highways and a hydropower dam on the Nile.When longtime President Yoweri Museveni launched a $167 million Cdn project to install Huawei facial recognition systems a year ago, he said the cameras were ""eyes, ears and a nose"" to fight rampant street crime in the sprawling capital, Kampala. Opposition activists say the real goal is to deter street protesters against an increasingly unpopular government.""The cameras are politically motivated,"" said Joel Ssenyonyi, a spokesman for the musician and activist known as Bobi Wine who has emerged as a powerful challenger to Museveni. ""They are not doing this for security. The focus for them is hunting down political opponents.""In neighbouring Kenya, the government has also renewed its focus on public safety after a spate of extremist attacks. It has been pushing to register people digitally, including by recording DNA, iris and facial data. To do so, it turned to China, which helped finance the installation of surveillance cameras in Kenya as far back as 2012.The Kenyan government wants to pool into one database all the information from public and private CCTV cameras, including those with facial recognition technology, a move that activists warn would vastly expand its surveillance powers in a country that does not have comprehensive data protection laws.A growing number of countries are following China's lead in deploying artificial intelligence to track citizens, according to the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.The group says at least 75 countries are actively using AI tools such as facial recognition for surveillance — and Huawei has sold its systems in 50 of those countries, giving it a far wider reach than competitors such as Japan-based NEC and U.S.-based IBM.""It's very unclear what safeguards are being put in place,"" said Steven Feldstein, a Carnegie Endowment fellow who authored a report on the issue.""Where are images being stored? How long are they being stored for? What kind of accountability procedures will there be? What type of operations will be linked to these surveillance cameras?""Huawei said in an emailed statement that it ""complies with all applicable laws and regulations in our countries of business. This is the most fundamental principle of our business operations. We are dedicated to bringing people better connectivity, eliminating digital gaps, and promoting the sustainable development of our societies and economies.""In Belgrade's bustling downtown Republic Square, high-tech video cameras are pointed in all directions from an office building as pedestrians hurry about their everyday business.With public authorities disclosing little about how the cameras work, a rights group has set up a tent to ask pedestrians whether they know they are being watched.""We don't want to be in some kind of Big Brother society,"" said rights activist Ivana Markulic. ""We are asking: Where are the cameras, where are they hidden, how much did we pay for them and what's going to happen with information collected after this surveillance?"""

Coronavirus: What's happening around the world on June 15 | CBC News,"China's capital is bracing for a resurgence of the coronavirus, with more than 100 new cases reported over recent days in a city that hadn't seen a case of local transmission in more than a month. Here's a look at what's happening around the world.",2020-06-15T09:39:23.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/china-coronavirus-resurgence-1.5612124,"The latest:Just days after declaring the country was COVID-19 free, New Zealand's Health Ministry confirmed Tuesday it had two new cases, both ""related to the border as a result of recent travel from the U.K.,"" according to a statement.The ministry said the cases were related and that it would release more information at a news conference later in the day.On June 8, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern told reporters she was ""confident we have eliminated transmission of the virus in New Zealand for now,"" but she warned there could be more cases there again. The head of the World Health Organization says more than 100,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 caused by the novel coronavirus have been reported worldwide each day over the past two weeks — mostly in the Americas and South Asia — and countries that have curbed transmissions ""must stay alert to the possibility of resurgence.""Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus noted a new cluster of cases in Beijing, which went more than 50 days without a new case of COVID-19, and said the origin of that outbreak is under investigation.The origins of the Beijing cluster are not certain. WHO officials said Monday that the claim they might have been caused by imports or packaging of salmon related to a local market are a ""hypothesis.""WATCH | WHO addresses new cases in China:WorldIn Europe, meanwhile, some nations eased border controls on Monday as coronavirus cases declined after three months of lockdown, with shoppers lining up in London for non-essential goods and French bargain hunters streaming into Belgium to buy cheap cigarettes.The total number of confirmed COVID-19 cases globally is closing in on eight million, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. More than two million of those cases are in the United States. There have been nearly 435,000 deaths from COVID-19 around the world, with about 116,000 of them in the U.S.In Europe, Greek airports allowed more international flights as the country sought to salvage its summer season, German tourists flocking to neighbouring Denmark caused an eight-kilometre queue, and Italians popped into France to buy lottery scratch cards.But the continued closure of most of Spain, a patchwork of quarantine rules and remote-working by many who once commuted across borders, means it will not be a return to unfettered travel for 420 million Europeans.Spain is initially allowing in 10,000 holidaymakers from Germany as the Madrid government works out how to handle mass tourism before opening up more fully in the coming weeks.Hundreds of German sun-seekers, the first tourists to visit Spain since borders were closed in March, arrived in Mallorca on Monday on a flight from Düsseldorf.""Holidaymakers can be happy that the beaches in Palma have never been so empty,"" said Aage Duenhaupt, a spokesperson for travel company TUI. ""But there won't be parties in the same way this year.""In Greece, passengers arriving from airports deemed high-risk will be tested and quarantined for up to 14 days, depending on the result. Restrictions remain for passengers from Britain and Turkey. Arrivals from other airports will be randomly tested.WATCH | What it looks like boarding a plane during COVID-19:Spain will allow no foreign tourists until June 21, with exceptions for some islands.Elsewhere, the right to travel will depend on where you live and where you are going. The Czech Republic has a traffic-light system, barring tourists from ""orange"" or ""red"" countries, such as Portugal and Sweden.Denmark will accept tourists from Iceland, Germany and Norway, but not Sweden, if they book at least six nights' accommodation.Britain's two-week quarantine for visitors means Britons will face the same confinement in France.Before the crisis, about 3.5 million people crossed an internal EU border every day, according to a 2019 European Parliament report, some 1.7 million of them commuters.Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced Monday that the federal government will extend the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB), with details to follow in the days ahead.The CERB is due to run out soon for people who have been on the benefit since it was first launched in April, at the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic.People can only claim the benefit for 16 weeks — four eligibility periods — and the end of the program's fourth eligibility period is early July.""We're working on a solution to extend the benefit for people who can't return to work yet,"" Trudeau said. ""We'll have more details this week, but for today, I want you to know that we'll continue to be there for you and your family.""WATCH | Epidemiologist says COVID-19 toll may be higher than official totals:CanadaAs of 3:45 p.m. ET on Monday, there were 99,091 confirmed and presumptive coronavirus cases in Canada, with 61,000 cases considered recovered or resolved. A CBC News tally of deaths based on provincial data, regional health information and CBC's reporting stood at 8,220.India's Health Ministry reported a jump of more than 11,000 new infections nationwide for a third consecutive day on Monday. The country's home minister offered 500 train carriages for use as makeshift coronavirus hospital wards as New Delhi struggles to contain a spike in cases.The Indian capital has about 9,000 beds dedicated to COVID-19 patients in public and private hospitals, but a state government panel of experts has said it will need at least 15,000 beds by the end of June.Long lines stretched along streets across England as shops selling items considered non-essential during the pandemic, such as sneakers and toys, welcomed customers on Monday for the first time since the United Kingdom was put into lockdown in late March.Starved of the retail experience for the better part of three months, shoppers generally appeared to abide by the physical distancing requirement to stay two metres apart as they awaited their turn to enter the stores.Monday's reopening of shops, from department stores to booksellers and electronics retailers, only applies to England. Scotland and Wales are taking a more tentative approach to the easing of the coronavirus restrictions. Northern Ireland's stores reopened last week. England also saw zoos, safari parks and drive-in cinemas reopen on Monday.Russian President Vladimir Putin blamed America's lack of centralized authority for its inability to stem the spread of the virus, while saying Russia was ""working quite steadily and getting out of this situation … with minimal losses.""In the U.S., ""this is not happening,"" Putin said, noting the central and regional governments work more closely in Russia.Russia, nevertheless, has recorded more than half a million infections and nearly 7,000 virus deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins count.Egypt's Health Ministry has confirmed 1,691 new cases of the coronavirus, including 97 deaths, the country's highest toll for one day.There have officially been 46,289 COVID-19 cases and 1,672 deaths recorded since the virus first emerged in Egypt in February. Egypt has the highest death rate in the Arab world and the third highest in the Middle East after Iran and Turkey. The government has resisted a full lockdown in an effort to keep the economy functioning. Even as caseloads multiply in the Arab world's most populous country, authorities have shortened the nightly curfew and plan to reopen airports for tourism to less hard-hit destinations next month.South Korea is also among the countries seeking to prevent a resurgence of the outbreak, reporting 37 new cases of COVID-19 on Monday. The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said 25 of the cases came from the Seoul area, where health authorities are scrambling to trace infections linked to entertainment and leisure activities, church gatherings, warehouse workers and door-to-door sellers.In France, restaurants in the Paris region will be allowed to join those in the rest of the country in opening indoor seating starting Monday. From June 22, all nursery schools, primary schools and junior high schools will be open and mandatory for all students. Authorities in Pakistan said they will reimpose strict lockdowns in selected areas of several cities from Monday night, a day after the federal government said COVID-19 cases could multiply eightfold by the end of July and hit 1.2 million.""A total of 20 cities across Pakistan have been identified as having likely increase in ratio/speed of infection, which needs restrictive measures for containment,"" said a statement Monday by the body that co-ordinates the national response to the virus.Pakistan has reported 144,477 cases of the respiratory illness and 2,729 deaths so far.In Africa, where the virus continues to spread, Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta's office says four people who work at the presidential residence have tested positive for COVID-19, though the president and his family do not appear to be affected.Ghana's Health Minister Kwaku Agyemang-Manu has contracted COVID-19 and is undergoing treatment at a hospital."

U.S. begins to pare back Hong Kong's special status amid scrutiny over security law | CBC News,"The U.S. began eliminating Hong Kong's special status under U.S. law on Monday, halting defence exports and restricting the territory's access to high technology products as China prepares new Hong Kong security legislation.",2020-06-29T23:42:07.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/hong-kong-us-security-law-special-status-1.5632161,"The U.S. began eliminating Hong Kong's special status under U.S. law on Monday, halting defence exports and restricting the territory's access to high technology products as China prepares new Hong Kong security legislation.The U.S. move comes as the top decision-making body of China's parliament deliberates a draft national security law for Hong Kong that pro-democracy activists in the city fear will be used to eliminate dissent and tighten Beijing's control.""The Chinese Communist Party's decision to eviscerate Hong Kong's freedoms has forced the Trump administration to re-evaluate its policies toward the territory,"" U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said.The Chinese embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Last month, U.S. President Donald Trump responded to China's plans for the security law by saying he was initiating a process to eliminate special economic treatment that has allowed Hong Kong to remain a global financial centre since its handover by Britain in 1997.Trump stopped short of calling for an immediate end to privileges but said the moves would affect the full range of U.S. agreements with Hong Kong, from an extradition treaty to export controls on dual-use technologies and more — ""with few exceptions.""The U.S. Commerce Department said it was suspending ""preferential treatment to Hong Kong over China, including the availability of export-license exceptions.""Further actions to eliminate Hong Kong's status were being evaluated, the departmemt said.In 2018, $432.7 million US of goods were shipped to Hong Kong under a Commerce Department exception, mostly relating to encryption, software and technology.Pompeo said the United States, effective Monday, was ending exports of defence equipment to Hong Kong and will also take steps to end the export of dual-use technologies, which have both commercial and military uses.Last year, the Department of State approved approximately $2.4 million US worth of controlled defence articles and services to Hong Kong government authorities, of which approximately $1.4 million US worth was shipped, according State Department records.""The United States is forced to take this action to protect U.S. national security,"" Pompeo said. ""We can no longer distinguish between the export of controlled items to Hong Kong or to mainland China.""The announcements come at a time of intensified U.S. rhetoric against Beijing as Trump campaigns for re-election in November. Opinion polls have shown voters increasingly embittered toward China, especially over the coronavirus, which began there."
Canada joins U.S.-led Artemis Accords to send human explorers back to moon and beyond | CBC News,"Canada has signed on to the Artemis Accords, a U.S.-led effort to establish global guidelines for sending explorers back to the moon and beyond.",2020-10-14T11:12:25.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/artemis-accords-1.5761456,"Canada has signed on to the Artemis Accords, a U.S.-led effort to establish global guidelines for sending explorers back to the moon and beyond.NASA says space agencies in Australia, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, Luxembourg and the United Arab Emirates also joined the pact. NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine said he expects more countries to join the effort to put astronauts back on the moon by 2024.It promises to be the largest coalition for a human spaceflight program in history, according to Bridenstine, and is expected to pave the way for eventual Mars expeditions.The accords, which establish rules for extracting and using ""space resources,"" commit signatories to exploring space peacefully and in the spirit of international co-operation.Rule No. 1: Everyone must come in peace. Other rules:Violators could be asked to leave, according to Bridenstine. The coalition can say, ""Look, you're in this program with the rest of us, but you're not playing by the same rules,"" Bridenstine said.The U.S. is the only country to put humans on the moon: 12 men from 1969 through 1972.Russia is still on the fence.

NASA is prohibited under law, at least for now, from signing any bilateral agreements with China.The rules also call for transparency, the protection of heritage sites like the 1969 moon landing location and preventing the spread of orbital debris.Canadian Space Agency president Lisa Campbell cheers the accords, but says more robust rules for the exploration of deep space are still a long way off.Campbell says the agency will begin consulting with Canadians, as well as a United Nations committee that oversees space exploration."

TRANSCRIPT: SANCTIONED - EPISODE 7 | CBC Radio,Full-text transcript for Sanctioned episode seven,2020-07-24T17:34:01.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/radio/podcastnews/transcript-sanctioned-episode-7-1.5662080," Sanctioned - The Arrest Warrant Host: Stephen Quinn Announcer: This is a CBC Podcast. [music: somber] Stephen: Previously, on Sanctioned. Huawei Chief Financial Officer, Meng Wanzhou is arrested at Vancouver International Airport in December 2018. She's accused of fraud in the United States, and later released on $10 million bail, meanwhile, two Canadians are accused of spying on China and a third is sentenced to death. Politicians in Canada, China, and the U.S. are drawn into a war of words and actions and Huawei's role in the next generation of wireless technology is questioned. [music: somber] [sound: outdoor din] Stephen: On the afternoon of the first nice day of spring, a black SUV pulls into a quiet street in the tony Vancouver neighbourhood of Shaughnessy. Another black SUV is already parked on the road. Two suited men are inside, they watch as the first vehicle pulls in front of a gated, twenty-year-old house. A slight Chinese woman steps out of the SUV. Across the street, another woman, a journalist, holds a camera.  [sound: camera clicks] Stephen: She's been standing there for hours. Her interest perks up as the vehicle pulls in front of her, blocking a view of the gate and the house beyond. [music: somber] Stephen: The female passenger from the SUV stands on the sidewalk, surveying the property. It's May 11th, 2019, and Meng Wanzhou is moving house and the two men keeping watch for Meng aren't the only security in the area. The home of the American consul is nearby and it's also guarded around the clock. It is an interesting situation that a woman the U.S. wants to incarcerate, and the official representative of the United States, are polite neighbours in Vancouver, a city that has become an unlikely battleground in a fight between global superpowers. Teeth aren't bared, weapons aren't drawn between enemies in a place like this. After all, we're in Shaughnessy, a stately clutch of mansions and old money located in the heart of the city's west side, where streets like Matthews, Angus and Marguerite are named for Canadian Pacific Railway executives who built the neighbourhood a century ago, but it's a fight all the same.  [music: somber] Stephen: And as the chief financial officer of the world's largest telecommunications equipment maker eyes her new home, Meng Wanzhou's address isn't the only thing that's about to change. Her lawyers are preparing to attack, her company will face a threat that could shake the order of the digital universe. Canada's economy will feel China's wrath and the order of the political world, or at least the lines between east and west will be tested by unrest in Meng's other home, Hong Kong. [music: somber] Stephen: I'm Stephen Quinn and you're listening to Sanctioned: The Arrest of a Telecom Giant, a CBC Vancouver original podcast about Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou, and her fight against possible extradition and jailing in the United States for allegedly violating economic sanctions against Iran. It's a journey deep into the world of global business and politics, up front deals and allegations of back room skullduggery in the battle to dominate the economies of the future, not to mention the extraordinary wealth and power of a few of the world's most influential players. Stephen: We launched in April 2019 with six episodes that covered the time from Meng's arrest in Vancouver on December 1st 2018 to the growing fallout from her situation a few months later, including the arrest of two Canadians in China for allegations of spying and the sentencing of a third Canadian to death for drug trafficking. We promised we'd be back, and that time is now, as Meng prepares for court proceedings ahead of an extradition hearing set to begin in January of 2020. A lot has changed since Sanctioned first dropped, and if you haven't listened to those first six episodes, now might be a good time to go back and add them to your feed, but since we last spoke, relations between Canada and China have hit an all-time low. The trade battle between the United States and China has only intensified and a flood of new details about Meng's arrest have emerged. Stephen: Over the next two episodes, we'll examine the ever expanding ripple effects of Meng's arrest as President Donald Trump announces new measures to keep Huawei out of the U.S. technological supply stream, and we'll zoom in on three crucial hours in this story, the hours immediately after Meng stepped off her flight from Hong Kong and before she was arrested by the RCMP in Vancouver. Hours in which her lawyers claim Canadian and U.S. authorities colluded to violate Meng's rights so badly that they want the case against her tossed, but we'll begin where so much of the case has played out in the legal arena where Meng Wanzhou emerges with a new look, a new strategy, and a bid to reshape the narrative. This is Sanctioned, Episode 7: The Arrest Warrant. [music: somber] Stephen: The pose of the woman in this grainy video would be familiar to anyone who has ever been called aside for secondary inspection at an airport. Tired after a long flight, Meng Wanzhou is seen standing with her hands in the pockets of a dark tracksuit, comfortable wear for the long flight from Hong Kong. She's at a counter in an area of YVR that, if they're lucky, most travellers never see. Eight pieces of luggage are piled on a trolley nearby. [sound: The goings-on of a luggage search] Stephen: Two men in dark uniforms sift through Meng's bags, as they ask her questions. They are Canada Border Services Agents, and they can seize and examine the items of anyone trying to enter the country. They don't need warrants and they're not required to warn anyone about the legal consequences of volunteering information. It's those powers and the use of them that will come into question as Meng Wanzhou's extradition hearing nears, because her lawyers, who filed this video with the court, claim that the Royal Canadian Mounted Police conspired with the border agency to detain Meng for more than three hours before officially arresting her. Stephen: The reason? According to the defence, it's so the RCMP could mount a covert criminal investigation against Meng using the CBSA to detain and question her,  all allegedly, at the direction of the American FBI.  [music: somber] Stephen: CBC reporter Jason Proctor has been following the court proceedings. He's with me now. Hello, Jason. Jason Proctor: Hello, Stephen.  Stephen: So, this video was actually released by B.C. Supreme Court Associate Chief Justice Heather Holmes in mid August. What happened in court that day? Jason: Well, yes, so the video was actually released nearly half a year after surveillance cameras captured those first, very tense moments that Meng spent on Canadian soil and months after she made her last in-person court appearance before Holmes, So this was actually the first time that we got a look at Meng Wanzhou for quite a few months, and to be honest, her appearance was quite different from the way it had been previously, when she'd sort of been wearing what looked like that same tracksuit that you see her in, in this video. Stephen: Right, and how is she different then? Jason:  Well, she kind of traded those floppy hats and casual wear of these previous court dates for a look that many people thought was much more fitting for a woman who is the chief financial officer of a multi billion dollar company so she wore a designer dress, you know, hair kind of flowing over her shoulders, held back by this stylish silver headband. I checked the logo, she was clutching a small Chanel bag, kind of gold chain on black material and and she, you know, with all of this, makes her way into the court at the side of one of the guards that she's still paying, if you recall, to maintain this kind of virtual jail around her that she's agreed to live in 24/7 as part of a ten million dollar bail agreement. Stephen: And an ankle monitoring bracelet to complete the ensemble. Jason:  Exactly. This was actually one of, the kind of fascinating things, is she's wearing this dress and just below the, kind of hem of the dress, which is just above her ankle, and these kind of low heeled sandals, you see this very solid ankle monitor which is, you know, cemented onto her leg to basically make sure that she maintains this boundary and a limitation of her movements around Vancouver, while she's under the direction of the court. Stephen: Alright. Now, this court appearance that you attended, this would, I guess begin the process that would culminate with the release of the video, but there were also other notes and documents that were gathered by Meng's lawyers to support the claim that authorities had violated her rights from the outset. What are Meng's lawyers basing that claim on? Jason: Well, so they say it was an abuse of process, what happened to her at the airport in those crucial first three hours and Scott Fenton, a top tier defender who flew out from Toronto to join Meng's legal team, told Justice Holmes he believed it was serious enough to warrant a stay of proceedings, in other words to toss the case  and set Meng free. I should say Scott Fenton is renowned for his knowledge of fraud and of cases dealing with the corruption of public officials and with Meng's case, he claimed the CBSA, that's Canada Border Services Agency, the RCMP, and the FBI weren't the only ones at fault here. He also pointed a finger at U.S. President Donald Trump.  [music: somber] Stephen: Donald Trump's shadow has loomed over Meng's case from almost the beginning, ever since he suggested she could be used as a bargaining chip if it would get the U.S. a better trade deal with China. [news clips play] Reporter: Here's what the president said in an interview late yesterday with Reuters about the Huawei CFO, Meng Wanzhou. He said, if I think it's good for the country, if I think it's good for what will be, certainly, the largest trade deal ever made, which is a very important thing, what's good for national security, I would certainly intervene if I thought it was necessary. Reporter 2: He also said that he, that, ah, he would,  the release of Meng could be part of a broader trade deal with China. So, President Trump really throwing a bit of a wrench into this case, essentially confirming that Meng Wanzhou is a bargaining chip. Reporter 3:  Meng's lawyer says she's being held hostage as part of a U.S. trade spat with China, but U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin in a Tuesday interview on Fox News said the pursuit against Huawei had nothing to do with trade negotiations. The Chinese government however doesn't agree. Stephen: But as the months following Meng's arrest begin to add up, so did the weight of U.S. pressure on Huawei. The company had already been excluded from bidding on American government contracts, a move that would effectively freeze them from the U.S. 5G grid, but in May, Donald Trump took another extraordinary step. [news clips play] Reporter: The Trump administration is cracking down on Chinese telecom giant Huawei.There are two specific actions that were taken yesterday. The first one came from the White House, that executive order essentially enabling the U.S. to ban telecommunications equipment from quote, ""foreign adversaries"". They didn't specifically single out China or Huawei, but this more significant movement yesterday came from the Department of Commerce, adding Huawei to a so-called entity list. Reporter 2:  That effectively prevents it from buying American parts, unless it has U.S. government approval, they say. So, they are definitely targeting Huawei with the Commerce Department action, the commerce secretary is gonna have a lot of discretion in how to approve and process all of this. Stephen: Now, if the phrase, ""Entity List"" sounds bland and bureaucratic, the names on the list are anything but. There are 300 pages worth of firms and people accused of being at risk of funding ""activities contrary to U.S. interests"" and list spans ""entities"" range from Afghanistan, to Vietnam, to China. [clip of Paul Evans speaking] Paul Evans: See, Huawei is, in some ways, corporate enemy number 1 in the context of American thinking. I am Paul Evans, a professor of Asian international affairs and the school of public policy and global affairs at the University of British Columbia. I just returned from Washington, where I met with think tanks and government agencies on the matter of the U.S. China relationship, which I think many of us see in a spiral downwards, at this stage. Five years ago, Americans who were looking at the rise of China, it's important, they had some criticisms they had some worries on the military side, but five years ago the view was, China can't innovate, because of its political system and because of its state led economic system, it could imitate, it could steal, but it could not innovate. Paul: Viewed now, it's exactly the reverse. United States is afraid of a China that can innovate and that it can innovate at world class levels. 5G technology is just one example of artificial intelligence, quantum computing robotics. Suddenly, this is a China that can innovate and the kicker is that it can innovate because it has an authoritarian political system and state led economy. Stephen:  Well, now that Huawei and 68 of its affiliates are on the entity list and deemed a potential threat to U.S. national security, the Chinese telecom giant will be banned from even buying parts and components from American companies without U.S. approval. Huawei responded by shrugging the problem off. [Huawei representative and affiliates speaking in Mandarin] Voicer: Our business in the United States is not that big. Due to our global operations, any change in one country has little impact on our global business.  Voicer 2: The U.S. is using its national power to constantly and deliberately smear and suppress certain Chinese companies by all means. This is not honorable nor is it just. People can clearly see their intentions. [somber music] Stephen: But the implications are far reaching, Huawei is the world's second largest producer of Android phones. Being cut off from U.S. technology would mean running without American operating systems. On a basic level that means a phone or mobile device without Google, of course, Huawei has the ability to design its own operating systems with China's own version of Google, but experts began warning that, if taken to its natural conclusion, Huawei's place on the entity list could signal the beginning of a world divided into East and West when it comes to digital devices and instead of the increased globalization that has marked the past few decades of technological growth, the world could be moving towards a new kind of cold war, one that would be played out through smartphones and tablets. Stephen: Trump almost immediately suspended the designation, opting instead to re-consider Huawei's place as a pariah, every three months. Now, bear in mind that at this point, China and the United States were already locked in a trade war and if anything, the tensions in that spat didn't appear to be decreasing, instead, they were ramping up. [news clips play] Reporter: There is heightened tension tonight between the world's two largest economies. President Trump is now threatening more tariffs on China. Donald Trump: We had a deal with China. It was 95 percent there and then my representatives, as you know, Secretary Mnuchin and  Robert Lighthizer our ambassador, Lighthizer, they went to China and they were told the things that were fully agreed to, we're not going to get anymore. They're going to un-agree to them. That's not acceptable. I said good, that's fine, put on the tariffs. Reporter 2: It looks like they've gone ahead and done it and increased the tariffs to 25 percent. How will China retaliate? Woman:  Just after the tariffs went into effect, the Chinese MOFCOM published a post on its website, saying that China deeply regrets for U.S. decision to increase tariffs and China will have to take a necessary counter measures. Stephen: So, as experts began fretting about the possibility of greater damage to both economies. Any bargaining chip in the trade battle would be a big deal for the U.S. Meng's lawyer, Scott Fenton, knew all this when he stood up in court in August to call Trump's original comments about his client ""intimidating and corrosive""  Stephen: And so Meng's legal team worked to draw up a narrative that would place the actions of those border guards who searched her bags on December 1st within that greater context of a global economic battle, a battle where a meddling U.S. president is determined to humble the Chinese economic giant and its unsuspecting chief financial officer. [music: somber] [sound: pages flipping]  Stephen: The notes of the RCMP officers tasked with arresting Meng Wanzhou indicate that they knew the case would be complicated from the outset. ""Female never flies to USA,'' wrote one officer. ""Do not want to alert online for flight manifest"", wrote another. ""No trust."" Stephen: Those notes were released at the same time as the airport video, fleshing out the details of the defence team's allegations. They also show that the plan had originally been to enter Meng's plane after it landed and to arrest her at that time. After all, a judge had given them a warrant that justified her immediate arrest, but instead, Meng was led by border guards to that secondary inspection area in the airport. In the video footage, Meng is flicking her hair away from her shoulders as a female guard trails. She's questioned about her business activities by Acting CBSA Superintendent Surjit Dhillon. According to his notes, the questioning went like this: [clip of Dhillon speaking]  Surjit Dhillon: I asked the subject if her company sold products in the United States.The subject stated, ""no we do not."" The subject was then asked if her company sold products in countries that they should not. The subject appeared confused by the questions. I rephrased the question and asked the subject if her company sold products or did business in Iran. The subject initially stated, ""I don't know.""  I reminded the subject that she is the CFO of a multibillion dollar company and that it would be hard for me to believe that she wouldn't know these details about her company. The subject stated that her company does have an office in Iran. Stephen: So, was this the smoking gun that RCMP were hoping to secure at the direction of the FBI? An admission that Huawei had an office in Iran? Jason Proctor is back with us and certainly a lot of American news outlets treated it that way. Jason: Yes, you saw that is a headline coming out of this trove of documents, you know, hundreds of pages worth of notes of border guards transcripts of interviews, all kinds of things and remember this all goes back to-- and  the reason why the possible admission of anything with regards to Iran is so important, because it was Huawei's activities in Iran that were the basis for Meng's arrest and the allegation that she had lied to banks about Huawei's alleged relationship with Skycom, a firm that was said to be a hidden subsidiary for the company doing business in Iran that violated U.S. sanctions.  Jason: So, Meng's lawyers claim that during the three hours before she was arrested, Canadian authorities were actually in constant contact with their American counterparts and they were ordered to seize Meng's mobile devices because you know they were allegedly told to obtain Meng's passwords, again all according to the defense and to question her, all in the aid of trying to get the information that could help send her to jail. Stephen: And Meng's lawyers also released a transcript of an interview with an RCMP officer. Jason: Exactly, and this is one of the documents I found most fascinating, just because it reveals more than we ever knew about these first moments where she's told, you are under arrest and this is what's going on. This was a transcript of an interview with RCMP Constable Winston Yep. He's the officer who obtained the provisional warrant to arrest  Meng at the behest of the United States, and again, this is the record of the moment at which Meng is officially taken into police custody and these wheels of justice begin turning. [music: somber] Stephen: It was twelve minutes past two on December 1st, 2018. Constable Winston Yep and Meng sat in an office at the airport with another officer, Constable Dawn But. In a halting speech full of ums and ahs, Constable Yep tells Meng why she has been arrested. Constable But translates into Mandarin. [clip of Dawn But's voicer speaking] Winston Yep: [speaking: English] Dawn But: [translating into Mandarin] Because in the United States, uh, you have committed fraud, uh, we're arresting you and then you will be sent back to the United States.  Stephen: The conversation switches back and forth between English and Mandarin, as the two officers read the warrant to Meng. Yep asks if she has any questions. Meng responds in Mandarin. [clip of Meng's voicer speaking] Meng Wanzhou: [speaking: Mandarin] Translator: I'm not clear on what has happened. Why would I have an arrest warrant, and I have got involved in fraud? Stephen: The officers attempt to explain, but Meng is slow to understand. Finally, she says...  [clip of Meng's voicer speaking] Meng: [speaking: Mandarin]  Translator: You're saying, because of my company, you're arresting me, you're saying, you're going to arrest me? And then send me to the United States? Stephen: This is Meng Wanzhou before she has a lawyer, so the two constables begin explaining how she can go about getting one, either through her company or through legal aid. Fast forward to May 2019, and Meng now has not one lawyer, but four, and all of them are present in the courtroom. David Martin, Scott Fenton, Richard Peck, and Eric Gottardi, all jointly sign their legal briefs with the kind of flourish you'd be more likely to see on a communique from the G7, rather than a memorandum in support of an application. But they've come up with a strategy to match Meng's more business-like look, and her move to her multi-million dollar mansion. It's matched by the more aggressive pose struck by Huawei's media spokesman as well. Stephen: Benjamin Howes stands on the steps of the courthouse after the proceedings are done for the day, and echoes the arguments that the lawyers inside the court have just made. [clip of Benjamin Howes speaking] Benjamin Howes: From the beginning, Huawei has expressed extreme confidence in Ms. Meng's innocence. We have maintained that her U.S. ordered arrest was an unlawful abuse of process, one guided by political considerations and tactics, not by the rule of law. Canadians value the rule of law, and the Charter of Rights. Law enforcement officials are expected to follow the rules at all times, in all cases and for all people, citizens and visitors alike. We have trust in the Canadian judicial process and we look forward to seeing Ms. Meng's freedom restored. Stephen: And so the stage is set for the battle to come, and like so many Canadian legal fights, the Charter of Rights and Freedoms appears likely to play a central role.It's the document that underpins much of modern Canadian life, from the right to live a life free of persecution or discrimination, to the right to end one's own life. The Charter is part of the legacy of former Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, coming into effect in 1982. Pierre Trudeau, of course, was the father of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who now has to deal with the growing economic and political repercussions of his government's decision to arrest Meng Wanzhou on behalf of the United States and away from the courtroom, those pressures are mounting. [advertisement for canola plays] Man: Thinking about canola, 50 years ago, even 20 years ago, it was that close to being considered as a weed. Woman: It's the most profitable crop for us producers to grow. Stephen: Canada is the world's number one exporter of canola, a crop described as the country's greatest agricultural success story. The vast prairie fields of Saskatchewan and Manitoba are ablaze with yellow flowers of the plant, whose name is literally a combination of the worlds Canada and oil. It produces one of the world's healthiest vegetable oils, high-protein animal feed, and biofuel, and as China looked for new ways to show its displeasure with Canada's role in the arrest of a Chinese business icon, canola must have made a very tempting target. Stephen: Canola seed exports to China were worth $2.8 billion in 2018, but then suddenly, China announced that it had concerns with pests in the products of two of Canada's main seed exporters, placing a ban on imports to China. [clip of conference] Woman: Speaker, we've just learned that China will stop purchasing Canadian canola wheat, peas, linseed, and canola meal. This is devastating news for our farmers. More than 40 percent of Canadian canola alone is currently sold to China. The loss of this market is catastrophic and it will cost billions of dollars to our economy. Man: We're really puzzled by the problem in the first place, we are very confident of the quality of Canadian canola on international markets. Man 2: We've heard very clearly that there is a significant interest in sending a high level delegation to China and to talk about the extraordinary work that we do in termsof oversight inspection and the science around ensuring the safety of, and the quality of everything Canada exports. We're very much looking at the possibility of sending a high level delegation to China. Stephen: China claimed the situation had nothing to do with Meng Wanzhou, but a pattern began to emerge. China also moved to suspend imports of Canadian pork, and then all Canadian meat, business worth hundreds of millions of dollars each year and that's to say nothing of the human lives at stake. Canadians Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig were still jailed in China, accused of spying. [news clips play] Reporter: Very little information is trickling out on the condition of two Canadians being held by authorities in China. Reporter 2: In China, there's no coincidence, if they want to send you a message, they will send you a message. Woman: I was able to have a formal bilateral meeting with Minister Wang Yi, the Chinese foreign minister. In that meeting, I expressed Canada's very grave concern about the arbitrary detentions of Michael Kovrig and of Michael Spavor. These are two very brave Canadians who are showing remarkable grace and resilience in difficult circumstances. Stephen: But it's not just Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig, there's also Robert Schellenberg, sentenced to death for drug trafficking and then one more Canadian, Fan Wei, also sentenced to death in China in a separate drug trafficking case that emerged in April. China claimed it had legitimate reasons for all its actions, an additive found in the pork, or the actions of judges and juries beyond its control, but a foreign ministry spokesman warned Canada to take his country's concerns seriously. As Meng's lawyers point out, their allegations about abuse of process are one thing, but the very crime that their client is accused of violating sanctions against Iran, would not even be considered a crime in Canada because Canada does not have those same sanctions imposed by the United States as part of Trump's quest to isolate Iran further from the global community. Stephen: It is just one more case of Canada, a relatively small country of 37 million people, trying to establish its own identity in the presence and under the pressure of much bigger countries. As the Huawei spokesman pointed out, Canadians do value the Charter of Rights, just like they value independence, the rule of law, and the friendship of much bigger nations, and Canadians are about to ask themselves a crucial question in relation to the many things they cherish: what cost are they willing to pay to defend and uphold those values? Stephen: Coming up, on the next episode of Sanctioned: the words of a former Canadian prime minister come to haunt the current leader.  China pressures Canada to release Meng Wanzhou, while trying to stifle the protests of opponents in Hong Kong. [clip from Red Dragon plays]  Man: Whatever the Americans are claiming is a lie. Stephen: Art imitates life, as plans are announced for a movie, based on Meng Wanzhou's story.[music: somber] Stephen: I'm Stephen Quinn.

But the black-shirts were not innocent,"" he said on air on August 21st.""In fact, Lam Cheuk-ting led the black-shirts going to the railway station.

U.S. suspends plans to hike tariffs Tuesday on Chinese imports | CBC News,"The United States is suspending a tariff hike on $250 billion in Chinese imports that was set to take effect Tuesday, and China agreed to buy $40 billion to $50 billion in U.S. farm products as the world's two biggest economies reached a cease-fire in their 15-month trade war.",2019-10-11T15:59:48.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/us-china-trade-talks-1.5318018,"The Trump administration is suspending a tariff hike on $250 billion in Chinese imports that was set to take effect Tuesday, and China agreed to buy $40 billion to $50 billion in U.S. farm products as the world's two biggest economies reached a cease-fire in their 15-month trade war.The White House said the two sides made some progress on the thornier issues, including China's lax protection of foreign intellectual property. But more work will have to be done on key differences in later negotiations, including U.S. allegations that China forces foreign countries to hand over trade secrets in return for access to the Chinese market.The U.S. and Chinese negotiators have so far reached their tentative agreement only in principle. No documents have been signed.President Donald Trump announced the trade truce in a White House meeting with the top Chinese negotiator, Vice Premier Liu He. The news followed two days of talks in Washington.""You're very tough negotiators,"" Trump said to the Chinese delegation.Trump has yet to drop plans to impose tariffs Dec. 15 on an additional $160 billion in Chinese products, a move that would extend the sanctions to just about everything China ships to the United States. The December tariffs would cover a wide range of consumer goods, including clothes, toys and smartphones and would likely be felt by American shoppers.While providing scant details of just what was agreed to Friday, the White House said Beijing has pledged to be more transparent about how it sets the value of its currency, the yuan. The Trump administration has accused China of manipulating the yuan lower to give its exporter a price advantage in foreign markets.China has agreed to open its markets to U.S. banks and other financial services providers, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said.Earlier Friday, China announced a timetable for carrying out a promise to allow full foreign ownership of some finance businesses, starting with futures traders on Jan. 1, as Beijing tries to make its slowing economy more competitive and efficient.Ownership limits will be ended for mutual fund companies on April 1 and for securities firm on Dec. 1, the China Securities Regulatory Commission said. Until now, foreign investors have been limited to owning 51 per cent of such businesses.For now, the two sides have come to ""almost a complete agreement"" on both financial services and currency issues, Mnuchin said.The trade war has inflicted an economic toll on both countries. U.S. manufacturers have been hurt by rising costs from the tariffs and by uncertainty over when and how the trade hostilities may end.""They're trying to de-escalate,"" said Timothy Keeler, a former chief of staff at the Office of the U.S. Trade Representatives. ""I think it serves both sides' interests because both sides were feeling pain.""Stock prices had been up substantially all day, mainly in anticipation of a significant trade agreement. But once the White House announced the contours of the tentative accord, the market shed some of its gains. The Dow Jones industrial average, which had risen more than 500 points at its high, closed up 319.The U.S. and Chinese negotiators did not deal this week with a dispute over the Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei. The U.S. has imposed sanctions on Huawei, saying it poses a threat to U.S. national security because its equipment can be used for espionage. Trump has said he was willing to use Huawei as a bargaining chip in the trade talks.The United States still has in place tariffs on more than $360 billion worth of Chinese imports and is set to hit an additional $160 billion in December. What changed Friday was that Trump suspended plans to raise the existing tariffs on $250 billion in Chinese products from 25 per cent to 30 per cent next week.""This is an encouraging first phase,"" said Craig Allen, president of the U.S.-China Business Council. ""We await word on how implementation will be measured and in what timeframe, as well as details on scheduling subsequent phases""Among the skeptics of Friday's agreement is Derek Scissors, a China expert at the American Enterprise Institute, who suggested that the deal amounted to merely a temporary pause in the conflict.""The president is acting as if a lot of Chinese concessions have been nailed down, and they just haven't,"" Scissors said.The two countries were close to a more comprehensive deal in early May. But talks stalled after the U.S. accused China of reneging on earlier commitments. Trump acknowledged that Friday's deal has yet to be put down on paper but said that wouldn't be a problem.""China wants it badly, and we want it also,"" Trump said. ""We should be able to get that done over the next four weeks.""Gregory Daco, an economist at Oxford Economics, said the partial nature of the deal won't relieve much of the uncertainty surrounding trade policy that has discouraged many American companies from investing in new equipment and expanding.""For businesses this will mean less damage, not greater certainty,"" Daco said in a research note.Daco has estimated that the trade fight will cut U.S. growth by about 0.6 percentage point in 2020. Friday's pact might reduce that slightly to 0.5 percentage point, he said. ""While market reacted positively to the news, we caution that beyond the promises and niceties, the deal doesn't address key underlying issues,"" Daco wrote.The two countries are deadlocked primarily over the Trump administration's assertions that China deploys predatory tactics — including outright theft — in a sharp-elbowed drive to become the global leader in robotics, self-driving cars and other advanced technology.Beijing has been reluctant to make the kind of substantive policy reforms that would satisfy the administration. Doing so would likely require scaling back China's aspirations for technological supremacy, which it sees as crucial to its prosperity."

It has removed the ad and apologized.The original ad starring Boyega, 28, aired last year and was called The London Gent. It features the London-born actor walking around the neighbourhood where he grew up and riding a horse in a park, and it makes reference to his Nigerian heritage in a scene featuring West African attire.""The film celebrated my personal story — showcasing my hometown, including my friends and featuring my family,"" Boyega wrote.Their decision to replace my campaign in China by using my concepts and substituting a local brand ambassador for me, without either my consent or prior notice, was wrong.

He played a leading role as Finn in 2015's Star Wars: The Force Awakens, but he and other nonwhite characters were removed or diminished from a Chinese poster for the movie.In an interview with GQ magazine, Boyega recently said that Black characters have been ""pushed to the side"" in Disney's Star Wars franchise. In June, the star made an emotional speech on racism when he joined Black Lives Matter protests in London.  "

New measurements show moon has hazardous radiation levels | CBC News,"Future moon explorers will be bombarded with two to three times more radiation than astronauts aboard the International Space Station, a health hazard that will require thick-walled shelters for protection, scientists reported Friday.",2020-09-28T13:29:18.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/moon-radiation-1.5571109,"Future moon explorers will be bombarded with two to three times more radiation than astronauts aboard the International Space Station, a health hazard that will require thick-walled shelters for protection, scientists reported Friday.China's lander on the far side of the moon is providing the first full measurements of radiation exposure from the lunar surface, vital information for NASA and others aiming to send astronauts to the moon, the study noted.A Chinese-German team reported on the radiation data collected by the lander — named Chang'e 4 for the Chinese moon goddess — in the U.S. journal Science Advances.""This is an immense achievement in the sense that now we have a data set which we can use to benchmark our radiation"" and better understand the potential risk to people on the moon, said Thomas Berger, a physicist with the German Space Agency's medicine institute.Astronauts would get 200 to 1,000 times more radiation on the moon than what we experience on Earth — or five to 10 times more than passengers on a trans-Atlantic airline flight, noted Robert Wimmer-Schweingruber of Christian-Albrechts University in Kiel, Germany.""The difference is, however, that we're not on such a flight for as long as astronauts would be when they're exploring the moon,"" Wimmer-Schweingruber said in an email.Cancer is the primary risk.""Humans are not really made for these radiation levels and should protect themselves when on the moon,"" he added.Radiation levels should be pretty much the same all over the moon, except for near the walls of deep craters, Wimmer-Schweingruber said.""Basically, the less you see of the sky, the better. That's the primary source of the radiation,"" he said.Wimmer-Schweingruber said the radiation levels are close to what models had predicted. The levels measured by Chang'e 4, in fact, ""agree nearly exactly"" with measurements by a detector on a NASA orbiter that has been circling the moon for more than a decade, said Kerry Lee, a space radiation expert at Johnson Space Center in Houston.""It is nice to see confirmation of what we think and our understanding of how radiation interacts with the moon is as expected,"" said Lee, who was not involved in the Chinese-led study.In a detailed outline released this week, NASA said the first pair of astronauts to land on the moon under the new Artemis program would spend about a week on the lunar surface, more than twice as long as the Apollo crews did a half-century ago. Expeditions would last one to two months once a base camp is established.NASA is looking to put astronauts on the moon by the end of 2024, an accelerated pace ordered by the White House, and on Mars sometime in the 2030s.The space agency said it will have radiation detectors and a safe shelter aboard all Orion crew capsules flying to the moon. As for the actual landers, three separate corporate teams are developing their own craft with NASA oversight. For the first Artemis moon landing, at least, the astronauts will live in the ascent portion of their lander.The German researchers suggest shelters built of moon dirt — readily available material — for stays of more than a few days. The walls should be 80 centimetres thick, they said. Any thicker and the dirt will emit its own secondary radiation, created when galactic cosmic rays interact with the lunar soil.""So in this sense — I think the walls of European Castles would be too thick!"" Berger wrote in an email."

Tariff threat against Mexico confirms a deal's not a deal with Trump: Don Pittis | CBC News,"Everyone knows politicians sometimes fail to keep their word. But when an entire country gives its word, businesses generally assume they can count on it. Not so in the era of U.S. President Donald Trump, as shown by his latest tariff threat against trade partner Mexico.",2019-06-01T08:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/trump-mexico-tariffs-1.5157253,"Everyone knows individual politicians sometimes fail to keep their word, and like the rest of us, investors seldom count on those promises until they see the commitments fulfilled.But when an entire country gives its word, businesses generally assume they can count on it. Not so in the era of U.S. President Donald Trump.On Thursday, Trump announced via Twitter that his administration will impose tariffs on Mexico if it fails to stop migrants from crossing into the U.S. The next day, he tweeted more conditions that seemed to reopen NAFTA negotiations that were settled last September.Critics say it shows that with Trump in charge, the U.S. is a nation that cannot be trusted. And that makes a difference.In order not to pay Tariffs, if they start rising, companies will leave Mexico, which has taken 30% of our Auto Industry, and come back home to the USA. Mexico must take back their country from the drug lords and cartels. The Tariff is about stopping drugs as well as illegals!On Friday, markets demonstrated how destabilizing that failure of trust can be. It has become a cliche of economic analysis to say that business hates uncertainty. Oil plunged, currencies gyrated, and the Dow Jones index fell more than 350 points.But such an abrupt and unforeseen change of course could signal much more than just a one-time market shock.""How do you plan for anything in this environment, whether in the U.S. or abroad?"" Derek Holt, vice-president at Scotiabank Economics, said in a Friday morning note as markets began to tumble.While Trump's trustworthiness was worrying markets, the Chinese government was announcing — with unintended irony, one presumes — a plan to designate certain foreign institutions and individuals as ""non-reliable entities.""In a counterblow to U.S. attacks on telecommunications giant Huawei and other Chinese tech companies, Beijing announced what analysts are describing as China's own corporate blacklist.According to the state-controlled Global Times, the ""non-reliable entity list"" would include ""foreign entities, individuals and companies that block and shut the supply chain, or take discriminatory measures over non-commercial reasons.""It would be fair to wonder whether Beijing was implying one of those entities is in the White House.If it went into effect, an across-the-board tariff on Mexican imports would raise prices for consumers and businesses across the United States. Canadians would not be off the hook, because in theory, goods and parts imported tax-free from Mexico and incorporated into Canadian exports would also face partial tariffs once sold to U.S. customers.Of course, such details can only be guessed at when a politician like Trump seems to be making up policy on the fly.Considering the devastating potential of such trade-disrupting tariffs, the fact that U.S. markets only fell by slightly more than one per cent on Friday is a hint that not everyone is taking Trump at his word.The idea that the Mexican president could wave a magic wand and stop asylum seekers from crossing at any point along his country's massive border with the U.S. — something the U.S., with all its technology and border guards, has failed to do — is beyond belief.There is also a sneaking suspicion that Trump's tariff threat, which grabbed headlines across North America, intentionally came just as the U.S. president was once again facing damaging news coverage about Russian election interference.""My net bias remains to retain some degree of faith that sundry checks and balances on Trump will exert themselves while counselling avoidance of a tendency to overreact, but the damage is nevertheless being done to market and business confidence in the interim,"" said Holt.Besides concerns over the effect of tariffs on prices and trade routes, the sudden announcement seems to send a chill over what until Thursday had been seen as a warming of relations between Canada, the U.S. and Mexico over continental free trade.Following the U.S.'s recent withdrawal of tariffs on aluminum and steel from its two closest trade partners, it appeared the three countries might be close to ratifying the NAFTA 2.0 deal negotiated last year. In fact, Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland seemed to suggest on Friday that the meeting of minds between the three countries is still happening, in spite of Trump's recent threat against Mexico.""The Mexican president has said today, speaking for Mexico, that Mexico intends to move ahead with its ratification process,"" she said in Parliament.That, too, seems to presuppose Trump's latest threat is a flash in the pan. But businesses deciding whether to proceed with new investments that depend on the deal's final conclusion may be right to be wary. Other wild Trump statements written off as self-interested or diversionary rants have ended up sticking and becoming administration policy. Many analysts at the time scoffed when Trump declared NAFTA the worst trade deal ever, threatened to ditch the Iran nuclear deal and promised to build a wall along the U.S.'s southern border.Chris Krueger, managing director of the Cowen Washington Research Group, which provides trade and market analysis, said Trump's latest attack on Mexican trade, if not withdrawn, could kill the new NAFTA trade process and further disrupt negotiations with China. The question Krueger asked must be echoing in Beijing, Brussels, Mexico City and Ottawa: ""How can you trust Trump to honour deals?""Follow Don on Twitter @don_pittis"

Because the Canadian had been anointed the world's yo-yo champion as a teenager, and he knew what he was talking about.Back in March of 1990, Lowe said his favourite was a San Francisco-made yo-yo, which involved the same kind of metal used in aircraft manufacturing.""It's very, very light, but you have to have this weight behind you,"" Lowe said, when appearing on CBC's Front Page Challenge, almost six decades after becoming the yo-yo champ.""It's very precision-made and it costs about $100 and the kids can't afford it.""Digital ArchivesLowe, who was then in his early 70s, had first picked up the spinning toy when he was a kid himself.When Front Page Challenge panellist Betty Kennedy asked him what had sparked his interest in the yo-yo, Lowe said he wasn't sure.""I don't know, it's a very funny little history I have here because I used to be left-handed and I played yo-yo with my right hand,"" said Lowe, recalling some of his early days as a yo-yo enthusiast.He then developed the ability to perform with both hands at the same time.""Both hands started to go, eh? Playing the yo-yos,"" he explained.The London-hosted international yo-yo contest that Lowe won in 1932 brought him his initial fame, but in the years that followed, he also made various appearances on the big and small screens.Lowe also worked as a radio broadcaster — hosting Call of China on British Columbia's CJOR radio station — and as a restaurant manager. He died in 2009, at the age of 90."

"What is Emissary Panda, and how does it hack its targets? | CBC News","Here is a look at the group of hackers, probably from China, suspected of carrying out a cyberattack on the Montreal-based International Civil Aviation Authority — how the hackers did it, and what they stood to gain from setting a trap for the world's aviation players.",2019-02-27T09:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/emissary-panda-chinese-hackers-cyberattack-icao-1.5034177,"In November 2016, the Montreal-based International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) was hit by the most serious cyberattack in its history.Internal documents obtained by CBC suggest key members of the team that should have prevented the attack tried to cover up how badly it was mishandled.The documents obtained by CBC suggest the hacker was most likely a member of Emissary Panda, a sophisticated and stealthy espionage group with ties to the Chinese government.Here is a look at the group of hackers, probably from China, suspected of carrying out a cyberattack on the Montreal-based International Civil Aviation Authority — how the hackers did it, and what they stood to gain from setting a trap for the world's aviation players.The group of hackers suspected of staging the attack is known by many names — among them: TG-3390, APT 27 and Bronze Union.The cybersecurity firm SecureWorks has a ""moderate level of confidence"" that the hacker group is sponsored by the People's Republic of China.In a 2015 report, it based that conclusion on a number of factors:The group has been active for at least 10 years, and it has also staged attacks in North America, South America, Asia, Europe and the Middle East.Cybersecurity experts consulted by CBC News said the group specializes in ""cyberespionage,"" collecting data from corporate and government targets.Ali Arasteh, a cybersecurity consultant with the firm FireEye, said many of Emissary Panda's activities align with the economic goals laid out by the Chinese government. It tends to target industries such as energy, aviation, defence and manufacturing, where China wants to gain a competitive edge.Cybersecurity expert José Fernandez says ICAO was likely not chosen because it was a weak link.""All targets are relatively easy,"" Fernandez said.Emissary Panda uses a variety of methods to access a target's system, such as hacking its webmail server or sending phishing emails including malicious links or attachments.While it is not known how the hackers got into ICAO's servers, experts on Emissary Panda's hacking activities say it's likely the group had access long before it was detected.In its 2015 report on Emissary Panda, SecureWorks wrote that the group tends to spend a significant period of time in a target's system before it starts extracting data. Emissary Panda uses this time to find other access points, learn how the network is set up and identify important data.The hacker group then sets up ""strategic web compromises,"" also known as watering holes. Watering holes are traps on websites that they know targets will visit.In the case of ICAO, when member states wanted to consult aviation documents online, they would be injected with malicious code that could give the attackers remote control of their computers.Hackers could then create a chain of watering holes once they gained access to the systems of governments or corporations that visited the first watering hole.Compromising ICAO would not cause planes to fall out of the sky.The attack appears to be part of a larger strategic game, said Fernandez. With member states and aviation companies regularly visiting ICAO websites, he said the organization is a ""one-stop shop"" for encountering the targets of Chinese cyberspies.According to the SecureWorks report, Emissary Panda often would find trusted websites frequented by political and corporate targets and infect them to gain access to data.Arasteh, speaking generally about the hacker group's operations, said that data could include intellectual property and travel information for corporate executives and politicians."

"Canadians to help develop, test potential COVID-19 vaccine from Chinese company | CBC News",The National Research Council of Canada said Tuesday it will work with a Chinese company to try to develop its potential vaccine for COVID-19 more quickly.,2020-05-12T17:51:41.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/vaccine-cansino-1.5566216,"The National Research Council of Canada said Tuesday it will work with a Chinese company to try to develop its potential vaccine for COVID-19 more quickly.The Chinese company, CanSino Biologics, is already conducting human clinical trials for its vaccine.Federal governments the world over have said vaccines are urgently needed to allow mass gatherings to resume. But that's only if clinical trials in thousands of human volunteers show safety and efficacy before shots go into the arms of vast swaths of the general public.As of April, five vaccine candidates have moved into clinical development in early stage human trials, including CanSino's, called Ad5-nCoV.The collaboration announced on Tuesday will allow Canada's publicly funded research council to try to scale up the technology needed to produce enough of the candidate vaccine to protect Canadians.Matthew Herder, director of the Health Law Institute at Dalhousie University's law school in Halifax, evaluated contracts for the Canadian Ebola vaccine. That vaccine followed a similar path from the lab bench to mass production. Herder welcomed the NRC announcement and awaits the details.""I think it showcases the power of the public sector … to play a key role in the development of vaccines,"" he said.There could also be strings attached on pricing, how much manufacturing can be done in Canada to meet both domestic and international needs, and equity of access, he said.The NRC plans to use a cell line its scientists developed during Ebola vaccine research.WATCH | Steps to vaccine safety and efficacy:Lakshmi Krishnan, director general of the NRC's Human Health Therapeutics Research Centre, said the trials in Canada will complement and expand on what's been done in China.""We're bringing back home a Canadian technology, and we're able to have the most advanced vaccine candidate in the world potentially available for Canadians in short order,"" Krishnan said. A Phase 1 trial for the Ebola vaccine took place at the Canadian Centre for Vaccinology in Halifax. The coronavirus vaccine will initially also be tested on healthy human volunteers there, subject to Health Canada's approval.If successful, then Phase 2 trials could start in the fall at hospitals in other provinces with a vaccine available for non-commercial use produced on Canadian soil for front line workers and those at risk in late 2020 or early 2021, she said.Dr. Ross Upshur of the University of Toronto's Dalla Lana School of Public Health studies global health ethics. He isn't involved in the vaccine trials.""You can't really tell how effective something is until you've got a large number of people and it's out in the field,"" Upshur said. The federal government's previously announced $44 million for upgrades to the NRC's facility in Montreal also aims to allow for domestic production if the vaccine candidate pans out.Separately on Tuesday, the federal government pledged $600 million over five years to support Gavi, a partnership between governments and the private sector. The group aims to vaccinate children around the world with routine immunizations and supports efforts to stamp out the pandemic globally.Successful vaccines normally take five to 15 years to develop and mass produce."
Huawei unveils pricey 5G-ready phone with folding screen | CBC News,"China's Huawei has unveiled a new folding-screen phone, joining the latest trend for bendable devices as it challenges the global smartphone market's dominant players, Apple and Samsung.",2019-02-24T17:48:45.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/huwawei-foldable-phone-mate-x-product-launch-mwc-barcelona-1.5031687,"China's Huawei unveiled a new folding-screen phone on Sunday, joining the latest trend for bendable devices as it challenges the global smartphone market's dominant players, Apple and Samsung.Huawei revealed its Mate X phone on the eve of MWC Barcelona, a four-day showcase of mobile devices in Spain, as the company battles U.S. allegations it is a cybersecurity risk.The device can be used on superfast next-generation mobile networks that are due to come online over the next decade. Device makers are looking to folding screens as the industry's next big thing to help them break out of an innovation malaise, although most analysts think the market is limited, at least in the early days.The Mate X is the answer to a question Huawei faced as it sought to satisfy smartphone users' demands for bigger screens and longer battery life, said Richard Yu, CEO of its consumer business group.""How can we bring the more big innovation to this smartphone industry?"" Yu said at a glitzy media launch.The Mate X will sell for 2,299 euros ($2,600 US, or $3,400 Cdn) when it goes on sale by mid-year. That's even more than Samsung's recently revealed Galaxy Fold, priced at nearly $2,000 US.The Mate X's screen wraps around the outside so users can still view it when it's closed, unlike the Galaxy Fold, which has a screen that folds shut. Unfolded, the Mate X's screen is 20 cm diagonally, making it the size of a small tablet.Yu said Huawei engineers spent three years working on the device's hinge, which doesn't leave a gap when shut.""No matter how innovative and technology-advanced the new device is, it will take a lot more time for a critical mass of consumers to experience the benefits of foldable phones and 5G technology,"" Forrester analyst Thomas Husson said.Huawei still ""has to find its own brand voice to differentiate from Samsung and Apple and stop acting as a technology challenger.""Huawei Technologies is trying to raise its profile in the fiercely competitive smartphone market. Almost everyone with a smartphone has heard of Apple and Samsung, the top device makers, and Google, the power behind Android's pervasive software.Huawei, a Chinese company with a name many people in the West don't know how to pronounce (it's ""HWA-way""), wants to join the market's upper echelon.It's getting close. Samsung was the No. 1 smartphone seller for all of last year, followed by Apple, according to research firm International Data Corp. Huawei came third, though in some quarters it took second place, IDC data showed.The company stealthily became an industry star by plowing into new markets, honing its technology, and developing a line-up of phones that offer affordable options for low-income households and luxury models that are siphoning upper-crust sales from Apple and Samsung in China and Europe.But Huawei's products are few and far between in the U.S. The scarcity stems from long-running security concerns that the company could facilitate digital espionage on behalf of China's government. Washington has been lobbying European allies to keep its equipment out of new 5G networks.The cloud over Huawei also includes U.S. criminal charges filed last month against the company and its chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, who U.S. prosecutors want to extradite from Canada. They accuse her of fraud and say the company stole trade secrets, including technology that mobile carrier T-Mobile used to test smartphones.Huawei is making its push at a time that both Samsung and Apple are struggling with declining smartphone sales amid a lull in industry innovation that is causing more consumers to hold on to their devices until they wear out instead of upgrading to the latest model as quickly as they once did.The company sells high-priced smartphones as well as an extensive range of cheaper models priced from $200 to $600 that offer a good camera and other features most consumers want, analysts said.But Huawei wouldn't be where it is today if it had been content focusing merely on China and other Asian markets.The company took a huge step forward several years ago when it began pouring millions into promoting its brand and building partnerships in major European markets such as Germany, France, Britain, Spain and Italy. Research firm Gartner estimates it now sells about 13 per cent of its phones in Europe.As for the U.S., Huawei can only make so much headway as long as the government is casting the company as a cyber-villain, said Gartner analyst Tuong Nguyen.""Brand building is a long-term exercise, but it's going to be especially difficult in the U.S. because of the way they have branded all of China,"" he said. ""The barriers in the U.S. are just getting more difficult."""

That person is not in hospital.Before the case was announced last Thursday, New Brunswick had gone more than two weeks without a new case.There have been 166 confirmed cases of COVID-19 since the outbreak started in March, and 163 people recover from the virus. Two people, both residents of a long-term care home in Atholville, died.So far, the province has conducted 46,489 tests for the disease, according to the dashboard information published Monday.It's been more than a week since the Atlantic travel bubble has opened between New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland.Prince Edward Island announced a new case of COVID-19 on Sunday, a health care worker at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Charlottetown. The case came to light after an 80-year-woman who had seen the health care worker at the hospital tested positive. There are currently eight active cases of the virus on the island. Nova Scotia hasn't had any new cases of COVID-19 in five consecutive days. Newfoundland recorded its first active case of COVID-19 on Friday after 43 days without any cases.

"Banning Huawei from building 5G network unlikely to seriously hurt Canada's big telcos, analysts say | CBC News","If the federal government moves to ban Huawei from Canada's 5G network, it is unlikely to have a major financial impact on two of the country's top communication companies who have partnered with the China-based firm, analysts say.",2018-12-19T09:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/huawei-ban-government-bell-telus-5g-1.4950521,"If the federal government moves to ban Huawei from working to build Canada's new 5G network, it is unlikely to have a major financial impact on two of the country's top communications companies who have partnered with the China-based firm, analysts say.Huawei's equipment is already used in telecommunications infrastructure run by Canada's major cellphone carriers, namely BCE and Telus. Those two companies are currently in 5G pretrial stages with Huawei, a company some western intelligence officials consider a security risk due to its links with China's government. As the next-generation wireless technology, 5G promises to deliver much faster internet download speeds — possibly up to 200 times faster than today's LTE networks.Desmond Lau, a telecommunications analyst with investment research firm Veritas, said BCE and Telus have not put a lot of capital into 5G trials, so the financial hit from a ban on Huawei's participation wouldn't be large.    ""It doesn't sound like all that much has been spent on 5G,"" Lau said, adding that neither company has disclosed what they have spent so far. ""They also have Nokia as another 5G partner, so they could probably just switch all toward Nokia if they really needed to.""BCE and Telus did not respond to inquiries from CBC News about their relationship with Huawei on building Canada's 5G network. The Sydney Morning Herald, an Australian newspaper, has reported that Ottawa could announce a formal ban on Huawei building the 5G network within weeks. Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale has called those reports ""speculation.""""The issues are being very carefully considered by Canadians. We have not arrived at a conclusion,"" Goodale told CBC Radio's The House.According to a Scotiabank telecommunications report, both BCE and Telus use radio access networks (RANs), equipment located at the top and bottom of cell sites, produced by Huawei. ""To our knowledge, Huawei does not supply the network core, which is software based and considered to be the most sensitive part of the network from a privacy and security perspective,"" the report states.For years, Huawei has been a source of concern for Western security officials, particularly the U.S., which has tried to convince other countries not to buy equipment from the company.Huawei denies allegations that it conducts espionage on behalf of China and has said it's a market-driven business simply looking to compete internationally.""Huawei has been working with Canadian operators on a number of pre-commercial trials in the lead up to 5G,"" said Scott Bradley, a spokesman for Huawei Canada. ""These efforts will ensure Canada is well positioned to be one of the early leaders in 5G globally, and will benefit Canadians in applications as diverse as greatly improving rural service, to spurring new innovations requiring increased speeds and capacity.""This next generation technology will also open up what analysts refer to as the ""internet of things,"" which would allow everyday devices and machines be connected to a wireless network. ""These ground-breaking trials are laying the foundation for 5G, which will enable the likes of driverless cars; smart cities; new innovations in healthcare; as well as yet-to-be-imagined applications, devices and services powered by astonishingly fast and reliable wireless connections,"" Telus said in a news release.But with 5G, one of the concerns is that the network would be more vulnerable to attack. If Huawei has some kind of relationship with the Chinese government, the fear is that the company could install a ""backdoor"" in the 5G network, possibly allowing access to the network, and creating the potential for widespread disruption.New Zealand and Australia have banned Huawei from working on their 5G networks. And British phone carrier BT said it would not use their equipment for its planned 5G mobile network. The U.K. company is removing Huawei equipment from the core of its existing 3G and 4G mobile phone networks.If a similar move to rip out and replace existing Huawei infrastructure were to happen in Canada, it ""would obviously be very costly,"" according to the Scotiabank report.Replacing Huawei products in Canada's existing 3G and 4G mobile networks could cost more than $1.2 billion, Scotiabank's report said. ""If logic prevails, even if a ban was to occur, we think it would be on 5G only,"" said the report. ""We believe this will be more manageable"" as there is ""limited 5G equipment at the cell sites today."""

As the search for a longer-term solution continues, it raises a key question: how much are we willing to give up in the name of safety?To manage the next phase of the pandemic, governments around the world are turning to new measures, including contact tracing, to try to slow the spread of the disease. That involves partnerships with technology giants and the mass collection of personal data from cellphones. Civil liberties organizations are worried about the potential consequences of these trade-offs.""When we talk about location data being particularly invasive, it's because where we are reflects who we are and how we live"" said Brenda McPhail, the director of the Privacy, Technology & Surveillance Project at the Canadian Civil Liberties Association.""Increasingly, in this age of surveillance capitalism, [data] can be sold and exploited, either to sell you things by corporations or to figure out how you're likely to behave,"" she said in an interview with Michael Enright, host of The Sunday Edition. ""And it's particularly that idea of behavioural assessment … that's of particular concern, in these circumstances in the pandemic.""Here are some highlights from their conversation, edited for clarity and condensed.We started out very well in Canada. We took careful, measured steps. As time goes on, as we're more and more afraid, as we're more and more sick of being stuck in our homes and social distancing, as more and more people have no employment income, the cries for governments to do more, to do anything that it takes, is getting really loud. And this is where the risks of surveillance come in. This is where we start hearing, ""Any restriction is OK if it helps. So why aren't you tracking people?"" Because the best way to control human behaviour is to know exactly what we do at all times.I spent all my professional life thinking about privacy and surveillance in the ways that technology affects those things. Right now, the question is absolutely, ""If it will help, save lives and get us through this faster, shouldn't we just give up everything for that goal?""There's a part of me, as a mother, who is worried about her kids, as a daughter who has a mother who's in a high-risk category for this, that says I get that. I get that incredibly visceral reaction that when it comes to a choice between rights and the ability to see the faces of those I love [it] would outweigh that sort of ephemeral connection to an idea of human rights, that I think we do have in Canada. But that right now is starting to feel a little bit shaky. And maybe a little bit privileged. But the rights that form the foundation for our shared values are, in fact, the very values that are helping us get through this crisis.What's remarkable about the social effectiveness of social distancing in Canada is not how many people are getting ticketed for sitting on a bench for too long or talking across their driveway. It's how many of us are actually doing the things that we're told to do. That frankly is the response of people who live in a mature democracy. That's the response of people who share values and are willing to prioritize the common good.If we toss that out the window, even if it helps right now … we're going to reduce our ability to get through another crisis like this in the future. We're going to give up who we are and what we believe, in ways that aren't just going to risk eroding rights over the long-term. It's going to risk erasing them.With some civil liberties, we're probably pretty safe. If following this pandemic, provinces continue to limit travel, for example, there would be a huge outcry. We'd say, ""No way. I have mobility rights. I deserve to travel around my home country."" And that would not stand in a democracy.The problem with privacy is that we're in a situation where our idea of what privacy means — even our idea of whether or not it's a fundamental human right, which it is recognized as internationally — we are in a position where the idea that privacy is something that corporations or governments can ask us to give away in exchange for a service or convenience is really fundamental. Some of these platforms that we're using to help us navigate our way through this isolation, things like video chats, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram that are allowing us to have some form of human connection during isolation are the very platforms that have habituated us to the idea that, in exchange for the privilege of using them, they get to collect information about us.That's been fundamentally built into the infrastructure of the business model and the internet, in ways that have slowly, already eroded and changed our idea of what privacy we deserve. So the risk in the pandemic is that that process is going to accelerate. And we're going to give up — not just in relation to companies but in relation to the state — the idea that privacy is actually a right and not a privilege.You've got to watch really closely for the idea that privacy is a barrier to public health — because it's not. The reality is there is nothing in privacy law that prevents sharing of epidemiological information that's necessary for public health purposes. There is nothing in privacy law that is a barrier to lawful collection of information. And what it is is a barrier to collecting personal information that's unnecessary and intrusive, that's not proportionate to the benefit that we get from it, either as individuals or as a society.The other thing that we want to watch for is the kind of proposals about tracking our risk, about coming up with some kind of system to label us as safe or unsafe people. There are so many fundamental problems with that kind of social sorting, that it's just not a place that we should be going as Canadians.Click 'listen' above to hear the full interview."

As the search for a longer-term solution continues, it raises a key question: how much are we willing to give up in the name of safety?To manage the next phase of the pandemic, governments around the world are turning to new measures, including contact tracing, to try to slow the spread of the disease. That involves partnerships with technology giants and the mass collection of personal data from cellphones. Civil liberties organizations are worried about the potential consequences of these trade-offs.""When we talk about location data being particularly invasive, it's because where we are reflects who we are and how we live"" said Brenda McPhail, the director of the Privacy, Technology & Surveillance Project at the Canadian Civil Liberties Association.""Increasingly, in this age of surveillance capitalism, [data] can be sold and exploited, either to sell you things by corporations or to figure out how you're likely to behave,"" she said in an interview with Michael Enright, host of The Sunday Edition. ""And it's particularly that idea of behavioural assessment … that's of particular concern, in these circumstances in the pandemic.""Here are some highlights from their conversation, edited for clarity and condensed.We started out very well in Canada. We took careful, measured steps. As time goes on, as we're more and more afraid, as we're more and more sick of being stuck in our homes and social distancing, as more and more people have no employment income, the cries for governments to do more, to do anything that it takes, is getting really loud. And this is where the risks of surveillance come in. This is where we start hearing, ""Any restriction is OK if it helps. So why aren't you tracking people?"" Because the best way to control human behaviour is to know exactly what we do at all times.I spent all my professional life thinking about privacy and surveillance in the ways that technology affects those things. Right now, the question is absolutely, ""If it will help, save lives and get us through this faster, shouldn't we just give up everything for that goal?""There's a part of me, as a mother, who is worried about her kids, as a daughter who has a mother who's in a high-risk category for this, that says I get that. I get that incredibly visceral reaction that when it comes to a choice between rights and the ability to see the faces of those I love [it] would outweigh that sort of ephemeral connection to an idea of human rights, that I think we do have in Canada. But that right now is starting to feel a little bit shaky. And maybe a little bit privileged. But the rights that form the foundation for our shared values are, in fact, the very values that are helping us get through this crisis.What's remarkable about the social effectiveness of social distancing in Canada is not how many people are getting ticketed for sitting on a bench for too long or talking across their driveway. It's how many of us are actually doing the things that we're told to do. That frankly is the response of people who live in a mature democracy. That's the response of people who share values and are willing to prioritize the common good.If we toss that out the window, even if it helps right now … we're going to reduce our ability to get through another crisis like this in the future. We're going to give up who we are and what we believe, in ways that aren't just going to risk eroding rights over the long-term. It's going to risk erasing them.With some civil liberties, we're probably pretty safe. If following this pandemic, provinces continue to limit travel, for example, there would be a huge outcry. We'd say, ""No way. I have mobility rights. I deserve to travel around my home country."" And that would not stand in a democracy.The problem with privacy is that we're in a situation where our idea of what privacy means — even our idea of whether or not it's a fundamental human right, which it is recognized as internationally — we are in a position where the idea that privacy is something that corporations or governments can ask us to give away in exchange for a service or convenience is really fundamental. Some of these platforms that we're using to help us navigate our way through this isolation, things like video chats, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram that are allowing us to have some form of human connection during isolation are the very platforms that have habituated us to the idea that, in exchange for the privilege of using them, they get to collect information about us.That's been fundamentally built into the infrastructure of the business model and the internet, in ways that have slowly, already eroded and changed our idea of what privacy we deserve. So the risk in the pandemic is that that process is going to accelerate. And we're going to give up — not just in relation to companies but in relation to the state — the idea that privacy is actually a right and not a privilege.You've got to watch really closely for the idea that privacy is a barrier to public health — because it's not. The reality is there is nothing in privacy law that prevents sharing of epidemiological information that's necessary for public health purposes. There is nothing in privacy law that is a barrier to lawful collection of information. And what it is is a barrier to collecting personal information that's unnecessary and intrusive, that's not proportionate to the benefit that we get from it, either as individuals or as a society.The other thing that we want to watch for is the kind of proposals about tracking our risk, about coming up with some kind of system to label us as safe or unsafe people. There are so many fundamental problems with that kind of social sorting, that it's just not a place that we should be going as Canadians.Click 'listen' above to hear the full interview."
TRANSCRIPT SANCTIONED EPISODE 8 | CBC Radio,Full-text transcript for Sanctioned episode eight,2020-07-24T17:35:47.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/radio/podcastnews/transcript-sanctioned-episode-8-1.5662097," Sanctioned - The Rule of LawHost: Stephen Quinn  Announcer: This is a CBC Podcast. [music: somber] Stephen Quinn: Previously on Sanctioned.  [music: somber] Stephen: Meng Wanzhou moves house and launches a new legal strategy in her battle against extradition, her lawyers question the actions of Canadian and American authorities at the time of her arrest. Meng claims her rights were violated the moment she stepped off a plane from Hong Kong and a videotape and transcripts, flesh out her first crucial hours in Canada. [somber music] [clip from Red Dragon plays]  [suspenseful music from film] Man: Whatever the Americans are claiming is a lie. Stephen: The movie trailer opens with a shot of a Chinese woman descending an escalator with two law enforcement officials in tow. The words, ""Canada Arrests a Chinese Executive"" fill the screen. Then the trailer cuts to the woman resting her head against the bars of a jail cell. [clip from Red Dragon plays]  Man: We are in an uncomfortable position because we have an extradition treaty with the Americans. [suspenseful music from film] Stephen: Words fill the screen again, ""The Chinese government retaliates."" [clip from Red Dragon plays]  Man: They just arbitrarily sentenced a Canadian to death, there's no telling where this retaliation will end. [suspenseful music from film] Stephen: The trailer is for the upcoming movie, ""Claws of the Red Dragon.""Supposedly, inspired by the dramatic situation surrounding Huawei chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou, the film stars a Canadian cast, most notably Eric Peterson, the award-winning actor perhaps best known for his role on one of the country's best-loved sitcoms, ""Corner Gas"". But there won't be a lot of laughs in this 54-minute thriller and it's really the name of the producer which is making headlines, not the names in the cast. It's Steve Bannon, right-wing American agitator and media mogul credited with engineering the political campaign that put U.S. President Donald Trump into office. Bannon says the fictional movie will expose ties between Huawei, known as Hua Xing in the film, and the Chinese communist government, and its military. [clip of Bannon speaking] Stephen: The backbone of the future of technology is 5G. It will be a dominant technology. Right now, the path that Huawei's taken as a front for the PLA is to basically take over the networks and the components throughout the world. If we allow this to happen, even for a couple more years, Huawei is going to control, basically, the communications systems of the west. Stephen: Huawei has repeatedly refuted such allegations. [clip from Red Dragon plays]  Man: This is a crazy accusation by countries who are jealous of our success. Stephen: ""Claws of the Red Dragon"" is set to be released in September,  as Meng Wanzhou, Ms. Fung in the film, prepares for two weeks of court dates ahead of her extradition hearing in January. So, is it art imitating life or is it politics imitating art and looking to influence the outcome of an ongoing drama? [clip from Red Dragon plays]  [phone rings] Woman: [speaking: Mandarin] Hello?  Stephen: Whatever the truth is, a real-life ending to Meng Wanzhou's story has yet to be written and competing storylines are about to collide. [music: Somber] Stephen: I'm Stephen Quinn and you're listening to Sanctioned: the Arrest of a Telecom Giant, a CBC Vancouver original podcast about Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou and her fight against possible extradition and jailing in the United States for allegedly violating economic sanctions against Iran. It is a journey deep into the world of global business and politics, up front deals and allegations of back room skullduggery in the battle to dominate the economies of the future, not to mention the extraordinary wealth and power of a few of the world's most influential players. Stephen: In this episode, entertaining though ""Claws of the Red Dragon"" promises to be, we'll look beyond fiction to the facts which led to the Chinese conflict with Canada. We'll also look beyond Vancouver to the streets of Hong Kong, Meng's other home, and the scene of her alleged crime, where China is facing pressure from its own citizens, even as it is placing pressure on Canadians. And tensions in Canada will reach a boiling point as a former Prime Minister weighs in.This is Sanctioned, Episode 8: The Rule of Law. [music: somber] Stephen: Jean Chretien was the Prime Minister of Canada on July 1st, 1997. On that day, the stroke of midnight marked the historic handover of what had been the British colony of Hong Kong back to the Chinese. [news clips play] [music: regal] Reporter: A century and a half of British rule in Hong Kong is simply history tonight. Man: I am the 28the. Governor. The last governor, my wife, my children and myself will take Hong Kong home in our hearts. Reporter 2: They left us to the call of trumpets echoing across the Pearl River. A long goodbye that ended with a wave. Stephen: And July 1st also happened to be Canada Day, so there were fireworks on both sides of the globe. Chretien is known to friends and foes alike as the self-styled little guy from Shawinigan, a scrappy fighter and perennial underdog who always seems to come out on top. In his youth, Chretien suffered from an attack of Bell's palsy, permanently leaving the left side of his face paralyzed. Stephen: As veteran foreign correspondent Jonathan Manthorpe says, it's a condition that, along with his strong Quebec accent, Chretien has used to endear himself to the public and to obscure sharp political skills with an everyman veneer.  [clip Jonathan Manthorpe speaking] Jonathan Manthorpe: He was a very eminent lawyer. He was Minister of Justice. He was actually, initially made his parliamentary name in the Pierre Trudeau cabinet as Minister of what was then called Indian Affairs. So, as you say, the sort of scrappy street fighter from the boonies of Quebec was the image he'd like to cultivate, but he was actually a very sophisticated and accomplished man. Stephen: By 1993, Chretien had risen to the post of Prime Minister himself. He would be the last Liberal to form a majority government, until Justin Trudeau took office in 2015.Chretien resigned more than a decade earlier, in the midst of allegations that later became known as ""the Sponsorship Scandal"", a uniquely Canadian morass of corruption,  payoffs, and misuse of public funds, centred around the actions of the Liberals in Chretien's home province. But back to 1997, when Chretien, along with the rest of the world, watched the birth of a new day in Kong Kong and what became known in China as the era of ""One country, two systems"".    [news clips play] [music: regal] [man speaks in Mandarin] Stephen: In his first term as Prime Minister, Jean Chretien led the largest foreign trade delegation to China in the years following the Tiananmen Square massacre. [news clips play] Reporter: Scattered protests continue to sputter and there are new reports of skirmishes and violence in the wake of this weekend's massive military assault aimed at smashing China's pro-democracy demonstrations. [sounds: protesting ] Reporter 2: The troops have been firing indiscriminately, but still, there are thousands of  people on the streets who will not move back. Reporter 3:  As the army units approached the centre of the city, they were firing into side streets, killing and injuring scores of comprehending and unarmed men women and children. Stephen: Although China has never acknowledged the slaughter of hundreds, possibly thousands, of student protesters by its army in 1989, Jonathan Manthorpe says Chretien's overtures helped reboot Canada's relationship with the Chinese government. [clip of Jonathan Manthorpe speaking]  Jonathan: China, Chinese Communist Party was still in international purgatory of sanctions because of that incident. In fact, it was a national uprising. There were similar massacres in about a hundred or so cities around China. It wasn't just in Tiananmen Square, it was much more significant than that and I think the Chinese Communist Party at that point looked to Chretien to help them out of the international doldrums in which they'd been thrust because of the massacre. Stephen: The relationship between Canada and the Chinese communist government dates back more than 50 years, to a point when Pierre Trudeau began negotiations with the People's Republic of China in order to open diplomatic relations with the communist giant and at its core, the relationship relies on a belief that is embraced by politicians of all stripes, Canadian and otherwise, politicians who seek to take advantage of China's great economic possibilities, even as they cast a wary eye to the human rights abuses of a dictatorship. It's the idea that you could embrace the light of the communist country without sacrificing anything to its darkness. Stephen: In his post-political life, Chretien continued to make frequent visits to China as part of his work with an elite law firm. He had earned the respect of Chinese governments, past and present, so it made sense that in early June 2019, another former Canadian Prime Minister, a rival even, Brian Mulroney suggested Jean Chretien might be just the man to sweeten Canada's suddenly poisoned relationship with China. Stephen: The idea is to win the release of Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, the two Canadians who had been imprisoned in China and accused of spying, and to rebuild Canada's trade relationship with China, which had banned Canadian canola and meat, all implemented in the wake of Meng Wanzhou's arrest.  As it turned out, Jean Chretien was more than willing to step into the fray once again, but perhaps not in the way that current Prime Minister Justin Trudeau might have hoped. [music: somber] Stephen: On June 12th, just as the Globe and Mail newspaper was putting the finishing touches on a bombshell of a story about Jean Chretien and Meng Wanzhou, riot police hit the streets of Hong Kong. [news clips play] Reporter: It's absolute chaos here on the streets of Hong Kong.  As you can see behind me, there were literally tens of thousands of pro-democracy supporters out here tonight, rallying against the Government's proposal to change extradition laws. Woman: [speaking: in an alternate language] Translator: I think the most important thing is to oppose this evil law.  Reporter 2: The police are also adopting more aggressive tactics, moving in faster and for the first time firing rubber bullets and beanbag rounds. Methods, Amnesty International has criticised as excessive force. Stephen: Police were sent out to quell growing protests against proposed legislation that would have further blurred the lines of the so-called 'One country, two systems' relationship between the Chinese mainland and the Hong Kong special administrative region.Ironically enough, given Meng's current predicament, the subject of the legislation was extradition. If enacted, the law would allow authorities in Hong Kong to detain and extradite suspects to mainland China and Taiwan to face trial. Critics complained that the rule would expose a population that was promised relative autonomy back in 1997 to the arbitrary and unjust realities of the Chinese legal system. [clip of Ivy Li speaking]   Ivy Li: Everyone in Hong Kong knows that China or anybody in China that can corrupt the officials and use any charges to try and get at people that they don't like or don't want. So, that is where the Hong Kong people are saying, if this amendment bill will pass, it means that everyone in Hong Kong will be at risk. Doesn't matter, you're a businessman or you are just an ordinary citizen or you are dissident. Stephen: Ivy Li, with the group Canadian Friends of Hong Kong, says erosion of the rights and freedoms of Hong Kongers started long before this extradition bill was proposed, and so the bill is really just the tip of the iceberg, there are much, much deeper political and socio-economic grievances. So in the days that followed the initial protests, the crowds grew and Hong Kong chief executive Carrie Lam, eventually announced the suspension of the bill and then later, even a withdrawal, but despite grave warnings from the Chinese government and increasingly violent police crackdowns, the protests in Hong Kong continued and civilians fought fire with fire.  Stephen: Lawyers, students, professors, waiters, housewives, grandparents, a sea of opponents eventually drew up a list of five core demands: complete withdrawal of the extradition bill,  the release of protesters, an independent commission into police conduct, the resignation of Carrie Lam, and universal suffrage. [clip of Ivy Li speaking]   Ivy: Because people start to realize that all these things they're seeing is only a symptom. The real solution to it, is to have to fight for universal suffrage so they can actually elect their own government. Doesn't matter how many times that the chief executives resign, step down. It will only be replaced by another puppet. So, even if the extradition bill is being withdrawn, Hong Kong will not be safe anymore because the police are behaving like the citizens are their enemies. So, people are saying that no, it's too late, too little. Stephen: Ivy, what was it like for you, or what is it like for you because those protests continue. What is it like for you to be watching what's going on there now from this far away? What do you think of what you've been seeing? Ivy: Um, it is very sad because it is a very beautiful, vibrant city and even though I left it for so many years, I still have family and friends back there. I know that Hong Kong would not be the same. Stephen: If unrest in Hong Kong, troubling though it may be, seems like a long way from the plight of Meng Wanzhou, remember, her story and the dilemma Canada is facing are both very much wrapped up in the tensions of that city.CBC reporter Jason Proctor's here to explain. Hello Jason. Jason Proctor: Hi, Stephen. Stephen: What does all this political unrest in Hong Kong have to do with Meng Wanzhou? Jason: Well, you want to think about Hong Kong in this whole story as almost this kind of third background character to all of this drama. Meng Wanzhou had actually flown from Hong Kong to Vancouver on the day she was arrested. According to the notes of the Canada Border Services agent who detained Meng in the hours after she stepped off the plane in December, she said she had traveled on a Hong Kong passport because she'd relinquished her People's Republic of China passport. Jason: So, in addition to the two Vancouver properties she owns in Canada, she has three apartments in London. Interestingly Monk said she also owned four more homes, two in Hong Kong, and two just across the border with mainland China in Shenzhen. You know, those properties reflect the realities of a life for a woman like Meng Wanzhou who does billionaire business in both the East and the West, in Hong Kong and in mainland China. Stephen: And Huawei's headquarters are actually based in Shenzhen. Yeah, Shenzhen is the first special economic zone that was established by China in 1980 for citizens to experiment with market capitalism it was in the back room of a restaurant in Hong Kong though that Meng travelled when she wanted, you know, allegedly to reassure an HSBC executive that the company was not breaking U.S. sanctions in the sort of action that gave rise to this whole case. Stephen: As Meng's father Ren Zhengfei had proven, China's ""experiment"" with capitalism, at this point, was beyond successful, but now, with the world watching, the Chinese military was beginning to amass in  Meng's other home in Shenzhen, which was a message, you know, an implied threat, you might say to the protesters on the other side of the border in Hong Kong and, you know, it was that kind of threat, veiled or naked, that figured into the thinking of the thousands of people who fled Hong Kong before the handover to China in 1997, landing in British Columbia, Canada, and now people in Canada and particularly in British Columbia were keeping a keen eye on this growing conflict. [music: somber] Stephen: Protesters and counter protesters in Vancouver would mirror the battles on Hong Kong's streets in much the same way that Meng's supporters would face off against her detractors on the steps of the courthouse where she fought for bail and in every case,  allegations were hurled back and forth about the potential influence of the Chinese state. Stephen: The front page headline in the Globe and Mail on June 13th caught the eye of the Canadian government almost immediately.""Chretien proposes cancelling Meng's extradition case to unfreeze relations with China.""The story went on to say that former Prime Minister, Jean Chretien, in private conversations with business executives, had been floating the idea that Canada's Justice Minister should exert his authority to end the extradition process against Meng. Stephen: The story said the proposal had not yet been formally presented to the Trudeau government, but that it would meet Chinese president Xi Jinping's demand that Meng be freed to return home to Beijing, as a means to ramp down reprisals that extended beyond the Canadians marking time in a Chinese prison, to the thousands of farmers whose livelihoods were being threatened by the Chinese bans on Canadian agricultural products. Now, it's true that Justice Minister David Lametti could intervene in Meng's extradition proceeding at any time, it is, after all, within the legislation, but as Paul Evans with the School of Public Policy and Global Affairs at UBC told me, this provision has never been acted upon by a Canadian justice minister.  [clip of Paul Evans speaking]  Paul Evans: Some lawyers would make the case that it shouldn't be acted upon, but nevertheless, it is not undue interference in a legal proceeding. It is something that has been anticipated in the legislation from the outset. Secondly, I think that if a current justice minister or a future justice minister, we don't know the outcome of the election, but that a future minister and government would have to start preparing the ground for the Canadian public and preparing the ground for the United States. Stephen: And that would be a huge issue with the United States, if the Minister stepped in to end the extradition proceedings. Paul: It would be. It would be unprecedented and particularly in the context of the major U.S. confrontation with China, which, there may be some magic, but at the moment, it looks like this is building towards a multidimensional confrontation, that for Canada to make a decision to release Madam Meng, that would need a lot of explaining and a lot of courage by any government that wished to do it. Stephen: Canada's Foreign Affairs Minister, Chrystia Freeland almost immediately rejected Chretien's suggestion. [clip of Chrystia Freeland speaking] Chrystia Freeland: When it comes to the extradition request around Ms. Meng, Canada has very carefully and intentionally abided by our extradition treaty commitments and, I think, when we reflect on it, it would be clear to all of us that it would be a very dangerous precedent indeed for Canada to alter its behaviour when it comes to honouring an extradition treaty in response to external pressure. Stephen:  But Chretien's proposal had raised a point that in some ways,  touched the heart of Canada's conflict with China, and the many underlying tensions. [music: somber] Stephen: What is the value of one individual, as measured against the interests of the wider population or the desires of the state? It's the kind of question Chretien himself had faced in 1997, when RCMP pepper sprayed protesters at an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit meeting at the University of British Columbia, a stone's throw from Meng's mansion. Chretien was accused of sacrificing the Canadian right to free speech  to save an Indonesian dictator from embarrassment. At the time, Chretien even joked about the effects of pepper spray. [clip of Chretien speaking] Jean Chretien: For me, I put pepper on my plate. [crowd laughs] Jean: Next. Stephen: And now, nearly a quarter century later, Chretien was suggesting that the rule of extradition law take a back seat to Canada's economic interests with China, a country that is allegedly holding Canadians hostage to get its way, a country that, even as the Meng Wanzhou drama was playing out, was threatening to crack down on peaceful protesters who were marching in Hong Kong in the millions, demanding their rights. Stephen: This was an awkward time for Canada to be having this conversation. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's government was facing a rule of law scandal of its own, grounded in an allegation that he had attempted to force his attorney general into giving Canadian engineering giant SNC Lavalin, a break on a criminal case that could have killed the company. Trudeau claimed he was putting Canadian jobs first. Chretien was suggesting he do just that, by freeing Meng Wanzhou and Meng's lawyers were listening. [music: somber] Stephen: The statement came out as a blast email, jointly signed by all four of Meng Wanzhou's lawyers. Canada, they said, was at a crossroads, and Canadian values were at stake. Jason Proctor's back with me now. So Jason, what exactly were Meng's lawyers trying to say here?  Jason: They cited former Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien's comments as the impetus for what they claimed was an appeal to Canada's Minister of Justice to drop the extradition proceedings against their client Meng Wanzhou, and I'll read from their statement, because it was fairly extraordinary. Quote, ""from time to time, Canadian governments have had to make difficult decisions, sometimes at odds with the foreign policy initiatives of its allies, including the United States, in order to assert essential Canadian values of human decency, fairness, tolerance and respect for human rights and the rule of law,"" end quote, and that was from this statement. Stephen: Except that tolerance and respect for human rights were not the only factors at play here. Jason: No, certainly not. And they weren't front and centre in the argument being put forward through, you know, the Globe Mail story on Chretien. Meng's lawyers claimed the cessation of the proceedings would be in the best interests of Canada's national interests and they went on to underscore a point that would become central to their argument for Meng's freedom because, well, only the United States has sanctions prohibiting foreign banks from entering into U.S. dollar transactions with foreign companies selling commercial goods in Iran.  Jason: So, what they say is man's alleged crime wouldn't be a crime in Canada, and again this is quoting from the statement, ""Canada does not police the conduct of foreign persons in foreign lands that have nothing to do with Canada"". That's from the statement and Meng's lawyers backed up their argument with another page from Chretien's book. [music: somber] Stephen: On February 15th, 2003, crowds began streaming into downtown Vancouver. Their destination? The art gallery. Once a provincial courthouse, the hundred-year-old building that houses the gallery was renovated in the 1980s by Arthur Erickson, part of the same complex of buildings where Meng Wanzhou would later face trial. Stephen: The gallery has served as a locus for protest for decades and in 2003, with a U.S. led war against Iraq imminent, more than 40,000 people gathered in the streets, joining millions around the world to oppose the invasion. [clips from Iraq war protests] Man: We are here to send a message of hope and solidarity for the people of Iraq. Woman: We are here today because we want to say to the Canadian government, have the courage to stand up and speak out and stop this war. Do not be complicit in the war on Iraq. Stephen: Just a few months earlier, Prime Minister Jean Chretien announced that Canada would not be part of the American coalition. It was a controversial move at the time, one that spurred debate, but it proved that Canada can go it alone when national interest was at stake. So now, years later,  Meng Wanzhou's lawyers are pointing to that decision as evidence that Canada can stand up to the pressures of its allies. [music: somber] Stephen: Ironically, David Lametti, the justice minister who was the target of Meng's appeal, had just taking over for Jody Wilson-Raybould, the Liberal politician who claimed she had stood up to her own government in order to defend the rule of law when it came to the prosecution of the engineering giant SNC Lavalin. As foreign affairs minister Chrystia Freeland acknowledged to the CBC, if Meng was committed for extradition, there would come a point when Lametti would have to make a decision, no matter what, as to whether Meng should be sent to the United States. Saying you're a rule of law country doesn't mean political decisions don't get taken, Freeland said. And in fact, Jason, the political element of the extradition process is actually baked right into the law. Jason: Well, yeah, it is. You know, in 2001, Canada's top court, Supreme Court of Canada decided not to extradite four men wanted in the United States for a 22 million dollar telemarketing scam. So, the reason in that case, which has precedent with regards to, you know, the situation Meng Wanzhou is in, it was from comments that American prosecutors made to a CBC show, The Fifth Estate, implying that one of the accused would be ""the boyfriend of a very bad man"", if he waited out his extradition hearing and wound up in a U.S. jail. Jason: So, the men involved at the center of that case, argued that they were being threatened with rape in prison, and that would be a violation of the very same Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms that  Meng Wanzhou was arguing, should act as a shield for her against the actions of authorities determined to put her behind bars. So this was a case when the courts essentially said, the Minister of Justice should have refused a request from the United States or should have at least stepped in and overruled the court. Meng's lawyers claimed this was another one of those times, they urged the Canadian government to stand up for Canadian values.  [somber music] Stephen: But what exactly would that mean? Should the Canadian government support the legal request of an ally, or give into the bullying tactics of a valued trading partner?It was a conundrum Lametti would have to ponder, even as tanks gathered in Shenzhen, thousands of protesters linked arms in Hong Kong and the world watched. It was to be a summer of discontent in Hong Kong, Vancouver, and in Washington, where rumours of a recession began dogging U.S. President Donald Trump. [news clips play] Donald Trump: I don't see a recession. I mean, the world is in a recession right now. Woman: Over the next 12 months the recession probability is above 80 percent. Reporter: Democrats pin the blame on the White House's trade war with China. Presidential candidate, Pete Buttigieg. Pete Buttigieg:  But it's also a fool's errand to think you're gonna be able to get China to change the fundamentals of their economic model by poking them in the eye with some tariffs. Stephen: The trade battle between the U.S. and China had become tit for tat and with Christmas looming, American consumers were starting to feel the pain of billions of dollars worth of tariffs and American farmers began to grumble about the impact of Chinese retaliation, which was beginning to hurt their pocketbooks.Trump's Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, tried to walk back the president's suggestion that Meng Wanzhou might be used as a bargaining chip.  [clip of Mike Pompeo speaking] Mike Pompeo: We've been pretty clear, with respect to the way we process and ask other countries with respect to extradition. I expect this case will be no different from that attorney general bar and the Justice Department team have a process by which they evaluate anytime they ask for this extradition which is a big lift oftentimes, certainly in this case, it is as well. They were thoughtful in the request and they'll continue to accord with American law and international law in the way that they proceed. I'm very confident of that.  Stephen: Movie audiences braced themselves for the release of ""Claws of the Red Dragon""  [clip from Red Dragon plays]  Woman: This is a democracy, reporters write the truth, editors allow that truth to be published, the legal system operates without interference, full stop. Stephen: And court watchers prepared for the next episode of the legal drama, when Meng's lawyers would face prosecutors in court for the first real legal skirmish in the fight, a fight ahead of the extradition hearing itself, a battle for disclosure of notes, documents, and correspondence between Canadian and U.S. authorities in the leadup to Meng's arrest. It would likely be the next time the world got a glimpse of the embattled Huawei CFO, a court appearance taking place weeks before a Canadian election, where the rule of law, the relationship with China, and the future of 5G would all be on the table. Meng Wanzhou would still face extradition after the election, but would her situation come to haunt a new Canadian government? [music: somber] Stephen: This is our last episode for now,  but we expect to be back with more as events warrant in the coming months.

"The COVID-19 pandemic: What it is, who's at risk, and how you can protect yourself | CBC News","Here's a breakdown of what COVID-19 is, who is most at risk of catching it, and most importantly, what you can do to protect yourself.",2020-03-12T08:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/covid19-disease-outbreak-epidemic-illness-respiratory-1.5494518,"Now that the World Health Organization has declared the novel coronavirus outbreak a pandemic, shutting down cities and even an entire country, many people want to know more about what they can do to fight COVID-19.   Canada confirmed its first case on Jan. 25 and as the new virus makes its way around the world, here's a breakdown of what it is, who is most at risk, and most importantly, what you can do to protect yourself. It's the illness that's caused by a viral respiratory infection. The virus that leads to COVID-19 is known as SARS-CoV-2​​​​.Dr. Allison McGeer, a clinical scientist with Sinai Health System in Toronto, said SARS-CoV-2 probably started showing up in China in November 2019.The World Health Organization says Chinese officials first reported cases of pneumonia with an unknown cause to the WHO Country Office on Dec. 31, 2019. What we know (and don't know) about the coronavirus outbreakOverall, 80 per cent of those who get infected will have mild symptoms, said Dr. Isaac Bogoch, an infectious disease expert at University Health Network in Toronto. Severe COVID-19 cases are more common for those who are ""older, immunocompromised and/or have underlying health issues,"" said McGeer. In February, China's centre for disease control and prevention (China CDC), published a study outlining the age and gender of 72,314 people infected with COVID-19.  The findings show that about 80 per cent of those who died from COVID-19 in China were 60 or older. In Italy, the National Health Institute says the average age of patients who have died is 81, with the majority suffering from underlying health problems.""The disease in children appears to be mild,"" said McGeer. China CDC found that only 0.9 per cent of infections were children under the age of 10.Canada's first COVID-19 death is not cause for panic — but shows need to protect most vulnerableAccording to the World Health Organization:Proper hand hygiene, said McGeer, can greatly reduce your risk of contracting the illness.  Although using soap to thoroughly cleanse your hands is best, ""if hand sanitizer is all you have, use that,"" said Bogoch. ""Go for the hand sanitizer that has about 70 per cent alcohol,"" he said. The World Health Organization says the virus is spread from person-to-person through small droplets from an infected person's mouth or nose. ""If you get the virus on your hands, this virus does not infect you through your skin,"" said McGeer. ""It has to then be transmitted to your eyes, mouth or nose.""  That's why it's so important to keep your hands away from your face, said Bogoch. ""It's actually hard to do that in practice, but if people are mindful and don't touch their faces… they'll come into less contact with this virus,"" said Bogoch.COVID-19 isn't a gastrointestinal virus, said McGeer. ""We've seen quarantines in China and Italy … but there's not been a circumstance in which there has been shortages of food or or basic supplies or life saving medication.,"" she said. If you do get sick, you will need to stay home for two weeks. Having enough food for 14 days is key, said McGeer. You should also refill your prescriptions so you have enough medication to last through a quarantine.  Though many people infected with COVID-19 may have few or no symptoms, the government of Canada's website says those symptoms include: Stay home, say both McGeer and Bogoch. The government of Canada website also outlines that if you need to see a doctor or go to the hospital because your illness is severe, call ahead or tell officials that you have a respiratory illness right when you arrive.  Canadians being urged to help 'flatten the curve' of COVID-19WHO is coordinating efforts to develop vaccines and some drug treatments are currently under investigation. But Bogoch said a vaccine is at least a year away. He said the infectious disease community believes that there are three scenarios for the future of COVID-19: ""We need to develop an effective vaccine to protect communities from this infection, because it's unlikely to go away anytime soon,"" said Bogoch."

Yellowknife couple faces coronavirus on both sides of the world | CBC News,"While Steven Shen waits for the panic to subside in China’s Guangdong province, his wife Nancy Lin confronts fear of the COVID-19 in Yellowknife.",2020-03-06T00:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/yellowknife-coronavirus-1.5488661,"It was supposed to be a retirement vacation. Steven Shen travelled to Asia with a Yellowknife couple, first to the couple's home community in the Philippines, then to his in China. Shen grew up in Chaozhou, a city of 2.6 million people in China's Guangdong province.He reached China on Jan. 18, planning to return to Yellowknife on March 3. In early February, he learned from his travel agent that his return flight to Canada, on China Eastern Airlines, was cancelled. Chaozhou is about 800 kilometres south of Wuhan, where the novel coronavirus, COVID-19, first emerged, and far from the areas where authorities have imposed a clampdown on travel. But Wuhan is a busy travel hub, which has affected routes throughout the country. Shen could have rebooked on a later flight, but he hasn't yet done so. ""After consulting with my family and consulting a public health expert, they say, well, you're better to stay in China longer, and I think it is a good idea."" Shen is a former environmental health officer with the N.W.T. government. He moved to Yellowknife 15 years ago to take the job. So while he wants to avoid travelling on any routes where he could be exposed to the illness, or carrying the illness himself, there's also another reason he's choosing to stay put.""I want to set an example for other people.""Shen's wife, Nancy Lin, says she's OK with that decision. She and the couple's daughter have been in Yellowknife the whole time, checking in with Steve by phone. ""He is having a good time,"" Lin said. But Lin has faced her own COVID-19 battles at home. She usually travels to China over the holidays, visiting family for two weeks at a time. This year, she changed that plan in order to prepare for an exam. One afternoon in January, she was in the downtown grocery store when she saw one of her co-workers, who knows her usual pattern. ""He passed by,"" she said, ""and then realized it was me. And then he stepped two steps far away from me, which is kind of about two metres away from me, and then he stopped and turned and said, 'Hey, Nancy! Have you just come back from China?'""Obviously I can feel that two-metres distance."" In China, Shen says he's already seen concern about the COVID-19 virus calm down. He spoke to the CBC from a street side tea shop and said people were smiling and out walking around.""That was not the situation one month ago. People were very worried."" Shen said he's also hoping to get some more information as an international traveller returning to the N.W.T., ""such as guidance on isolation and prevention.""So far, the territorial government has not issued any general warnings or advice on whether or not to travel — inside or outside of the country. The World Health Organization has not yet advised against any international travel.The federal government issued a travel advisory on Jan. 7 advising Canadians ""to consider avoiding non-essential travel to China"" and other countries affected by the COVID-19 virus. That advisory recommends travellers who do go to China avoid spending time in large crowds, avoid sick people and animals, and follow local public health advice. Travellers returning from China are asked to monitor their health for fever, cough and difficulty breathing for 14 days, and ""avoid places where you cannot easily separate from others if you become ill.""People who do develop symptoms are asked to isolate themselves from others as quickly as possible and contact a health-care professional.Those who have travelled to China's Hubei Province (of which Wuhan is the capital) are asked to contact the public health authority in the area where they live within 24 hours of arriving in Canada. "

Meng Wanzhou lawyers claim Trump has 'poisoned' extradition proceedings | CBC News,Lawyers for Meng Wanzhou claim U.S. President Donald Trump has 'poisoned' extradition proceedings against the Huawei executive to the degree where the judge overseeing the hearing has no choice but to throw the case out.,2020-07-24T17:23:27.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/meng-wanzhou-update-july-2020-1.5661627,"Lawyers for Meng Wanzhou claim U.S. President Donald Trump has ""poisoned"" extradition proceedings against the Huawei executive to the degree where the judge overseeing the hearing has no choice but to throw the case out.In court documents filed in advance of a September hearing, Meng's defence team cites Trump's history of intervening in high-profile criminal cases to claim he would have no hesitation to make good on his threat to use their client as a bargaining chip in a global trade war.Lawyers for the Huawei chief financial officer also noted Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's comments about two Canadians detained in China in apparent retaliation for Meng's arrest.The lawyers claim Meng, 48, has been left in the impossible position of fearing that any attempt to defend herself may affect either the Chinese economy or the lives of two men.""These proceedings have been poisoned,"" Meng's lawyers claimed in a 28-page legal brief outlining their arguments.""They can no longer be reasonably regarded as fair, regardless of the undoubted good faith of the court.""Meng was arrested on an extradition warrant on Dec. 1, 2018, after landing in Vancouver on what was supposed to be a layover between Hong Kong and Mexico City.The U.S. wants to extradite Meng to New York to face charges of fraud and conspiracy.She is accused of lying to banks about Huawei's relationship with a company accused of violating U.S. economic sanctions against Iran. Prosecutors claim Meng's alleged lies placed banks at risk of loss and prosecution.The latest legal arguments are grounded in a statement Trump made to a reporter less than two weeks after Meng's arrest in which he was asked if he would intervene in the case. At the time, the United States had recently escalated the trade war with China, which is still in effect.""If I think it's good for what will be certainly the largest trade deal ever made — which is a very important thing — what's good for national security, I would certainly intervene if I thought it was necessary,"" Trump replied.Meng's lawyers say the actions of the president and U.S. Attorney General William Barr in the cases of both Trump's former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn and his political advisor Roger Stone make clear that his words are not just idle talk.Flynn — who Trump called ""a good guy"" — pleaded guilty twice to lying to the Federal Bureau of Investigation about conversations with Russia's ambassador, yet the case against him was dismissed after the U.S. Justice Department intervened.In February, Trump demanded a new trial for Stone, calling himself ""the chief law enforcement officer of the country."" More recently, he acted to commute Stone's three year prison sentence for witness tampering and lying to Congress.""The two examples show that the (U.S.) president not only thinks he can intervene in prosecutions, but that he will do so when it suits his political agenda,"" Meng's lawyers wrote.They also said that Trump has already said that ""there is MUCH more to come"" when it comes to interventions.The court documents also claim Trudeau contributed to the politicization of the case in statements he made to a French language TV show in December 2019 with regard to former diplomat Michael Kovrig and entrepreneur Michael Spavor.The two were detained in China within days of Meng's arrest and have since been accused of spying. Both men have been held in Chinese prisons for more than a year and a half.Trudeau claimed his government told the U.S. it ""should not sign a final and complete agreement with China that does not settle the question of Meng Wanzhou and the two Canadians.""""As a bargaining chip in a global trade war, (Meng faces) intimidation regarding the ramifications her own decisions may have on others,"" her lawyers claim.They say a reasonable person would believe that how Meng ""defends her extradition could alter the consequences faced by the two Canadians held in China.Her defence strategy could also impact Huawei in its future interests as a globally competitive company, as well as Canada's economy.""The legal arguments are all part of a series of attempts that the defence plans to make to have the case against Meng tossed for alleged abuse of process. The same newly filed batch of court documents include an argument that the U.S. failed to disclose material facts in its record of the case that show Meng's statements to banks had no impact on the financial decisions in question.If necessary, the defence team also plans to argue that Canadian and U.S. authorities conspired to violate Meng's Constitutional rights at the time of her arrest.To that end, her lawyers will be in federal court next week to argue for the release of Canadian Security Intelligence Service documents that they claim prove collusion with the FBI.CSIS has already released a number of heavily redacted documents suggesting that it was aware of Meng's arrest and in contact with the FBI and other agencies.Canada's attorney general claims the redacted information should be kept from public view because of national security concerns. Affidavits filed in the case suggest that the details could inflame tensions with China and alienate intelligence sources.But in federal court documents released Friday, Meng's lawyers claim the information could be crucial to her defence.""If there is additional information hidden under the redactions ... national security privilege should not be used to cover up the abuse,"" the lawyers state.""Additionally, national security privilege should not be used to protect government enforcement officials from being embarrassed.""Meng has been living under house arrest since her release on $10 million bail in the week after her initial arrest.She wears a monitoring bracelet as part of her release conditions and lives in one of two multi-million mansions she owns on Vancouver's west side.She has denied the allegations made against her. "

Sign up here to get this delivered to your inbox every morning.Canadians are shopping online in record numbers during the pandemic — sales almost doubled from $1.6 billion in February to $2.8 billion in August, according to Statistics Canada.  But what happens when those items don't arrive? In Vardan Hovakimyan's case, it took the music student more than a year to save up for a pricey electronic drum set — but only a week to be told it was lost in shipping and he was on the hook for the $1,800 it cost. The 40003 Speedlight Electronic Drum Kit was shipped in two boxes. Only one arrived at the Purolator outlet on Sept. 16, missing key pieces and rendering the set useless.  Things got complicated when Hovakimyan asked for a refund. He spent weeks going back and forth between the shipping company and the retailer, trying to get them to track down the missing box or give him his money back.  Purolator said it would look for the package, but he'd have to deal with the seller if he wanted a refund. The seller, Acclaim Sound and Lighting in North Bay, Ont., would only offer a replacement if the set was back in stock sometime in the future — or give him the $100 it got from shipping insurance.WATCH | A look at two shoppers whose online orders never arrived:The National  Consumer laws are on the side of online shoppers when deliveries go missing, but experts say taking advantage of those laws is harder than it should be, made more complicated when companies try to shift the cost of lost parcels onto buyers in their policies.  ""It's certainly not unusual that companies will write policies that are one-sided and intended to make consumers feel they have fewer rights than they do,"" said Ken Whitehurst, executive director of the Consumers Council of Canada. He said some company policies indicate the buyer is responsible for merchandise that's lost in shipping, even though consumer laws clearly say the retailer is responsible.  He said buyers often think they are at the mercy of those store policies. Hovakimyan did, after reading Acclaim Sound and Lighting's shipping policy, which says the customer assumes ""the risk of loss"" once an item is shipped. The company refunded Hovakimyan's money more than a month later, but only after Purolator located the missing box in one of its warehouses. Read more on this story here.(Malcolm Denemark/Florida Today/The Associated Press)Crowds on the beach in Cape Canaveral, Fla., watch the launch of the SpaceX Falcon 9 Crew Dragon on Sunday in this 3½-minute exposure.

Supreme Court. But Supt. Bryce McRae will take the stand in a world that has changed in at least one fundamental way in the past two weeks: the country seeking to extradite Meng has elected a new president. Observers are anxious to see what U.S. president-elect Joe Biden might mean for a case in which the actions of current President Donald Trump have featured so prominently. Paul Evans, a professor in the University of British Columbia's school of public policy and global affairs, said there is little doubt Biden will ""continue the concept of China as a rival and a strategic competitor."" But Evans believes the incoming administration may take a less confrontational approach — while also being more willing to consider the interests of an ally like Canada in dealing with China's anger over Meng's arrest. Read more on this story here.  Transport Canada has suspended six employees without pay for spreading a racist email at work more than a decade ago, following a CBC News story last year that triggered an internal investigation. The department's probe found 10 workers shared an offensive parody song called Strangers on my Flight, set to the tune of a Frank Sinatra number, between 2006 and 2010. The spoof song features derogatory lyrics based on racial stereotypes about travellers wearing turbans and mentions harming travellers with baseball bats. In a memo sent to all staff on Tuesday, the department's deputy minister Michael Keenan and associate deputy minister Arun Thangaraj said that while the email was sent years ago, its distribution amounted to an act of ""systemic racism that had a negative impact on our workplace and the public's confidence in Transport Canada's ability to operate without bias."" Of the 10 employees who shared the email, only six still work for the department. Read more on the suspensions here.   As the number of high-profile online consumer security breaches continues to grow, the federal government is expected to introduce a bill to shake up Canada's privacy laws — possibly as soon as today. Innovation Minister Navdeep Bains signalled plans to introduce the legislation late last week on the House of Commons notice paper. The bill would be the first major attempt to change Canada's privacy law in decades. Details of the bill won't be available until the legislation is tabled, but a spokesperson for Bains pointed to the promises outlined in the minister's mandate letter — which tasked him with drafting a ""digital charter"" that would include legislation to give Canadians ""appropriate compensation"" when their personal data is breached. Read more here about the pending bill.  Shell Canada will plant more than 800,000 trees in the interior of British Columbia next year, a project that the company hopes will create valuable carbon offsets in the future. Shell is one of the companies pushing the federal government to create a national greenhouse gas offset program, which Ottawa announced last year with no specific timeline for when it might start. Carbon offsets allow companies and individuals to invest in environmental projects in order to balance out their own greenhouse gas emissions. Increasingly, energy companies are setting climate goals to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. While the firms expect technological innovation will play a big role in achieving those targets, in addition to sequestering emissions underground, purchasing offsets are a way to make sure there is at least a pathway to reaching ambitious environmental targets. While innovation will likely occur, the technology under development may not prove to be as effective as hoped. Read more here on the push for a carbon offset program.  Donald Trump shows no sign of ever admitting he lost the U.S. presidential election fairly. The closest he came was a tweet Sunday that suggested Joe Biden won through treachery — and after some media interpreted that as a grudging concession, Trump pulled it back with other tweets like: ""I concede NOTHING! We have a long way to go. This was a RIGGED ELECTION!"" Trump's words are legally irrelevant to the outcome, but some of his supporters say they're waiting to hear him concede before they'll accept his loss and move on. Read more on why Trump's non-admission of defeat could have a slow-burning effect for years.WATCH | Donald Trump refuses to concede in ongoing presidential transition saga:  Now for some good news to start your Monday: There are all sorts of ways to make the world a brighter place.

China has suspended imports of Canadian canola, pork and beef after the arrest of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou in Vancouver in December at the behest of American officials.""This problem will pass,"" McCallum was quoted as saying. ""It's important for Canadian business people not just to come to China but to come often … especially when the going is tough.""McCallum was let go from his post after remarks he made regarding the high-profile Meng extradition case. The longtime Liberal publicly opined that Meng, daughter of the founder of the Chinese telecom giant, had a strong case in fighting extradition to the U.S.He also stated that any deal to spare Meng from prosecution in the U.S. should include the release of Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, Canadians detained in China.Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland took exception to her former colleague's comments Thursday while speaking to reporters at an event in London.""Mr. McCallum does not speak in the name of the Canadian government,"" said Freeland. ""I think it is inappropriate for any Canadian to be advising any foreign government in ways it ought or ought not to behave to secure any particular election outcome in Canada.""Scheer was unmoved by the fact that McCallum was no longer speaking in an official capacity.""Justin Trudeau still has not disavowed John McCallum's invitation for the Chinese government to interfere in the upcoming election,"" the Conservative leader said in a social media post. ""The only conclusion to come to is that electing Justin Trudeau would be good for China, but bad for Canada."""
Alberta unconcerned about OPEC prediction for slower growth in oil demand over next 25 years | CBC News,Alberta’s energy minister is unconcerned about a new report by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) that suggests demand for oil will plateau in a decade.,2020-10-09T01:00:25.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/alberta-unconcerned-about-opec-prediction-for-slower-growth-in-oil-demand-over-next-25-years-1.5756345,"Alberta's energy minister is unconcerned about a new report by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) that suggests demand for oil will plateau in a decade.""As we all know, plateau does not mean end of demand — it means end of continuous growth in demand,"" Sonya Savage said in a written statement to CBC News on Thursday. ""Oil and gas will still be required as demand gradually declines. OPEC itself believes that oil will remain the largest contributor to the energy mix through 2045.""The OPEC's World Oil Outlook covers the period from 2020 to 2045. According to the report, demand for oil in 2020 is 90.7 million barrels a day. It will grow to 107 million barrels a day in 2030 and 109 million barrels a day in 2045.""Global oil demand will grow at relatively healthy rates during the first part of the forecast period before demand begins to plateau over a relatively long period during the second half,"" the report said. It also acknowledges a gradual shift away from oil, noting that oil will make up 27.5 per cent of the energy mix in 2045, down from the 31.5 per cent in 2020.Solar, wind and geothermal power will jump from 2.1 per cent of fuel sources in 2020 to 8.7 per cent over that same period, said the OPEC report. Natural gas will also see an increase from 23.1 per cent in 2020 to 25.3 per cent in 2045.While demand for oil is expected to drop in OECD (Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development) countries, it will increase in places like India and China, due to ""a growing middle class, high population growth rates and stronger economic growth potential.""""The largest contributor to this incremental demand is anticipated to be India, adding some 6.3 [million barrels per day] between 2019 and 2045.""The report reflects uncertainty about how long the current pandemic will last and whether changes prompted by COVID-19, like working from home and avoiding international travel, will persist. Oil demand will also be impacted by the move to vehicles powered by electricity, natural gas and hydrogen, as well as measures to reduce climate change, the report said. Richard Masson, an executive fellow with the school of public policy at the University of Calgary and chair of the Canadian chapter of the World Petroleum Council, said the OPEC report sees strong markets for oil over the next 25 years and noted that Canada is one of four non-OPEC countries that can increase production. . ""This scenario is good for Alberta,"" Masson said. ""The challenge, of course, is OPEC notes that the commitments made under the Paris agreement are not being met and there needs to be further work by countries around the world to come up with solutions.""Last month, a forecast from British Petroleum suggested demand for fossil fuels has already peaked due to lasting effects of the pandemic and a switch to renewable energy. The report looked at three scenarios — two suggested oil has already peaked, the third has demand reaching a peak around 2030. Masson said COVID-19 may not have as big of an impact when viewed over a span of 25 years. ""The long-term demand has been driven primarily by more people in the world and more people moving into the middle class, especially in Asia. China and India [are] the two big drivers,"" he said. ""And so COVID has changed our behaviour a little bit in the short term but the long-term outlook is fundamentally driven by that. And COVID will turn out to be probably just a blip on that long-term trend.""Alberta, which has traditionally relied on oil and gas revenues to fund government services, has struggled to keep its deficit and debt in check in light of this year's drop in oil prices. Savage said the government is trying to diversify the economy by moving into mineral production, geothermal energy and small modular nuclear reactors."

He's pressed ahead with a promise to eliminate auxiliary fees charged by some medical specialists, forcing private imaging clinics to offer ultrasounds at no extra cost to patients — and without any formal agreement on how those clinics are to be reimbursed.Beginning next week, medical specialists will be unable to charge many of the fees that have become important sources of revenue for their practices.But now Quebec's federation of medical specialists, the FMSQ, is pushing back.The FMSQ says Barrette unilaterally imposed the new rules, and that in negotiations with the association, he has done little to address concerns about how doctors operating freestanding clinics will be compensated for their lost revenue. Faced with uncertainty over payment, several radiologists are turning away patients. Other specialists have threatened to drop out of the provincial health insurance system.Quebec radiologists threatened with lawsuit for balking at ultrasounds""The information diffused by the Health Ministry is incomplete and raises a lot of questions without providing answers, either for patients or doctors,"" said Diane Francoeur, president of the FMSQ.""What is being allowed is uncertainty, and uncertainty can't be allowed.""The FMSQ wants Barrette gone from the negotiating table. They called on the government to replace him with Treasury Board President Pierre Moreau.Auxiliary fees at the doctor's office will be banned, Quebec health minister says""He seems in a totally different mindset, happy to discuss and evaluate, as every negotiation should be,"" Francoeur said of Moreau, who recently returned to politics following a serious illness.  ""You have to respect both people and find an agreement that fits both,"" Francoeur said.The medical specialists are also hoping to strengthen their bargaining position by hiring former premier Lucien Bouchard to represent them in possible legal actions against the government. Barrette, for his part, appears unfazed by the FMSQ's latest moves. In characteristic fashion, he accused the federation of holding patients ""hostage"" and chalked up their demands for compensation to greediness. ""The issue here is, above all, monetary,"" Barrette told Radio-Canada on Thursday. ""There are groups that always want more. I think the public is listening to us and knows what we're talking about.""Groups take legal action to get Ottawa to enforce Canada Health Act in QuebecHis position is getting some support from a patients' rights group in Quebec that is seeking to launch a class-action lawsuit against radiologists who are cancelling or refusing to take appointments.  ""Medical specialists can't refuse or neglect to offer care to patients for whom they will nevertheless be compensated following a ministerial decision,"" said Paul Brunet, who chairs the Quebec Council for the Protection of Patients, the group behind the lawsuit. Announcing his intention to end auxiliary fees last fall, Barrette said the only extra fee that doctors will be allowed to charge will be for the transport of biological samples from a private clinic or specialist. There is a $15 limit for blood samples, and $5 maximum fee for transporting all other kinds of samples.Ottawa threatens to cut Quebec's health payments over user fees"

"Still no coronavirus cases reported in Sask., says chief medical health officer in update | CBC News",The Saskatchewan Ministry of Health says there have been no confirmed cases of novel Coronavirus in the province.,2020-02-07T16:47:02.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatoon/coronavirus-sask-saqib-shahab-1.5455630,"The Saskatchewan Ministry of Health says there have been no confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus in the province.The provincial Healthline has received 50 calls from people concerned that they might have the virus, which is spreading outside of China, despite the best efforts of officials.The province has tested 13 people in the province who have travelled to China and showed symptoms. Six tests have come back negative and seven are still pending.Chief Medical Health Officer Dr. Saqib Shahab said people in the province do not need to be concerned about the virus spreading.""If you have not travelled to China, and you are in Saskatchewan, there should not be any concern at this point,"" he said. ""It is not transmitting person to person in Canada or in Saskatchewan.""The Health Ministry has updated its rules around people returning from China.Anyone entering the province who has recently been in Hubei province, the epicentre of the disease, is asked to isolate themselves for two weeks and to call the provincial Healthline.As well, anyone coming into Saskatchewan who has travelled to anywhere in China recently and is showing flu-like symptoms are also asked to isolate themselves for two weeks and to call provincial officials for more instructions.""That includes mild symptoms like a cough, fatigue, fever,"" said Shahab. ""The reason why we want to make these two recommendations is we obviously want to limit the importation of the spread of the novel coronavirus.""So far, there have been five confirmed cases of coronavirus across the country, two in Vancouver and three in Toronto.People without symptoms are less infectious; if a person is very sick they are more infectious. The province had a previous protocol for viruses like this but it has now refocused to make sure that people declare their travel history, Shahab said. "
Canada endangered health-care workers by failing to learn lessons from SARS: report | CBC News,"Canada put health-care workers at risk of contracting COVID-19 and taking it home to their families because it failed to learn lessons from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome in 2003, a new report says.",2020-10-05T14:10:38.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/covid19-health-workers-sars-1.5750439,"Canada put health-care workers at risk of contracting COVID-19 and taking it home to their families because it failed to learn lessons from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome in 2003, a new report says.Mario Possamai, who authored the report and was senior adviser to a two-year commission on SARS, outlines multiple shortcomings by the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC).The agency was established to respond to emerging infectious diseases after an early recommendation by the commission investigating how the SARS epidemic that killed 44 people arrived in Canada and spread, mostly in Ontario.Hundreds of people died of SARS elsewhere, including in China and Taiwan. However, Possamai says in the report released Monday that unlike Canada, those countries heeded the warnings from SARS, which he calls ""a dress rehearsal for COVID-19.""""In COVID-19, Canada is witnessing a systemic, preventable failure to learn from the 2003 SARS outbreak,"" he said. ""It is a failure to both adequately prepare and to urgently respond in a manner that is commensurate with the gravest public health emergency in a century.""Possamai says in the report, titled A Time of Fear: How Canada Failed Our Health-Care Workers and Mismanaged COVID-19, that the safety of workers, from those in long-term care homes to respiratory technicians and nurses and doctors in hospitals, has been ignored.It says union sources suggest 16 workers died in the pandemic, though official reports put the number at 12 deaths.Canada's infection rate among health-care workers is four times that of China, the report says.While other countries, including the United States, have fared worse than Canada in containing COVID-19, they managed to escape SARS and did not have the opportunity to learn from it, Possamai says in the report, which was commissioned by the Canadian Federation of Nurses' Unions to evaluate the first wave of the pandemic.WATCH | Calls for more accountability in long-term care homes:The National""A significant systemic problem during COVID-19, as it was during SARS, is that health-care workers and unions were not seen by governments and public health agencies as collaborative partners in setting safety guidelines and procedures,"" Possamai says, adding that is still the case as parts of Canada enter a second wave of the disease.Corinna Heieie is a nurse who works in a long-term care home in Winnipeg. She fears what another wave of COVID-19 could bring for herself and those under her care. ""The truth is, is that if I go out into the community and I get COVID, I'm going to go to work and I'm going to kill people that I love,"" Heieie said. ""The stress is real and it is heartbreaking.""Dr. Theresa Tam, Canada's chief public health officer, says while both the PHAC and her position were created because of SARS, she agrees pandemic preparedness needs to encompass more. ""We need to broaden pandemic preparedness going forward so it's not just public health and maybe hospitals,"" Tam said. ""It has to extend to long-term care,"" as well as home care workers and those employed in seniors' residences.Possamai says precious time was wasted as infections among health-care workers rose and the so-called precautionary principle, which aims to reduce risk of infection without waiting for scientific certainty, was not adopted as a lesson from the SARS commission.WATCH | What to keep in mind about communicating with a mask on:CBC News Nova ScotiaQuestions about whether COVID-19 was airborne resulted in some health-care workers being denied N95 respirators in place of surgical masks, and other personal protective equipment has also been lacking. The report says that was not the case in China, Hong Kong and Taiwan, which also endured SARS.Possamai makes several recommendations, including that:Linda Silas, president of the Canadian Federation of Nurses Unions, said it was only after pressure from nurses and doctors and ultimately from federal Health Minister Patti Hadju in February that the public health agency began weekly calls with the health sector, including psychologists and dentists, on guidelines.However, she said unions are still not involved in developing those guidelines and how they should be used in practice. ""That's the gist of the mistake,"" Silas said.""It is always a joint responsibility between the employer and the union,"" she said of occupational health and safety issues.Dr. Sandy Buchman, past president of the Canadian Medical Association who finished his one-year term in August, said he worked as a family doctor in Mississauga, Ont., during the SARS outbreak and remembers lining up to get into a hospital before being screened and wearing personal protective equipment when seeing patients.The level of anxiety among health-care workers now is no comparison to that outbreak, Buchman said, adding he was shocked to learn Canada did not have enough personal protective equipment for a pandemic after the SARS commission recommended to stockpile it.""What can I say? It's still kind of incomprehensible to me that we weren't prepared for a pandemic when it was ... such a thorough report,"" he said of the commission's findings, which were released in 2007.""My sense was, and it still is, that somehow the government expected front-line workers to put themselves in harm's way, without having adequate PPE. It's like expecting a firefighter to go into a burning building without the proper equipment to protect them."""

Beijing bristles as more countries bar travellers over coronavirus fears | CBC News,"Despite imposing drastic travel restrictions at home, China has chafed at those imposed by foreign governments, criticizing Washington's order barring entry to most non-citizens who visited China in the past two weeks.",2020-02-01T10:56:49.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/coronavirus-pneumonia-china-briefing-1.5448784,"China's death toll from a new virus increased to 304 on Sunday amid warnings from the World Health Organization that other countries need to be prepared in the event the disease spreads among their populations.Meanwhile, six officials in the city of Huanggang — neighbouring the epicentre of Wuhan in Hubei province — have been fired over ""poor performance"" in handling the outbreak, the official Xinhua News Agency reported.It cited the mayor as saying the city's ""capabilities to treat the patients remained inadequate and there is a severe shortage in medical supplies such as protective suits and medical masks.""Figures from the National Health Commission showed an increase of 45 in the death toll and 2,590 in the number of cases for a total of 14,380, well above the number of those infected in in the 2002-03 outbreak of SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, which broke out in southern China before spreading worldwide.Despite imposing drastic travel restrictions at home, China has chafed at those imposed by foreign governments, criticizing Washington's order barring entry to most non-citizens who visited China in the past two weeks.Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced similar measures Saturday, following Japan and Singapore.South Korea and India flew hundreds of their citizens out of Wuhan, the city at the centre of an area where some 50 million people are prevented from leaving in a sweeping anti-virus effort. The evacuees went into a two-week quarantine. Indonesia also sent a plane.The virus' rapid spread in two months prompted the World Health Organization on Thursday to declare it a global emergency.That declaration ""flipped the switch"" from a cautious attitude to recommending governments prepare for the possibility the virus might spread, said the WHO representative in Beijing, Gauden Galea. Most cases reported so far have been people who visited China or their family members.The agency acted out of concern for poorer countries that might not be equipped to respond, said Galea. Such a declaration calls for a coordinated international response and can bring more money and resources.WHO said it was especially concerned that some cases abroad involved human-to-human transmission.""Countries need to get ready for possible importation in order to identify cases as early as possible and in order to be ready for a domestic outbreak control, if that happens,"" Galea told The Associated Press.Watch: Construction of two coronavirus hospitals in China nears completionCBC NewsThe United States declared a public health emergency on Friday and President Donald Trump signed an order barring entry to foreign nationals who visited China within the last 14 days, which scientists say is the virus' longest incubation period. The restrictions don't apply to immediate family of American citizens and permanent residents.China criticized the U.S. controls and ""unfriendly comments"" alleging that Beijing was failing to co-operate.""Just as the WHO recommended against travel restrictions, the U.S. rushed to go in the opposite way. Certainly not a gesture of goodwill,"" said foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying.Australia, Germany, Japan, South Korea, the United Arab Emirates, the United States and Vietnam all reported new cases Saturday. Spain confirmed its first case — a German man who had close contact with an infected person in Germany and then traveled to the Canary Islands with friends. Four friends who were hospitalized with him have not shown symptoms.Both the new virus and SARS are from the coronavirus family, which also includes those that cause the common cold.The death rate in China is falling, but the number of confirmed cases will keep growing because thousands of specimens from suspected cases have yet to be tested, WHO's Galea said.""The case fatality ratio is settling out at a much lower level than we were reporting three, now four, weeks ago,"" he said.Although scientists expect to see limited transmission of the virus between people with family or other close contacts, they are concerned about cases of infection spreading to people who might have less exposure.Canada has four confirmed cases of cornavirus. The Public Health Agency of Canada, which is working alongside provinces and territories to monitor the novel coronavirus, says the risk to Canadians is low. Watch: What we actually know about the coronavirusCBC News"
P.E.I. selects 626 newcomers as PNP kicks back into gear | CBC News,"From June through August, P.E.I. selected 626 immigrants to sponsor for permanent residency through its provincial nominee program, which had been dormant in the early months of the pandemic.",2020-09-18T21:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-covid-pnp-provincial-nominee-1.5729563,"An immigration program which has boosted P.E.I.'s economy and population — but has also been a near-constant source of political controversy — is picking up speed again after languishing during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic.P.E.I.'s Office of Immigration held eight draws through its provincial nominee program from June 10 through Aug. 20, offering to sponsor 626 immigrants in their applications to become permanent residents of Canada.But the province says close to 90 per cent of those immigrants were already working and living on P.E.I. through various employment-related visa programs when their names were drawn.""Since June, our programs have been picking up the draw numbers,"" said Jamie Aiken, executive director of the P.E.I. Office of Immigration.""We're trying to pick up individuals through our labour streams that are already here working,"" Aiken said. ""A lot of these individuals have work permits that they're here working underneath, and now they're transitioning to try and apply for permanent residency.""Aiken said those workers are employed in the service industry, in health care, manufacturing and in trucking. He said they come from many countries, but predominantly India, the Philippines, Vietnam and China. In most cases he said their family members are already living here.Compared to the 626 candidates invited from June through August, the province issued a total of just 48 invitations from March through May, according to figures posted on the province's website.In the six months leading up to March, the province was averaging 141 invitations per month.Among the new immigrants the province is offering to sponsor are 77 potential immigrant investors who would be required to operate a business on P.E.I. Aiken said all of those applicants are currently living overseas, but that it would be months before their applications to enter the country are processed by the federal government.""So we may not actually see an applicant for upwards to 12 months who we would invite in the month of August,"" he said.While Canada has closed its borders to many international travellers, there are exceptions which allow provincial nominees to enter the country if they have a work permit and are able to self-isolate for 14 days.Aiken said since the start of the pandemic, approximately 75 people have arrived on P.E.I. from overseas to become permanent residents through the PNP, mostly essential workers employed in health care or the trucking industry.P.E.I.'s Chief Public Health Officer Dr. Heather Morrison has repeatedly warned the primary risk of introducing COVID-19 to the Island comes from those entering from outside the Atlantic bubble. Government says all 57 cases recorded on the Island so far have been travel-related. As of Tuesday, government reported only one active case of the disease in the province.But Morrison has also often referred to the requirement that those coming to P.E.I. from outside the Atlantic bubble self-isolate for 14 days, crediting that requirement for the lack of community spread of COVID-19 in the province.When asked about the potential risks of resuming immigration programs during the pandemic, Morrison said those decisions ""are almost made at a federal level.… It's really, from my perspective, trying to figure out once those decisions are made, how we can do it safely.""The P.E.I. government administers its own provincial nominee program, under the oversight and within parameters approved by the federal government.""As we ease back and learn to live with COVID and those [immigration] streams begin to open up a little bit more broadly in the future, the big question would be just around making sure that we have that self-isolation in place,"" said Premier Dennis King.""As a province we need immigration. We depend on growing our population through many streams, including immigration,"" King said. ""And even though we're in a worldwide health pandemic, that has to remain a focus for the long term, and it will."""

The story was first reported by The Globe and Mail.Champagne said he disclosed the two mortgages to the ethics commissioner when he entered politics in 2015, that they were part of the public record, and that neither of the mortgages ever had any bearing on his job.Before Champagne entered politics, he lived and worked in London and bought two apartments in 2009 and 2013, which he continues to own and rent. His office has said the London branch of the Bank of China, (UK) Ltd. was one of a limited number of lenders that would give mortgages to people living in Britain on temporary work visas, as Champagne was at the time."
Economic bounce-back depends on quick resolution of epidemic: Don Pittis | CBC News,"A global recession would likely kill more people than the coronavirus, a Canadian expert says.",2020-02-18T09:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/covid-19-coronavirus-china-canada-1.5464012,"For people who have lost loved ones to COVID-19, the disease that has swept parts of China and may have gained a foothold elsewhere, the global economic impact is likely the least of their concerns.But with the world economy already hovering near what the International Monetary Fund considers to be recessionary levels, a significant global slowdown would be about more than money. And one of the biggest considerations is whether the economic impact of the disease will be ephemeral or lasting.Widely described as the biggest current threat to global growth, the coronavirus, and perhaps more important the things governments are doing to prevent it from spreading, could yet push the world below the recession line.That is one of the reasons why experts like Richard Schabas, Ontario's former chief medical officer, worry that draconian measures that stoke fear in the population do more harm than good.""Recessions kill people, in fact will probably kill more people than this virus does,"" he told CBC News host Michael Serapio last week. Here in the wealth and safety of Canada it may be hard to fathom, but in a globally integrated economy a few dollars less a month can mean life or death to people struggling for food and medicine. That's easier to comprehend when you think that the World Health Organization estimates about six million children a year die preventable deaths, usually associated with poverty.WATCH: Ontario's ex-chief medical officer says a recession could kill more people than the coronavirus:World""Our world has become so interconnected,"" says Jia Wang, deputy director of the University of Alberta's China Institute.Wang suggests that the next few weeks will be critical, showing whether the epidemic, with its global economic impact, is moderating or getting worse. Early reports that the spread of the disease was slowing were cast into doubt last week when China reported 5,000 new cases and global deaths leapt past 1,500.Fear and government restrictions mean people in China have been staying home, slashing the business of retailers and restaurants. Some reports say property sales are down by more than 80 per cent, affecting a business that represents about one-quarter of China's gross domestic product.Wang says that while the country's giant companies are big enough to outlast the crisis, especially with government help, a significant and dynamic part of China's economy is based on much smaller businesses that could disappear, leading to lingering economic effects.""If the quarantines and shutdowns of many cities around China continue for a few more months or even just one month, many of the smaller companies may not survive,"" she said.Wang says there are also worries that the coronavirus and its economic effect will spread outside China. Last Friday, Singapore's president, Lee Hsien Loong. warned the disease could push that country into recession.Putting a figure on the global impact is not easy, and estimates of the damage vary widely. Oxford Economics says global growth will fall to 2.3 per cent in 2020, the lowest level in more than 10 years and below the IMF's global recession level.Last week Canada's Parliamentary Budget Office suggested the epidemic would eat into Canada's growth rate in the first three months of the year chopping off 0.3 percentage points.That worries Brian Kingston from the Business Council of Canada, especially when no one knows when the crisis will end.""And remember that China is our second most important export destination,"" Kingston told Piya Chattopadhyay on CBC Radio's Metro Morning.BMO economist Jennifer Lee says the bank has again downgraded the Chinese economy due to fading optimism that the country can get its factories geared up as soon as it had hoped. ""We've shaved Q1 and Q2 growth,"" said Lee, ""given how long the shutdowns are lasting.""Lee says the bank still expects China to rebound from the economic malaise, though BMO now puts Chinese full-year growth for 2020 at 5.3 per cent. That is far below the previous consensus that China would grow this year at between six and 6.5 per cent.But Lee says it is common for economies to rebound even after the sharpest decline. For example, a month of storms may mean Canadians stay home from the shops, but the money they didn't spend in one month they can spend in the next, causing what looks like a boom.That depends on how much damage is done and whether it can heal. And Lee says the duration of any interruption in business makes all the difference. She says that after the SARS outbreak in 2003, the Canadian economy bounced back with very little overall damage.""I don't think anyone has any idea of whether or not this is going to be resolved any time soon,"" said Lee.Just as in the recent trade war, uncertainty may be having a paralyzing effect on businesses that are waiting to see whether the availability of parts and the demand for copper and Canada Goose coats will bounce back before firms are forced to completely change their strategies. For some businesses, even a speedy recuperation of the global economy may not wash away the business impact of COVID-19. The special deals already being offered by cruise lines for summer packages may not be enough to cleanse the lingering image of people being trapped for days on a plague ship in windowless rooms in what for many became floating prisons.Follow Don on Twitter @don_pittis"

"I want my baby to grow up proud of her heritage. But with rising anti-Chinese racism, I'm struggling | CBC Radio",Lisa Xing wants to raise her child with pride in her Chinese heritage in spite of a surge in anti-Chinese racism due to COVID-19.,2020-10-03T09:01:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/radio/docproject/from-afar-1.5710871/i-want-my-baby-to-grow-up-proud-of-her-heritage-but-with-rising-anti-chinese-racism-i-m-struggling-1.5710879,"My parents immigrated to Canada from China in their thirties. I came when I was five. So I thought they would be honoured when I bestowed upon them the responsibility of giving their granddaughter a name. A Chinese name. To my surprise (and dismay), I realized just how much they were against this child having a Chinese name. They said the first name should be easy to pronounce.Finally, after my daughter was born on September 29, 2020, my partner Nathan and I settled on Minmin, pronounced ""Ming Ming"". The first Min means ""fall"", the second Min, ""easygoing"" and ""gentle"". It was my mom's suggestion, after she gave in to my pleas.Not only do I think it's user friendly, it's beautiful written in Chinese as 旻旼. Both words using the same two radicals (parts that form a character), just rearranged differently. The choice of my child's name is just one way I am trying to instill a sense of pride in her Chinese heritage. I want her to embrace it, even though anti-Chinese racism has been on the rise since COVID-19.My partner, Nathan, is white. He grew up on a tobacco farm in southwestern Ontario. Our baby is biracial. Throughout the pregnancy, we often talked about how she would look, how I'll manage to get her to speak Mandarin (as I am just a basic speaker myself), and the responsibility of choosing a name that would inevitably play a role in shaping her identity. But although we went ahead and named her Minmin, the current social and political climate has wedged some fear into my mind. It's not treatment from kids on the playground that worries me. It's the recent resurgence of racism that is different to the kind of intolerance I experienced as a child. Trump calls COVID-19 the ""China virus."" And since the coronavirus outbreak, there has been widespread racism against Chinese people, since the virus originated in Wuhan, China. I hate to say it, but in this context, something as superficial as looking more ""white"" or having an English name could spare my daughter a lot of pain. While I know she could get by easier by blending in, this hate also stirred up a defiance in me that made me want to instill that pride in being Chinese even more, so she can have a bulletproof attitude, as Nathan says, and so that none of it will bother her the way it bothered me. I wasn't always called ""Lisa."" My Chinese name is Yaxi (pronounced Ya-shee). That's what I went by as a child growing up in Hamilton, Ont. Everyone butchered it, intentionally or otherwise. Some called me ""Taxi"" or ""Yucky"". So the summer before high school, my best friend – who also had a difficult-for-North-Americans-to-pronounce name, Yiqing – and I decided to change our names. After fighting with my parents to let me change mine to ""Melanie,"" a cringe-worthy homage to Mel B of the Spice Girls, I finally relented and we went with ""Lisa,"" the English name my dad had chosen for me when I first came to Canada. Yiqing chose ""Myra."" The name change took some getting used to, though ultimately, it made life easier. But some time after university, I started realizing just how unique my Chinese name was: Ya, the last part of my mom's name, and Xi, which means ""dawn."" After my own experiences, and the ensuing struggle with my parents over my daughter's name, I hope Minmin will embrace it. I want her to be defiant and proud and confident. And I hope she won't take as long as I did to get there.  "

Trump suspends funding to WHO pending review over handling of coronavirus | CBC News,U.S. President Donald Trump says he has directed a halt to the country's payments to the World Health Organization pending a review of its warnings about the coronavirus and China.,2020-04-14T22:32:40.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/coronavirus-trump-who-funding-1.5532324,"U.S. President Donald Trump says he has directed a halt to U.S. payments to the World Health Organization (WHO) pending a review of its warnings about the coronavirus and China.Trump said at a White House news conference on Tuesday the outbreak could have been contained at its source and spared lives had the UN health agency done a better job investigating reports coming out of China.He said the world depends on the WHO to work with countries to make sure accurate information about health threats are shared in a timely manner.""The WHO failed in its basic duty and must be held accountable,"" Trump said at the briefing. He said the U.S. would be reviewing the WHO's actions to stop the virus before making any decision on resuming aid.There was no immediate comment from the Geneva-based organization, but when asked about possible U.S. funding cuts during a regular UN briefing earlier Tuesday, WHO spokeswoman Margaret Harris responded, ""Regardless of any issues, our work will go on.""Trump said the U.S. will continue to engage with the WHO in pursuit of ""meaningful reforms.""""We're doing a very thorough investigation as we speak,"" he told reporters, saying it would take about 60 to 90 days.""[The WHO] is very China-centric,"" he said, adding, it's ""not right."" The United States contributed nearly $900 million US to the WHO's budget for 2018-19, according to information on the agency's website. That represents one-fifth of its total $4.4 billion budget for those years. The U.S. gave nearly three-fourths of the funds in ""specified voluntary contributions"" and the rest in ""assessed"" funding as part of Washington's commitment to UN institutions.A more detailed WHO budget document provided by the U.S. mission in Geneva showed that in 2019, the U.S. provided $452 million, including nearly $119 million in assessed funding. In its most recent budget proposal from February, the Trump administration called for slashing the U.S. assessed funding contribution to the WHO to $57.9 million.Last week, the head of the WHO gave a strident defence of his agency's handling of the pandemic after Trump threatened to halt WHO funding. Director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus repeatedly called for unity and a halt to ""politicization"" of the global health crisis.Tedros, a former foreign minister of Ethiopia, also rejected Trump's suggestion that the WHO was ""China-centric,"" saying: ""We are close to every nation, we are colour-blind.""Trump himself showed deference to China at the beginning stages of the outbreak.""China has been working very hard to contain the Coronavirus,"" he tweeted on Jan. 24. ""The United States greatly appreciates their efforts and transparency. It will all work out well. In particular, on behalf of the American People, I want to thank President Xi!"""
'I had tears running down my face': Fredericton couple happy to be back in Canada | CBC News,"Despite having to deal with another quarantine, David and Patricia Strang say they are happy to be back on Canadian soil.",2020-02-22T21:23:26.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/nb-fredericton-cruise-ship-couple-diamond-princess-coronavirus-1.5472720,"Despite having to deal with another quarantine, Fredericton's David and Patricia Strang say they are happy to be back on Canadian soil. ""When the plane landed in Trenton the people on the plane clapped and I had tears running down my face because I was so happy to be in Canada,"" Patricia Strang said Saturday when reached by phone. The Strangs were among thousands of passengers stranded aboard the cruise ship Diamond Princess in Yokohama, Japan since Feb. 3 because of the Coronavirus COVID-19.Over 600 passengers on the ship contracted the virus. Two people have died. The Strangs arrived at CFB Trenton on a government chartered plane Friday at 8 a.m.""We're supposed to be cruising the coast of Australia right now,"" said David Strang. CBC News OttawaInstead, the couple, along about 129 other Canadian passengers, are at the NAV Canada Training Institute in Cornwall, Ont., a 2½-hour drive from Trenton, under another another 14-day quarantine and adjusting to another time zone.""We've never felt sick through this whole period. No, we're fine. You're confined to what you can do and that kind of thing.""   David said they are anxious to get back home, though. He said once they do get back to Fredericton they plan to stay put for a few weeks to enjoy some freedom and a normal life. While under quarantine on the cruise ship, passengers were confined to their rooms. Staff would deliver meals.David said they are permitted to go outside for walks at the training institute but they have to stay two metres away from other people. ""It's pretty much the same quarantine we had on the ship only we're on land now."" The couple even joked they haven't irritated each other despite spending so much time together. Patricia said they travel together about 150 days per year so they are used to being together.""This wasn't terrible or anything [because] when we go away for a long period of time it's just us."" While the couple expressed frustration at how some things have been handled, David said he knows governments in various countries were dealing with a situation that was changing daily and new things were being learned all the time. ""I think the cruise line was good to us overall."" Patricia said she wished they would have been put under quarantine as soon as it was discovered that the first passenger had coronavirus. ""The whole time that we were quarantined I was scared. I mean I was really scared even though I kept that to myself most of the time."" Patricia said she was scared they'd get sick and end up in a Japanese hospital, where there might be a language barrier.Then, when the crew on the cruise ship started getting sick, Strang became more worried. ""The crews were the ones bringing us our trays of food, making our food and everything else.""She said it wasn't until the last two days of the quarantine that they started to get their food from an outside source. While spending a month in quarantine is a first, the couple have had a few other close calls and adventures during their travels. There was Norovirus found on cruise ships they've been on but neither got infected. On a trip in 2010 they had to spend an extra nine days in Prague after a volcano erupted in Iceland and disrupted air travel. Patricia said being able to stay in touch with their family and friends through social media has helped immensely. ""There's been so many of my friends and David's friends that have been praying for us and I think it's been working.""The total number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in China surpassed 76,000 Saturday, according to China's National Health Commission. More than 2,300 have died. "
Impact of COVID-19 on Canadian businesses delayed - but it's coming | CBC News,"North American manufacturers and retailers haven't yet experienced widespread disruptions from the coronavirus outbreak. But contingency plans are in effect for industries that use Chinese suppliers — which, these days, means a lot of different businesses.",2020-03-08T08:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/coronavirus-supply-chains-1.5488730,"North American manufacturers and retailers haven't yet experienced widespread disruptions from the coronavirus outbreak. But contingency plans are in effect for industries that use Chinese suppliers — which, these days, means a lot of different businesses.China was Canada's second biggest source of imports in 2019, trailing far behind the U.S. (which supplies half of what Canada buys) but supplying more than double the imports from Mexico or any European or Asian country. And a lot of those American products are made with Chinese supplies, too.What happens if closed factories and transport restrictions in China mean all those products stop shipping to North America for a while?""It's a unique challenge, in the sense that businesses are facing both supply and demand issues at the same time,"" Finance Minister Bill Morneau told a Toronto business audience Friday, as he previewed at his government's plan to mitigate the possible recessionary effects of the now-global outbreak.""There's certainly reduced supply already, so we are thinking about how we help the business sector.""Hard data pinpointing those supply disruptions is hard to find.Goods from the U.S. arrive overnight, but shipping containers from China take weeks to land — long enough that products from factories that failed to reopen after the annual Lunar New Year shutdown may not even be missed yet. Goods shipped before the Jan. 25 holiday could reach North American destinations over the next two weeks.Many businesses that rely on Chinese suppliers know to stock up before the holiday, so serious shortages in Canada may not emerge until later this month or next. On the other hand, recent disruptions in Canadian rail shipping may already have forced some facilities to dip into their reserves.Even if a Chinese supplier was able to reopen, the Chinese trucking industry is not operating at regular capacity and may not be for weeks to come. Logistics operators have been hard-pressed to get official permission to ship out non-essential goods.The Port of Vancouver — its normal cargo already disrupted by rail blockades and poor weather — reports 30 cancelled sailings of container vessels so far due to the reduced workforce and cargo-loading activities at Chinese ports. Total container volumes already were down about 13 per cent in January.What was supposed to be in all those stacks of now-stalled shipping containers, heading for Canadian factories or stores? Canada's top imports from China include electronics, machinery, furniture, toys and sporting goods and plastics. At the peak of Chinese efforts to control the COVID-19 outbreak, factories making 80 per cent of Chinese exports were shut down.Early reports from the port of Los Angeles — another major gateway to the continent's manufacturing sector and retail distribution networks — suggest a 25 per cent drop in volumes in February. But that doesn't necessarily spell immediate disaster.""Inventories both on the wholesale and the manufacturing side, in Canada and the U.S., as a ratio to sales, are at near-record levels,"" said Brett House, deputy chief economist at Scotiabank Economics. ""There's been a lot of stockpiling in Canada and the U.S. well before the coronavirus was identified, and that provides a bit of a cushion ... you have a lot of inventory piles that you can draw down.""Those inventory piles are not necessarily matched with what needs are at any given time, so it doesn't mean that everything is seamless. But it does mean that an immediate drop in imports into our West Coast ports doesn't translate immediately into supply chains being gummed up.""Business associations like the Canadian Manufacturers and Exporters told CBC News this week their members were already experiencing supply chain disruptions.Production shutdowns and layoffs are a last resort, but alternative suppliers aren't always available on short notice — which can force some facilities to slow down temporarily. Several groups said they were surveying their members and taking stock to figure out how serious things look.Approximately 10 per cent of Canadian imports of intermediate products — goods destined for Canadian plants to be made into something else — come from China. That seems like a low number — but don't be too comforted by it.""Our business is kind of funny. You're building everything just in time and a very small part can stop a line,"" said Flavio Volpe, president of the Automotive Parts Manufacturer's Association. ""You're building a complete car in sequence, so every part has to be there.""Shipping logistics dictate that larger, more complex automotive parts come from facilities that are geographically close to final assembly plants. Parts from China are usually electronics, or smaller commodity goods like clips, fasteners or seals.""We've now tipped into our contingency planning — where can you re-source?"" Volpe said.Usually there are other options within North America, or perhaps in other low-cost jurisdictions in Asia or Europe — suppliers that may look more appealing after the tariff cuts in Canada's recent trade agreements. But Volpe said the cost of replacing some Chinese goods might be double.""We always have Plan B and Plan C on the books. The reason that you operate on Plan A is it's the most efficient one from a cost perspective,"" said Volpe. ""The coronavirus is not causing anyone to stop production yet, but it is making us incur additional costs. Costs we have to eat.""For now, ""it's business as usual, except that business has increased costs and stress in it,"" he said. But if it goes deeper or longer than currently anticipated, companies will re-evaluate.Over the last 20 years or so, the rewards for incurring the risks of switching to offshore Chinese suppliers have been ""very good"" for commoditized goods, Volpe said. But ""if a SUV plant was shut down because of some clips, there'd be a pretty quick correction in all that.""Any rethinking in the automotive industry will coincide with the expected implementation of the revised North American trade agreement, which requires 75 per cent North American parts for tariff-free trade.""You're doubly incentivized,"" Volpe said. ""It doesn't make sense to make clips in a factory in Ontario, but it might in Chihuahua (Mexico).""  "

It also plans at its Nov. 19 meeting to vote to ask carriers how much it would cost to remove and replace Huawei and ZTE from existing networks and to establish a reimbursement program to offset the costs of removing the equipment.""When it comes to 5G and America's security, we can't afford to take a risk and hope for the best,"" Federal Communications Commission chairman Ajit Pai said in a statement.""As the United States upgrades its networks to the next generation of wireless technologies — 5G — we cannot ignore the risk that the Chinese government will seek to exploit network vulnerabilities in order to engage in espionage, insert malware and viruses, and otherwise compromise our critical communications networks.""This is the latest in a series of actions by the U.S. government aimed at barring U.S. companies from purchasing Huawei and ZTE equipment. Huawei and ZTE would have 30 days to contest the FCC's national security risk designation.Huawei and ZTE did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Pai first proposed in March 2018 barring companies that posed a national security risk from receiving funds from the FCC's Universal Service Fund, but did not name Huawei or ZTE.

The order directed the Commerce Department, working with other government agencies, to draw up an enforcement plan by mid-October. The Commerce Department has yet to publish a plan.The U.S. government added Huawei to its economic blacklist in May, saying the Chinese company was involved in activities contrary to U.S. national security.U.S. officials are also trying to secure the extradition from British Columbia of the daughter of Huawei's founder and CEO, Ren Zhengfei.Meng Wanzou is accused of misleading banks about Huawei's relationship with a hidden subsidiary accused of attempting to sell U.S. telecommunications equipment to Iran.She was arrested in Vancouver on Dec. 1, 2018."

Canada won't follow U.S. and declare national emergency over coronavirus: health minister | CBC News,Health Minister Patty Hajdu said Friday Canada is not ready to declare a national emergency over the coronavirus outbreak.,2020-01-31T14:26:20.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/champagne-coronavirus-airlift-china-1.5447130,"Health Minister Patty Hajdu said Friday Canada is not ready to declare a national emergency over the coronavirus outbreak.She said the current evidence doesn't justify such a declaration — or restrictions on the movement of foreign nationals into the country like the ones the United States imposed on Friday.""We've been following closely the recommendations of the World Health Organization,"" Hajdu said in an interview with CBC's Power & Politics.Hajdu said Health Canada maintains there is no evidence that the virus can be transmitted by people who are asymptomatic — who have no symptoms — despite a German report suggesting otherwise.If the disease can be spread by people without symptoms, it will be much harder for authorities to contain it. If people are contagious before they become sick, they could be spreading the virus without knowing it.""We're comfortable that we're completely up to date in terms of our approach and what the science says. There is a very low risk to Canadians,"" Hajdu said.The U.S. declared a public health emergency Friday in response to the coronavirus, which has sickened nearly 10,000 people worldwide.The Americans also will temporarily ban foreign nationals from entering the country if they have traveled in China over the preceding 14 days. Major U.S. airlines such as Delta and American have cancelled all flights to mainland China until the end of March. Air Canada already has suspended its flights to Beijing and Shanghai until the end of February.Asked why Canada is taking a different approach, Hajdu said she ""can't speculate"" about why the U.S. chose this route.She said she's ""extremely comfortable"" with the leadership of Chief Public Health Officer Theresa Tam and the other officials leading Canada's response.Foreign Affairs Minister François-Philippe Champagne spoke with his Chinese counterpart last night as Canada pursues a plan to bring home Canadians from the ​coronavirus-affected region in China.""Minister Champagne expressed his solidarity with the people of China suffering from the outbreak and offered Canada's assistance.

State Department says U.S. will reassess intelligence-sharing with Canada if it lets Huawei into 5G | CBC News,"The United States is prepared to reassess its intelligence-sharing arrangement with Canada if Huawei is given the green light to take part in building Canada's 5G networks, a State Department spokesperson said today.",2020-06-04T23:12:15.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/huawei-5g-state-department-trudeau-china-1.5598548,"The United States is prepared to reassess its intelligence-sharing arrangement with Canada if Huawei is given the green light to take part in building Canada's 5G networks, a State Department spokesperson said today.The federal government still has not announced its decision on whether the Chinese telecom giant will be allowed to participate in building Canada's next-generation wireless networks, despite more than a year and a half of assessing the question.""We in the U.S. government have made it very clear to all of our friends and allies around the world that if Huawei is allowed into a country's national security systems, we will have to protect our intelligence-sharing relationship,"" Morgan Ortagus, spokesperson for the U.S. State Department, told CBC News today.""We'll have to make an assessment if we can continue sharing intelligence with countries who have Huawei inside their most sensitive technology, in their most sensitive national security areas.""We think that the Canadian government will make their own sovereign decisions and what's best for Canada's national security.""Watch: Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Huawei and 5GPolitics News""Every step of the way, we have listened to our security agencies, our intelligence agencies, worked with our allies,"" Trudeau said in response to a reporter's question today. ""We will make the right decision for Canadians to both keep Canadians and businesses safe while at the same time ensuring competitiveness in our telecom industry.""Some private companies aren't waiting for Ottawa to make a decision. Bell and Telus announced yesterday that they would not be working with Huawei as they pursue their 5G plans. Instead, both are opting to use equipment from European companies Ericsson and Nokia.Washington has long argued that Huawei poses a national security threat because the Chinese government has the power to compel private companies like Huawei to hand over sensitive information. Huawei's critics say they fear the company would conduct espionage on behalf of Beijing.Contacted by CBC News, Huawei's VP for corporate affairs in Canada said State's ""threats"" are consistent with ""the Trump administration's preference for bullying and coercing rivals and allies alike. """"Huawei has operated in Canada for more than a decade without a single security incident related to our equipment. Not one,"" said Alykhan Velshi. ""We look forward to the Government of Canada making an evidence-based decision on Huawei's role in Canada's 5G rollout.""This decision should be made by, in, and for Canada, not Donald Trump's Washington.""In recent weeks, while much of the world has been focused on the pandemic's rising death toll, Washington has announced new measures aimed at curbing Huawei's global influence.On May 15, the U.S. Department of Commerce changed its export control rules to restrict ""... Huawei's ability to use U.S. technology and software to design and manufacture its semiconductors abroad.""The move is meant to make it harder for Huawei to obtain the supplies it needs, to significantly raise its operating costs and to force the company to rely on goods that may be less reliable and more vulnerable.As a middle power, Canada often has found itself taking collateral diplomatic damage from tensions between U.S. and China, as both superpowers fight to become the global leader in technology.That damage started ramping up in December of 2018, when Canada arrested Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou on a U.S. extradition request.Beijing immediately demanded her release and executed swift retaliatory actions. Two Canadians — Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor — were arbitrarily detained in China; they've been held for more than 500 days. Beijing took trade action as well, halting large purchases of Canadian canola and, for a time, Canadian pork.Ortagus condemned China's imprisonment of the two Canadians. She said U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has brought this issue up regularly during high-profile meetings with his Chinese counterparts.   ""The United States, we're taking a lot of actions, doing everything we can behind the scenes with the Canadian government,"" she said.  Asked if the United States might deploy sanctions to pressure China to release the two men, Ortagus said ""we're not going to preview any public actions that we may take."""

"Fed stands pat, keeps benchmark U.S. interest rate steady | CBC News",The Federal Reserve kept its benchmark interest rate unchanged at a low level Wednesday amid an economy that looks solid but faces potential global threats.,2020-01-29T19:14:41.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/federal-reserve-interest-rate-1.5444744,"The Federal Reserve kept its benchmark interest rate unchanged at a low level Wednesday amid an economy that looks solid but faces potential global threats.The Fed sketched a mostly positive picture of the U.S. economy in the statement it released after its latest policy meeting. It also repeated its pledge to ""monitor"" the world economy, which may be held back in the coming months by China's viral outbreak. Stock and bond markets have gyrated in the past week over fears about the virus.The central bank said it would hold short-term rates in a range of 1.5 to 1.75 per cent, far below levels that have been typical during previous expansions. Chairman Jerome Powell and other Fed officials have indicated that they see that range as low enough to support faster growth and hiring.Stock prices rose modestly after the Fed issued its statement at 2 p.m. Eastern time. The Fed's statement was nearly identical to the one it issued after its December meeting, though it described consumer spending as rising at only a ""moderate"" rather than at a ""strong"" pace. That change likely reflects relatively modest spending by Americans over the winter holidays.Last year, the Fed cut its benchmark interest rate three times after having raised it four times in 2018. Powell and other Fed officials credit those rate cuts with revitalizing the housing market, which had stumbled early last year, and offsetting some of the drag from President Donald Trump's trade war with China.Many economists and investors had hoped that U.S. and global growth would pick up this year, now that the U.S. and China have signed a preliminary trade deal that removed some tariffs on Chinese goods. Indeed, the International Monetary Fund said last week that low interest rates and reduced trade tensions would likely buoy the global economy over the next two years and help nurture steady if modest growth.But China's viral outbreak has injected fresh doubts into that outlook. The coronavirus has in effect shut down much of that nation and seems sure to slow the Chinese economy — the world's second-largest — which had already been decelerating. The virus has now infected more people in China than were sickened in the country by the SARS outbreak in 2002-2003.Major companies across the world have responded by suspending some operations in China. Starbucks said it plans to close half its stores in China, its second-largest market. British Airways has halted all flights to China, and American Airlines suspended Los Angeles flights to and from Shanghai and Beijing.Hotels, airlines, casinos and cruise operators are among the industries that have suffered the most immediate repercussions, especially in countries close to China. Apple CEO Tim Cook said the company's suppliers in China have been forced to delay the re-opening of factories that have closed for the Chinese New Year holiday until Feb. 10.Investors seem increasingly to believe that the Fed will feel compelled to cut rates again later this year. The chances of a cut by September's Fed meeting have risen to about 56 per cent, according to the Chicago Mercantile Exchange's FedWatch tool, up from 37 per cent just a month ago.Still, the Fed will likely wait to see how last year's rate cuts play out. Among other benefits, the cuts have helped drive down mortgage rates and led home buyers to bid up prices on a dwindling number of available properties. Home sales jumped in December and were nearly 11% higher than a year earlier.Since they last met in December, Fed officials have presented a nearly unified front in support of keeping rates unchanged, possibly for the rest of this year. That contrasts with last year, when both ""hawks,"" who tend to favour higher rates, and ""doves,"" who typically lean toward lower rates, occasionally dissented from the Fed's rate decisions.The Fed's decision came a day after President Donald Trump urged Fed chair Jerome Powell to cut rates in a tweet, arguing it would make U.S. interest rates ""competitive with other Countries."" Yet the Fed hopes to avoid the ultra-low and negative interest rates that exist in much of Europe and Japan, which they — and most analysts — see as evidence of weak economies.Most analysts think the Fed would be more willing to cut rates if there were clear signs of a sharp economic slowdown. Still, some Fed watchers say they foresee a rate cut by the summer or after November's elections.One reason for a potential future cut is that inflation remains chronically low. According to the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, prices rose just 1.5 per cent in November from a year earlier, below the central bank's 2 per cent annual target. Since the Fed adopted that target in 2012, inflation has failed to consistently reach that high, to the surprise of the Fed and most economists."

"Canada distinguishes itself in military actions but could do more for NATO, says former NATO commander | CBC News","Former NATO supreme allied commander James Stavridis tells Power & Politics that Canada punches above its weight on NATO missions, but the country could do more, especially on defence spending.",2018-07-12T00:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/former-nato-commander-canada-1.4744662,"Canada punches above its weight on NATO operations but should still spend more on defence, a former NATO supreme allied commander told CBC News Thursday.""We need our allies to spend two per cent. That is an achievable goal. The United States spends about 3.5 per cent of its GDP (on defence). We need that to get more in balance,"" retired U.S. Navy Admiral James Stavridis said in an interview with host Vassy Kapelos on CBC News Network's Power & Politics Thursday.NATO member countries pledged in 2014 to move toward a defence spending target of two per cent of GDP by 2024. Canada's defence spending was estimated at 1.36 per cent of GDP in 2017 and is only expected to rise to 1.4 per cent by 2024.Stavridis, who is also dean of The Fletcher School at Tufts University, said it's unfortunate that Canada will not hit the alliance target, but acknowledged something he learned from his own time as a NATO commander — that Canada's military performs with distinction, fighting bravely in Afghanistan, Libya and Iraq, and at sea on counter-piracy missions.""Canada has always been there with the United States and has always been there with NATO,"" said Stavridis. ""I would like to see that hit that level. I think it would be salutary for the alliance.""At the end of the day, however, I know that the relations between the United States and Canada militarily are going to continue to be superb.""Politics NewsU.S. President Donald Trump hammered NATO allies on defence spending at the alliance's summit in Brussels this week. The combative leader closed out the summit by claiming that member nations caved to his demand for a significant increase in their defence spending.That claim was immediately refuted by French President Emmanuel Macron, who pointed out to journalists that the alliance communique released Wednesday recommitted NATO members to hitting the two per cent target by 2024 — a commitment they made in 2014, two years before Trump was elected.Also responding to Trump's claim, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told reporters at his closing press conference that Canada hadn't committed to spending any new money on defence.Stavridis said he thinks it's probably in Canada's interest to invest in better interoperability capabilities with other allied forces — but at the end of the day the decision to increase defence spending is ultimately up to Canadians, not Americans.Trump closed out the tumultuous two-day summit by reaffirming the United States' commitment to the nearly 70-year-old alliance and signing the joint declaration, despite spending much of the summit berating allies over defence spending and accusing Germany of being beholden to Russia because it buys Russian natural gas.""You've heard about a bull in a china shop. We've just seen a bull in a NATO shop and a lot of china got broken, I think particularly between the United States and Germany. That's very unfortunate,"" said Stavridis.Politics NewsThe retired admiral said that he thinks Trump's stated commitment to NATO and the signing of the declaration shows the alliance is holding together — for now.""I think crisis averted as in an immediate crisis, but I think there's long-term structural, fundamental creaking of that transatlantic bridge. On one side, the United States and Canada. On the other side, twenty-seven European allies. You just feel it kind of creaking in the wake of the commentary from President Trump.""Watch Power & Politics' full interview with retired Admiral James Stavridis below."

Making tea in townships a part of heritage | CBC News,"The Uplands Cultural and Heritage Centre in Sherbrooke, Que., is gathering stories of tea-drinking rituals from anglophones in the Eastern Townships, to include their oral histories in future exhibits.",2018-04-06T16:55:41.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/heritage-centre-documents-tea-drinking-tradition-in-quebec-s-eastern-townships-1.4607849,"One of Jane Loiselle's first childhood memories is sipping afternoon tea from china cups with her grandmother and being allowed a cookie to go with it.""My first time serving tea was as a Brownie,"" she said. ""We all wore our uniforms, and we served all the teas in town.""At the end of that afternoon, Loiselle recalls, she got to put a cube of sugar in her own cup of tea — a habit she's kept for more than 40 years.Loiselle's tea-time ritual is exactly the type of anecdote the Uplands Heritage and Cultural Centre wants to hear.The heritage house is home to the Lennoxville-Ascot Historical Museum, attracting close to 8,000 tourists and residents annually. Many stop in for a cup of tea and scones, served by staff dressed in period costume.Julie Marleau, who co-ordinates visitors' services at Uplands, said having a better idea of the history of tea in the region would add depth to that experience.Last year, the City of Sherbrooke officially recognized tea drinking as an ""intangible"" heritage — something you can't touch but can replicate.Marleau said Uplands, in partnership with Quebec's Culture Ministry and the University of Sherbrooke, has launched an oral history project to record stories and anecdotes from anglophones in the Eastern Townships who drank tea between 1940 and 2005.""We're going to meet people, ask them questions,"" said Marleau. ""We're still looking for participants.""""They don't have to be tea experts, just people who are willing to talk about the local traditions.""Muriel Fitzsimmons is one of the Townshippers planning to take part in the oral history project.""I wasn't given tea as a child,"" she said.""You didn't give young children tea — apparently it might stunt their growth or something.""Fitzsimmons laughs at the memory, saying she wasn't served her first cup of tea until she was 10, when it was offered to her at a friend's house. ""I tasted it, and it was awful, so I put some sugar in it. It was still awful,"" she said, remembering that she'd ended up with thick, syrupy water.Marleau says she's hoping to gather about 30 stories such as those recounted by Loiselle and Fitzsimmons, but she's only a third of the way to reaching that goal.Marleau aims to find 10 participants over the age of 65, 10 between the ages of 35 and 65, and another 10 younger than 35.Townshippers interested in sharing their stories can call the Uplands Centre at 819-564-0409."

But unlike some past Vancouver rallies, there is currently no counter-protest planned.Hong Kong is experiencing its worst political crisis in decades. The protests have gone on for three months, sometimes turning violent, and have targeted the airport, the legislature and the Liaison Office, the symbol of Chinese rule.There have been frequent clashes between protesters and police, who have often fired tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse crowds, amid accusations of excessive force.The movement started with anger over planned legislation allowing extraditions to mainland China. It soon broadened into calls for democracy amid fears China is squeezing Hong Kong's freedoms.China denies the charge of meddling in Hong Kong, which it says is an internal affair. It has denounced the protests and warned of the damage to the economy.Hong Kong returned to China under a ""one country, two systems"" formula that allows it to keep freedoms not enjoyed on the mainland, like the freedom to protest and an independent legal system. "

Military intelligence unit briefed Sajjan on COVID-19 risk on January 17: documents | CBC News,"A little-known medical unit within Canadian Forces Intelligence Command briefed Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan about the COVID-19 crisis on January 17, 2020, the government confirmed in a document presented to Parliament this week.",2020-07-22T08:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/military-intelligence-unit-covid-19-briefing-1.5657796,"A little-known medical unit within Canadian Forces Intelligence Command briefed Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan about the COVID-19 crisis on January 17, 2020, the government confirmed in a document presented to Parliament this week.The briefing from the medical intelligence (MEDINT) unit came 17 days after the World Health Organization (WHO) China Country Office was informed of cases of pneumonia with an unknown cause in Wuhan, in China's Hubei province.Between December 31, 2019 and January 3, 2020, 44 patients with an unknown form of ""pneumonia"" were reported to the WHO by authorities in China. Thousands more such cases would follow in the days ahead.While the minister was briefed in mid-January about the new virus, the government's incident response group — led by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and composed of cabinet ministers and other senior governmental officials — didn't meet to discuss COVID-19 until 10 days later, on January 27.By that date, 82 people had died and more than 2,800 cases had been confirmed in mainland China. More cases were being reported throughout the rest of Asia and around the world.In response to an order paper question from Conservative MP James Bezan, the Department of National Defence confirmed that the medical intelligence unit shared its briefing documents about COVID-19 widely with other government departments and agencies.""All relevant information and analysis was briefed to senior officials in a timely manner ... The minister of National Defence receives regular briefings to ensure the safety and security of Canadians as well as Canadian Armed Forces members at home and abroad,"" DND said in its response to Bezan.While the actual contents of that military intelligence briefing are unknown, it is clear that the machinery of government was aware of COVID-19 and its spread well before the Public Health Agency of Canada coordinated an almost complete shutdown of economic and social life two months later, in mid-March.Wesley Wark, a University of Ottawa professor and one of the country's top intelligence experts, said the delay between the January 17 military briefing and the first meeting of the incident response group shows ""there weren't a lot of alarm bells ringing anywhere in government"" in the early days of this pandemic.Wark said the January 17 briefing to Sajjan on the threat posed by COVID-19 to Canada ""wasn't particularly early,"" given China was already in the planning stages for the full lockdown of Hubei province that took place less than a week later.By the time cabinet and officials met on January 27, Wark said, Western intelligence agencies had already known for weeks that there was a new virus ripping through Hubei province and beyond.CBC asked Sajjan's office about the intelligence report and the subsequent 10-day delay before an incident response group meeting on COVID-19. ""We do not comment on specific intelligence reports,"" a spokesperson for Sajjan said.""Our government and the Canadian Armed Forces are committed to health and safety of Canadians. Since the start of the pandemic, we have monitored the progression of the outbreak to ensure the protection of Canadians and Members of the Canadian Armed Forces,"" Floriane Bonneville said in an email statement to CBC News.In the order paper question response, DND confirmed that Canada's military and the Communications Security Establishment (CSE) were working with Five Eyes intelligence sharing partnership, and with NATO and NORAD intelligence partners, to monitor the outbreak.The U.S. military's National Center for Medical Intelligence (NCMI) was following and reporting on the novel coronavirus as early as last November, with its analysts warning U.S. officials and allies of a ""cataclysmic event.""""Canada, for reasons that go unexplained, missed the opportunity to do proper risk assessments, to seize the opportunity of early warning and to get the response planning into gear,"" Wark said.""We lost a crucial period of time to take preparations before COVID-19 seriously struck in Canada. I think we have to assume that the wasted time cost Canada enormously in terms of lives and, as economists say in a bloody-minded way, treasure.""It is not clear how, or if, the military's January 17 intelligence briefing differed from other reports that were being prepared by the lead government agency on COVID-19, the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC).""There's two ways to read it — if red flags were raised they were not red flags that were taken seriously, or there weren't really red flags raised at that stage,"" Wark said.The PHAC was working closely with its partners at the WHO, which has since been criticized for being too closely aligned with the Communist regime in Beijing.The Associated Press has reported, based on leaked documents, that China's leaders sat on critical information that might have helped stave off a global pandemic.What is known is that the contents of the January briefing to Sajjan did not lead the federal government to close borders or restrict flights — or to alter its public messaging on the risk the virus posed to Canadians.""Thousands of travellers were streaming through Canadian airports — none of whom were quarantined — and nobody seemed to be lifting an eyebrow,"" Wark said of the two-month stretch between intelligence briefing and the shutdown.Bezan, the Conservative defence critic, said the latest details about the intelligence report amount to ""just another example of how this Liberal government was slow to act"" on COVID-19.He said the incident response group should have been convened as soon as the intelligence report was prepared for Sajjan and disseminated to government departments.""This delay and lack of leadership has put more Canadians at risk and has had real consequences for the Canadian economy,"" Bezan said.As previously reported by CBC, based on documents presented at the House of Commons health committee, much of the government's focus in the early days of the pandemic was on repatriating Canadians from Hubei province and cruise ships while international borders remained open with minimal screening.""The reality is we missed the significance of COVID-19. Our early warning system failed and our risk assessments were totally wrong and we've got to fix that as soon as possible,"" Wark said.As late as March 10, a department-drafted briefing note prepared for Health Minister Patty Hajdu ahead of question period was saying that — with just 12 cases being reported nationwide at that point (even though publicly available numbers already had climbed higher) — ""the risk of spread of this virus within Canada remains low at this time.""The note also said the public health system is ""well-equipped to contain cases coming from abroad, limiting the spread in Canada.""A month later, Canada would have more than 21,000 cases, many of them linked to China, Europe and U.S. travel.As government documents show, as of Jan. 28 the World Health Organization (WHO) was describing the risk of COVID-19 transmission as ""very high"" in China and ""high at the global level.""It would be weeks before Canadian public health officials changed their risk assessment.""There's a lot of explaining that I think the Canadian government needs to do as to why it held on to a low risk judgment for so long until suddenly, on a Sunday in mid-March, we got all these cascading, desperate measures and societal restrictions,"" Wark said.Trudeau and other members of his cabinet have been reluctant to publicly look back at what could have been done to better prepare Canada for COVID-19 with the country still in the grips of a pandemic.Since mid-March, much of the government's focus has been on mitigating the spread of the virus and supporting Canadians through unprecedented job losses and economic decline.""As we look back, of course there's going to be things we said, 'Oh, we might have said this differently or that differently,'"" Trudeau said in April when asked about the speed of the government's response."
Coronavirus a 'wake-up call' for Canada's prescription drug supply | CBC News,"Canadian pharmacies are limiting how much medication can be dispensed to try to prevent shortages, recognizing that most active ingredients for drugs come from India and China and medical supply chains have been disrupted by the spread of COVID-19.",2020-03-27T08:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/covid-19-drug-supply-1.5511659,"Canadian pharmacies are limiting how much medication can be dispensed to try to prevent shortages, recognizing that most active ingredients for drugs come from India and China and medical supply chains have been disrupted by the spread of COVID-19.Provincial regulatory colleges are complying with the Canadian Pharmacists Association call to limit the amount of medications given to patients to 30-day supplies. The goal is to stop people from refilling prescriptions early and to ensure life-saving drugs don't run short when supply chains are vulnerable.Mina Tadrous is a pharmacist and researcher in Toronto who monitors pharmaceutical supplies.He is worried Canadians will start stockpiling drugs after watching what has been unfolding in the U.S. and other regions as the virus spreads. He said pharmacists are concerned about drugs such as life-saving inhalers that people might stockpile based on misinformation circulating about potential treatments for COVID-19.""It's that relationship of how people are reacting rather than the actual supply of medications,"" he said. Tadrous said pharmacies get their medications and supplies from wholesalers, who get theirs from distributors who source them from manufacturers. Outside of wholesalers, most of that supply chain is outside of Canada. Dr. Jacalyn Duffin of Queen's University in Kingston, Ont., has long warned about the increasing frequency of drug shortages, including nearly 2,000 ongoing shortages, none of which she attributes to coronavirus.Given that China and India produce 80 per cent of the active ingredients of prescription drugs sold in North America, supply disruptions are expected eventually, Duffin said.""I think that the coronavirus outbreak is a big wake-up call for us to pay attention to our drug shortages that exist already and to pay attention to where our drugs come from,"" she said.India, a major supplier of generic drugs to Europe, has already shut down the export of some antibiotics and drugs for hypertension, blood pressure and acetaminophen, Duffin said.As a precaution, the federal government has enacted sweeping legislation that gives it the right to force patented drugmakers to make more medicine if necessary and remove patents as part of the response to the public health emergency. "

'I wouldn't go': Chinese detentions prompt Canadian businesses to rethink travel plans | CBC News,Escalating fears of retaliation after Canada detained a high-ranking Chinese business executive have prompted some Canadian business leaders to think twice before going to China on business.,2018-12-13T15:43:33.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/canada-china-business-1.4944143,"Escalating fears of retaliation after Canada detained a high-ranking Chinese business executive have prompted some Canadian business leaders to think twice before going to China on business.The detention of Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou in Vancouver on behalf of U.S. authorities earlier this month enraged Chinese authorities. And though she's been released on bail, the situation has prompted fears that Beijing may be in the mood to retaliate by drumming up trumped-up charges on Canadians travelling in China.It was revealed on Tuesday that former Canadian diplomat Michael Kovrig has been detained on murky national security grounds. A day later, word emerged that a second Canadian man, Michael Spavor, is also being held on similar grounds.The impact of Meng's arrest was reverberating even before China appeared to retaliate. Last weekend, the government of British Columbia suspended a planned trade mission to China as the story was unfolding.That's led to fears of more reprisals to come, even for businesspeople with no connection to any part of Canada's foreign service.""I wouldn't go,"" retail consultant Bruce Winder of the Retail Advisor's Network said. ""I don't think folks should be going over to China right now from Canada until this is resolved, just for the fear of retaliation.""Managing partner Andy Chan with law firm Miller Thomson LLP says the situation has ""complex hybrid considerations"" that Canadian businesses doing deals in China need to be aware of. Firms in fields such as security and infrastructure in particular, he says, should take a ""hard look"" at whether Beijing would consider them to be higher-risk industries.""Canadians need to look at and balance their reasons for travel to China against the current political environment,"" said Chan, the head of the firm's Asia practice.Granting bail to Meng Wanzhou until her extradition hearing in February likely helped the situation a little, but Chan said Canada is caught in a situation where the forces driving the tension are beyond Canada's control. Based on extradition treaties, Canadian authorities were obligated to act when U.S. officials wanted to proceed with fraud accusations against Meng.But in the eyes of the Chinese government, Canada has been lumped in with its southern neighbour.""The arrests happened here, the judicial proceedings are happening here and, consequently, worldwide attention is on Canada,"" Chan said.While tensions are high, he thinks the situation is definitely fixable over time. ""It is important to stay diplomatic,"" Chan said.Officially, the Canadian government does not have a travel advisory against going to the country, and simply urges Canadians to ""exercise a high degree of caution"" while visiting the country — but the same level of caution is advised for 94 other countries in the world.Indeed, there are many business leaders who have no more qualms about travelling to China now than they would have at any other time.""I don't see any reason why one should be concerned,"" said Ken Courtis, chair of Starfort Holdings and the former head of Goldman Sachs Asia. ""It's like going anywhere else, mind your Ps and Qs, respect your hosts, obey the law."" he said. Courtis actually spoke to CBC while en route to China for business and said, ""I don't see any reason not to continue [travelling to China].""And yet there is definitely a sense in some corners of the Canadian business community that the situation is far from normal.Elmer Kim, president of Uclid Inc., summed up the feeling succinctly in a recent interview on CBC News Network.""If I was a Canadian executive I'd get the heck out of China on the fastest plane I could find.""Watch his interview in the player below:CBC News"

(Kovrig) doesn't deserve what he's getting.""""I think (with) China, the Canadian government's approach very much was, 'We'll wait it out' ... Keep persisting but just wait it out,"" said Julia. ""I don't encourage Canada to take that same approach. I think (Ottawa) could be proactive in some other ways.""After living in China for 30 years without incident, Kevin and Julia Garratt were arrested by Chinese security officials in 2014 and accused of spying and stealing military secrets. At the time, Kevin said he and his wife were ""dumbfounded"" by their arrest.Julia was released in February, 2015, but was put on bail with restrictions pending trial, and did not return to Canada until May 2016. Kevin wasn't released until September, 2016.While the Garratts didn't expand on what they'd like to see Ottawa do in Kovrig's case, they were clear about what he can expect now that he's in Chinese custody: isolation and pressure tactics.""They'll keep (him) in in the dark about everything,"" said Kevin. ""They hopefully will grant him consular access. We were given that very quickly within a couple of days.""They'll keep him, no access to media ... maybe no access to a lawyer. We didn't get access to a lawyer for almost a year. We couldn't talk about the case even when consular officials came, so it will be very isolating, I think. (He'll be) well guarded but treated well,"" he said.""The only thing that I'm really thankful for — it's highly likely they wouldn't use any harsh techniques, or beat him, or things like that, based on our experience,"" said Julia. ""We were really thankful for that, even though there was really extreme psychological pressure, and the lights were on 24/7. The interrogation was very intense and lasted six hours every day.""(Kovrig) may be trained for that. We weren't ... we just were in absolute shock, incredulous about what was going on. I'm sure it would help, but I'm sure it will be a shock no matter what.""On Tuesday, the Canadian government confirmed Kovrig's detention by Chinese authorities. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said his family was receiving ""consular assistance.""On Wednesday, China's Foreign Ministry denied knowledge of Kovrig's detention — but did state that the International Crisis Group, the NGO that employs Kovrig as a Hong-Kong-based analyst, is not registered in China and its activities in the country are illegal.Kovrig served as a diplomat in Beijing and Hong Kong until 2016, but is on a leave of absence from the Canadian foreign service and has no diplomatic status to protect him.His detention led to speculation that the Chinese government was using him to punish Canada for the recent arrest of the chief financial officer of the Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei in Vancouver.Meng Wanzhou awaits possible extradition to the United States to face fraud charges. She is accused of misleading multinational banks about Huawei's control of a company operating in Iran, putting those banks at risk of violating U.S. sanctions. She has been released on $10 million bail.Watch Canadians formerly held by China talk about experienceThe Garratts said they feel ""heartbroken"" for Kovrig's family and counselled him and his loved ones to be patient — because he's not likely to be released soon.""Just hold on to hope,"" said Kevin. ""If (his family) can write letters, that would be great. I don't know if the Chinese ministry of security will let them send letters. They only allowed us to receive letters later on.""""Don't spend all your time worrying,"" said Julia. ""Just quietly stay persistent and active and persevere ... but keep a good attitude about it.

Chinese K-pop stars share support for Beijing during Hong Kong protests | CBC News,"At least eight pop stars from mainland China and one each from Taiwan and Hong Kong are publicly stating their support for Beijing's one-China policy, eliciting a mixture of disappointment and understanding from fans.",2019-08-19T18:54:52.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/chinese-stars-hk-protests-1.5252048,"At least eight pop stars from mainland China and one each from Taiwan and Hong Kong are publicly stating their support for Beijing's one-China policy, eliciting a mixture of disappointment and understanding from fans.Many of the statements came after protesters opposed to Beijing's growing influence over semi-autonomous Hong Kong removed a Chinese flag and tossed it into Victoria Harbour earlier this month.Lay Zhang, Jackson Wang, Lai Kuan-lin and Victoria Song were among the K-pop singers who recently uploaded a Chinese flag and declared themselves as ""one of 1.4 billion guardians of the Chinese flag"" on their official Weibo social media accounts. Wang is from Hong Kong and Lai is from Taiwan.Some see the public pronouncements as the latest examples of how celebrities and companies feel pressured to toe the line politically in the important Chinese market. Yet they also coincide with a surge in patriotism among young Chinese raised on a steady diet of pro-Communist Party messaging.Song and Zhang, a member of popular group EXO, have shown their Chinese pride on Instagram, in Song's case by uploading an image of the Chinese flag last week with the caption ""Hong Kong is part of China forever.""Such posts would only be seen by their international fans because Instagram, like most Western social media sites, is blocked by the ruling Chinese Communist Party's censors.For over a decade, South Korean entertainment agencies have been grooming Chinese singers to be part of their Korean pop, or K-pop, bands in an attempt to win over the massive mainland Chinese market. Only a few made it to a much-coveted debut. But a number of Chinese K-pop stars — citing unfair treatment — left their K-pop groups to pursue lucrative solo careers in mainland China.K-pop fans reacted swiftly to the avowals of allegiance to China. Some called it shameful, while others were more understanding.Erika Ng, a 26-year-old Hong Kong fan of Jackson Wang, was not surprised by his statement. She said he ""values the China market more than the Hong Kong market"" because of his large presence in the mainland.Wang, a member of the group Got7, used to carry a Hong Kong flag and wear a hat with the city's symbol, a bauhinia flower. Lately, he has been carrying a Chinese flag on his concert tour and was wearing a China flag hoodie in his music video.Ellyn Bukvich, a 26-year-old American who has been an EXO fan for five years, said many young fans will probably support Zhang and his message because of his status as a K-pop idol.""It's spreading propaganda and it's very effective,"" Bukvich said.The one-China policy maintains that there is only one Chinese government, and it is a key diplomatic point accepted by most nations in the world, including the U.S. It is mostly aimed at the democratic island of Taiwan, which Beijing sees as a breakaway province to be reunited with the mainland by force if necessary.In the case of Hong Kong, a former British colony handed back to Chinese control in 1997, Beijing maintains a ""one country, two systems"" policy in which the city is guaranteed greater freedoms than those on the mainland until 2047.China's government and entirely state-controlled media have consistently portrayed the Hong Kong protest movement as an effort by criminals trying to split the territory from China, backed by hostile foreigners.International brands — from fashion companies to airlines — have been compelled to make public apologies for perceived breaches of that policy, such as listing Taiwan and Hong Kong as separate countries on their websites or on T-shirts.Zhang terminated his partnership with Samsung Electronics last week, accusing the South Korean mobile giant of damaging China's ""sovereignty and territorial integrity.""The statement in a Weibo post was prompted by Samsung having separate language options for users in Hong Kong, China and Taiwan on its global website. Both Hong Kong and Taiwan use traditional Chinese characters instead of the simplified ones used in mainland China, and Hong Kong also has English as an official language. Samsung declined to comment on whether it will continue to provide different language options for Taiwan and Hong Kong.It can be difficult to know whether loyalty vows to Beijing are heartfelt or for commercial reasons. The past is littered with examples of celebrities, both Chinese and foreign, who saw their business in China destroyed after the party objected to a statement or an action.In 2016, Taiwanese K-pop star Chou Tzu-yu made a public apology for waving the Taiwanese flag while appearing on a South Korean television show. A Chinese vilification campaign against her led to a backlash among some Taiwanese, who at the time were in the midst of a presidential election eventually won by Tsai Ing-wen, who is despised by Beijing for her pro-independence stance.Public support for Beijing hasn't been limited to pop stars.Liu Yifei, the Chinese-born star of Disney's upcoming live-action version of the film Mulan, weighed in on the situation in Hong Kong, where protesters have accused police of abuses.""I support the Hong Kong police,"" Liu, a naturalized U.S. citizen, wrote on her Weibo account. ""You can all attack me now. What a shame for Hong Kong.""Some questioned her motives, wondering if the post was calculated to ensure her film is released widely in China — the world's largest film market. Among Hong Kong protesters, there were swift calls for a boycott of the film when it is released next year."

Passenger with nose 'running like Niagara Falls' questions Canada's airport coronavirus screening | CBC News,"Massey Beveridge, a retired general surgeon, said he was ""waved"" through Pearson International Airport even after reporting his symptoms to a border services agent.",2020-01-31T09:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/airport-screening-coronavirus-canada-toronto-1.5446959,"A physician who said he developed ""a nasty cold with a cough and runny nose"" while on a flight from Hong Kong to Toronto is questioning whether there are adequate safeguards to prevent the spread of coronavirus in Canada.Massey Beveridge, a retired general surgeon, said he was ""waved"" through Pearson International Airport even after reporting his symptoms to a border services agent.""My nose is running like Niagara Falls, I'm coughing and feeling pretty miserable,"" Beveridge told CBC News.He says he explained his symptoms to the agent and that he was taken to a screened-off area with face masks and hand wash. ""The immigration officer came back a few minutes later and said, 'Here's a handout. You can call public health if you like',"" Beveridge added.""I figured there'd be some kind of public health person coming to interview me.""There are currently two confirmed coronavirus cases in Toronto, a husband and wife both in their 50s who recently travelled to Wuhan, China — the epicentre of the outbreak. A third case has also been confirmed in B.C.Ontario public health officials have repeatedly stressed that the risk of coronavirus infection in Canada is low. Evidence suggests transmission of the virus from person to person requires close contact, like the kind between immediate family members who live together, said Dr. David Williams, the province's chief medical officer, this week. Further, lessons from the 2003 SARS outbreak suggest many airport screening procedures are ineffective.Beveridge was returning to Canada from Cambodia but changed planes in Hong Kong after flying from Phnom Penh.He said he was anxious, even though he had not been anywhere near Wuhan. Cambodia has so far reported only one case of the coronavirus and it was travel-related. Additionally, given the concerns over the coronavirus in China and other Southeast Asian countries, he figured he'd better do something on his return to make sure he didn't spread whatever he had.""Nobody even took my temperature. And you know if we're really trying to keep this out of Canada, it seems that that was not a very thorough screening process,"" Beveridge said.The outbreak of the new coronavirus began last month in Wuhan, a city of 11 million people. The World Health Organization (WHO) says it has killed at least 213 people, all in China. More than 9,600 people globally have been infected, the vast majority in China, though cases have been confirmed in 19 other countries. Yesterday, WHO declared the emerging situation a public health emergency of international concern.CBC News reached out to the Greater Toronto Airports Authority (GTAA), the body that oversees Pearson, for comment. A spokesperson said the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) is responsible for determining the response to coronavirus.Canada began implementing some enhanced screening measures for passengers on flights from China to Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver on Jan. 22. They include signs urging travellers to report flu-like symptoms, additional health-realted questions at kiosks and pamphlets with information about what people should do if their condition worsens.Watch infectious disease experts discuss why many enhanced screening measures are ineffective:The NationalDr. Theresa Tam, chief public health officer of Canada, said it's likely Beveridge was not screened because he was in Hong Kong only briefly and hadn't been to mainland China.""For the coronavirus, the enhanced border measures, on top of what we have as a foundation, is essentially providing the information on the screen and the kiosk questions and the referral to Canadian border service agents,"" Tam told CBC News.Tam said anyone who is sick should tell a border service agent.Frank Scarpitti, the mayor of Markham, 30 kilometres northeast of Toronto, says while he has great confidence in public health officials at the federal, provincial and local levels, he continues to press for the federal government to put in more enhanced screening at all Canadian airports.""I think it would just give Canadians a greater sense of confidence that that additional step is being taken,"" Scarpitti told CBC News.""It's not going to catch everyone but it's just another layer of screening, rather than just voluntary screening, and indicating where someone may have travelled.""Scarpitti also pointed to measures introduced at other major airports in New York City, San Francisco and Los Angeles that involve passengers from China being screened for symptoms.""You just have to look south of the border, the U.S. airports instituted that,"" he said.""Because of the number of airports that they have, they're actually redirecting passengers to the airports that have that technology,"" Scarpitti said.Global Affairs Canada said there are 196 Canadians currently seeking consular help to leave China, and Canada has secured a charter aircraft to bring home Canadians stranded in the affected region."

Across 24 other countries, there are 270 confirmed cases and one death. There are five confirmed cases in Canada. The WHO declared the outbreak a global health emergency in late January. The Canadian government issued a Level 3 advisory for China, asking Canadians to avoid non-essential travel. There is only one higher level, which advises people to avoid all travel.The government recommends people avoid travelling to Hubei province, where Wuhan city is located. The province has recorded 22,112 of China's 31,211 coronavirus cases, according to the WHO. As soon as the Canadian government declares a Level 3 or 4 travel advisory, a person may cancel their upcoming trip and their insurance should cover any lost expenses, said Weir. ""You'd have to submit receipts,'' she said, but travellers should receive refunds for flights, hotels and other costs.<a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/China?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#China</a>: Most airlines have suspended or reduced flights to and from the country due to the <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/coronavirus?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#coronavirus</a> outbreak.

While 24 countries have confirmed coronavirus cases, Canada's travel advisory applies only to China.

Annual — and potentially final — Chinese reception at UBCM convention taking place tonight | CBC News,The most controversial annual wine and cheese reception at a local government convention will finally take place on Wednesday — perhaps for the last time.,2019-09-25T11:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/ubcm-chinese-reception-dayof-2019-1.5295914,"The most controversial annual wine and cheese reception at a local government convention will finally take place on Wednesday — perhaps for the last time. The ""Consulate-General of the People's Republic of China Reception"" takes place at the Union of B.C. Municipalities convention at 6:30 p.m. PT, with its future unclear after months of negative publicity and attendance unknown after several councils announced they wouldn't attend. ""I'm pleased to see the number of mayors and councillors from around the province who have spoken up and said that they share my concerns,"" said Port Coquitlam Mayor Brad West.West has publicly campaigned against the optional reception — one of several sponsored events that regularly take place at the UBCM convention — since last year.During that time, the relationship between China and Canada has deteriorated, with Michael Spavor and former diplomat Michael Kovrig detained in separate incidents shortly after Huawei chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou was arrested in Vancouver on a U.S. extradition warrant.While the UBCM executive decided in June to allow this year's reception to go forward, it also created a review panel to help decide how the annual convention is financed in the future. Former UBCM president and Saanich Mayor Frank Leonard, who chairs the panel, said that sponsorships cover about 20 per cent of the convention's revenue and help keep delegate fees low. ""You either have to [fund the convention] from registration fees, which in most cases comes from the taxpayers or you possibly even increase the dues, which comes from the taxpayers, or you get it from third parties, which doesn't usually come from the taxpayers,"" he said.  But at a session Wednesday morning on how the convention is financed, only one delegate spoke in favour of sponsorships. And later in the day, 65 per cent of delegates voted against allowing future sponsorship by foreign governments, compared to 24 per cent who were in favour.   China is the only foreign government that currently sponsors UBCM, paying approximately $6,000.The question was non-binding, but Leonard said it would be considered when the panel creates its recommendations for the UBCM executive in early 2020. ""We're not going to make a recommendation just on a straw poll, but this will help guide us toward a recommendation,"" said Leonard. While delegates also voted in favour of continuing to have sponsorships from corporations and unions, not everyone agreed with that approach.""It undermines to some degree our credibility,"" said Squamish Coun. Chris Pettingill.""I'm not sure the value we get in terms of revenue is worth that. I think it sets a higher standard if we're not accepting sponsorship, in general.""West said he was happy to see the question being put to delegates but argued the entire process wasn't necessary. ""It shouldn't require a lengthy process and various review panels and surveys just to figure out what the right thing to do is. I think this is a matter of principle,"" he said. West had considered showing up to the reception — which is typically 90 minutes long and features free appetizers, a cash bar, and a couple of speeches by Chinese officials — but ultimately decided against it.Instead, he'll attend a protest next to the event, hosted by the group, Canadian Friends of Hong Kong.""The reception, I think, by design, is not a forum to have dialogue and to raise concerns or issues that you feel strongly about. It really is designed to facilitate one-on-one quiet conversations, relationship building as they call it,"" he said. ""I think a stronger message will be sent by joining those outside of the hotel who will be raising our concerns."""
Is the global trading system unravelling before our eyes? Here is where things stand | CBC News,"It took decades to build the world's rules-based trading system, but a frantic few days have compounded the historic strains on it. A pandemic, a trade-skeptical U.S. president, and simmering frustration with China have collided to test the durability of the system.",2020-04-30T08:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/wto-unravelling-panetta-covid-19-united-states-china-1.5548511,"The modern history of global trade is being written at warp speed, with a dizzying series of developments now testing the international trading system.What the rules-based order looks like after this is anyone's guess.Credit a collision of conditions: a pandemic, a trade-skeptical U.S. president, simmering frustration with China, and a growing great-power rivalry.In the past few days alone, the U.S. has dismissed the World Trade Organization's top dispute-resolution body as illegitimate.The Trump administration said it would ignore WTO appellate body rulings, after years of complaints from successive American administrations.Then the U.S. slapped several new regulatory controls on high-tech exports to China that could be used by the military.The U.S. has also placed its closest allies on notice: it is studying similar export controls for friendly nations that sell sensitive U.S. technology to rivals.Then there's the pandemic.Protectionist measures have not only sprouted all over the globe as countries cling to desperately needed medical equipment, such as masks and medicines.A few countries have also limited food exports, in a sign of nervousness about potential hunger. There's a Canadian-led push at the WTO, supported by dozens of countries, including the U.S., to maintain free trade in food.One of Washington's best-known trade-policy experts wrote a paper 18 years ago predicting a Cold War II between the U.S. and China, which would strain international institutions.Gary Hufbauer fears the moment has arrived. ""Oh, yes,"" said Hufbauer, now semi-retired at 81 after a long career as a trade analyst and U.S. trade official. ""We're in it. We're in the Cold War II. You see how it's being fought. Trade, technology.""Hufbauer sees cracks not only at the World Trade Organization, but also in the current pandemic-related scuffle at the World Health Organization, and in ongoing paralysis at the United Nations Security Council.Depending on who you ask, this is either the end of the postwar order, or a minor, perhaps even welcome, hiccup.Hufbauer foresees a return to the era of great-power diplomacy where large countries make their own rules, regardless of whether smaller countries agree.And it saddens him.""This was the best 60 years in human history,"" Hufbauer said.""There's no doubt [about that], in terms of improving the average standard of living around the world. … This new world doesn't have the same power."" He fears greater protectionism will harm both rich and poor countries, reducing competition, productivity and international investment.Other trade analysts are more optimistic.While it's true trade has grown more slowly in recent years, and that 2019 featured the most new tariffs in a long time, the long-term trend line still points in one clear direction: lower tariffs. In addition, Canada has new trade agreements with the U.S., Mexico, Europe, and the Asia-Pacific Rim. Most of the world still supports the WTO appeals body. And even the U.S. has, to date, continued to support lower-level WTO decisions. Count Mona Pinchis-Paulsen among the cautious optimists.""I don't think all is lost,"" she said.A trade historian and lawyer, she's a Canadian who teaches at Stanford University and has extensively researched the roots of the global trading system.One lesson of history, she said, is that institutions work as long as there's a will to co-operate. She's heartened by the support for Canada's WTO statement against food protectionism.But what about the pandemic-induced torrent of protectionism — all the corporate subsidies, buy-local initiatives and export controls? She says the system is flexible enough to accommodate temporary measures in a crisis.She cites Willard Thorp, a U.S. official who championed the push for a global trading system after the Second World War, who said international institutions should be responsible, not overly legalistic.The rules, she says, allow exceptions now, too.For example, it's true that export restrictions are generally forbidden under Article 11 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. But right beneath that admonition, there's fine print: exceptions are allowed for critical shortages of food and essential products.Article 20 also allows exceptions to protect human health. Simon Lester shares her view. A former official at the WTO's appellate body, and current trade-policy expert at the Cato Institute, a Washington, D.C.-based think-tank, Lester says countries are behaving responsibly.""You see blaring headlines: 'Export bans on medical supplies!' 'The system can't handle it!' 'Everything's falling apart!' What I've seen so far is that the measures taken so far are generally reasonable,"" Lester said. ""I think we'll say [someday] that the trading system dealt with this just fine.""But he'll be watching two upcoming cases at the WTO. While Lester personally regrets the erosion of the appeals body, he said the system can still function if the U.S. accepts negative findings by lower-level WTO panels.That's why he'll be paying attention over the coming months as the U.S. squares off against Canada on softwood lumber, and against Vietnam on fish fillets.A U.S. refusal to respect any findings, by any WTO panel, would render the international trade body mostly useless, he said.That would leave middle-power countries in a tough spot, he said. In Canada's case, that would leave it reliant, in future disputes with the U.S., on the panels in the new NAFTA — Lester still isn't sure how well those new panels will work.One Canadian trade lawyer says Canada's actions have sometimes been self-defeating. That includes last week's milestone case where the U.S. declared the WTO appellate body illegitimate.""Idiocy,"" is how the Toronto-based lawyer Mark Warner described the Canadian government's actions in the case. The dispute involved U.S. duties on Canadian glossy paper.The U.S. had already dropped its duties two years ago, after being found mostly in the wrong by a lower-level WTO panel.Yet the Canadian government appealed anyway, to contest the methodology the U.S. uses in calculating duties against subsidized goods.The U.S. was furious. President Donald Trump's trade representative, Robert Lighthizer, said Canada's pointless fight would undermine the U.S.'s ability to defend itself against a bigger economic threat: illegally subsidized, state-sponsored businesses in China.All this was happening as the U.S. was already working to paralyze the appeals body, created with the formation of the WTO in 1995.American administrations have been complaining about the appellate body for years — that it overstepped its original mandate, that it shouldn't be applying precedents from unrelated cases, that it constantly misses legal deadlines.The Trump administration began blocking the appointment of new panellists.Finally, last week, the U.S. said the body no longer had the required three members to be legitimate. It said two panellists' mandates had expired, and alleged the third worked directly for a Chinese government department.WTO rules say panellists should be recognized trade experts unaffiliated with any government.Despite it all, Warner says the international trading system will be OK.He says gloomy predictions about the collapse of the post-Second World War order are off — by approximately 50 years.We're more likely seeing a return to the world before the creation of the WTO appellate body in the 1990s, he says.""I don't think this is the return to the law of the jungle…. It's a return to 1995."""
Did the WHO mishandle the global coronavirus pandemic? | CBC News,"The World Health Organization has come under fire for its response to the global coronavirus pandemic, but experts say it's only as powerful as its weakest link.",2020-04-30T08:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/coronavirus-who-china-canada-pandemic-1.5549836,"The World Health Organization has come under fire for its response to the global coronavirus pandemic, with threats of funding cuts and investigations into its conduct.But experts say that while the WHO may have made some missteps in its handling of the crisis, the organization is only as powerful as its weakest link.The United Nations agency was founded in 1948 with a mandate to act as an authority on international health. Its 194 member states fund the agency and set Its policies, and it is accountable to them. Conversely, it has discretionary power to investigate members' handling of public health crises, but it relies on their co-operation and information sharing.""An organization like the World Health Organization can only be as strong and as effective as its member states want it to be,"" said Steven Hoffman, director of the Global Strategy Lab and a global health law professor at York University in Toronto. ""So, one of the challenges that the World Health Organization has faced over the last decades is that it keeps on getting new responsibilities and no new resources.""In 2005, its responsibilities increased with the adoption of the International Health Regulations (IHR), a legal agreement signed by all members that requires countries to report emerging disease outbreaks that are at risk of spreading worldwide. WATCH | WHO defends its record on COVID-19NewsIn doing so, experts say the WHO took on a more political role in juggling the domestic interests of its individual members with the interests of the rest of the world.""They have never performed well in that function — not once,"" said Amir Attaran, a professor in the Faculties of Law and School of Epidemiology and Public Health at the University of Ottawa, who told CBC's Sunday Edition the WHO should never again preside over a pandemic. ""They cave to diplomatic pressure. Or even if there is not diplomatic pressure, they self-censor."" Attaran said an agency entrusted with ensuring compliance with an agreement like the IHR cannot also operate with the ""attitude of a diplomat."" ""It cannot simultaneously be constantly begging countries for co-operation in certain areas where it's expected at the next moment to turn on them severely and possibly fault them for hiding an epidemic."" Hoffman says the agency is ""doomed by its institutional design.""""The criticisms that WHO has faced are not fair in the sense that WHO is not an independent entity, it's essentially acting on behalf of its member states, who control it,"" he said. ""So, the criticism is really a criticism of those national governments' inability to create the kind of strong public health agency that the world needs in this globalized era."" On Dec. 31, China alerted the WHO to a mysterious outbreak of pneumonia in the city of Wuhan, in the central Chinese province of Hubei. But it would be weeks before the WHO declared the situation a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on Jan. 30, a key designation that determines whether a country's response to an outbreak has been effective and if more resources are needed. The timing of that emergency declaration is critical at the beginning of an epidemic and can have ripple effects on how quickly countries around the world respond. ""I think that happened probably a week too late,"" said Hoffman, adding that the organization was ""hung"" over whether the outbreak constituted an emergency. While the WHO considered the emergency declaration, Chinese officials acted swiftly to silence early informal releases of information from health care workers sounding the alarm in Wuhan, opting instead to carefully manage the release of information in the weeks before the WHO would be allowed on the ground. Former Canadian ambassador to China David Mulroney said that information was put through a ""political prism"" in China and delayed as local officials determined how to put the best possible face on the crisis before sending it up the line to Beijing. ""You never want to give bad news to your boss in China,"" he said. Mulroney said that problem highlights an inherent issue within the WHO: it can be ""stonewalled"" by a member country on the release of information — posing a ""significant risk"" at a critical time in an outbreak.Lynette Ong, an associate professor of political science at the University of Toronto and a China specialist, said the WHO needed to maintain a diplomatic relationship with China in order to encourage the conducting of investigations and the sharing of key data. When Chinese health officials quickly genetically sequenced the virus from an infected patient, the WHO lauded the effort, calling it a ""notable achievement"" that ""demonstrates China's increased capacity to manage new outbreaks.""""But you do not also want to overdo it, to be too deferential and too friendly to the extent that you cannot take a step back and then question the things that they share with you,"" she said. ""WHO is being criticized, rightly so, and a lot of the criticism is justified to my mind because they have probably gone a little too far to the other side of being too deferential."" Ong said that while the WHO was ""outwardly praising"" China for its capacity to build hospitals and put in place strict lockdown of millions of its citizens that helped flatten their epidemic curve, the country did so by casting aside privacy and human rights with Draconian restrictions on citizens.""The other side of the criticism, which I also think is justified, is the cover-up at the beginning, which I don't think the WHO has actually addressed at all,"" she said, adding the world lost two to three weeks at a ""very crucial time"" in tackling the outbreak.""Had there not been any cover-up, I think the world probably, we would be in a different position."" Calls for the WHO to be held accountable for its response to the global coronavirus have been been growing. Australia says it will call for an international investigation into the origin of the pandemic at next month's annual meeting of the World Health Assembly, the decision-making body of the WHO. And U.S. President Donald Trump has already cut funding to the organization, saying it ""failed"" in its duty. Still, the U.S. is working with the agency. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has, since late January, had a member on the WHO's emergency committee, which also includes Canada's Chief Public Health Officer Dr. Theresa Tam as an adviser. Tam said that while she would welcome a review of the pandemic advice provided by the WHO, she does not fault it for its initial response because health experts all over the world ""underestimated where this could go."" WATCH | Dr. Theresa Tam says it would be 'worthwhile to examine' the WHO's response to COVID-19Politics NewsPrime Minister Justin Trudeau said Canada would continue to work with the WHO because the virus ""demands a global, co-ordinated response.""He added there will be ""plenty of time to reflect on challenges"" in the future.Former interim Liberal leader Bob Rae and Canada's special envoy on humanitarian and refugee issues said that while the WHO does act as a source of information, alert and guidance for countries in a pandemic, that doesn't take away the responsibility of governments to take the steps they feel necessary. ""You could never say, 'Well, you know, [the WHO] didn't tell us how serious it was.' Of course they did,"" Rae said. ""The question as to how each country should respond to the information is entirely up to each country. It's not up to the WHO.""The WHO doesn't issue directives ""to say you should carry out a lockdown, you should limit transportation, you should cut off all flights.""Rae said that while it can be difficult for the WHO to navigate the challenges of the Chinese political system, there's no evidence to suggest the organization actively suppressed the release of any information on the pandemic.He says the criticism of the WHO is ""completely misguided"" and that cutting funding to the organization at a critical time is a strategic ""mistake."" ""I think every crisis such as this one will prompt every governmental agency, both domestic and international, to reflect on what happened and to see how it can be improved,"" he said.""That is an issue that is going to be quite legitimately placed at the doorstep of the WHO."""

New U of S study finds mask use has no effect on exercise performance or oxygen levels for healthy people | CBC News,"Saskatchewan's new mandatory mask rules won't apply to people exercising indoors, but one University of Saskatchewan professor says that doesn't make sense.",2020-11-04T18:16:40.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatoon/mask-exemption-for-indoor-exercise-unwarranted-says-researcher-1.5789484,"Saskatchewan's mandatory mask rules won't apply to people exercising indoors, an exception one researcher says doesn't make sense.Phil Chilibeck and a team at the University of Saskatchewan have published a new study showing mask use, even three-layer coverings, have no effect on exercise performance, oxygen levels or any other indicator for healthy individuals.Chilibeck plans to pass the findings to provincial health authorities and hopes they'll reconsider the exemption.""In closed gyms, there is a good potential for COVID transmission,"" Chilibeck said. ""People should be wearing masks. It should be the rule.""With record case numbers over the past several days, a new mandatory mask order takes effect Friday in Prince Albert, Saskatoon and Regina.Masks will be required for people in most public indoor spaces, but people engaged in physical activity will be exempt. The order will remain in effect for at least 28 days.Dr. Saqib Shahab, Saskatchewan's chief medical health officer, said the new rules attempt to strike a ""balance."" He said most gyms and restaurants — which are also exempt while patrons are seated — have done a good job creating safe environments. Those rules can be revisited at any time, he said.Regina infectious disease specialist Dr. Alex Wong said it can be uncomfortable to wear a mask while exercising, but for now people should at least consider it during less intense cardiovascular workouts such as weight lifting or walking.""I think masks are a zero-risk way to reduce community transmission and transmission of COVID-19,"" Wong said.Chilibeck said the results are clear. Masks don't impede workouts, so there should be no exemption.He noted the recent case of a Hamilton spin bike studio. Owners were vigilant about their cleaning and other protocols, but participants biked without masks and a big outbreak occurred, he said.The study was conducted with U of S colleagues Keely Shaw, Scotty Butcher, Jongbum Ko and Gordon A. Zello, and published in the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health.Participants rode stationary bikes with or without various types of masks.

'It is a sin': Pope Francis urged to follow Vatican guidelines and wear a mask | CBC News,"A day after donning a face mask for the first time during a liturgical service, Pope Francis was back to his mask-less ways Wednesday despite surging coronavirus infections across Europe and growing criticism of his behaviour and the example he is setting.",2020-10-21T12:53:35.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/vatican-francis-mass-mask-1.5770628,"A day after donning a face mask for the first time during a liturgical service, Pope Francis was back to his mask-less old ways Wednesday despite surging coronavirus infections across Europe and growing criticism of his behaviour and the example he is setting.Francis shunned a face mask again during his Wednesday general audience in the Vatican auditorium, and didn't wear one when he greeted a half-dozen mask-less bishops at the end. He shook hands and leaned in to chat privately with each one.While the clerics wore masks while seated during the audience, all but one took his mask off to speak to the Pope. Only one kept it on, and by the end of his private conversation with Francis, had lowered it under his chin.Vatican regulations now require face masks to be worn indoors and out where distancing can't be ""always guaranteed.""Francis has faced sharp criticism even from his most ardent supporters and incredulousness from some within the Vatican for refusing to wear a mask.Just this week, the Vatican expert and columnist, the Rev. Thomas Reese, wrote a blistering, tough-love open letter to the Pope offering him six reasons why he should wear a mask and urging like-minded faithful to troll the pope's @Pontifex Twitter feed to shame him into setting a better example.""You're the boss; you should follow your own rules,"" Reese wrote. ""When the clergy hold themselves above the rules, we call that clericalism, a sin that you have loudly denounced.""At the start of his audience Wednesday, Francis explained to the faithful why he didn't plunge into the crowd as he usually would do. But he said his distance from them was for their own well-being, to prevent crowds from forming around him.""I'm sorry for this, but it's for your own safety,"" he said. ""Rather than get close to you, shake your hands and greet you, I greet you from far away. But know that I'm close to you with my heart.""He didn't address his decision to forego wearing a mask.Francis did, however, wear a white face mask throughout an interreligious prayer service in downtown Rome on Tuesday, removing it only to speak. He had previously only been seen wearing one once before as he entered and exited his car in a Vatican courtyard on Sept. 9. Italian law requires masks indoors and out.At 83 and with part of a lung removed when he was in his 20s in Argentina due to illness, the Pope would be at high risk for COVID-19 complications. He has urged the faithful to comply with government mandates to protect public health.Some have speculated the lung issue may make breathing with a mask difficult for him, but the the Vatican hasn't responded to questions about why the Pope wasn't following either their regulations or basic public health measures to prevent COVID-19.In the past week, 11 Swiss Guards and a resident of the hotel where Francis lives have tested positive. All told, the Vatican City State has had 27 cases, according to the Johns Hopkins University running tally.In Italy, the one-time European epicentre of COVID-19, coronavirus cases are surging, with the Lazio region around Vatican City among the hardest hit. Lazio has more people hospitalized and in intensive care than any other region except Italy's most populous and hardest-hit region, Lombardy.My RNS column: Dear Pope Francis, six reasons you should wear a mask <a href=""https://twitter.com/Pontifex?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">@Pontifex</a> <a href=""https://t.co/BvwJ69S22g"">https://t.co/BvwJ69S22g</a> via <a href=""https://twitter.com/RNS?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">@RNS</a>Inside the Vatican auditorium Wednesday, the crowd wore masks as did the Swiss Guards. But Francis, his two aides and some of the protocol officials didn't.In his open letter to Francis, which Reese said was a ""fraternal correction"" from a fellow Jesuit, the American noted that Francis was trained as a scientist, and should know to trust the science on virus protection.""It is a sin not to wear a mask,"" Reese wrote, saying the pontiff left himself vulnerable to charges of clericalism, that is, ""when clergy hold themselves above the rules.""Reese urged Francis to set a better example to others and avoid being lumped in the same camp as COVID-19 negationists and mask-averse U.S. President Donald Trump, with whom Francis has clashed.""Do you really want to be in company with a man who builds walls rather than bridges, who demonizes refugees and immigrants, who turns his back to the marginalized?"" Reese asked. ""I don't think so, but that is where you are as long as, like Trump, you do not wear a mask.""Meanwhile, with respect to matters of the church, Vatican Secretary of State Cardinal Pietro Parolin said on Wednesday that a controversial deal with Beijing on the appointment of Roman Catholic bishops in China would be renewed.The deal, which was first signed two years ago and expires on Thursday, will be renewed for another two years, he said.The accord with Beijing gives the Pope final say over the appointment of Chinese bishops, and the government allows all of them, including those hailing from a state-backed church, to recognize the pope's authority.The deal has been highly contested by the U.S. State Department and conservative Catholics, who say the Vatican has sold out to the communist government.U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo recently lobbied officials at the Vatican to end the pact, bringing up the subject of China's human rights abuses. Pompeo didn't meet with Francis as desired, with the Vatican saying the pontiff wouldn't grant audiences to officials during an election campaign.Vatican officials say the agreement is not perfect but establishes a dialogue with Beijing after decades during which Chinese Catholics faithful to the pope were driven underground.""As far as the accord is concerned, we are content. There are still many other problems but we never expected the accord to resolve all the problems,"" said Parolin.Many believe the accord will eventually lead to diplomatic relations with Beijing, meaning that the Vatican would have to sever ties with Taiwan. Parolin said talk of diplomatic relations was premature."
'We have a whole globe to protect': Pandemic vaccine research speeds up | CBC News,Scientists racing to develop a pandemic vaccine face a daunting goal and record progress.,2020-04-16T08:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/covid-vaccine-trials-accelerate-1.5533797,"At least 70 research teams, including some in Canada, are racing to develop potential pandemic vaccines within a year — an accelerated pace in an unprecedented search for an end to humanity's lockdowns.So far, the number of vaccine developers that have shifted from lab studies in animals to early-stage clinical trials in human volunteers can be counted on one hand. But scientists are hopeful they can speed up the research and bypass some of the usual red tape that slows down the vaccine approval process.In a pandemic, no one has immunity to the virus because it is new. The goal of a vaccine is to expose our immune system to part of the virus so our antibody fighters can prepare to attack the virus that causes COVID-19.Dr. Scott Halperin, of the Canadian Immunization Research Network, said it's important to have multiple versions of the vaccine that achieve the same purpose but work in different ways.""Hopefully there'll be five, six, seven, eight successful vaccines, because we have a whole globe that we need to protect,"" the Halifax-based physician and researcher said. The first phase of clinical trials focuses on safety, with about 30 to 50 volunteers testing out different doses of shots.A critical next step is Phase 2 trials in a larger number of people to look for signs that the jabs meet the goal of protecting against infection.China's CanSino Biologics is beginning the second phase of testing a vaccine candidate, adapted from the company's Ebola research, according to China's Ministry of Science and Technology. Another vaccine candidate is in Phase 1.In the U.S., Pennsylvania-based Inovio Pharmaceuticals began a Phase 1 trial last week of its vaccine candidate that uses the DNA sequence extracted from the key spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.The idea is to train the person's immune system to seek out the telltale crown, or corona of spikes that gives the coronavirus its name.""It's like an FBI poster,"" said Inovio's president and CEO, Joseph Kim. ""Anytime you see any signature, something that looks like this spike, go pounce on that with the full force of your immune system.""WATCH | How do you predict who will be hit hard by COVID-19?CBC NewsEarlier this week, the first person received a second dose of another potential U.S. vaccine from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and Massachusetts-based biotech company Moderna Inc.NIH infectious disease chief Dr. Anthony Fauci told The Associated Press there are ""no red flags"" so far and he hoped the next, larger phase of testing could begin around June.If SARS-CoV-2 continues to circulate widely into fall, it might be possible to complete larger trials in human volunteers sooner than the 12 to 18 months he originally predicted.""Please let me say this caveat: That is assuming that it's effective. See, that's the big 'if,'' Fauci said. ""It's got to be effective and it's got to be safe.""A potential vaccine from researchers at the University of Oxford in the U.K. is also listed as Phase 2, although doses for the trial are still being made.Normally, it takes from seven to 10 years to go from the lab to the arms of patients, Halperin said. ""What's mainly being accelerated are the various administrative steps, not the safety steps,"" he said.WATCH | What mathematical simulations tell us about how the pandemic will play outThe NationalHalperin said Canadian researchers hope to have some potential vaccines in clinical trials within the next four to six weeks.Jonathan Kimmelman, a biomedical ethics professor at McGill University in Montreal, is watching how both scientific and ethical standards are maintained while the pandemic vaccine trials progress at breakneck speed.""My concern is that, in the fear and in the haste to develop a vaccine, we may be tempted to tolerate less than optimal science,"" Kimmelman said. ""That to me seems unacceptable. The stakes are just as high right now in a pandemic as they are in non-pandemic settings.""To show how long the process can take, Kimmelman points to the example of the ongoing search for an effective HIV vaccine that began in the 1990s.Before healthy people worldwide receive a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the risk/benefit balance needs to tip in favour of the vaccine's efficacy in offering protection over the potential risks, he said. The balance still exists even in the face of a virus wreaking an incalculable toll on human health and society."

Crown seeks $75K fine for illegal First Nation lobster sales at N.S. pound | CBC News,"The owner of a lobster pound in Nova Scotia convicted of illegally selling lobster harvested by First Nations should be fined $75,000 and banned from the industry for two years, according to a federal Crown prosecutor.",2020-11-12T21:21:25.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/crown-seeks-fine-illegal-lobster-sales-1.5799777,"The owner of a lobster pound in Nova Scotia convicted of illegally selling lobster harvested by First Nations should be fined $75,000 and banned from the industry for two years, according to a federal Crown prosecutor.That was the recommendation Thursday at the sentencing hearing for Shen Ren Zheng in Digby provincial court.Zheng and his company, Guang Da International, were found guilty in August of illegally selling lobster harvested under communal food, social and ceremonial licences by members of Sipekne'katik First Nation.By regulation, those catches cannot be sold. The maximum fine for a first offence is $100,000.Federal Crown prosecutor Mark Stares told provincial court Judge Tim Landry the case was a deliberate act of greed that was clearly against the law.""This was an ongoing commercial scheme that was, in reality, a ruse to cover up black market dealings,"" Stares told Landry.The fine and industry ban, he said, is needed to deter others and conserve lobster stocks.In an October 2017 sting operation, federal fisheries officers pulled Sipekne'katik traps fished by Robert Syliboy from St. Marys Bay, placed microchips on 73 lobsters, returned the traps and then traced the tagged lobster to the nearby Guang Da pound in Belliveaus Cove.Three days later, officers followed a shipment from the plant containing 15 of those lobsters to the Halifax Stanfield International Airport. The shipment was stopped and seized before being loaded onto a flight for China. The shipment was valued at $50,000 and carried the necessary paperwork from the Canadian Food Inspection Agency.""The international export of black market fish can jeopardize Canadians ability to legally do so,"" Stares said.Speaking through a Mandarin translator, Zheng repeated a claim Thursday rejected by the judge at his trial. He said this was an accident where his workers inexplicably mixed commercial lobster at his pound with lobster harvested by First Nations.""During the time I did business over here I did not break any rules,"" Zheng said over the phone from Ontario, where he is living.He said it was wrong to mix lobster harvested commercially with those under a communal licence by First Nations.He claimed the 15 lobsters bearing microchips in the shipment of 5,000 pounds seized at the airport were the only lobster caught by First Nations that were attributable to him.The Crown disagreed, saying pound holding books and invoices seized by DFO indicated Sipekne'katik lobster was supplying a commercial operation.There was no evidence during the trial that money changed hands, but pound security video showed Sipekne'katik lobster being commercially graded and sorted at the plant. Zheng says he has declared personal bankruptcy and a bank is auctioning off the company after charges were laid in the caseHe told the court he has been on federal employment assistance since the pandemic.""If it is possible I would like to resume work in the fishing industry,"" he said. ""I would like to ask Your Honour's help to sustain myself and to continue living in Canada.""Landry asked for proof of his financial situation and will hand down a sentence next month."

Decision on future of Meng Wanzhou extradition case expected next week | CBC News,A B.C. Supreme Court judge will deliver a highly anticipated ruling next week that could spell the end of attempts to extradite Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou to the United States.,2020-05-21T18:55:42.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/meng-wanzhou-extradition-double-criminality-decision-1.5578795,"A B.C. Supreme Court judge will deliver a highly anticipated ruling next week that could spell the end of attempts to extradite Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou to the United States.On Thursday, Associate Chief Justice Heather Holmes told Crown prosecutors and Meng's defence team that she will release her findings next Wednesday on the issue of so-called ""double criminality"" — the question of whether the offence the U.S. has accused Meng of committing would be considered a crime if it had happened in Canada.Meng, who is Huawei's chief financial officer as well as the daughter of company founder Ren Zhengfei, is accused of defrauding banks by lying about the telecommunication giant's control of a subsidiary suspected of violating American sanctions against Iran.Prosecutors claim those banks then placed themselves at risk of fines, prosecution and the loss of reputation by relying on Meng's alleged lies to continue providing financial services to Huawei.Holmes will give her decision to the defence team, the Crown, the Canada Border Services Agency and the U.S. Department of Justice in the two hours before releasing them to the public.The verdict could be momentous. If Meng wins, she would be free to return to China, barring attempts to keep her in Canada if the Crown decides to appeal.If she loses, Holmes still has to hear arguments on allegations that Canadian authorities violated Meng's rights at the time of her arrest, before delivering a final ruling on the question of extradition.Meng is expected to be in court for the release of the double-criminality judgment, but Holmes said she won't have to make an appearance if the lawyers decide one is not necessary.Regardless, the proceedings will occur in a very different setting to the one in which arguments over double criminality occurred in January, two months before COVID-19 altered nearly every aspect of Canadian life, including the courts.Only 27 members of the accredited media will be allowed to attend an embargoed release of the decision an hour ahead of the public release in order to maintain physical distancing mandated by B.C. health authorities.At the hearing in January, dozens of reporters from around the world packed shoulder to shoulder into the largest courtroom in the downtown Vancouver courthouse to hear the arguments for and against extradition.The U.S. Department of Justice has charged Meng with bank fraud, wire fraud, conspiracy to commit bank fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud.The 48-year-old was arrested at Vancouver's airport on Dec. 1, 2018, on a stopover from Hong Kong to a conference in Argentina.She is living under house arrest in one of two multi-million dollar homes she owns in Vancouver.As part of a $10-million bail agreement, she wears a GPS monitoring bracelet on her left ankle and is trailed everywhere by a team of security guards.During the double-criminality hearing, Meng's lawyers argued the whole case comes down to economic sanctions the U.S. reimposed against Iran in 2018 when it left an international deal meant to stall the Islamic republic's nuclear ambitions.Canada doesn't have those same sanctions and so, the defence claims, Meng's alleged lies would be harmless north of the border because a bank in Canada wouldn't risk anything by dealing with a company that did business in Iran.But the Crown argued that the case was one of fraud, plain and simple, and that the issue of sanctions was essentially a red herring.They say that the issue of foreign sanctions should only be considered as a means to understand the context of the risks that HSBC would be taking by providing finance to a company on the wrong side of U.S. law.The case has caused a serious rift in the relationship between the U.S. and China.China has made no secret of its displeasure with Canada for acting at the behest of the U.S. to arrest Meng.Canadians Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor were detained in China within days of Meng's arrest and have been imprisoned ever since, accused of gathering state secrets and intelligence for foreign forces.China has also targeted Canadian shipments of canola and meat.In addition to legal troubles facing both Meng and the company itself, Huawei has been the subject of ongoing disputes with the U.S., which accuses the company of stealing trade secrets.The U.S. has placed Huawei on its ""Entity List,"" which effectively bars American companies from selling components to Huawei without government approval.Even with the COVID-19 pandemic underway, the U.S. has moved to block shipments of semiconductors to Huawei from global chipmakers.Meng has argued she is being used as a political pawn, citing comments from U.S. President Donald Trump, who said shortly after her arrest that he would intervene in the case if it might secure a better trade deal with China.If the Crown wins the double criminality decision, Meng will have a chance to make that case later this year, although COVID-19 related restrictions on court proceedings and questions around privilege associated with government documents have threatened to delay what was originally supposed to be an expedited timeline."
Apple revenue forecast tops expectations | CBC News,"Apple Inc.'s quarterly profit and revenue beat Wall Street targets on Tuesday and its forecast for fourth-quarter sales topped expectations as well, with Chief Executive Tim Cook telling Reuters that ""marked improvement in greater China"" drove the results.",2019-07-30T21:28:35.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/apple-earnings-1.5230852,"Apple Inc. on Tuesday reported quarterly profit and revenue which beat Wall Street targets and its forecast for fourth-quarter sales topped expectations as well, with CEO Tim Cook telling Reuters that ""marked improvement in greater China"" drove the results.Services revenue in the fiscal third quarter rose 12.6 per cent to $11.46 billion US, a new record, but missed expectations of $11.73 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Apple CEO Tim Cook told Reuters that after factoring out a one-time payment from lawsuits a year ago and foreign-exchange effects, the services segment growth rate would have been 18 per cent.Apple's iPhone sales fell 12 per cent to $25.99 billion, about in line with expectations of $25.96 billion, according to Refinitiv data. Apple shares were up 3.5 per cent to $216.10 in after-hours trading after the news.China sales fell four per cent to $9.16 billion, after declining 22 per cent in the fiscal second quarter. The Chinese smartphone market shipments declined six per cent in Apple's fiscal third quarter, according to market research firm Canalys.Trade tension between the United States and China have weighed heavily on Apple because it has slowed down economic growth in China, a major market for Apple. Apple effectively cut iPhone prices in China earlier this year after currency exchange rates had made its phones too expensive for many Chinese consumers.Cook told Reuters that results for mainland China, a subset of Apple's greater China region, were positive.""We actually grew in mainland China,"" Cook told Reuters. ""Non-iPhone revenue grew 17 per cent. We grew in every category outside of iPhone.""Apple said it expects revenue for the current fiscal fourth quarter of between $61 billion and $64 billion, compared with analyst estimates of $61.02 billion.For the fiscal third quarter ended in June, Apple reported a one per cent rise in revenue to $53.8 billion and a seven per cent drop in earnings per share to $2.18, compared with expectations of $53.39 billion and $2.10 per share, according to Refinitiv data.""In regards to iPhone, the most important thing for us is that we continue to grow the installed base,"" Cook told Reuters. ""And we did that on iPhone. And so the fact that people are hanging onto them a little longer, it's not something I worry about in the 90-day clock.""Apple did not give the number of active Apple devices, but in January said it was 1.4 billion, with 900 million of those being iPhones. Investors used the number, called the installed base, as a proxy for how many subscribers it can gain for its services business. In April, Apple disclosed that it has 390 million paid subscribers to its own services and third-party apps. The company has set a goal of 500 million by 2020.Apple reported results as U.S. and Chinese trade negotiators met in Shanghai for their first in-person talks since a G20 truce last month, after which U.S. President Donald Trump said he would not impose new tariffs on a final $300 billion of Chinese imports if China agreed to make purchases of U.S. agricultural products.Apple's most important products, such as the iPhone, are primarily made in China but so far have avoided tariffs. But the iPhone would be included in the final $300 billion round as it is currently written.""I don't know what the journey will be, but over time I'm optimistic that we'll all get to a good conclusion and everybody will win from it,"" Cook told Reuters when asked about the trade talks.Apple's market share in China declined to 5.8 per cent from 6.4 per cent, according to market research firm Canalys, in part because smartphone rival Huawei Technologies gained market share to become the top handset seller in the country.But Apple experienced a smaller market share loss than competitors such as Xiaomi Corp., Oppo and Vivo, according to Canalys data. Cook said that iPhone price adjustments, plus the Chinese government's move to cut phone taxes, helped keep iPhone sales in China from eroding further.""Our trade-in and financing programs are doing extremely well in China,"" Cook told Reuters. ""Because of the active installed base is growing in China, our services business is doing very well, growing double digits.""Apple shares have gained more than 20 per cent since early June, when shares dropped on news that the U.S. Department of Justice had jurisdiction over the company in a potential probe as part of a broader review of whether technology giants engage in anticompetitive practices.The Justice Department formally announced the review last week but did not name any companies that would be scrutinized. Officials said the efforts would focus on research, social media, and some retail services online, with an apparent reference to Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc., and Facebook Inc. rather than Apple specifically.But Apple has faced complaints from competitors and developers over its practice of keeping 15 per cent to 30 per cent of revenue earned by developers on its App Store. In March, Spotify, Apple's chief rival in the streaming music space, filed an antitrust complaint against Apple with European Union officials.Apple's services, which include Apple Music, the App Store and iCloud, are seen as a source of growth for Apple as iPhone sales have slowed. In the coming months Apple plans to release a credit card and subscription services for gaming and television.Apple said revenue for its ""Wearables, home and accessories"" segment that contains devices like the Apple Watch and AirPods was $5.53 billion, compared with analyst estimates of $4.81 billion.Apple said it returned more than $21 billion to shareholders during the fiscal third quarter, including $17 billion in share repurchases. It declared a dividend of 77 cents per share."

P.E.I. Chinese community raising money for doctors dealing with coronavirus outbreak | CBC News,Members of the Chinese community on Prince Edward Island are aiming to get thousands of dollars in medical supplies to the areas of China dealing with the recent coronavirus outbreak.,2020-02-07T23:39:55.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-chinese-community-fundraising-feb-2020-1.5456540,"Members of the Chinese community on Prince Edward Island are aiming to get thousands of dollars in medical supplies to the areas of China dealing with the recent coronavirus outbreak.Fundraising efforts are being organized by the P.E.I. Chinese Canadian Association. There's one Islander who is friends with the head of a hospital in China's Hubei province — where Wuhan is. Another Islander is friends with the head of a group in the U.S. that's already shipped medical supplies to Chinese hospitals.It was through those connections that the P.E.I. Chinese Canadian Association learned about how much of a need there is for more medical supplies at Hubei hospitals and how to help get them there, said Paul Yin, head of the association, through interpreter Ally Guo.""In our Island, we do have friends with friends in Hubei. And they have direct contact with the hospitals. They have an urgent need for help. So that's why we decided to start this fundraiser,"" Yin said.There have been no confirmed cases of coronavirus on Prince Edward Island and seven in Canada.The live map tracking the outbreak on the World Health Organization website said China had 31,424 confirmed cases and 638 deaths as of Friday evening.The association is accepting e-transfers to purchase medical equipment.Even members of the Canadian Chinese community who lived on P.E.I. for a period before moving to another province are chipping in.""It's not just P.E.I., it's residents who were here before and also want to donate,"" Yin said.Yin said in particular, the doctors and nurses are lacking protective gear like suits, masks and glasses and that it's important doctors and nurses stay healthy in order to help other people.""There's a huge demand for the masks and everything.""""The Chinese government, they are doing a lot of purchases and activities to prevent this outbreak, but the numbers are too big,"" Yin said.""They might not be able to do all the things. And it's Chinese New Year festival time and a lot of factories in China that produce this equipment are on holiday.""Yin just returned from another, less affected area of China a few days ago, and while he feels fine he's staying inside his home, away from the public for two weeks as a precaution.However, since Yin has gotten back to the Island he's been busy online putting out the call to P.E.I.'s Chinese community for donations.In an email to CBC, P.E.I.'s Chief Public Health Office said the policy for those returning from China changed Thursday.Those who have travelled to Canada from Hubei province — which includes Wuhan — should voluntarily self-isolate for 14 days, staying at home and not going to school or work. This does not apply to people returning from other parts of China. Those travellers are being asked to monitor themselves and their children for 14 days — and call 811 if they develop symptoms such as fever, coughing or difficulty breathing.Yin is getting help in his fundraising efforts from volunteers like Guo, Yin's interpreter during his interview with CBC.Guo was born in Shanghai, but has lived on P.E.I. for the last five years. She runs a Chinese social media website aimed at bridging the gap between the Chinese community and other Islanders.In just three days, about 140 people have donated more than $15,000 and it will all go to that non-profit group in the U.S. to buy supplies and ship them to three hospitals in Hubei, Guo said.""We have seen their materials, like who do they buy from, who do they deliver to, and with the evidence that they've already delivered equipment to the hospitals with photos and everything, we believe they can do so,"" she said.Guo said the money raised so far is enough to provide a week's worth of protective gear for about 200 doctors and nurses, but she hopes they can at least double that amount.""Every day they need a lot of equipment. They don't have so many supplies just because the population there is so many,"" Guo said.""They have to protect themselves.""Guo said the group will continue to raise money for medical equipment in China for as long as it is needed. This year, P.E.I.'s Chinese New Year's gala was moved from early March to mid-March to give those trying to get back to the Island time to do so, Guo said.That gala is also becoming a charity event this year. Money raised  will go toward helping those dealing with the coronavirus outbreak, Guo said."

More lockdowns could be fatal for a large number of businesses, said Jasmin Guénette, vice-president of national affairs at the Canadian Federation of Independent Business. ""This money will help several entrepreneurs to get through the crisis, but we have to make sure that these sums are available quickly,"" Guénette said.Quebec hits 1,000 new cases for first time in second waveQuebec reported 1,052 new cases of COVID-19 on Friday — the first time 1,000 cases has been reached in the second wave of infections. During the first wave, the province's single-day totals exceeded 1,000 cases only five times.In ""red zones"" such as Montreal and Quebec City, parties and virtually all other kinds of gatherings are now banned. This weekend, police will be enforcing that ban and can issue $1,000 fines to those who do not comply.Since the start of the pandemic, there have been 76,273 confirmed cases in the province and 5,857 people have died. There are 302 people in hospital (an increase of 27), including 49 in intensive care (an increase of three).Rapid COVID-19 testing helps remote First Nations cope with shortage of isolation space A new machine that tests for COVID-19 and provides results within an hour is already making a difference in Sandy Lake First Nation, a remote community about 600 kilometres north of Thunder Bay, Ont. The rapid testing ""helps us determine how fast to react, if it's an emergency or something we can handle,"" Sandy Lake Chief Delores Kakegamic told CBC News.The Public Health Agency of Canada provided machines for First Nations that have had positive cases, including Sandy Lake. It's part of a countrywide effort to place the machines, called GeneXpert, in all remote communities.Rapid results are critical in First Nations because more than 40 per cent of the homes in those communities are overcrowded and there are few places to self-isolate for people awaiting tests results. If someone presents with COVID-19 symptoms in remote communities without a rapid testing machine, that person may need to be taken out by air ambulance because of the risk they could infect others in the tiny nursing stations that are the only health-care facilities in most First Nations.Stay informed with the latest COVID-19 data from Canada and around the world.THE SCIENCEOntario wants to know if residents are following the COVID-19 prevention rulesThe Ontario government plans to find out whether people are following COVID-19 prevention measures such as physical distancing and wearing a mask — and if not, why not. It's called ""health behaviour surveillance,"" and while that term might sound like it involves the province spying on you, that's not what will be happening.In this case, surveillance means doing surveys. Premier Doug Ford's government will ask questions about people's compliance with public health guidelines to try to better understand some of the behaviours driving Ontario's upsurge in COVID-19 cases. Experts in the field say health behaviour surveillance is crucial work that can help rein in the spread of infections, provided the government does it right. However, they question why the province has waited until the pandemic's second wave.The government plans to start the work this month by surveying representative samples of the population across the province. Good data could help the province understand what actually influences people's behaviours around preventing the spread of COVID-19, said Scott Leatherdale, a professor at the University of Waterloo's School of Public Health and Public Health Systems. ""It would be incredibly important to know what's working and how we can learn from that,"" said Leatherdale, whose specialty is researching the health behaviours of youth.People under age 40 have accounted for a disproportionate number of new cases of COVID-19 reported in Ontario since the second wave started building at the end of August. While Ford repeatedly condemned young people for ""wild parties"" as a source of infections, health officials have suggested lack of fear of the virus, fatigue with pandemic restrictions and a growing number of less-than-wild social gatherings contributed to the spread of cases among that age group.The survey work could shed more light on the factors at play, albeit not quickly enough to halt Ontario's expected trajectory toward an average of 1,000 new cases a day in mid-October.AND FINALLY...With protocols in place, QMJHL set to begin season amid 2nd wave of pandemicThe Quebec Major Junior Hockey League could not save its season when the COVID-19 pandemic hit, but seven months later and on the eve of the start of the 2020-21 season, their efforts have paid off. Within the span of a week in March, COVID-19 snuffed out the league's season, cancelling the final 41 games left to play in its regular season as well as its entire playoffs. The end result was no President's Cup for the first time in league history.There are still concerns, but league commissioner Gilles Courteau and the managers of the QMJHL teams have worked hard to create a return-to-play plan that includes clear health measures and strict rules. That hard work appears to have paid off as no positive cases have been recorded since camps began in August.The QMJHL will be the first junior hockey league in Canada to kick off its season beginning Friday. ""We've got a family spirit within our team and for sure with the masks and everything, it distances us a little more, but that was the price to pay to start the season,"" said Stephane Juilen, head coach and general manager of the Sherbrooke Phoenix. ""The protocol is super strict and there was some adaptation at the start, but after two weeks, we got into a routine and things are going well.""While its players are healthy, the QMJHL faces other financial and logistical challenges as its 12 Quebec-based clubs will play in empty arenas, and many of its European and U.S.-based players can't return to Quebec.Find out more about COVID-19Still looking for more information on the pandemic?

Silent spread of virus keeps scientists grasping for clues | CBC News,Researchers have exposed the frightening likelihood of silent spread of the virus by asymptomatic and presymptomatic carriers.,2020-07-22T16:22:29.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/covid-19-silent-spread-1.5658639,"One of the great mysteries of the novel coronavirus is how quickly it rocketed around the world.It first flared in central China and within three months was on every continent but Antarctica, shutting down daily life for millions. Behind the rapid spread was something that initially caught scientists off guard, baffled health authorities and undermined early containment efforts: The virus could be spread by seemingly healthy people.As workers return to offices, children prepare to go back to school and those desperate for normalcy again visit malls and restaurants, the emerging science points to a menacing reality: If people who appear healthy can transmit the illness, it may be impossible to contain.""It can be a killer and then 40 per cent of people don't even know they have it,"" said Dr. Eric Topol, head of Scripps Research Translational Institute in San Diego.Researchers have exposed the frightening likelihood of silent spread of the virus by asymptomatic and presymptomatic carriers. But how major a role seemingly healthy people play in swelling the ranks of those infected remains unanswered — and at the top of the scientific agenda.The small but mighty coronavirus can unlock a human cell, set up shop and mass produce tens of thousands of copies of itself in a single day. Virus levels skyrocket before the first cough, if one ever arrives. And astonishing to scientists, an estimated four in 10 infected people never have symptoms.The slyness of the virus remains on the minds of many scientists as they watch societies reopen, wondering what happens if silent spreaders aren't detected until it's too late.Travellers with no coughs can slip past airport screens. Workers without fevers won't be caught by temperature checks. People who don't feel tired and achy will attend business meetings.And outbreaks could begin anew.As early as January, there were signs people could harbour the virus without showing symptoms. Still, many scientists remained unconvinced.The concept of people unwittingly spreading disease has never been an easy one to grasp, from the polio epidemic of the mid-20th-century United States to the spread of HIV decades later.As COVID-19 emerged, health officials believed it would be like other coronaviruses and that people were most infectious when showing symptoms like a cough and fever, with transmission rare otherwise.""We were thinking this thing is going to look like SARS: a long incubation period and no transmission during the incubation period,"" said Lauren Ancel Meyers, a disease modeller at the University of Texas at Austin.Behind the scenes, scientists like Meyers were sharing their alarming finding with health officials. By scouring the websites of Chinese health departments, Meyers and her team found more than 50 cases between Jan. 21 and Feb. 8 where the person who brought the virus home didn't develop symptoms until after infecting a family member.""When we looked at the data, we said, 'Oh no, this can't be true,""' she said. ""It was shocking.""Rebecca Frasure, who contracted the virus while aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship, sat in bed in Japan in late February, frustrated to be kept hospitalized even though she didn't have any symptoms.""I'm perfectly healthy except having this virus in my body,"" Frasure said.Without widespread and frequent testing, it's impossible to know how many people without symptoms might carry it. The Diamond Princess, which idled in the Port of Yokohama while the virus exploded onboard, enticed researchers.A mathematical model built by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine aimed at estimating how many infected people without symptoms were being missed indicated that a startling three-quarters of infected people on the Princess were asymptomatic.In Washington state, similar clues emerged for Dr. Jeff Duchin as a team of investigators examined the Life Care nursing home — the site of the first major U.S. cluster of cases — and found health-care workers were spreading the virus to other elder-care facilities. They believed at least some were working while infected but before feeling symptoms.In March, more than half the residents at another nursing home who tested positive didn't have symptoms.All that underscored the need to shift gears and acknowledge the virus couldn't be totally stopped.""This disease is going to be extremely hard to control,"" Duchin recalled thinking.The nose and mouth are convenient entryways for the coronavirus. Once inside, the virus commandeers a cell's machinery to copy itself while fending off the body's immune defences. Virus levels skyrocket in the upper airway, all without symptoms early on. Many scientists believe that during these days, people can spread virus just by talking, breathing or touching surfaces.In the truly asymptomatic, the immune system wins the battle before they ever feel sick.As it became clearer that healthy people could spread the virus, U.S. health authorities opted not to wait for scientific certainty. In early April, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended people wear masks.Days later, Chinese researchers published a paper saying patients are most infectious two to three days before developing symptoms. Evidence continues to accumulate, and the CDC now estimates 40 per cent of transmission is occurring before people feel sick.Still, doubt remains among scientists, most notably among the World Health Organization, which has discounted the importance of asymptomatic infection — though it recently began to acknowledge that possibility and advised people to wear masks.U.S. health officials blame China for delays in sharing information on silent spread. But Topol said the U.S. could have mounted its own testing program with viral genome sequencing.That's no small matter: Gaining scientific clarity earlier would have saved lives.""We've been slow on everything in the United States,"" Topol said. ""And I have to say it's shameful."""
Chinese ambassador to Canada to depart as diplomatic dispute rages on | CBC News,"Lu Shaye, the Chinese ambassador to Canada who has been a combative presence throughout a serious and ongoing dispute between the two countries, is expected to depart soon for a new posting, CBC News has confirmed.",2019-06-05T18:33:44.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/china-ambassador-canada-lu-shaye-1.5163395,"Lu Shaye, the Chinese ambassador to Canada who has been a combative presence throughout a serious and ongoing dispute between the two countries, is expected to depart soon for a new posting, CBC News has confirmed.With Lu's departure, neither country will have a permanent ambassador in place at a moment of great tension on several fronts.Canada and China have been at odds since December 2018, when Canadian authorities detained Meng Wanzhou, chief financial officer of the Chinese telecom giant Huawei, on an extradition request from the United States. Soon after, Chinese authorities detained two Canadian citizens: Michael Spavor, a businessman, and Michael Kovrig, a Canadian diplomat on leave to work for a non-governmental organization.John McCallum, the former Liberal cabinet minister appointed by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to represent Canada in China, was fired as ambassador in January after making public comments about Meng's case.In March, China began to cut off imports of canola seed from Canada. Just this week, China said it would increase its inspection of Canadian pork products.Federal officials in Canada are also still weighing whether to allow Huawei access to Canada's 5G wireless network.In a news conference in January, Lu said there would be ""repercussions"" for Canada if Huawei is rejected on national security grounds. In a newspaper op-ed that same month, he said the international community's treatment of China reflected an attitude of ""white supremacy."""

The patient is a woman in her 80s who is in critical condition at Vancouver General Hospital.Provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry said the woman had recently returned from travel in India and Hong Kong, and officials are investigating where she might have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.""The timing of her symptom onset is much more likely to be related to Hong Kong,"" Henry said at a news conference Wednesday, but she added that the province is also looking into a tour group that the woman travelled with in India.The patient is currently in isolation in the intensive care unit, and Henry said ""all precautions"" have been taken to protect staff and other patients.This is B.C.'s first severe case of the novel coronavirus. Henry said the sick woman has several underlying conditions that put her at risk of serious illness. All of the previous 12 patients were able to stay in isolation at home and four have recovered completely. Three other patients are currently asymptomatic and are awaiting test results to clear them to return to normal life. All COVID-19 patients must test negative for the virus twice before they can leave isolation, said Henry.Of the previous 12 cases, seven have been connected to an outbreak in Iran and five have been connected to China.Watch: ""Wash your hands like you've been chopping jalapenos and you need to change your contacts,"" says Dr. Bonnie Henry. CBC News BCHenry said that while B.C. has experience dealing with disease pandemics, each outbreak is different, and it takes some time after the initial chaos to work out an effective response.""I am confident that it will never be easy,"" she said. ""There's a lot of unknowns at the beginning … but we're putting the puzzle together and breaking the chains of transmission.""She pointed out that China, which was the epicentre of the outbreak, has managed to significantly slow the spread of the virus, which gives hope to officials here in Canada.B.C. officials continue to ask members of the public to be vigilant about washing their hands, and to stay home from work or school and avoid large gatherings if they're feeling sick. People who've recently returned from trips to Iran and China are asked to self-isolate for 14 days.Health Minister Adrian Dix said he's asking employers to be understanding when employees ask for sick days and to consider dropping any requirements for doctors' notes.Watch: Dr. Bonnie Henry on ""keeping your germs to yourself.""  CBC News BCIn nearby Washington state, 10 people have now died from the virus. B.C. is not recommending against travel south of the border, except for those who are feeling ill.Henry pointed out that most of the cases in Washington are linked to an outbreak at a long-term care home, and said everyone needs to be cautious about visiting elderly loved ones right now.""This has been a devastating disease for older people,"" Henry said. ""If you are sick and you absolutely have to see your loved one in a long-term care home … then call ahead, talk to the staff."""
"Hong Kong leader starts dialogue on protests, but won't budge on demands | CBC News","Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam said Tuesday she had met with a group of young people about the ongoing pro-democracy protests, but she showed no sign of budging in a continuing stalemate over the movement's demands.",2019-08-27T02:45:07.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/hong-kong-protests-carrie-lam-serious-violent-escalation-1.5260883,"Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam said Tuesday she had met with a group of young people about the ongoing pro-democracy protests, but she showed no sign of budging in a continuing stalemate over the movement's demands.Lam said she explained the government's position at the Monday closed-door meeting, which was unannounced. She disputed complaints her government is ignoring the protesters, whose demands include the withdrawal of an extradition bill, an independent inquiry into what they believe is excessive use of force by police at the demonstrations, and democratic elections.""It is not a question of not responding,"" she told reporters before a weekly meeting with her executive council. ""It is a question of not accepting those demands.""Hong Kong, a Chinese territory, has seen more than two months of youth-led protests that have sometimes ended in clashes with police. More than 80 people were arrested last weekend after protesters occupied city streets. They built barriers across the roads, and threw bricks and gasoline bombs to try to block the police, who used tear gas to drive them away.Lam announced last week she is creating a platform for dialogue and said Tuesday it would include protesters. Opposition lawmakers have questioned the sincerity of her initiative, calling it a delay tactic.It wasn't clear who attended the Monday meeting with Lam and the education and home affairs ministers. The South China Morning Post newspaper, citing an unidentified source, said about 20 people took part and that they were mostly in their 20s and 30s.Lam said her government had accepted the movement's main demand by suspending the extradition bill, which would have allowed suspects to be sent to mainland China to face trial. She has declared the legislation dead, but protesters are demanding its formal withdrawal.The proposal fuelled concern China is chipping away at the separate legal system and rights that semiautonomous Hong Kong has under a ""one-country, two-systems"" framework. Huge marches against the legislation have drawn more than a million people, according to organizer estimates.Protesters have also disrupted subways and the airport, surrounded and spray painted slogans on police stations, and broken into and vandalized the legislative chamber. Not all the protesters resort to confrontation, but those who do say it is needed because the government is not responding to peaceful demonstrations.Lam said it would be unacceptable for the government to accede to demands because of such pressure.""If violence continues, the only thing that we should do is to stamp out that violence through law enforcement actions.""Lam also dismissed talk of her resignation, telling reporters a responsible chief executive should continue ""to hold the fort and do her utmost to restore law and order in Hong Kong.""We should prepare for reconciliation in society by communicating with different people ... We want to put an end to the chaotic situation in Hong Kong,"" Lam said, adding she did not believe her government had lost control.The government said on Monday illegal violence was pushing Hong Kong to the brink of great danger after weekend clashes that included the first gunshot and the arrest of 86 people, the youngest just 12.More demonstrations are planned over coming days and weeks, posing a direct challenge to authorities in Beijing, who are eager to quell the unrest ahead of the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China on Oct. 1.China said it strongly deplores a statement by the leaders of the G7 nations, who called for the avoidance of violence in Hong Kong and affirmed the importance of a 1984 Sino-British agreement that gave the city its semiautonomous status. The former British colony was returned to China in 1997.""We expressed, collectively, deep concern about what is happening in Hong Kong,"" British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said after the G7 meeting in France. He added, ""We remain collectively committed to the one-country, two-systems framework.""Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Geng Shuang said in Beijing that no foreign government has the right to intervene in Hong Kong, which he called an internal Chinese issue.""We urge the members of the G7 countries not to meddle in other's affairs."""

"Time for Canada to have 'authentically unique' voice, says Alexandre Trudeau | CBC News","Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s brother Alexandre says Canada has lost its unique voice in the world and has fallen into the role of a “confused follower nation,” but building a unique relationship with China could help fix the situation.",2016-09-14T01:20:20.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/alexandre-trudeau-follower-nation-1.3761033,"Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's brother Alexandre says Canada has lost its unique voice in the world and fallen into the role of a ""confused follower nation"" — but building a unique relationship with China could help fix that.Alexandre made the comments in an interview with CBC News Network's Power & Politics, where he was promoting his book Barbarian Lost: Travels in the New China.""In recent times Canada has disappeared as an independent voice, as a country that makes its own decisions about things,"" Alexandre told host Rosemary Barton. ""When's the last time you think: 'Well, Canada really has a position that is unlike any other?' We've kind of fallen into a confused follower nation.""The author and filmmaker said Canada should be surprising other countries with ""authentically unique"" positions on issues of international importance.""It's a constant challenge when we are so closely linked with the United States, obviously, they expect us to toe the line on so many issues, but it's not even good for them that we be so close to them,"" he said. ""We have to be independent, and developing an independently sophisticated relationship with China is one of the big features of that.""Alexandre said his brother's job is difficult when it comes to China, because Canada is a trading nation and his brother is the ""salesman in chief"" of a country where many citizens are uncomfortable with the human rights record of the Chinese government.""I'm not one who believes that trade should be politicized like that,"" he said. ""I think the way to go at human rights is to say China has to evolve, we want to be a long-term friend to China and be helpful as it evolves, and we have a lot to learn from them too. Not just Canada but the West in general.""While the rest of the world has been significantly influenced by European expansion over the last five or six centuries, Alexandre said, China is a place apart, a country where travellers can look at the West from the outside like nowhere else.One of the lessons there is the way Chinese culture puts a strong emphasis on family history and how that family is put above the individual.""What could be more true, that the only thing really real about us in the long run, is what we manage to receive from those who came before, and what we manage to pass on to those who follow,"" he said.As children, Alexandre and his brothers Justin and Michel travelled in China with their father. Alexandre related a story he mentions in the book in which the elder Trudeau chastised his sons for behaving like ""barbarians"" at some of China's most sacred sites.""My brother and I, when we get together, we're just like the young lions we were — one missing obviously —  we're boxing and pushing and throwing our kids around, we were rambunctious, still are,"" he said""My father mostly encouraged that, but at certain times he had a sense — 'this is kind of a sacred place for people and here are my boys just bouncing off the walls behaving.'  ""We ended up injuring ourselves and we were sort of crippled the next day, and he was like: 'You guys are ridiculous. Stop behaving like barbarians. The Chinese see us as barbarians; often, you're giving them reason to do that.'""Hence the title,"" Alexandre said of why he chose the name for his book."
The world could face a 2nd wave of COVID-19: Here's what Canada needs to do now to prepare | CBC News,"Countries must prepare for a second wave of the COVID-19 outbreak to emerge once social distancing measures are eased, and they should only lift those measures gradually, infectious disease experts say. Here's what you need to know about a potential second wave and what Canada can do to minimize the impact.",2020-03-24T08:00:38.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/canada-covid-19-second-wave-1.5507522,"Canada and other countries must prepare for a second wave of the COVID-19 outbreak to emerge once social distancing measures are eased, and they should only lift those measures gradually, infectious disease experts say.A second wave of an outbreak is an increase in infections that occurs after a sustained period of time when there are no — or very few — new cases of that illness, said Dr. Isaac Bogoch, a Toronto General Hospital Research Institute clinical investigator, who specializes in infectious diseases.""Essentially, what we have now is physical distancing measures in place as one of a multi-pronged approach to curb the Canadian epidemic,"" said Bogoch. ""Now, of course, we cannot sustain these physical distancing measures for an infinite period of time.… They're tough on the individual level, they're tough for communities, they're tough for businesses, tough for kids.""The good news is that Canada has the opportunity to learn from countries where the epidemic started months earlier by observing how public health measures in those places work to keep the case load from bubbling up again once people start to emerge from their homes and go about business as usual, he said.Places in East Asia are facing a second wave of the virus now. For instance, on Friday, Hong Kong recorded its biggest daily jump in cases since the pandemic started, though mostly connected to infected travellers, who are returning from abroad after being prevented from going home before.Dr. Theresa Tam, Canada's chief public health officer, warned last week that ""this virus is going to be with us for some time. It will not be eradicated from the world in months.""""We will need to be prepared for another wave, potentially.""Like Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan, Canada will also experience its own second wave after seeing initial success containing the virus through the social distancing measures currently in place, Bogoch believes.""When we start to lift those measures in the months down the line, are we going to start to see a rebound of the virus? The answer is most certainly yes. We probably will see, to some extent, a greater number of cases as people mingle again as life slowly returns to normal.""Several modelling studies have been conducted to explore how effective social distancing is at dampening disease spread, said Bogoch, and almost all show that when the reins are eventually loosened, cases will tick up again.But he said there are steps we can take to minimize the extent of a second wave.""The hope is that we can slowly lift these measures, rather than have them completely lifted, and we can control the rebound of the virus such that it does not cause a situation where we overwhelm our health-care system and negate everything that we've done for the past few months.""The key will be to change social distancing policies ""very slowly and carefully,"" he said.Eleanor Fish, a professor of immunology at the University of Toronto whose research group conducted treatment studies during the 2003 outbreak of SARS in Toronto, said a true second wave of an outbreak involves new community transmissions, not just sick returning travellers who are swiftly moved into quarantine.She said countries like China, where new cases are also travel-related, could face a second round of the outbreak but are ""nowhere near"" that territory yet.Fish also said she believes a second wave is ""unlikely to happen here.""""We haven't locked down our borders to Canadians. So any of those who might want to return, are returning. We're asking them to self-isolate for 14 days."" That means Canada is less likely than other countries who shut their borders to citizens to have cases shoot up again upon their return.Fish said she's optimistic that the government is listening to the scientific community and learning from places, like Italy, by preparing for a surge of severe cases by doing things like securing more ventilators. She also said she was buoyed by progress of research groups testing various forms of treatment.""The public needs to be reassured that there's a lot coming up that's going to be very positive.""Jason Kindrachuk, an assistant professor at the University of Manitoba's department of medical microbiology, said that during the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic, there was both a second wave and a small third wave of the outbreak.But he said Canada can prepare now for a second wave of COVID-19 illnesses in a number of different ways.It can improve the supply of personal protective equipment for front-line health-care workers, as well as the materials needed for testing, both of which have already been a challenge in the first phase of the epidemic, said Kindrachuk, who holds a Canada Research Chair in emerging viruses.And although little is known yet about the seasonality of the virus and how much immunity people will have after recovering from the illness, Canada can look to the nations that are months ahead of it in the progression of the pandemic.""We can learn from what those countries do in terms of when they start reducing the requirements for social distancing to help guide our own procedures and time frame for doing that so we don't see spikes in increased transmission.""The true long-term strategy, said Bogoch, is the creation of an effective vaccination, ""which we know is more than a year away.""""But for now, we just have to put up with the physical distancing measures."""

Chinese company makes agreement to buy Nunavut gold mine | CBC News,"China's Shandong Gold Mining has entered a 'definitive agreement' to buy Canadian mining company TMAC Resources, which operates the Hope Bay mine in Nunavut.",2020-05-20T16:04:06.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/tmac-resources-purchase-agreement-1.5576240,"The company behind an ongoing gold project in Nunavut's Kitikmeot region, is all set to be sold to a Chinese mining company.TMAC Resources owns the Hope Bay gold mine project, located 125 kilometres southwest of Cambridge Bay.On May 8, the company announced a ""definitive agreement"" to sell to Shandong Gold Mining, a state-owned Chinese mining company, for around $230 million.The deal values TMAC at $1.75 per share — a 52 per cent premium on the share's average price, according to the announcement, and about 30 cents more per share than its listed price before the announcement.The sale must be approved by two-thirds of the company's shareholders. TMAC is also hoping to get the approval of the Kitikmeot Inuit Association (KIA), the land claim organization representing the region's Inuit, which owns one per cent of shares.Though a statement accompanying the announcement voiced tentative support for the agreement, it also made clear the organization hasn't decided yet if it will support the sale.TMAC would not comment on the sale until it was complete. Shandong Gold did not respond to requests for comment.""We have been impressed by TMAC's strong relationships with its local stakeholders and responsible management … and intend on demonstrating the same commitment,"" reads a statement attributed to Chen Yumin, chairman of Shandong Gold, accompanying the announcement of the sale.That release says the company will maintain targets for Inuit employment and royalty payments to the territorial and regional Inuit organizations, established in an impact benefit agreement between TMAC and KIA.They also pledged to continue contracting with local and Inuit-owned firms. Those contracts were valued at more than $68 million last year, according to filings from TMAC.The sale would bring to an end TMAC's eight years in charge of the Hope Bay property.The area's gold deposits, which could eventually produce nearly 150,000 kilograms of gold, have been owned by three different mining companies since they were first identified more than 30 years ago.In 2012, TMAC acquired it from Canadian mining giant Newmont Mining and, three years later, signed a 20-year land tenure agreement with the KIA and the territorial Inuit land claim organization Nunavut Tunngavik Inc.The property produced no gold for commercial sale until 2017, and in the time since its purchase, TMAC has poured more than $450 million into developing the deposits.It's likely to need a lot more investment. A ""pre-feasibility study"" published last March explored the possibility of more than doubling its output of ore, estimating the cost of expanding operations at more than $683 million.""Hope Bay … requires substantial investment to optimize production and extend mine life,"" Chen's statement acknowledges.But Shendong Gold ""has the financial strength, technical capability and long-term vision to maximize the value of the Hope Bay camp,"" a statement from Jason Neal, the president and chief executive officer of TMAC, reads.That value could extend beyond shareholders' pockets. Gold, which generated nearly $900 million in revenues in Nunavut last year, is the single biggest contributor to mining revenues and royalties for Inuit associations.The mine at Hope Bay is expected to produce as much as $400 million in royalties alone over its lifetime for KIA and Nunavut Tunngavik Inc.Those benefits have not always trickled down to communities. In 2018, TMAC fell short of modest goals for Inuit employment, failing to fill the equivalent of 70 full time positions, and was forced to pay a $90,700 fine as a result, filings with the Nunavut Impact Review Board show.Shandong Gold Mining is a state-owned Chinese gold mining company, centred in the eastern province of Shandong. It's the second-largest producer of gold in China by output, and the latest of several to expand its operations overseas.That expansion has been far from simple.In its sole international venture to date, Shandong Gold purchased a 50 per cent interest in Canadian company Barrick Gold's Veladero Mine in Argentina, to the tune of more than $1.3 billion.The mine is proving to be the most expensive per ounce of gold produced in Barrick's large portfolio.It's also been the site of several controversial spills, including the biggest mining accident in Argentinian history, when one million litres of cyanide solution was spilled in 2015, two years before Shandong Gold came on board.The day after Shandong Gold's purchase, the Argentine government threatened to rescind its license over a third cyanide spill inside 18 months, and workers at the camp went on strike over safety.Argentinian regulators have since been satisfied that the safety situation has improved — but workers at the camp continue to describe conditions there as ""intolerable.""Those early difficulties haven't dented the company's ambition. At the opening of their Toronto office in 2019, amid rising diplomatic tensions between China and Canada, Shandong Gold chairman Chen Yumin said he hoped the company would become one of the top 10 gold producers in the world.That would have benefits for Toronto's employment numbers, at least — the May 8 announcement also pledged to make the city the headquarters for its North and South American operations."

""He had planned to leave. This virus thing just messed it up. He's afraid because he has a little kid."" ""Right now [my son Felix] is fine,"" Michael said over WeChat, a Chinese messaging app, Thursday night. ""We're not even worried about this virus, but babies do get sick. We worry that if he does catch a cold or something like that, that we won't be able to take him to a hospital."" Michael said the initial response from Canada was slow but he has been more impressed in recent days. He said the Canadian government is attempting to find a way to allow his wife, who isn't a Canadian citizen, to come with him. His son, who is currently breastfeeding, is a Canadian citizen. The federal government announced Wednesday it's preparing a charter aircraft to bring trapped Canadians home. It's estimated nearly 200 Canadians are trapped in the lockdown.""We're not in Wuhan, but we just got an email saying that we have to somehow make it to Wuhan to make it on that flight,"" Michael said late Thursday night.""That's something we won't be able to do without some help.""When asked Thursday, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said there is no timeline for when that flight is scheduled to leave.So far, three cases of the coronavirus have been reported inside Canada, including a Toronto man in his 50s, his wife, and a B.C. man in his 40s. While one person in Ottawa was tested for the virus, Ottawa Public Health has confirmed the results were negative.  According to China's National Health Commission, the country's total number of deaths from the coronavirus has climbed to 213, with the number of those infected rising to 9,692.That's up nearly 2,000 cases and 43 deaths from the previous day.The virus — declared a public health emergency by a World Health Organization panel Thursday afternoon — has spread to at least 18 other countries. Still, Kate said she's not too concerned about her brother, who she says is taking precautions to ensure his family stays safe.""We're not going outside,"" Michael said. ""We're not taking any chances.""  And the Schellenbergs are anxious to meet Michael's wife and newborn baby for the first time.  ""Felix is so cute,"" Kate said. ""I think my parents are just desperate to meet him."" "

Rise of the robots: automation and tech becoming more popular as pandemic restricts human contact | CBC Radio,"Humans have long been fascinated by the idea of automatons. But increasingly, robots are also just reality as more work is automated. Automation that's exploded thanks to pandemic health concerns. This week, a look at the new rules we need to prepare for a world of automation. And, if we're going to work and live alongside robots, how do we design them so they don't creep us out?",2020-10-23T21:10:13.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/radio/spark/rise-of-the-robots-automation-and-tech-becoming-more-popular-as-pandemic-restricts-human-contact-1.5774901,"For years, the rapid advance of technology has stoked fears that robots are coming for humans' jobs.But when the COVID-19 pandemic shut everything down across the world in the spring, robots have come to the rescue — and public perception of them has become more positive as a result.""I've noticed headlines have changed regarding robots,"" Julie Carpenter, a research fellow with the ethics and emerging sciences group at California State Polytechnic, told Spark host Nora Young.""It's definitely pivoted from 'The robots are coming for your jobs' headlines to, 'Robots in the pandemic, and they'll save us all by shining UV light on everything,' and that sort of thing.""Headlines — and novel photographs — have depicted machines of all levels of sophistication bridging the gap between physically-distanced humans.In Toronto, the Tiny Mile AI robot is making food deliveries instead of couriers — at a discounted rate for restaurants compared to third-party delivery apps.Robots with powerful UV lights are being used to disinfect everything from hospitals in China to a wildlife rehabilitation centre in Manitoba.And in a Boston hospital, a doglike robot named Spot takes COVID patients' vital signs, reducing health-care workers' risk of contracting the coronavirus.TorontoFor all that robots and technology have done to help keep us safe during the pandemic, it hasn't completely assuaged fear of its effect on the job market.A Statistics Canada study released in June estimated that office support workers, salespeople and employees in industrial or construction trades were far more likely to lose their jobs to automation than people in careers like law, education and government.The study noted, however, that COVID-19 may affect those projections in ways that are ""largely unknown and dependent on several factors,"" the study authors wrote.""The closure of workplaces during the pandemic and efforts to minimize physical contact between people may motivate employers to 'virus-proof' their production practices by adopting technological solutions. Additionally, many businesses have moved much of their sales and customer services online, increasing their reliance on digital technologies,"" they explained.In the U.S., Time's Alana Semeuls explained that in the late 1800s and 1900s, companies retrained employees for new jobs to replace old jobs transformed by increasing automation and industrialization. And governments invested in education, as a workforce largely made up of farmers diversified into bankers, engineers and more.But today, tax incentives in the U.S. mean companies might pay less tax purchasing equipment than spending the same amount of money hiring workers.However, Frank Pasquale, a law professor at Brooklyn Law School, argues that human jobs don't have to be traded in for the inevitable advances in technology and artificial intelligence.In his book New Laws of Robotics: Defending Human Expertise in the Age of AI, he draws a line between AI, or artificial intelligence, and what he calls I.A., or intelligence augmentation.He gave an example of an AI robot doctor scanning a patient and handing out a diagnosis, compared to a human doctor using an advanced scanner to compare a person's vital signs to millions of archived images of cancerous and non-cancerous cells to help aid the diagnosis.""The idea is that ultimately you'd have the doctor as an intermediary between the technology and [the] person who's being treated,"" he said.As of now, a robot programmed with preferred responses to a patient or customer's questions is no substitute for genuine person-to-person communication — and Pasquale argues it's foolish to pretend otherwise.""The robot may simulate emotion and empathy, but because it is itself not mortal … it is sort of a counterfeiting of the human ability to understand, reflect, [and] empathize,"" he said.He developed four ""new laws of robotics"" to navigate its growing role in society, a play on sci-fi author Isaac Asimov's laws of robotics introduced in the 1942 short story Runaround.Pasquale's new laws are:Employ robotics and A.I. in ways that complement professionals, instead of replacing them.Prevent robots from mimicking human qualities like empathy or emotionAvoid ""arms races"" between robotics researchers.Keep record of who designed or controls a robot, in order to know who to contact — or hold responsible — in case something goes wrong.As the pandemic thrusts robots and automation further into the mainstream spotlight, some people may find them unusual, or even unnerving.Carpenter explained that many people's expectations of robots are based in science fiction. And in the West, at least, those depictions are often threatening. For every R2-D2 in Star Wars, she says, you'll find a seething Terminator — or the murderous robot dog in Black Mirror.""It's a combination of fascination at the technology, but also a little bit of fear [and] trepidation because they don't understand its capabilities and its limitations,"" said Carpenter.If you're introducing robots into the workplace, she said, talk to your colleagues about what they're being used for, and how they might affect everyone's work.""Have discussions with your staff. Say, this is what we're thinking about. These are the robots we're looking at. This is how your job might change,"" she said.Sometimes, Carpenter added, people might be more willing to embrace robots in the workplace if they take on a familiar form — like how the four-legged Spot resembles a dog.But she noted that people can develop an attachment to robots simply because of the roles they play, even without anthropomorphizing them.Carpenter studied how the U.S. military uses robots for tasks like bomb disposal for her book Culture and Human-Robot Interaction in Militarized Spaces.She found that many U.S. military forces use robots for sensitive or dangerous tasks, such as explosive disposal. Even though they looked more like miniature tanks, some soldiers would give them names, or consider them a mascot for their unit.""I want to emphasize, though, they would never regard it the same as a human teammate, at this point,"" she said.""But you can see … that we're navigating and negotiating where robots fit into our lives, even socially."""
"Beijing looks like a 'ghost town,' says BBC correspondent under quarantine | CBC Radio","After weeks of driving around China covering the spread of the coronavirus, Stephen McDonell is now staying put.",2020-01-30T23:32:47.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/radio/asithappens/as-it-happens-the-thursday-edition-1.5446163/beijing-looks-like-a-ghost-town-says-bbc-correspondent-under-quarantine-1.5446165,"TranscriptAfter driving around China covering the spread of the coronavirus, Stephen McDonell is now staying put. McDonell, the chief China correspondent for the BBC, has been forced to quarantine himself in his apartment in Beijing after returning from a visit to Hubei province, which is in lockdown. The World Health Organization said Thursday the coronavirus now represents a global health emergency. At least 212 people have died, most of them in Hubei.  Here is part of McDonell's conversation with As It Happens host Carol Off. You're covering one of the biggest stories in China in years, and yet you're forced to stay home in quarantine. As a reporter, what's that like?It's not too bad. At least I got to initially go to the sort of heart of it in Hubei province. And it's because we were there that upon returning to Beijing, I've had to stay at home for a couple of weeks, so as to not pass on the virus, potentially, to my colleagues.It's been a sort of a contrast. We certainly were crazy busy down there for a few days.It is also interesting here, though. Because Beijing — it's incredible. Like, normally, it's quiet anyway for the Spring Festival. But at the moment ... in this enormous city, there's barely anybody on the streets. Shops are closed, businesses also closed.We've had news now that these big companies — Toyota, Samsung, Ikea — are all delaying starting up work again after the Spring Festival break because of the fear of their workforce being contaminated. And it's like the whole country has gone into sort of ghost-town mode.For anyone who's normally been to China, it's not what you would expect it to be like.What's the level of fear that people are feeling right now?It's more serious when you're in the sort of what you might call ... the virus hot zone.The closer we're getting to Hubei, the more people are worried. There are obviously more checkpoints. There are police, there are medical teams dressed head-to-toe in protective gear. To pass those checkpoints, you need to have a temperature screening.Once you go into Hubei, well, of course, people are most worried there, because that's where the corona virus outbreak started. But I think mainly they're pretty happy that the government is taking this very decisive action — even though it's kind of Draconian and heavy-handed.Locking down a province of 60 million people — it's like the entire population of Italy not being able to move around — it is quite a drastic step to take. And yet most Chinese people, I think, can understand why it's being done. And even the World Health Organization isn't criticizing China over this.How did you get out? How difficult was it actually to cross a border and get out of that province and get back to Beijing?We sort of thought we'd ease ourselves in on a small little back street — a small road.But even on that very little road we were attempting to cross over the border, there was a police checkpoint. And when we went to go in the police were like, ""Well, we'll let you in. But we're not going let you back out again.""So we thought, well, what the hell? And we just pushed ahead and went in — not knowing how we'd get back out again.We travelled through lots of towns, which just felt like were completely deserted. If people had told you that nobody lived there anymore, you would believe it — apart from the odd person walking down the street, sort of hunched over with their face mask on. And then we went to a small city. And we were interviewing a patient from their hospital bed via a phone app.I wished this person good health ... and hung up the phone. As if on cue, the police turned up. And the local ... government officials were hot on their heels, and basically said they didn't want us there. And so we said to them, ""Well look, you know, even if we wanted to go, how would we get out of this province? Because you know it's all locked down.""""Oh, no worries,"" they said, and escorted us back across the border ... with the police lights flashing.It was more important for them to breach their own quarantine procedures than have a sort of team of pesky journalists hanging around.Interview produced by Chris Harbord. Q&A edited for length and clarity."

Manitoba cancels $5-million order for medical gowns in move local supplier calls 'ineffective and uninformed' | CBC News,The Manitoba government is being accused of being ‘ineffective’ in its attempts to secure protective personal equipment in the fight against COVID-19 after a Winnipeg supplier watched a $5 million PPE deal go sour because officials balked at the terms.,2020-04-22T10:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/ppe-covid19-manitoba-1.5540452,"The Manitoba government is being accused of being ineffective in its attempts to secure protective personal equipment in the fight against COVID-19 after a Winnipeg supplier watched a $5-million PPE deal go sour because officials balked at the terms. The CBC has learned the provincial government cancelled the $5-million order for gowns and goggles at the last minute because it refused to send money directly to China.""Slow, ineffective and uninformed,"" said wholesale supplier Craig Henderson, when asked about his experience working with procurement officials. ""(The government has) been presented with an absolutely honest and straightforward offer by two guys who have worked as hard as they can for almost three weeks now to try to get the PPE.""Henderson is the owner of Big Top Fireworks in West Kildonan and has spent decades importing fireworks for wholesale, with the majority of the product coming from China.When Health Minister Cameron Friesen issued a public plea on March 25 asking for businesses to help supply them with PPE to combat COVID-19, Henderson saw an opportunity to use the business relationships he built with suppliers in China to bring in these items. ""And as soon as I heard that I went, 'Well, I'm pretty sure I can do that.' And I went to look into it, contacted my guy over in China and began researching it,"" he said.""And by one day after the governments asked, we realized that we could supply masks and gowns and hand sanitizer and every other piece of PPE that they were requesting in very large quantities.""Using an agent on the ground in Hebei, an industrial hub in China, Henderson says he was able to find factories that could produce medical-grade gowns, N95 masks and other coveted PPE. Henderson had worked with this agent, Lai Weichang, for decades. On March 27, Henderson began emailing government officials, explaining what he could offer. Emails between Henderson and officials within the finance department show their initial interest was in obtaining N95 masks — which it then abandoned because of an ""export ban"" on N95s from China, according to an email from a civil servant to Henderson.Eventually, a $300,000 deal to purchase 100,000 Class 1 safety goggles was in the works and a $4.7-million purchase order was signed for 500,000 isolation gowns on April 12.These are medical-grade gowns used by health-care staff to protect them from infection.""We firmly had been told and were firmly of the opinion that the money was going to be transferred. We could lock down those factories at that price and that delivery schedule,"" Henderson told CBC last week. And within days, it all fell apart. ""I received a one-line email … essentially saying, 'No, we're not gonna do this,'"" Henderson said. The email told Henderson they were cancelling the purchase order for the gowns, because ""government is not going to make payments to a Chinese agent for this type of equipment.""Which baffled Henderson, as the purchase order was issued to a Chinese company, with a Chinese address.""I feel sorry for the health-care workers with the ineffective purchasing that's now occurring from the Manitoba government,"" Henderson said. As for the order for goggles, the procurement officer told Henderson he would prepare a purchase order on April 13 and then stopped returning his emails. Andrea Slobodian, a spokesperson for Manitoba's Central Services department, said the order was cancelled because the terms were changed to involve a direct payment to China. ""The province has made the conscious decision to work with local suppliers as much as possible and to source materials through and provide direct payment to Canadian and U.S.-based suppliers in order to provide legal and contractual protections,"" she said in a prepared statement.She said no one noticed it was a payment to a Chinese company until they went to add in the banking information.Manitoba's drive to get PPE to front line workers has been front and centre throughout the pandemic. While the Manitoba government announced in March it was first to sign up to work with federal health officials to secure PPE in a co-ordinated national effort, there have been multiple setbacks. Millions of supplies were ordered through the feds but the province only ""received a fraction of that,"" Manitoba Shared Health Chief Nursing Officer Lanette Siragusa said on April 8.This prompted the province to temporarily scale back a universal personal protective equipment protocol introduced at the beginning of April. On Tuesday, Siragusa announced a new protocol, abandoning the universal protocol in favour of a new guideline that ranks the level of PPE based on those with the highest risk and need. ""Supply levels and demand continues to be a challenge and changes day by day,"" she said. ""We are taking every possible step to ensure appropriate protection remains available for staff in risk situations and settings for the duration of this pandemic.""The province announced this week, following the CBC's questions, that it had made a deal to purchase up to 200,000 isolation gowns from MWG Apparel Corp. — a Winnipeg-based company which specializes in industrial workwear.In total, they have issued purchase orders for more than $100 million in COVID-related PPE, supplies and equipment since March 29, 2020, from suppliers in Manitoba, across Canada and internationally.Fraser Johnson, a supply chain expert and professor at the Ivey Business School at Western University, says this pandemic has been a learning experience for governments, which aren't used to fighting for access to these resources.""So you get some provinces going from buying anywhere from 20,000 to 50,000 N95 masks to buying over a million,"" he said. ""The system isn't built to be able to support that kind of volume.""Johnson called it a ""gamble"" for governments to use an unknown overseas supplier.""I've heard horror stories of people and organizations who brought stuff from Southeast Asia, China, shipped in and air-freighted it in and then to find out that it's counterfeit,"" he said.""So that is a significant problem.""Henderson said he is not in this for financial gain, but wants to see Manitobans get access to the PPE they need. The agent Henderson worked with in China has been his partner for two decades and he said he trusts him to only deal with licensed medical equipment. ""There are thousands of factories in China. That's what people have to be able to picture. He (his partner) works at those factories as hard as he can, finding qualified factories, making sure they're certified,"" Henderson said. Henderson is not alone in his frustration when it comes to the government's PPE procurement approach. Doctors across the province are feeling the pinch after a promise by Shared Health in mid-March to secure them the necessary PPE to open their offices to see patients has stalled. A survey of 400 doctors last week by Doctors Manitoba found that only 36 per cent received their PPE order through Shared Health Logistics and half of the orders were incomplete.Almost 60 per cent of those surveyed said they do not have the gowns recommended by provincial authorities and 43 per cent don't have appropriate eye protection.Danielle Paradis is a doctor in rural Manitoba, who splits her time between East Parkland Medical Group, a private clinic, and the Ste. Rose General Hospital. While she hasn't had to worry at the hospital, her clinic has been waiting since mid-March to get the PPE it ordered through Shared Health. ""Shared Health said, 'Yes if you contact us we will help ensure that PPE gets out to you,'"" she said. Instead, she was forced to purchase face shields, surgical masks and goggles out of pocket as they waited.""At this point it has been too slow and it's inadequate,"" she said of the government's response to getting them the PPE.""This is a rapidly changing pandemic here … the fact that we are still continuing to await PPE for weeks on end at this point, I think that is putting health-care providers and the community at large at risk."""

She recently travelled to China.Henry said Friday the woman returned from China through Shanghai this past week and had not been in an area with travel bans, such as Hubei province.She flew through Vancouver and drove in a private vehicle back to the Interior. Henry says she began experiencing symptoms upon her arrival and immediately isolated herself at home.Vancouver Coastal Health and Interior Health are conducting investigations into the small group of people with whom she had contact. Officials are still determining if people on the same flights as the patient need to be contacted, said Henry. She said the woman wore a mask while in transit. Henry says the woman reached out to health officials in the Interior about her illness and was placed in isolation in hospital. The B.C. Centre for Disease Control (BCCDC) said a test for the virus came back positive Thursday afternoon. That test must be confirmed by the National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg.The patient is in stable condition, and is now in isolation at home, said Henry. Those who are known to have come into contact with her are also in isolation at home.""So once again we're very thankful and grateful that the people who are coming back not just from Hubei province but all over China are taking the advice very seriously to self-monitor and to connect with us and make sure that they can be tested, assessed and cared for safely,"" Henry said.There are four other confirmed cases of the virus in the province, according to the BCCDC, and three in Ontario, according to the Public Health Agency of Canada. Health Minister Adrian Dix said Friday B.C. has done the most testing of any jurisdiction in Canada. As of this week, the BCCDC has conducted more than 715 tests for the coronavirus on about 500 people.WATCH | Dix explains why he's impressed with B.C.'s response:CBC News BCHenry says the man with the first confirmed case in the province is recovering. ""So that's a good sign,"" she said.A recent test said he is free of the illness. A second test confirming that will allow him out of isolation. ""So we fully expect that to happen soon,"" Henry said. All of the people in B.C. who have contracted the virus are in stable condition, Henry said.Anyone with concerns about their illness or who want to be assessed for coronavirus risk can call 811.China's National Health Commission has reported 5,090 new coronavirus cases on the mainland, for a total of 63,851. There have been 121 new deaths, bringing the death toll in mainland China to 1,380.Chinese officials say 1,716 health-care workers have been infected, and six have died.Public health officials say the risk is low in Canada."

International student recruitment behind growing Lakehead University partnership with Chinese private schools | CBC News,"A large operator of private schools in China opened its third high school on a Canadian university campus when it launched its site at Lakehead University this month, and officials with the northwestern Ontario institution say it will help strengthen international student recruiting in Asia.",2019-09-19T11:00:01.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/thunder-bay/lakehead-maple-leaf-schools-1.5288810,"A large operator of private schools in China opened its third high school on a Canadian university campus when it launched its site at Lakehead University in Thunder Bay this month, and officials with the northwestern Ontario institution say it will help strengthen international student recruiting in Asia.Maple Leaf Education has taught the British Columbia curriculum at its private schools in China and other countries since the mid-1990s, but opened its first two high schools in Canada at B.C. universities in 2016 and 2017. Earlier in September, Maple Leaf's Lakehead site opened with the first cohort of 33 Chinese students in Grades 10, 11 and 12.The school in Thunder Bay will teach the Ontario high school curriculum.The main benefit to Lakehead isn't necessarily that those students will transition to the university after they graduate, said David Barnett, the interim provost and vice president of academics at Lakehead, adding that he expects very few will.What the partnership will do, Barnett said, is raise Lakehead's profile in China — a large market for international students, and one where Lakehead recruits heavily.""Moreover than getting just the students that maybe want to stick around and go to university here, this is ... the largest school provider in China for private education,"" Barnett said of Maple Leaf Education. ""The affiliation ... is certainly a great way for us to explore international student recruitment more broadly in China and beyond.""Maple Leaf leases space at the university's Avila Centre.Canadian universities are increasingly relying on international student enrolment to sustain themselves, with one 2017 report projecting that the pool of university-aged prospective students from northern Ontario communities will continue to decline and likely won't recover.Within the past decade, ""we've gone from maybe 100, 150 students to close to 1,500 students now,"" Barnett said. ""China's a clearly important part of that and one of the early locations we went in to.""Lakehead has also had a relationship with Maple Leaf Education for over a decade, Barnett said, which includes graduates from their schools in China coming to study in Thunder Bay.The cohort at the Lakehead site will expand in subsequent years and include students from other countries as well, said Stuart McIlmoyle, the president of Maple Leaf's North American operations.The school on-campus allows students to get a taste of university life while completing high school in North America, he said.""They're focused on high school graduation, but with that opportunity to be able to be on a university campus,"" he said. ""At our B.C. university partners, students are able to have that dual credit experience where they're taking university courses from a select suite of courses and they're able to receive high school credit for those courses.""McIlmoyle said something like that could also come to the Thunder Bay campus as well.The opportunity for the students, however, isn't cheap.

Coronavirus lockdown traps permanent Canadian residents for foreseeable future | CBC News,Canadians with family still trapped in China's Hubei province are losing hope of seeing loved ones before the city of Wuhan is released from lockdown — or perhaps ever again.,2020-02-14T14:43:03.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/canada-premanent-residents-stuck-wuhan-china-1.5463686,"Canadians with family still trapped in China's Hubei province are losing hope of seeing loved ones before the city of Wuhan is released from lockdown — or perhaps ever again.In late December, Ottawa's Lisa Yu warned her parents against staying in Wuhan as rumours about the coronavirus's severity began to surface, but she said they didn't believe her.When the city of 11 million was placed in lockdown and countries began flying evacuees home, Yu's parents, permanent residents in Canada who also live in the suburb of Kanata, were unable to board either of the two flights Canada sent to Hubei.""I feel completely incapable of doing anything. I told them 'There is a possibility that we can't see each other for the last time' [if they become sick]. It is a real possibility,"" she said.""I feel the window of doing the rescue is closing up. The best scenario I can think of is for them to just stay there until whenever this [passes].""As of Monday, more than 400 Canadians and their families had been flown to Ontario and are now living in quarantine at CFB Trenton for 14 days to make sure they're not contagious.The decision to only allow Canadian citizens, or permanent residents accompanying Canadian minors, board the two flights Ottawa chartered home was made by Chinese officials. The NationalThe respiratory illness has no vaccine and can have a severe effect on older people or people with pre-existing medical conditions.Cassie Tao, 43, is also concerned for her parents, likewise stuck in the city and unable to return because of their permanent residency status.  ""I am [scared] more than them,"" the Coquitlam, B.C., resident said. As the number of people infected with the respiratory illness now officially called COVID-19 increased, her parents began to understand the magnitude of the crisis. Tao pleaded her parents' case to the Canadian federal government, but they still weren't permitted by Chinese officials to leave Wuhan. Now they're stuck without transportation.She said she cried when she heard the city had entered lockdown. Both her parents suffer from coronary heart disease. Her mother is 70 and her father is 74. ""It's too difficult for seniors,"" Tao said.Yu, now in the late stages of pregnancy, said her mother and father are 66 and 70.Her father had heart surgery a few years ago and is running out of medicine, she said.For now, Yu's parents are trapped in an apartment, healthy but with no way out. ""I feel their life and safety is threatened,"" she said.""No one can help them. The Chinese government. The Canadian government. No one can help them.""Pei Lu, a permanent Canadian resident who has called Saskatoon home for the past eight years, has been stuck in Wuhan ever since the city was placed in lockdown in late January. Lu is the only member of his family with a job and the only member stuck in China.""I need to work. I need [to be] with my family,"" he said. His parents have lent him money to send back to Canada to support his family, but Lu now fears he'll have to ask for more. While he has remained healthy through the last 20 days, he's uncertain when he'll be able to leave. Outside his window, the streets of the city are almost empty, Lu said. He calls his wife and two children every day, using the messaging app WeChat. When he does return home, he'd like to acquire Canadian citizenship. ""I'm sad,"" Lu said. ""[I had] no opportunity to go to the airplane.""With the death toll from coronavirus surpassing 1,350 out of about 47,000 confirmed cases, Yu believes the outbreak proves how incapable humans are handling such disasters. ""Now I'm just hoping [my parents] can stay in and not get sick,"" she said."

Why health experts advise cancelling cruises amid coronavirus | CBC News,"Experts warn that cruise liners pose special danger as the coronavirus crisis worsens, and call on the industry to rethink ship design.",2020-03-10T08:00:58.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/coronavirus-cruise-warnings-1.5491789,"The coronavirus outbreak on the cruise ship Diamond Princess started with a single passenger who came aboard in late January with a slight cough, and then developed a fever shortly after disembarking, six days later. By the time doctors in Japan started testing the remaining passengers and crew on Feb. 3, there were 10 cases. After a 14-day quarantine, that number ballooned to 619, with seven resulting deaths so far.  A new study modelling the onboard outbreak, published in the Journal of Travel Medicine, reaches some sobering conclusions about how much worse — or better — things might have gone.In the early stages of the shipboard epidemic, the rate of infection on the Diamond Princess was four times higher than in Wuhan, China, the epicentre of what has now become a global outbreak. Left unchecked, the disease would have eventually touched 79 per cent of those on board, some 2,900 people, the Swedish researchers calculate. However, if all passengers and crew had been relocated, assessed and, where necessary, isolated when the first 10 cases were discovered, the outbreak might have been limited to a total of 76 people, they say. The difference was the boat. ""The cruise ship conditions clearly amplified an already highly transmissible disease,"" the epidemiologists write. Doctors have long known that it doesn't take much to turn a pleasure cruise into a ship of sickness. Passengers and crew are regularly laid-low by influenza, food poisoning or gastrointestinal viruses like Norwalk. Over the past decade, cruise companies operating out of U.S. ports alone have reported an average of almost 3,200 such illnesses each year. But the coronavirus outbreaks aboard the Diamond Princess — and now its Carnival Cruises sister ship, the Grand Princess, where 21 people and counting have been diagnosed with COVID-19 — show how the close quarters of onboard life have become potentially life-threatening. The current generation of massive, floating luxury hotels — some of them ferrying more than 6,000 passengers, from all over the world, each voyage — can function like a Petri dish, creating the perfect environment for the spread of a plague.""Cruise ships really provide a fairly unique situation because you take a large group of people and you confine them to a rather limited space, and really you rely on excellent hand hygiene and infection-control measures to be in place to prevent infections from spreading very widely,"" said Dr. Abdu Sharkawy, an infectious disease specialist with the University Health Network and associate professor at the University of Toronto. Unlike airplanes, where a majority of passengers tend to originate from one region or country, cruise ships host travellers from all corners of the world. And while plane passengers share a confined space for a few hours, people aboard ships are in close quarters for days, if not weeks.On Monday, Canada's Chief Public Health Officer Dr. Theresa Tam, asked Canadians to ""think twice about being on cruise ships."" The U.S. Centers for Disease Control has similarly recommended that all travellers — and most particularly those with underlying health issues — ""defer"" cruise vacations for the foreseeable future. Sharkawy says, as March break approaches, vacationers need to ""use common sense"" and look at what has already happened on the high seas. ""If I had a cruise booked, I would frankly cancel it,"" he said. ""You just don't have that degree of control, you don't have that amount of flexibility when you're stuck on a vessel with 3,000, or 4,000, or more, other passengers and you're kind at the mercy of the local authorities.""Ross Klein, a sociologist at Memorial University in St. John's, has been studying the cruise industry for more than two decades, tracking outbreaks and other on-board problems. He says the cruise companies have developed a fairly workable strategy to deal with things like stomach bugs and the flu, with illnesses hitting just a tiny fraction of the 30 million passengers they carried globally in 2019. But that playbook clearly isn't working for COVID-19.""I think the coronavirus caught them by surprise and I think they just weren't sure what to do,"" says Klein. ""It's almost like being caught like deer in the headlights.""Klein says that part of the problem might be that a modest amount of sickness has traditionally been a money-maker for cruise companies. ""There's a revenue stream that comes from illness, not just the cost stream,"" he explains. On-board health care isn't free. ""U.S. physician prices, you know? I mean, $150 for an office visit. And if you need drugs, you've got to pay too … The doctor gets a commission, and the ship makes money, and everybody's happy. Except for the passenger who doesn't have insurance.""Over the weekend, the Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA), an industry body, unveiled a coronavirus action plan, which will deny boarding to people who have visited or travelled from South Korea, Iran or China, or anyone who has come in contact with a COVID-19 patient within the past 14 days. All passengers will also have their temperatures taken as they embark, with those showing a fever above 38 C referred for secondary screening. CBC NewsWhether such measures will be sufficient to protect cruise passengers, who tend to skew older — one-third of all who sail are aged 60 or above, the age group most at risk from COVID-19 — remains to be seen. The CLIA did not respond to a request for an interview. And the three major ocean cruise companies — Carnival, Royal Caribbean and Norwegian — all declined to provide CBC News on-board access to document their cleaning and coronavirus control measures. Some experts say the coronavirus crisis points to a need to reimagine the spaces where we work, play and travel, and to start adapting them for 21st century, global health challenges.""We have to think beyond the everyday experiences. We have to anticipate risks and respond to threats,"" said Lindsay Tan, who studies how pathogens and people intersect as director of the Design Ecology Lab at Auburn University in Alabama. ""So that's both the shape of spaces, how big they are, how many people are going to be in them, how they're going to be used, but also the materials that we're using. Different materials have different properties that carry different loads of virus; properties that are easier to clean.""For cruise companies that may mean challenging consumers' definition of ""high-end"" and moving from fabric finishes to surfaces that can be more easily cleaned. ""If I told you that your cruise ship was going to have a vinyl headboard you might not think that sounds really luxurious, but I assure you there are properties that we can put into vinyl now that allow it to be comfortable, luxurious and safe,"" says Tan. ""We're already doing it in health-care spaces. You can have a seat that is beautiful and comfortable, and it's also able to be washed down with bleach."" The cruise industry is trying its best to weather the storm, by waiving cancellation fees and penalties, and offering full credit for passengers who agree to rebook for future voyages. Klein predicts that major PR campaigns and deep discounts will soon follow, in an effort to quell public fears.That's what has worked with past outbreaks of lesser illnesses. But with lives on the line, convincing people that it is safe to sail, might be a much tougher sell.""It could be years and years before people have confidence,"" said Klein."
Waterford Wedgwood shifts to Asia to save company | CBC News,"For more than two centuries, Waterford crystal and Wedgwood china have been symbols of Irish and British craftsmanship. Now, their future may lie in Asia.",2008-12-31T15:50:07.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/waterford-wedgwood-shifts-to-asia-to-save-company-1.750184,"For more than two centuries, Waterford crystal and Wedgwood china have been symbols of Irish and British craftsmanship. Now, their future may lie in Asia.Drowning in red ink, the storied brands, which merged in 1986, have moved most ceramics production to Indonesia to cut costs and now plan the same fate for crystal manufacturing. Their headquarters may soon follow.Short of funds for operations and loan payments, Waterford Wedgwood PLC is in advanced talks to sell a controlling stake to a U.S. private equity fund for roughly $1.02 billion in cash and assumed debt, three people briefed on the negotiations said late last week.The prospective new owners may move the company's management and possibly its headquarters to Indonesia, one of the sources said. They would not identify the fund and spoke on condition of anonymity because the talks are confidential. With a Friday deadline set by creditors, a deal could come as soon as this week, though the Bank of America-led lender group has extended the company's deadline three times previously.Waterford Wedgwood, which lost $129 million in the six-month period ending Oct. 4, has struggled for several years like other fine china makers, as formal dining trends continue to give way to more informal habits. But the global financial crisis has pushed it to the brink of bankruptcy. As credit dried up, the company could no longer raise money to cover costs. Its shares have collapsed to one-tenth of a euro cent on the Irish Stock Exchange.Workers have made Waterford crystal in Ireland and Wedgwood china in England for nearly 250 years. Their crafts have graced the tables of royalty and made innumerable wedding gifts for the better-off in the United States and elsewhere. But six years of losses have driven Wedgwood to move all major ceramics production from the green hills of Staffordshire county in central England to the industrial outskirts of Jakarta over the past two years.Only a small number of high-end products — hand-painted figurines and the iconic blue and white china — will continue to be made in England. The move to Indonesia, which cost 1,500 jobs in England, follows the opening of a smaller ceramics factory in China in 2004.On the Waterford side, half of its crystal production was shifted to Eastern Europe last year, cutting 1,400 jobs in Ireland. Now, the company is looking to move all crystal work to Asia, with Indonesia a prime candidate.""This is part of an expansive search for the best partners to work with in Asia,"" said James Philip Murtagh, senior vice-president of Waterford Ltd.The move to Indonesia all but brings down the curtain on English clay processing in a region nicknamed ""The Potteries."" At its peak, the industry employed tens of thousands.The $50 million move to Indonesia will cut manufacturing costs in half and, it is hoped, enable the business to turn a profit in 2009 or 2010, depending on the depth of the global slowdown, said Tony O'Reilly Jr., whose family is one of two that together own a majority stake in Waterford Wedgwood.The move became inevitable because of rising energy costs, shrinking sales and the falling U.S. dollar, which ate into profits from the important U.S. market, company executives said.After onsite training, Indonesians have taken up positions as managers, designers, technicians and painters at a factory that can produce 10 million pieces a year. It will employ about 1,750 workers by early 2009 as severance packages are settled in England, O'Reilly said.With an average monthly salary of about 1.8 million rupiah ($183), compared with $2,380 in Britain, their work is vastly cheaper. The reduced costs will enable Waterford Wedgwood to boost spending on marketing and create new products, some with a hint of the Indonesian culture of batik and shadow puppets.Though the packaging will say ""Made in Indonesia,"" all pieces will still be stamped ""Wedgwood. England 1759"" — labelling the company says is permitted under international trade law."
"Arctic nations need to adapt in 'an arena of global power,' Pompeo says | CBC News","The Trump administration has warned China and Russia that the U.S. won't stand for aggressive moves in the Arctic region, which is rapidly opening up to development and commerce as temperatures warm and sea ice melts.",2019-05-06T14:17:28.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/pompeo-arctic-speech-finland-1.5124219,"The Trump administration warned China and Russia on Monday that the U.S. won't stand for aggressive moves in the Arctic region, which is rapidly opening up to development and commerce as temperatures warm and sea ice melts.In a speech in Finland, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the U.S. will compete for influence in the Arctic and counter attempts to make it the strategic preserve of any one or two nations. He said the rule of law must prevail for the Arctic to remain peaceful and slammed both China and Russia for what he said were coercive practices that would destabilize the ""high North"" if repeated.""The region has become an arena of global power and competition, and the eight Arctic states must adapt to this new future,"" Pompeo said in the speech, delivered a day before he participates in a meeting of foreign ministers from the Arctic Council.In addition to the U.S., Russia and Finland, the council includes Canada, Denmark, Iceland, Norway and Sweden.He said the council had once been able to focus solely on non-controversial scientific, environmental and cultural issues but that the profound changes in the Arctic's environment and strategic rivalries no longer offered that luxury.""We're entering a new age of strategic engagement in the Arctic, complete with new threats to Arctic interests and its real estate,"" he said.For the U.S. he said that means boosting America's security and diplomatic presence with new military exercises, icebreakers and expanded Coast Guard Operations.Pompeo took particular aim at China, which, unlike Russia, does not have any territory or claim in the Arctic.Chinese attempts to inject itself into the region's affairs by pushing massive infrastructure projects and commercial investments must be checked, Pompeo said. He rejected China's assertion that it is a ""near-Arctic nation.""""There are only Arctic States and Non-Arctic States,"" he said. ""No third category exists-and claiming otherwise entitles China to exactly nothing.""Pompeo said responsible Chinese investment is welcome in the Arctic but said China's history of predatory activities elsewhere are cause for concern.""China's pattern of aggressive behaviour elsewhere will inform how it treats the Arctic,"" he said, noting its increasing assertiveness in the South China Sea, which has alarmed many of its smaller neighbours. ""Do we want the Arctic Ocean to transform into a new South China Sea, fraught with militarization and competing territorial claims?"" he asked.Similarly, Pompeo warned that Russia's intentions in the Arctic, where it has embarked on a massive military expansion campaign, may prove destabilizing given its past record.""We know Russian territorial ambitions can turn violent,"" he said, pointing to the conflict in eastern Ukraine. ""Just because the Arctic is a place of wilderness does not mean it should become a place of lawlessness.""Despite Pompeo's warnings and defence of U.S. positions, many council members and observers are equally alarmed by the Trump administration's environmental policies and skepticism of climate change. Many of those critics fear the administration is intent on exploiting the Arctic with no thought for its consequences or mitigation.A prepared text of Pompeo's speech, for example, ran to 2,400 words but did not mention ""climate change."" He spoke of ""steady reductions in sea ice"" but did not address the cause, focusing instead on the opportunity those reductions present. ""Arctic sea lanes could become the 21st century's Suez and Panama Canals,"" he said.He called the Arctic ""a frontier of opportunity and abundance"" with untouched oil and gas reserves, unmined uranium, raw earth minerals, precious metals and gems.Pompeo sought to assuage environmental concerns by committing to safe and responsible development.And, he pointed to the U.S. record on reducing greenhouse gas emissions despite President Donald Trump's decision to withdraw from the Paris climate accord. Critics argue that those reductions are the result of policies enacted before Trump took office and could be reversed."

Simon is safe,"" said Max Chung, organizer of a rally earlier this week to urge the British government to step up efforts to free Cheng. ""We've just managed to talk to him over the phone,"" he said, adding that Cheng would answer any further questions but did not say when.Cheng's detention stoked tensions in semi-autonomous Hong Kong, which has been rocked by months of anti-government protests. Cheng, a Scottish government trade and investment officer, was hired locally and did not have a diplomatic passport. He was detained after he left for a business trip on the mainland at a Hong Kong high-speed train station.The Chinese government has said he was detained for violating public order regulations. The Global Times, a Communist Party-owned nationalistic tabloid, said Thursday he was detained for ""soliciting prostitutes."" China often uses public order charges against political targets and has sometimes used the charge of soliciting prostitution.The British consulate did not respond to a request for comment."

Forced to work against our will. Please help us and notify human rights organization.""Use the link to contact Mr Peter Humphrey.""Peter Humphrey is a British former journalist and corporate fraud investigator.Humphrey and his American wife, Yu Yingzeng, were both sentenced in China in 2014 for illegally obtaining private records of Chinese citizens and selling the information to clients including drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline.

Conservative Leader Erin O'Toole downplays talk of a fall federal election | CBC News,"Conservative Leader Erin O'Toole today downplayed talk of the Tories triggering a fall election, saying he's more focused on holding the Liberal government to account over its efforts to rebuild an economy ravaged by the COVID-19 pandemic.",2020-09-02T18:39:36.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/erin-otoole-fall-election-1.5709569,"Conservative Leader Erin O'Toole today downplayed talk of the Tories triggering a fall election, saying he's more focused on holding the Liberal government to account over its efforts to rebuild an economy ravaged by the COVID-19 pandemic.O'Toole said his party is ready for an election and it has enough money on hand to run a full campaign if one is called after the Sept. 23 speech from the throne.He said the Conservatives already have organizers in place across the country in case the Trudeau government falls on a non-confidence motion this month — which would trigger an election before Christmas — but insisted an early election is not his focus a week into the job as Conservative leader.""If they want to rattle sabres, they will find that our sabre is sharp,"" O'Toole said of the Liberals. ""But I'm not here for an election. I'm here for the re-launch of our economy post-COVID.""Watch: Conservative Leader Erin O'Toole on the prospects for a fall electionPolitics NewsThe Conservative leader said he would not do away with current relief payment programs like the Canadian Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) — but he does want to see more of a focus on transitioning Canadians back to normal employment. ""I think the relaunch will be more difficult because of slow action by the Trudeau government and so I want to make sure we fight for the opportunity for Canadians in any part of this country to work to provide for their families,"" he said.Speaking to CBC Radio in Vancouver today, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau defended the government's decision to prorogue Parliament and shut down the parliamentary committees studying the WE Charity affair, saying it's a chance for the opposition parties to either vote on ambitious Liberal plans to rebuild the economy or force an election.""The speech from the throne ... will allow opposition parties to weigh in on whether or not they agree with the new direction we're taking for building back Canada. That is a fundamentally important thing in our democracy,"" he said.The Conservatives alone could not bring down the government, given the current party standings in the Commons. O'Toole would have to join forces with both the Bloc Québécois and the NDP to launch an election by voting against the speech.O'Toole also made it known today that he will be pushing the Liberal government to take a harder line on China.He said he favours slapping sanctions on senior Chinese Communist Party officials through provisions of the Sergei Magnitsky Act.The law allows the federal government to impose financial and other restrictions on foreign nationals responsible for, or complicit in, violating internationally recognized human rights.Citing China's detention of Uighur Muslims, its crackdown on democratic rights in Hong Kong, its decades-long repression of Tibet and its imprisonment of Canadians Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig, O'Toole said sanctions would signal the Canadian government is taking a much more ""serious approach"" to Beijing's abuses.""Canadians deserve to know the difference between Mr. Trudeau and myself. He was famous for saying the country he most admired was China. The country I most admire is Canada, the one I've served my whole life. We have to take a stronger, more principled approach to China,"" he said.O'Toole today also named the MPs who will sit on the Tory front bench as part of his House of Commons leadership team — parliamentarians who still stare down the Liberal government in question period and challenge ministers on their files.O'Toole said he hopes his choices will encourage more Canadians to ""see themselves reflected in our conservative movement.""Of the eight people picked Wednesday, two are women, one is a visible minority and another is a gay man.His primary opponent in the contentious leadership race, Peter MacKay, had picked up the most caucus endorsements. Some of those who sided with O'Toole have now been rewarded with leadership positions.O'Toole put his own stamp on the party today, moving out some of the MPs that held top jobs under former leader Andrew Scheer.Scheer himself has not been named to the House leadership team but could be picked as a critic — or as the party calls it, a ""shadow minister"" — when O'Toole releases those names at a later date.Watch: Erin O'Toole names his House leadership teamThe most notable demotion was for Leona Alleslev, a former Liberal MP who defected to the Tories in September 2018. Alleslev served as deputy leader under Scheer but has now been swapped out.Instead, Manitoba MP Candice Bergen will take on the role as deputy leader, a position also held previously by former Ontario MP Lisa Raitt before her 2019 election defeat.Bergen was first elected in 2008 and was a junior cabinet minister in Stephen Harper's government.Until today, Bergen had served as the party's House leader — a key position in a minority Parliament, given the constant negotiations between government and the opposition parties over legislation and votes. Bergen demanded changes to a number of COVID-19-related programs over the last six months before the Tories agreed to pass the bills into law.A Quebecer, MP Gerard Deltell, slides into the House leader role. Southwestern Ontario MP Karen Vecchio will be the deputy House leader, replacing another Scheer ally — Alberta MP Chris Warkentin.Bergen, one of only three westerners on O'Toole's House leadership team, said she would focus her efforts on addressing political alienation in the West at a time when the natural resources sector in this country — notably the oil and gas industry — is facing massive job losses and price declines.""We want Canadians from every part of the country to know that they are important, that they are valuable and that they are being listened to by Conservatives,"" Bergen said.Richard Martel, a former hockey coach who won his Quebec seat Chicoutimi—Le Fjord in a 2018 byelection, will be O'Toole's new Quebec lieutenant.Martel replaces MP Alain Reyes, a Scheer loyalist. O'Toole said he will redeploy Reyes to another role in his shadow cabinet.Alberta MP Blake Richards will be the party's whip, with support from deputy opposition whip Alex Ruff.A party whip acts as an enforcer-in-chief, ensuring there are enough party members in the chamber for debates and votes. The whip also decides on other key questions — such as which committees a member will sit on — and assigns office space and seats in the chamber.Alberta MP Tim Uppal, a Sikh, will serve as O'Toole's caucus/party liaison.

Coronavirus: What's happening around the world Sunday | CBC News,"Pope Francis is cautioning people in countries emerging from coronavirus lockdowns to keep following authorities' rules for COVID-19 containment. ""Be careful, don't cry victory, don't cry victory too soon,"" he said Sunday.",2020-06-07T14:20:32.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/coronavirus-what-s-happening-around-the-world-sunday-1.5602076,"The confirmed global death toll from the COVID-19 virus reached at least 400,000 fatalities on Sunday, a day after the government of Brazil broke with standard public health protocols by ceasing to publish updates of the number of deaths and infections in the hard-hit South American country.Worldwide, at least 6.9 million people have been infected by the virus, according to Johns Hopkins University, whose aggregated tally has become the main worldwide reference for monitoring the disease.Its running counter says the U.S. leads the world with nearly 110,000 confirmed virus-related deaths. Europe as a whole has recorded more than 175,000 since the virus emerged in China late last year.Health experts, however, believe that the John Hopkins tally falls short of showing the true tragedy of the pandemic.Many governments have struggled to produce statistics that can reasonably be considered as true indicators of the pandemic given the scarcity of diagnostic tests, especially in the first phase of the crisis. Authorities in Italy and Spain, with over 60,000 combined deaths, have acknowledged that their death count is larger than the story the numbers tell.Brazil's government has stopped publishing a running total of coronavirus deaths and infections; critics say it's an attempt to hide the true toll of the disease.Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro went as far as to tweet on Saturday that his country's disease totals are ""not representative"" of Brazil's current situation, insinuating that the numbers were actually overestimating the spread of the virus.Critics of Bolsonaro, who has repeatedly clashed with health experts over the seriousness of the disease and has threatened to take Brazil out of the World Health Organization, said the decision was a maneuver by the hardman-style leader to hide the depths of crisis.Brazil's last official numbers recorded over 34,000 virus-related deaths, the third-highest toll in the world behind the U.S. and Britain. It reported nearly 615,000 infections, putting it second behind the U.S.Canada had 95,699 confirmed and presumptive coronavirus cases as of 1:30 p.m. ET Sunday, according to a CBC News tally, including 33,630 active cases and 54,221 recoveries.At least 7,848 people in Canada have died from coronavirus.WATCH | Scientists aim to reduce waste from created from disposable pandemic supplies:The NationalHere's a look at what's happening around the world on Sunday. Spain is preparing to take another step forward in the scaling back of its containment with Madrid and Barcelona opening the interiors of restaurants with reduced seating on Monday.In France, the government announced that from Tuesday, it will ease restrictions limiting travel from the French mainland to overseas territories in the Caribbean and Indian Ocean.In Turkey, Istanbul residents flocked to the city's shores and parks on the first weekend with no lockdown, prompting a reprimand from the health minister.Russia remained troubling, with nearly 9,000 new cases over the past day, roughly in line with numbers reported over the past week.India confirmed 9,971 new coronavirus cases in another biggest single-day spike, a day before it prepares to reopen shopping malls, hotels and religious places after a 10-week lockdown.Pakistan is pushing toward 100,000 confirmed infections as medical professionals plead for more controls and greater enforcement of social distancing directives. But Prime Minister Imran Khan said a full shutdown would devastate a failing economy.China has reported its first non-imported case in two weeks, an infected person on the island of Hainan off the southern coast.South Korea has reported 57 additional cases of the coronavirus, marking a second day in a row that its daily jump is above 50 as authorities struggle to suppress a spike in fresh infections in the densely populated Seoul metropolitan area.Britain will allow places of worship to reopen on June 15 — but only for private prayer."

Mystery surrounds explosion in North Korean city on Chinese border | CBC News,A video obtained by The Associated Press shows plumes of black smoke rising from a North Korean city near the border with China amid reports that deadly explosions occurred there earlier this week.,2020-08-05T14:18:13.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/north-korea-hyesan-explosion-1.5674866,"A video obtained by The Associated Press shows plumes of black smoke rising from a North Korean city near the border with China amid reports that deadly explosions occurred there earlier this week.There has been no official word from North Korea or China about what happened in the North Korean city of Hyesan on Monday. But South Korean media and outside monitoring groups reported that gas explosions in a residential area left dozens of people dead or injured. The AP couldn't independently confirm the reports.The video acquired by AP shows orange flames and black smoke shooting into the sky from Hyesan as loud explosion-like sounds are heard. A few people can be seen watching the scene from the Chinese side of the border.The video was provided by Wang Bo, a travel agent who said he shot it from a park in the Chinese border town of Changbai.""I just saw explosions and there were a lot of onlookers who were looking in that direction. We don't know the reason why there were explosions,"" Wang said.Wang, who said he has previously visited Hyesan, said the explosions happened not far from the city's orphanage and tourism office.Many Chinese border towns are very close to North Korea, separated only by the river border.Wang said from Binjiang Park in Changbai, where he shot the video, ""in summer, we can see North Koreans swim in the river, and in winter, people can walk on the frozen Yalu River.""The Associated Press verified the location after examining other tourist videos of the park that show the same structures and lights. Other videos of the reported explosions have been circulating on Chinese and South Korean social media.In Seoul, South Korea's spy agency and the Unification Ministry, which handles relations with North Korea, said they couldn't immediately confirm the reported explosions. Still, Unification Ministry spokesperson Yoh Sangkey told reporters he felt sorry for any possible casualties.The Seoul-based Daily NK, which specializes in North Korea news, on Wednesday cited unidentified sources in North Korea as saying that the explosions left 15 people dead and the death toll could rise. It earlier reported that gasoline stored at a house in Hyesan ignited and led to the explosion of a nearby liquid petroleum gas cylinder, and this caused chain explosions of gas cylinders attached to other houses.Other South Korean media carried similar reports. Ahn Kyung-su, a researcher, said one of his North Korean refugee sources in South Korea told him that she heard from her relative in Hyesan about the reported explosions during a phone conversation on Tuesday.North Korean state media, which rarely acknowledge deadly accidents in the country, haven't commented on the reported explosions.But in 2017, state media reported six people died when the roof of a mine collapsed. In 2014, state media said government officials had offered an apology for the collapse of an apartment building under construction in Pyongyang, the capital."

The sickened child lives in Contamines and attends a local school, and took French classes at another local school, regional officials told a news conference Saturday. Both schools will be closed, and the pupils will be monitored for signs of the virus.The infected Britons had been hospitalized overnight in the region, the ministry added.The virus has killed more than 720 people and infected over 34,500 since late December, mostly in China's Hubei province and elsewhere across mainland China."
U.S. charges 4 Chinese military hackers in Equifax breach probe | CBC News,"Four Chinese military hackers have been charged with breaking into the computer networks of the Equifax credit reporting agency and stealing the personal information of tens of millions of Americans, the U.S. Justice Department announced Monday.",2020-02-10T00:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/us-justice-charges-china-equifax-1.5458110,"Four members of the Chinese military have been charged with breaking into the networks of the Equifax credit reporting agency and stealing the personal information of tens of millions of Americans, the U.S. Justice Department said Monday, blaming Beijing for one of the largest hacks in history.The 2017 breach affected roughly 145 million Americans, with the hackers successfully stealing names, Social Security numbers and other personal information stored in the company's databases.  The four — members of the People's Liberation Army (PLA), an arm of the Chinese military — are also accused of stealing the company's trade secrets, law enforcement officials said. They were identified in a news release as Wu Zhiyong, Wang Qian, Xu Ke and Liu Lei.The case comes as the Trump administration has warned against what it sees as the growing political and economic influence of China, and efforts by Beijing to collect data on Americans and steal scientific research and innovation.The accused hackers allegedly exploited a software vulnerability to gain access to Equifax's computers, obtaining log-in credentials that they used to navigate databases and review records. The indictment also details efforts the hackers took to cover their tracks, including allegedly wiping log files on a daily basis and routing traffic through dozens of servers in nearly 20 countries.""The scale of the theft was staggering,"" Attorney General William Barr said Monday. ""This theft not only caused significant financial damage to Equifax, but invaded the privacy of many millions of Americans, and imposed substantial costs and burdens on them as they have had to take measures to protect against identity theft.""Equifax, headquartered in Atlanta, maintains a massive repository of consumer information that it sells to businesses looking to verify identities or assess creditworthiness.The case is one of several the U.S. Justice Department has brought over the years against members of the PLA. The Obama administration in 2014 charged five Chinese military hackers with breaking into the networks of major American corporations to siphon trade secrets.The indictment, which details efforts the hackers took to cover their tracks, includes charges of conspiracy to commit computer fraud, conspiracy to commit economic espionage and conspiracy to commit wire fraud.The indictment also alleges that the hackers ""obtained personally identifiable information belonging to nearly a million citizens of the United Kingdom and Canada."" It did not provide a breakdown, but weeks after the breach, Equifax estimated the number of customers affected at around 700,000 in the United Kingdom and nearly 20,000 in Canada.Equifax was criticized soon after the hack for not acting on earlier warnings of vulnerabilities and not noticing the intrusions for weeks, but on Monday government officials credited the company with aiding the investigation.Equifax officials told the U.S. Government Accountability Office that the company made many mistakes, including having an outdated list of computer systems administrators. When the company circulated a notice to install a patch for the software vulnerability, the employees responsible for installing the patch never got it.Wu Zhiyong, Wang Qian, Xu Ke, and Liu Lei face charges of computer fraud, economic espionage, and wire fraud for their role in one of the largest thefts of personally identifiable information by state-sponsored hackers ever recorded. <a href=""https://t.co/KcZ8lOfpbd"">https://t.co/KcZ8lOfpbd</a> <a href=""https://t.co/65vDyh4HTx"">pic.twitter.com/65vDyh4HTx</a>The company CEO at the time, Richard Smith, was replaced as a result of the failures.Equifax last year reached a $700 million US settlement over the data breach, with the bulk of the funds intended for consumers affected by it. However, because so many people made claims, officials said some consumers would get far less than the eligible amounts because of caps in the settlement pool."

Canada set to postpone Huawei 5G decision to after the election - sources | CBC News,"Canada is likely to postpone a decision on whether to allow China's Huawei Technologies Co Ltd to supply 5G network equipment until after the October federal election, given increasingly strained relations with Beijing, say three well-placed sources.",2019-07-15T18:24:37.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canada-china-huawei-5g-1.5212349,"Canada is likely to postpone a decision on whether to allow China's Huawei Technologies Co Ltd to supply 5G network equipment until after the October federal election, given increasingly strained relations with Beijing, say three well-placed sources.The sources, who requested anonymity given the sensitivity of the situation, said the Liberal government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was reluctant to move until the fate of two Canadians detained in China became clearer.China detained Canadians Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor last December and later charged them with spying. Beijing acted after Canadian police arrested Huawei's chief financial officer on a U.S. warrant, a move condemned by China.Experts in Ottawa are reviewing the security implications of 5G networks, including Huawei's participation. The United States is concerned the use of Huawei equipment could undermine national security.Two sources with direct knowledge of the situation said there was no chance of an announcement before the election. A third source stressed a final decision had not yet been made but added it was unlikely details would be released in time for the vote.A postponement could irritate telecommunications companies such as BCE Inc and Telus Corp, which cannot proceed with their plans for 5G wireless networks until Ottawa comes to a decision.The 5G issue is entangled in the broader trade and diplomatic dispute with China. Trudeau has condemned the arrests of Kovrig and Spavor and several Canadian allies, including the United States, are calling for their release.Whether Canada was willing to allow a Chinese company to dominate an important part of the telecommunications network for the next generation was an important issue, said the third source.China has also stopped importing some Canadian commodities.Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale, in charge of the 5G review, said in late April he intended the results to be made public by the election.""We will be taking appropriate decisions in due course,"" said Goodale spokesman Scott Bardsley. Bell, Telus and Huawei did not respond to requests for comment.Recent polls suggest the Liberals could retain power, fending off a challenge from the rival Conservative Party, which has said it would not allow Huawei 5G technology.A decision before October would not help Trudeau with voters, said the third source. Banning Huawei could anger Beijing but a positive decision would leave him open to attacks that he was ignoring the detainees' fate.The question of whether Huawei's 5G equipment could contain backdoors allowing access to spies is dividing Canada and its partners in the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing network.The United States, Australia and New Zealand have bans in place while Britain is taking a less firm line, indicating Huawei's 5G products could be used in less sensitive areas.Canada is watching what Britain does very closely, said the third source, indicating Ottawa could take a similar decision. Huawei has repeatedly insisted Beijing has no influence over it.In the meantime, Rogers Corp, Canada's third major telecommunications company, has announced it will use 5G equipment from Telefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson.""(That) potentially gives them quite a head start ... at a certain point the clamour from Bell and Telus will be louder than it is now,"" said the second source.Smaller telecommunications firms such as SaskTel in the western province of Saskatchewan are chafing at the delay.""It's a challenge for us ... we're pushing hard to get some answers from the federal government,"" Don Morgan, the cabinet minister responsible for SaskTel, said on July 8."

'Righteous ... but dangerous': What Trump stands to win and lose from Taiwan relations | CBC News,"U.S. president-elect Donald Trump's official call with the leader of Taiwan breaks diplomatic protocol, a move that could lead to an economic and military standoff, Asia analysts warn.",2016-12-06T03:04:31.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/trump-taiwan-diplomacy-china-policy-1.3882429,"More than two decades before U.S. president-elect Donald Trump's phone call with Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen broke longstanding diplomatic protocol last week, one of Tsai's predecessors triggered a scary response from China. One that eventually drew in the American military and could foreshadow how combustible U.S.-China relations can get.In 1995, U.S. Congressional leaders cleared the way for former Taiwanese president Lee Teng-hui to speak at his alma mater, Cornell University, a trip that so outraged Beijing that the Communist power fired missiles into the Taiwan Strait.The incident touched off what became known as the Third Taiwan Strait Crisis, an eight-month-long display of sabre-rattling involving ballistic ""tests"" that only ceased after U.S. president Bill Clinton dispatched military ships into the region, causing China to back off.China has only grown more powerful in the intervening 21 years.The lesson this time for Trump? Tread very carefully when risking offending the volatile superpower, particularly when it comes to giving off the impression of recognizing Taiwan as an independent democratic state, says Orville Schell, the Asia Society's Arthur Ross director of the Center on U.S.-China Relations.Such a radical shift in foreign policy could spark an economic standoff with China. With China occupying one of five votes on the United Nations Security Council, it could also jeopardize co-operation when it comes to imposing sanctions on Iran or partnering against nuclear proliferation of North Korea.""Is it dangerous? Absolutely. It may be righteous, but it's dangerous,"" Schell says of moving toward diplomatic ties with the island of 23 million, which China considers among its 23 provinces. ""It could very easily erupt into warfare.""During his election campaign, Trump adopted an ""America first"" approach, boasting about a tough-on-China policy, characterizing Beijing as a currency manipulator and proposing slapping 45 per cent tariffs on imports from China.His unorthodox chat with Tsai, the first time in 37 years that an American president or president-elect communicated officially with a Taiwanese counterpart, was widely viewed as a provocative move.Schell warns of the consequences of disrupting the ""very calibrated dance"" the U.S. and China have swayed to in order to maintain peace in the Taiwan Strait.""Constructive ambiguity"" was the term that former secretary of state Henry Kissinger used to define this balance. ""Trump's vice is his sort of reckless way he proceeds into an issue without fully understanding it,"" Schell says. ""He is the disrupter. Some of these disruptions could be surprisingly constructive. Others could be dangerously destructive.""It would be unwise to ignore the interdependency the two superpowers share, says Jordan Tama, a foreign-policy expert at American University.China and the U.S. are two largest carbon-emitters in the world and will need to co-operate on climate change, for example.As for Trump's end game? Tama says the rationale for seeking to strengthen relations with Taiwan is to counter the rise of China, giving the U.S. a regional foothold in Asia and making it more difficult for China to expand its influence.Trump has played coy about his chat with Tsai, describing it as a simple congratulatory conversation. He insisted that Tsai reached out to him. If Trump was oblivious to the sensitive nature of speaking officially with a Taiwanese leader, Democratic Senator Chris Murphy says, that's worrisome in its own right. ""These are major pivots in foreign policy [without] any plan. That's how wars start,"" Murphy tweeted on Friday.It's likely Trump would have prearranged the call with Tsai, just as Taipei would not have wanted to risk the political embarrassment of Trump refusing her phone call, says Gordon Chang, author of The Coming Collapse of China.Whether a diplomatic blunder or calculated move, though, Chang argues closer ties between the U.S. and Taiwan could be strategically useful for keeping East Asia stable.That's because the U.S. opposes China's militarizing of man-made islands in the South China Sea, which America views as an open international waterway.Taiwan, as an intermediary land mass between the East China Sea and the South China Sea, serves a ""cork in the bottle"" function that could constrain Chinese naval expansion in the Western Pacific, Chang says.If reopening official lines with Taiwan was intentional, he welcomes the new approach.""The China policy is going to change. And it's just got to — it's unsustainable,"" he says. ""Maintaining co-operation with an increasingly hostile, authoritarian state is not the way to go.""Chang believes that Trump has created a ""bargaining chip"" by raising a quandary that China may now want to work to reverse, but he cautions the president-elect will need to play his hand carefully.""He's started a staring match, and it's very important for him not to blink."""

Alberta health officials testing people for coronavirus out of 'excess of caution' | CBC News,"Health officials in Alberta say they've tested several people for the new coronavirus that's killed 26 people and made more than 800 people sick, mostly in China.",2020-01-24T14:47:43.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/coronavirus-alberta-canada-testing-china-health-1.5438919,"Health officials in Alberta say they've tested several people for the new coronavirus that's killed 26 people and made more than 800 people sick, mostly in China.Alberta Health says there are no confirmed or suspected cases in Alberta, but that several people have been tested as a precaution.The first confirmed North American case was found in Seattle earlier this week.""At this stage we are acting out of an excess of caution even when the likelihood of exposure, based on history, is small or improbable,"" Alberta Health spokesperson Tom McMillan said in an email to CBC News.China expands city lockdowns, building 1,000-bed hospital to treat virus""We are closely monitoring the situation and will keep Albertans informed as it evolves.""The new coronavirus is from the same family of viruses as SARS, which killed 44 Canadians in 2003.Craig Jenne, who teaches in the department of microbiology at the University of Calgary, says he's not surprised some Albertans have been tested for the new coronavirus.""I think this is showing that our surveillance system is in place, all the moving parts are apparently working, we're looking for these patients and we're being excessively cautious,"" he said.""So I really think this is good sign and will be a big step in trying to limit this from establishing itself as a community infection here in Alberta.""Health officials have been saying for days that Canada would likely see cases of the new coronavirus.Federal Health minister Patty Hajdu told reporters Thursday that six people are being monitored for the virus in Canada, and that one of them has been cleared.""The risk still remains pretty low for Canadians in terms of acquiring this particular illness in Canada. The fact that there are cases that are under further examination is actually a good sign. It's a sign that our system is working,"" she said.Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said the situation is being taken seriously.""We're of course looking at any extra measures that need to be taken to keep Canadians safe and to prevent the spread of this virus,"" he said.Keeping this new coronavirus out of the country is proving to be complicated because it has an incubation period of up to 14 days.That means there could be up to two weeks between the time someone contracts the virus and starts to have symptoms.Canada's chief public health officer, Dr. Theresa Tam, says once a case  is confirmed the most important steps are isolating that patient, tracing that person's contacts and watching those people as well."

Blanchet went into isolation alongside his wife, Nancy Déziel, after she tested positive for COVID-19.Many of his caucus members and staffers are also in self-isolation as a precaution after a staff member contracted COVID-19. Conservative Leader Erin O'Toole and his family have been tested for COVID-19 after one of his staff members received a positive diagnosis. A member of the Parliamentary Protective Service (PPS) also tested positive on Sept. 10.The developments come as MPs are set to return to Ottawa for the resumption of Parliament. The session is set to begin Wednesday with a speech from the throne. There is ongoing debate over how the House of Commons can ensure public health guidelines are followed. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Health Minister Patty Hajdu have called for virtual voting to allow participation from all MPs who are not present in the chamber.On Friday, Ottawa's medical officer of health said the city is experiencing its second wave of COVID-19 infections. Dr. Vera Etches said the city's rolling five-day average of the number of people diagnosed daily is now almost 55, surpassing the previous high set in late April. ""It's the speed of the increase that concerns us. We can't sustain a rapid rise in cases,"" she said. Etches said the numbers show residents got a bit too ""relaxed"" in August but she is confident the city can bring the numbers back down again.Click below to watch more from The NationalThe NationalIN BRIEFDoctors say saliva test for COVID-19 won't be a silver bulletCanadians in several provinces face long lines for a swab to help diagnose COVID-19 as school and workplaces open. While new testing technologies could help, doctors say they won't be a silver bullet.The gold standard swab of the nose or throat can be uncomfortable. In contrast, a key promise of saliva tests is that people could collect saliva themselves so that fewer nurses and other health professionals would be needed at assessment centres, as staffing is one of the factors that can drive up wait times. But that ideal won't happen immediately. Currently in Canada, both saliva collection and testing remain a research project that regulators are closely evaluating.There are three main barriers to overcome before saliva tests roll out widely. Gobs of saliva vary in how fluid they can be, so collecting a high-quality sample can be a challenge even for something as non-invasive as spitting into a cup. The next hurdle for scientists is to get accurate and consistent results on the presence of the virus. Finally, clinicians need to determine how well the test results help them to correctly identify those with the disease.On Thursday, British Columbia announced it's introducing a new mouth rinse, gargle and spit test for students from kindergarten to Grade 12 to make it easier for children and teenagers to check whether they have COVID-19. But this new test is only offered to school-age kids, and only in B.C.COVID-19 medical coverage now available even though Canadians advised to avoid international travel Canadians yearning to travel abroad despite the COVID-19 pandemic can now get medical insurance to cover costs if they get sick with the coronavirus while travelling, CBC's Sophia Harris reports. In March, when the virus began its global spread and Canada advised against non-essential travel abroad, travel insurance providers stopped selling COVID-19 medical coverage. Now, several insurance providers have resumed offering the coverage along with their regular travel insurance plans.Air Canada, WestJet, Sunwing and travel agency Flight Centre have also joined in, offering free COVID-19 medical coverage to passengers booking certain international flights and vacation packages. ""They are able to travel if they want to, and we just want to enable that to take place as safely as we can,"" said Richard Job, Flight Centre's vice-president of commercial partnership.Travel insurance broker Martin Firestone said he's surprised by the spate of offers — considering Canada's advisory against international travel remains intact due to the ongoing pandemic. ""Your country is now currently under a Level 3 travel advisory, and you've got airlines enticing people with free medical coverage,"" said Firestone with Travel Secure in Toronto. ""Whether you have coverage or not, you may be in a very precarious position with [available] hospital beds and treatment and the ability to be flown back to Canada.""Canadian airlines cancelling flights again as hoped-for bounceback in demand fizzles Canadian airlines are cancelling hundreds of flights as hopes for a spike in demand fall flat, snarling plans for the few passengers who remain. Figures from flight data firm Cirium show Air Canada and WestJet have cancelled at least 439 flights so far this month.John Gradek, who heads McGill University's Global Aviation Leadership program, says the inordinately high number comes after airlines banked on a return of business travel and a continued uptick in leisure trips following months of profit loss. Now, carriers are cancelling the half-booked flights and consolidating passengers on remaining ones to cut costs.Twenty-six-year-old Rachel Farrell had booked a Transat flight out of Halifax for mid-February as part of her destination wedding in the Dominican Republic, but she was informed this week the airline had cancelled the trip and could not make the journey possible until six days later. Farrell's wedding group of two dozen paid $37,000 for the package. She says Transat is offering flight credit but no refund, as the tour company struggles to bounce back from a 99 per cent year-over-year drop in revenue last quarter.Stay informed with the latest COVID-19 data from Canada and around the world.THE SCIENCEDoctors think you should get the flu shot this year — and soonAs COVID-19 cases climb in many provinces, flu season is also on the horizon. Doctors and governments say the COVID-19 pandemic makes it more important than ever to get the flu shot because:Too many people with flu and flu-related complications can put pressure on the health system, which will likely already be under strain due to COVID-19. A high vaccination rate can reduce the demand for COVID-19 testing, since the flu and COVID-19 have similar symptoms. Many testing centres have recently seen long lines and wait times due to a surge in demand. Getting the flu — as with other pre-existing lung diseases — can increase the risk of COVID-19 complications in people who catch that, too. ""If they have the flu, they're more likely to wind up in hospital and die from COVID-19,"" said Dr. Iris Gorfinkel, a family physician and vaccine researcher at Prime Health Clinical Research in Toronto.The federal government said that this year, it's raising awareness and promoting the flu vaccine especially to populations at higher risk of flu and flu-related complications, including seniors, people with compromised immune systems and those with chronic medical conditions.AND FINALLY...Canada's biggest cities are seeing a surge in household waste thanks to COVID-19 Some of Canada's biggest cities are seeing a surge in household waste thanks to myriad COVID-related trends, including the re-emergence of disposable goods, a summer full of home renovations and the continuous growth of online shopping. Early figures from the cities of Vancouver, Calgary, Winnipeg, Toronto and Halifax reveal that the amount of residential garbage collected has increased significantly since the start of the pandemic.Data compiled by CBC Radio's The Cost of Living shows the garbage picked up in many of these cities went up in some months by as much as 35 per cent compared with the year before.In Toronto, residential garbage collection jumped by 12 per cent from June 2019 to June 2020. Vancouver saw 18 and 11 per cent increases in June and July, respectively. In Calgary, single-family residential garbage collection rose by double-digit percentages each month from April through July, when comparing those months in 2019 and 2020. Winnipeg and Halifax also saw increases.Commercial waste, on the other hand, is down significantly across Canada, suggesting a major shift in where and how we consume goods and services.Find out more about COVID-19Still looking for more information on the pandemic?

30-day cap on prescriptions eases as pharmacy inventories return to normal | CBC News,"The board regulating Newfoundland and Labrador's pharmacists is easing up on a 30-day cap on prescriptions, as inventories return to pre-pandemic levels.",2020-05-06T08:30:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/nl-pharmacy-board-easing-recommendation-1.5554915,"The board regulating Newfoundland and Labrador's pharmacists is easing up on a 30-day cap on prescriptions, after a nationwide effort to protect supplies has brought inventories back to pre-pandemic levels. The easing will happen over the next two weeks, on the condition that pharmacists have the supply they need on hand to provide patients with a longer prescription.""We're really putting it in the hands of the pharmacists,"" said Margot Priddle, the Newfoundland and Labrador Pharmacy Board's registrar and CEO. ""Pharmacists will manage their inventory and manage the amount of medication dispensed to their patients so that their patients have access to their medications.""On March 19 NLPB issued the recommendation that a 30-day supply of medication was necessary in order to protect public health, which affected patients accustomed to getting two or three months of medication at once. ""It was a worldwide demand for medications and that was due in part to stockpiling,"" said Priddle.""I call that the toilet tissue effect, where a lot of people were presenting to pharmacies to get their medications.""Priddle pointed out that much of the world's medications are manufactured in China and India.""Those were two very hard hit countries earlier on in the pandemic that we're dealing with,"" said Priddle. ""Manufacturing of medications actually slowed and in some cases stopped.""Priddle, while noting the supply has returned to pre-COVID-19 levels, said what happened earlier this year wasn't normal.""I have never seen anything like this in the last 30 years for sure. It is truly unprecedented,"" she said.The NLPB also issued tips for patients as its recommendation is eased, including:The easing back on the 30-day supply will be good news for people who usually get 60- or 90-day prescriptions, meaning they will also now save on dispensing fees charged by pharmacies.""The [NLPB] isn't insensitive to this at all and we do recognize that there are people in our province that are paying extra … and probably can't afford to pay the extra,"" Priddle said.Priddle said pharmacists are thanking consumers for their patience during the last few months. ""We would still ask them to be kind to the pharmacists as they're presenting for for their medications,"" she said. ""They're working with you as best they can to deal with all the situations that are coming at them.""The board said while the 30-day supply recommendation is diminishing, it will continue to closely monitor drug supplies and the overall healthcare environment associated with COVID-19. The board will respond accordingly should access to medications become compromised. ""I'm hopeful that that we will not have to put in such harsh measures again but we'll do what we need to do to protect the supply,"" said Priddle.Read more articles from CBC Newfoundland and Labrador"

"There's no one way to do drag, and Vancouver collective The Darlings are proving that loud and queer | CBC Arts",The non-binary quartet are about to offer their most ambitious performance yet.,2020-07-23T17:15:26.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/arts/there-s-no-one-way-to-do-drag-and-vancouver-collective-the-darlings-are-proving-that-loud-and-queer-1.5659022,"Queeries is a weekly column by CBC Arts producer Peter Knegt that queries LGBTQ art, culture and/or identity through a personal lens. There are few folks pushing the boundaries of drag quite like the four members that make up The Darlings. A multidisciplinary performance collective featuring Continental Breakfast (Chris Reed), P.M. (Desi Rekrut), Maiden China (Kendell Yan) and Rose Butch (Rae Takei), the Vancouver-based quartet turn conventional drag upside down by exploring the ""genderqueer, non-binary, and trans experience through the use of movement, poetry, performance art, theatre, and immersive installation.""During the past few months, The Darlings lit up our dire existences (and apparently offended Facebook censors) with ""Quarantine I"" and ""Quarantine II,"" two innovative performances they put together from their respective self-isolations. And now, they're coming back together for the first show they've worked together in person since February — and their most ambitious presentation in the two years since forming. Streaming as part of the Queer Arts Festival's 2020 virtual edition, the hour-long filmed performance promises to be a highlight of our new digital festival realities, and you can watch it from anywhere this Friday, July 24 at 7pm PT.In anticipation of the performance, The Darlings chatted with CBC Arts about their process, which they also had documented through a short film by CBC's Creator Network that was directed by Eric Sanderson and produced by Claudia Goodine. You can watch the film just below and then scroll further down to read a bit about The Darlings' plan to take over the world (whenever the world once again becomes safe to take over, that is). CBC News BCTell me about The Darlings and how you all came together.Rose Butch: We're a multidisciplinary non-binary drag performance collective, and as a group we're turning two this year! Before we started performing as The Darlings, we would work with each other at different shows and parties around town; [we] admired each other as performers and we've always gotten along as friends. We all come at drag from different viewpoints that all somehow intersect — PM is a trained dancer, I'm a theatre artist, Continental Breakfast is a comedian and actor, and Maiden China is a writer and activist.PM had gotten the four of us together to work on a photo shoot with Sean Alistair, who's an artist that we've ended up collaborating with quite a bit, and brought up this idea that they had with Breakfast about the four of us putting together an immersive night that didn't follow the conventional format of drag shows as we knew them — where we could do riskier and more experimental stuff that we all seemed to be drawn to in our performance anyway.Our first show went up in a DIY warehouse space to an audience of 89 people, just after Pride in 2018. We had no idea what to expect. But the energy was electric, the support was there, and we knew we were onto something.What is The Darlings' mission and what do you aim to express through your art?Maiden China: I always aim to express vulnerability and a keen sense of emotional intelligence through my work, while challenging hegemonic systems of power and oppressive ideals. I believe art is inherently political.Rose Butch: We aim to challenge and employ the conventions of drag as a medium, using elements of lip sync, dance, poetry, visual art, physical theatre and spoken word to explore narratives of queer, trans and non-binary experience. Thematically, we work a lot with relational dynamics, intimacy, and nostalgia, queering and reclaiming memories. Currently, our mission is to provide the world with some much-needed queer escapism and catharsis.PM: I think our biggest mission is to be seen and heard — loudly at that. We want to force-feed our audiences pure queerness and make them question every construct they may have about what they ""think drag looks like."" Drag is such a beautiful thing, but there isn't just one way to do it. Drag can cross mediums such as poetry, theatre, dance, live music...The Darlings aim to not be stagnant and never be comfortable, and continually push and express what it is to be non-binary in many different avenues. The Darlings recently faced censorship from Facebook due to a live performance they deemed ""inappropriate."" Can you tell me a bit about that and how you feel about it now?Rose Butch: We totally thought that we'd really toned down our content to make it Facebook-friendly the first time around, so when we were flagged and taken down for ""inappropriate content"" during our Quarantine II show after we'd deliberately tried to check every box we could think of, it was so frustrating.At a time when there was so much uncertainty around queer community spaces and loss of opportunity as performing artists, having even a digital platform pulled out from under us was disappointing to say the least. We released a video addressing the censorship, and took a step back from self-producing online content as a collective for the time being. Looking back at it now seems like so long ago, even though it's literally been three months. Honestly, it's hard not to see the censorship as targeting a group mostly made up of queer and trans POC — if it had been a group of artists with a different set of privileges, would they have been met with the same response?PM: Being virtual has posed many challenges. It really made us converse and talk about why queerness is censored. We weren't breaking rules, and we made sure that our content could be viewed by all generations. The fact that our show was taken down felt quite homophobic to say the least. People make it hard on artists — not just queer artists — to showcase anything out of the normal. What we do is uncomfortable, and people see that as being wrong. Queerness is often seen as being wrong. But, if you have a brain inside that head, you should be able to see that art is art, queer or not. In blocking our voices, it made us re-route and re-imagine how to work over quarantine, and how to overcome these obstacles. Art will not stop being made, and it just challenged us to continue making it. Look at us now! Unstoppable. What can we expect from the performance at the Queer Arts Festival?PM: You can expect a whole lot of non-binary energy! We hope to take the viewers on a rollercoaster with this show. We paired up with Queer Based Media, and all I can say is the footage is hot. Hopefully you will shed a tear, laugh, and feel emotionally exhausted at the end of the hour!Rose Butch: This has been the first time we've worked on a show in person since February, and the fact that one of our members (me) is physically distancing within the group has played into the creation process, so that's something that you may pick up on. The QAF have also provided us with ASL interpretation, and we've been excited to collaborate on a show that's more accessible to everyone. You can expect fantasy, lots of big feelings, and, in the spirit of Pride, some good old-fashioned resistance.Maiden China: This is the largest project the four of us have ever worked on. Coming out of the restricted circumstances of the initial phases of quarantine that led us to create Quarantine I & II, we are all so thrilled to be back in a physical space together and pushing our boundaries with regard to our form. Rose, PM, and Continental blow me away every time they perform, and this Queer Arts Festival film is a testament to their creative excellence.Where do you want to take The Darlings into the future? PM: I would love for The Darlings [to be] on ice or in outer space. That would be ideal. But for now, I think we want to really work as a collective on creating great content, and hit as many stages as we can. I (personally) would love more opportunities to tour with this amazing group of individuals. They are my best friends, and whenever we get out of the city it feels like what we are doing is stretching farther then our limbs can here in Vancouver. Touring makes what you do feel so impactful. Rose Butch: Hopefully back to performing for live audiences as soon as it's safe to do so. And then, the world???Maiden China: Stages across the world. On a major streaming platform. At film and theatre festivals abroad. I want The Darlings to be household.These interviews have been edited and condensed for clarity. Watch The Darlings' virtual performance at the Queer Arts Festival this Friday, July 24 and 7pm PT here.CBC Arts understands that this is an incredibly difficult time for artists and arts organizations across this country. We will do our best to provide valuable information, share inspiring stories of communities rising up and make us all feel as (virtually) connected as possible as we get through this together.

U.S. secretary of state calls Bolton 'a traitor' over new book | CBC News,"U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Thursday branded as ""a traitor"" former White House national security adviser John Bolton, who has accused President Donald Trump in a book of sweeping misdeeds and said he is not fit for office.",2020-06-19T01:52:02.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/pompeo-bolton-trump-book-traitor-1.5618577,"U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Thursday branded as ""a traitor"" former White House national security adviser John Bolton, who has accused President Donald Trump in a book of sweeping misdeeds and said he is not fit for office.""It is both sad and dangerous that John Bolton's final public role is that of a traitor who damaged America by violating his sacred trust with its people,"" Pompeo, the latest in a series of Trump allies to condemn Bolton, said in a statement.The 577-page book titled The Room Where It Happened: A White House Memoir paints an unvarnished portrait of Trump and his administration, and the sometimes dim view that Trump's advisers have of him.In one excerpt, Bolton says he received a note from Pompeo mocking Trump during a 2018 meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.""He is so full of sh-t,"" Pompeo's note said, according to a Washington Post report.Bolton also wrote that Trump ""pleaded"" with China's President Xi Jinping during a 2019 summit to help his re-election prospects and that political calculations drove Trump's foreign policy.U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said in Senate testimony that Bolton's account was ""absolutely untrue.""""I was at the meeting.

"Face masks provided by AHS are substandard, says group of Alberta doctors | CBC News",A group called #abdocs4patients has sent a letter to the province with concerns about the current supply of face masks being provided by Alberta Health Services.,2020-05-08T00:34:17.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/face-masks-provided-by-ahs-are-substandard-says-group-of-alberta-doctors-1.5560340,"A group of more than 150 Alberta doctors has sent a letter to the province expressing ""grave concerns"" about the current supply of face masks being provided to health-care workers by Alberta Health Services.The group, which calls itself #abdocs4patients, says Vanch disposable medical masks do not fit properly, consistently malfunction and cause skin irritation, nausea and headaches.Spokesperson Dr. John Julyan-Gudgeon said the letter was sent on Thursday to Health Minister Tyler Shandro and Dr. Verna Yiu, president and CEO of AHS.Julyan-Gudgeon thinks the biggest concern is that the masks don't provide adequate personal protection.""They do not have the particle filtration capacity nor the splash protection,"" he said in an interview on Thursday.Alberta health-care workers say new masks don't seal, cause rashes and headachesThe issue of the Vanch masks was first raised by health-care workers in mid-April.At the time, Jitendra Prasad, the AHS official in charge of contracting and procurement, said the masks met clinical standards and any issues had more to do with personal preferences for an older model.Prasad said the province has been buying masks from China for two decades. He said they were tested prior to being purchased.AHS reiterated its stance in a statement to CBC News on Thursday, almost identical to a statement it released on April 22.""All PPE purchased and provided by AHS is approved for medical use and meets health-care standards,"" the Thursday statement said.""AHS has worked with the suppliers to have the nose pieces adjusted and the length of the mask [from nose to chin] increased for a better fit. These changes will be in place for the next shipment to AHS.""Alberta mask issues a matter of personal preference, official saysIn the meantime, AHS recommends that doctors can compress the entire edge of the mask containing the nose piece in a 'W' shape to help the fit across the nose, and adding a face shield for extra protection.AHS says it is confident it can resolve the issues that have been identified and that it has created a quality control group to field test any new models or products.That's not good enough for Julyan-Gudgeon.""The government, in the form AHS media, has stated that they are meeting a standard,"" he said. ""Then when you challenge them on it they send you links as to how to wear the mask … but they seem to shy away from any discussion of the exact performance standards."" Julyan-Gudgeon believes AHS is only focusing on esthetics.""They're not getting the point that the actual protection performance of these masks are, by an established protocol, already substandard,"" he said.He said he wants the government to be more transparent about understanding the standards and then to follow through on delivering those standards."

CNN has reported that in the U.S., one case was detected on Tuesday.The virus, which originated in China's Wuhan region, has infected 258 and killed six as of Jan. 21.There have been cases reported in Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Thailand, all connected to people who had travelled from mainland China. Dr. Theresa Tam, Canada's chief public health officer, told reporters Monday that travellers will be asked at electronic immigration kiosks if they have travelled to areas affected by the coronavirus in the last 14 days.They will also be reminded to report flu-like symptoms to border services agents.""With that information it becomes more efficient for us to be able to follow up and ensure that those who are sick at the borders are taken care of,"" Tam said. Signs about the virus will be posted at international airports in Toronto, Vancouver and Montreal. Because of where the virus originates, Canadians will not have much immunity against it, said Dr. Caroline Quach, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at Saint-Justine Hospital.She said hospital employees have been asking patients whether they have been travelling and where as soon as they enter the hospital. ""If we need to admit you, if we have to do any tests on you, we will put you in isolation and make you wear a mask,"" Quach said. Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses. They cause a range of illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases — such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV).For their part, officials with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say they will begin taking passengers' temperatures and asking travellers about symptoms at New York City's Kennedy airport, as well as the Los Angeles and San Francisco airports."

Parkway, to be formally connected.The waterway would run through the cities of Vancouver, Burnaby and New Westminster.""[This] would increase access to water for local residents across three of B.C.'s largest communities,"" the motion reads.The City of Vancouver has dozens of streams and creeks that have been long buried or diverted through pipes due to development. The process of bringing long-buried streams up to the surface — known as daylighting — has been part of the city's urban renewal process for decades.According to the motion, restored streams ""can revive and protect ecosystems within our urban communities to help cities deal with the impacts of climate change. They improve water quality, absorb carbon and heavy rainfall, buffer floods, protect and expand urban forests and increase biodiversity and wildlife habitats.""This motion, Wiebe explained, will help formalize and streamline the work done to restore different stream networks in the region.Ultimately, Wiebe said, he would love to be able to swim again in False Creek.The motion goes before council on May 14."

They attributed the spike in new cases to improvements in detection and monitoring."

Going against the grain: How the Chinese canola ban is affecting Manitoba | CBC News,"When the most populous nation on Earth suddenly decides it no longer covets Canadian canola, there's obviously more going on than the alleged trans-oceanic trade in unwanted organisms.",2019-03-27T10:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/canola-manitoba-economy-1.5071872,"When the most populous nation on Earth suddenly decides it no longer covets Canadian canola, there's obviously more going on than the alleged trans-oceanic trade in unwanted organisms.China is refusing to import Canadian canola, claiming unspecified creatures are crawling among our oilseeds.First, it revoked Richardson International's canola export permit, prompting a wave of consternation about potential retaliation for the December arrest of Huawei chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou.Then China claimed Viterra's canola shipments are also contaminated, further fuelling fears one of Canada's top agricultural exports could become a casualty of the volatile relationship between the Asian superpower and the United States, which had requested Meng's arrest.The stakes in this dispute are high in Manitoba, which covers more acres with canola than any other crop and counts on canola production and processing worth about $4.2 billion every year, according to the Canola Council of Canada.But for now, the province appears to be viewing the impasse more like a game of brinksmanship than as a straight-up trade dispute.This is partly because China has raised concerns about Canadian canola before, demanding higher standards to prevent the spread of the fungal disease blackleg.It's also because China has been buying more Canadian canola every year to fuel its voracious food-production industries.""We do know they need our canola and they will have to come back with cap in hand,"" Manitoba Agriculture Minister Ralph Eichler said in an interview on Tuesday.He reiterated his desire to take part in a trade mission to China, something Prime Minister Justin Trudeau confirmed he's considering in an effort to end the Sino-Canadian canola tiff.""Certainly we realize that we don't have a strong relationship with China. Obviously if we did, they wouldn't be doing this to us,"" Eichler said.While Canada is no stranger to trade disputes, the Chinese ban on canola imports bears little resemblance to the mundane likes of of the softwood lumber battles with the U.S. or the more recent Trump-era aluminum tariffs.For starters, there's the belief China is attempting to teach Canada a lesson for doing the diplomatic bidding of the United States.""Things are so globally interconnected that a major conflict between two big players is going to have downstream effects,"" said Paul Larson, a professor of supply-chain management at the Asper School of Business at the University of Manitoba.""It seemed like for years there would be disputes between nations, but they wouldn't really go so deeply into trying to harm each other with things like trade trade embargoes [or] trade sanctions.""The dispute also strikes observers as illogical, given that Canadian canola producers and Chinese buyers need each other.Canada is the world's largest canola producer and by far the top exporter. China, meanwhile, accounts for more Canadian canola purchases than the next three markets combined: the United States, Mexico and Japan.Canada simply can't absorb the loss of Chinese market, said Jim Everson, president of the Canola Council of Canada.""Our domestic processors are at or near capacity in the work that they're doing already,"" Everson said at his office in Winnipeg.""Certainly the industry will do everything they can to utilize canola through the processing side but, you know, it's very difficult to replace over four million tonnes of canola that would otherwise be going to China.""Manitoba nonetheless has plans to encourage more canola processing, Agriculture Minister Eichler said. The canola dispute with China also highlights the need to diversify Manitoba's crop cover, he said.That won't happen overnight. Manitoba farmers who were planning to grow canola this summer are not likely to change their plans six weeks away from the mid-May seeding, said Starbuck-area farmer Charles Fossay, who serves as president of Manitoba Canola Growers.While canola prices have dropped about $20 a tonne, that isn't enough to convince agricultural producers to consider other crops, Fossay said.Eichler said it's too soon to consider what effect this dispute could have on Manitoba's bottom line. It's more important to simply end it, he insisted.""This is more of a political ploy on behalf of the Chinese government,"" Eichler said.A longer-term concern is the global reputation of a commodity that was named after Canada. The sooner the Chinese claims about canola quality are put to bed, the better, Everson said.""We need to address that really quickly anyway, because we don't want a black mark in other global markets around the quality of Canadian canola."""

""There is a toxic environment in artistic swimming.""According to the swimmers, the alleged incident that sparked last month's shutdown was troubling to several athletes.During a conversation with team members, head coach Gabor Szauder is said to have made what were qualified as racist and hateful remarks.""He was talking about what's happening in China, the Black Lives Matter movement and Muslim people,"" said Rose.""He said all Muslims were extremists,"" said Patricia. ""And then he added: 'When is the last time you saw a white person crash a plane?'""When one of the swimmers confronted him about the comment, Szauder allegedly became verbally aggressive.""He answered: 'This is a free country. I can say whatever I want. Who are you to tell me what hate speech is? Are you God?'""Another swimmer, Sion Ormond, isn't surprised by these events. She says she retired two months ago because, amongst other reasons, the atmosphere at the training centre had become unbearable.""The abuse that I witnessed regularly at the pool — It was just something that I did not want to be a part of anymore,"" she said.Ormond claims she and some of her teammates were victims of verbal abuse last year in China, during a competition.""He said that if we kept swimming like that, he would hit us so hard, we wouldn't know what happened,"" she added.Those comments were allegedly addressed to substitutes with the entire team present after a pre-competition warm-up deemed inadequate by the head coach.""Maybe it was like ten minutes before our competition swim,"" said Rose. ""And there were various adults who were there that witnessed what was said.""The coach apparently explained his comments after the fact, but the swimmers say they were not satisfied.""He just said that we all misunderstood what he had said and that he was going to hit us really hard with a hard workout,"" explained Patricia.According to the swimmers, Szauder would often zero in on one athlete to pick on.Patricia recalls one incident in Hawaii during training camp.""There was a girl that was publicly shamed for her weight, in front of the whole team. The staff was there. It was made clear to us that she was being publicly shamed. He verbalized that to us,"" said Patricia.""I felt sick listening to the conversation,"" Rose said. ""It was a really inappropriate way to handle that type of subject.""Ultimately, the swimmers say these types of incidents became a burden, affecting the mood at the centre. They say Szauder is prone to mood swings and can get carried away, causing tears and anxiety.""There's been times when he's yelled at girls to the point that they have panic attacks in the pool, in the gym,"" Patricia said.""And then he will continue to yell at them and harass them and swear at them. He will call them babies and tell them to stop crying, to compose themselves.""The coach is also alleged to have made sexist comments on more than one occasion.""He told us that girls should learn how to cook and clean, to take care of our men, or else they won't want us,"" Sarah said. ""And that was all men looked for in a woman.""They also say Szauder made comments of a sexual nature.Ormond recalls one incident that took place in Prince George, B.C..""He said: 'Sion, zip up your hoodie before I get too excited,"" Ormond said. ""It was in front of multiple athletes. This is a 47-year-old man.""Ormond is emotional as she recounts what happened. She claims she only found the courage to tell her parents about it after her retirement.""I knew how inappropriate that comment was, that it never should've been said and I was scared,"" she said. ""I was afraid of what my dad would either say or do. I was afraid he would get involved and I would be perceived as a troublemaker.""The four swimmers are critical of Canada Artistic Swimming for not taking the situation seriously enough, when incidents were reported.Caroline says she often heard the same thing.""We were constantly told: 'You know, he comes from Eastern Europe.'""""They would often meet with us after the fact to tell us we weren't resilient enough and could not deal with anxiety and stress in training situations,"" said Patricia. ""It only made us more and more fearful to report it.""Canada Artistic Swimming declined Radio-Canada Sports' interview requests, citing the ongoing review that is being carried out by an outside firm.In a written statement, coach Szauder denied the allegations. He says he is confident that the report will ultimately negate any sort of misconduct on his part.The four swimmers say if nothing changes, they will seriously consider following Ormond's lead and retiring — with the next Olympic Games less than a year away."
Coronavirus fears putting a damper on cruise bookings | CBC News,Some local travel agencies are reporting a decline in cruise vacation bookings and an increase in cancellations over fears caused by the coronavirus outbreak.,2020-02-20T16:00:11.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/coronavirus-cruise-ship-bookings-1.5469283,"Some local travel agencies are reporting a decline in cruise vacation bookings and an increase in cancellations over fears caused by the coronavirus outbreak.Katherine Le, president of Ottawa-based Eastview Travel, said about 15 per cent of her cruise vacation bookings have been cancelled or postponed in the past three weeks.""People are worried about what's going on if they go on a cruise ship,"" Le said. ""They worry about getting infected with the coronavirus.""The outbreak originated in Wuhan, China, and has since infected over 74,000 people in that country and another 924 worldwide, according to an update Wednesday from the World Health Organization (WHO).That includes passengers who were aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship in the Japanese port of Yokohama.The decline in cruise ship bookings comes as Canadian airlines have cancelled most flights to China and the government has issued a travel warning for the country, exacerbating the situation for travel agents like Le who focus on Asia.A total of 621 passengers from the Diamond Princess are now infected, including 57 Canadians. It's the largest cluster of cases outside China, the WHO has said.Passengers who tested negative for coronavirus began to disembark Wednesday after a two-week quarantine that infectious disease experts have criticized for doing more harm than good.Le said her customers have expressed fears of being caught in a similar situation.""When you get on a cruise ship that means you get trapped in there, and you cannot leave,"" Le said.In another case, the MS Westerdam sailed from port to port in Asia seeking to offload passengers, only to be denied at each one.Finally, the government of Cambodia allowed it to dock in Sihanoukville.One passenger who disembarked tested positive for the respiratory illness caused by the virus, which is officially known as COVID-19.Wen Jin, sales manager at Midearth Travel, which specializes in all-inclusive packages to China, said anxiety among potential cruise-goers extends beyond those travelling to Asia.Jin also organizes flight and cruise packages to the Caribbean in partnership with Sunwing Airlines. She said she hasn't received any new bookings for cruises since Jan. 15.Instead, Jin said she's been dealing mainly with cancellations and refunds, which has been eating into her commission.""I work double,"" Jin said. ""One time it's to buy the cruise, the other time it's to refund the cruise. So I work two hours, but I get nothing.""Jin said one family who had a cruise booked for Feb. 8 leaving from Miami, Fla., cancelled after they heard about an incident on a New Jersey cruise ship.In that case, the Royal Caribbean's Anthem of the Seas was delayed at its departure port over fears that four people had coronavirus.While the people later tested negative, the scare was enough for the family to decide the risk wasn't worth it, Jin said.""They are afraid off being stopped inside of the ship, so they cancelled the trip,"" she said.Jin said other families were forced to cancel and refund their trips when some cruise lines adopted policies barring people with Chinese, Hong Kong or Macau passports from their ships.The situation is not the same at all agencies.Mohinder Hona, general manager of Honda Travel, said his cruise vacation business has not been impacted so far.""Obviously, that is a concern right now, but it hasn't really stopped people from booking cruises because everyone knows that this is not something that is going to last forever,"" Honda said.Honda pointed out that people often book cruises months, if not years in advance.A spokesperson for the Association of Canadian Travel Agencies said the industry group is in the process of surveying its members to assess trends in light of the coronavirus outbreak, but won't have results until next week."
Global fossil fuel production on track to bust Paris climate targets | CBC News,"The world's major fossil fuel producers are set to bust global environmental goals with excessive coal, oil and gas extraction in the next decade, the United Nations and research groups said on Wednesday in the latest warning over climate crisis.",2019-11-20T12:38:04.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/fossil-fuel-overshoot-1.5365974,"The world's major fossil fuel producers are set to bust global environmental goals with excessive coal, oil and gas extraction in the next decade, the United Nations and research groups said on Wednesday in the latest warning over climate crisis.The report reviewed specific plans from 10 countries, including Canada, China and the United States, as well as trends for the rest of the world and estimated that global fossil fuel production by 2030 would be at levels between 50 to 120 per cent over Paris Agreement targets.Ahead of next week's <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/EmissionsGap?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#EmissionsGap</a> Report, <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/ProductionGap?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#ProductionGap</a> Report finds that the world is on track to produce far more coal, oil &amp; gas than would be consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C or 2°C.<br><br>This makes <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/ClimateAction?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#ClimateAction</a> goals much harder to reach: <a href=""https://t.co/xED8xd05rR"">https://t.co/xED8xd05rR</a> <a href=""https://t.co/vUGpK83uSH"">pic.twitter.com/vUGpK83uSH</a>Under that 2015 global pact, nations committed to a long-term goal of limiting the average temperature increase to within 1.5 to 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.But by 2030, global planned production would lead to 39 gigatonnes (Gt) of carbon dioxide emissions, 53 per cent higher than what is needed to reduce temperature rises to 2 C and 21 Gt, or 120 per cent, more than is needed for 1.5 C, the report said.""The world's energy supply remains dominated by coal, oil and gas, driving emission levels that are inconsistent with climate goals,"" said United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) executive director Inger Andersen.As well as UNEP, the report was produced by the Stockholm Environment Institute, the International Institute for Sustainable Development, the Overseas Development Institute, and the CICERO Centre for International Climate and Environmental Research and Climate Analytics.It created a new metric called ""the fossil fuel production gap,"" highlighting the difference between rising production and the decline needed to restrict global warming.The gap was largest for coal, with countries planning to produce 150 per cent more in 2030 than would be consistent with limiting warming to 2 C, and 280 per cent more than would limit warming to 1.5 C.""The continued expansion of fossil fuel production — and the widening of the global production gap — is underpinned by a combination of ambitious national plans, government subsidies to producers, and other forms of public finance,"" the report said.The report notes that some countries, such as Canada, the U.S., and Russia, appear to be using export markets to justify major increases in fossil fuel production. Others, such as India and China, are scaling up production to limit or end imports.""The net result could be significant over-investment, increasing the risk of stranded assets, workers, and communities, as well as locking in a higher emissions trajectory,"" the report said.The report precedes UNEP's annual ""emissions gap"" report, due next week, which assesses whether countries' emissions cut policies are enough."

Chinese students trying to recoup thousands of dollars from Canadian homestay providers they say misled them | CBC News,A group of students from China and their parents say they're trying to recoup thousands of dollars from a family of homestay providers in Canada who promised a level of service they didn't deliver.,2020-01-06T09:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/international-students-china-homestay-toronto-british-columbia-1.5402622,"Several Chinese international students are warning others about a pair of homestay providers thousands of kilometres apart who they allege are taking advantage of young newcomers moving to Canada for high school. CBC News has spoken with seven students from China and their parents who allege the mother-daughter pair lied about the living conditions in their homes in Toronto and Burnaby, B.C., and broke the terms of their room-and-board contracts.The students described similar experiences of moving into a situation that was not as advertised, including seeing their hosts eat steak after feeding the teens hot dogs and leftovers and discovering that what they had been told would be a short walk to and from school would actually take hours each day.Many of the students are now trying to recoup thousands of dollars after moving out early.""I want my money back, and I don't want any other students to go through what my daughter did,"" said Li Limei, the mother of a teenager who lived at the homestay in Toronto. In the summer of 2018, Li started scouring the internet for housing for her 15-year-old daughter, Angel An, who was to start Grade 10 at Loretto Abbey Catholic Secondary School in Toronto that fall. ""I wanted Angel to get a head start at a Canadian high school,"" Li said in Mandarin, during a video interview on the WeChat app from her home in Beijing. She hoped finishing high school in Toronto would boost her child's chances of getting accepted into a Canadian university.Angel was preparing to join the annual influx of tens of thousands of Chinese students to Canada whose parents share that hope.In 2019, there were almost 70,000 Chinese international students of elementary school, high school and university age in Canada — up by about 10,000 from five years ago, according to Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada.The sharp increase has fuelled the business of housing students.Li easily found housing for Angel through WeChat, a popular place for Chinese families, homestay providers and settlement agencies that help people find homestays to make connections. She said a woman named Fiona Liu saw her post to the homestay group and offered to host Angel. Li said she made it clear she did not want her teen daughter sharing a house with male students and the home had to be pet-free because of her daughter's allergies to cats and dogs. ""Fiona promised she only accepts girls, that there were no male students,"" said Li. The contract Li signed stipulated there would be no pets. Li was satisfied when she got a first-hand look inside the detached three-storey house when she helped Angel move in August 2018. CBC News reviewed Li's rental agreement, which showed she paid $20,800 for a year's rent before Angel moved in.Within a month, Angel called her mother to say Liu had a dog and a male student had moved in. Li immediately contacted the homestay provider saying her daughter couldn't live with male students or dogs. She said Liu didn't listen and even brought home a second dog a few months later. Angel's mom said her daughter's asthma flared up and she developed allergic dermatitis.Because of the stress of her living situation, Angel dropped out of school in May and moved back to China, four months before her homestay contract was up.""I regret it so much,"" said Li. ""It really affected my daughter."" Li has since been trying to get about $8,000 in rent and deposit money back because she argues Liu broke the terms of the contract. Despite trying to contact Liu multiple times, Li said the homeowner has not answered her.""To this day, she hasn't returned my money,"" she said. CBC News reached out to Liu through email and phone calls, but she has not responded. On a visit to Liu's Toronto house in October, CBC spoke with several Chinese international students who confirmed she was hosting them.A teenage girl who had been living there for four months said her experience has been positive. However, her male housemate's room does not have a door. She said there's just a carpet hanging over it. On a subsequent visit to the house in December, a man who several students confirmed is Liu's husband, spoke with CBC News outside the house. He refused to identify himself or confirm whether Liu or any international students live there. But, when asked why Liu would allow male students into the house when she had said there would only be females, he said such an arrangement would be nonsensical in the real world. ""Can you segregate men and women on the TTC, for example?"" he said in Mandarin, referring to Toronto's public transit system. The seven families with whom CBC spoke found accommodation for their children either with Liu in Toronto or with her daughter, Tiff Lei, in Burnaby, B.C.All seven have attempted to get refunds — that add up to about $40,000 — but they allege the pair either stall, send cheques that bounce or don't respond at all.CBC News tried to call, email and text Lei about the allegations. The calls went to voice mail each time. A response to a text said it was the wrong number, even though the families verified the number belongs to Lei. Oswald Li, 19, said he's trying to get back his $1,400 damage deposit from Lei. He and another Chinese student lived with her in Burnaby for six months before moving out in February 2019. He described the experience as a ""nightmare."" He said he was promised three nutritious meals a day but was often fed beef jerky, french fries and hot dogs. He said much of the food wasn't fresh. Sometimes, after he finished eating, he would see Lei enjoying a steak for dinner, he said. Photos on a now-defunct website advertising the homestays in Toronto and Burnaby showed photos of chicken, cake and crab.When asked about the quality of the food, the man at the Toronto home told CBC News, ""You can't eat seafood every day.""After he moved out, Oswald Li said Lei gave him a cheque equalling the amount of his damage deposit. He said it bounced.""It was frustrating,"" he said. The parents, children and settlement agencies with whom CBC News spoke found each other by chance on WeChat and soon discovered they'd had similar experiences dealing with the same two people in Canada. They discovered Liu went by different names in her communication with different families. To Li Limei, she was ""Fiona Liu"" or ""Liu Jia."" To others, she was ""Gao Ling Qian."" CBC News confirmed through property records that both properties in Ontario and B.C. are owned by the same family. The director of a Beijing-based agency that helped settle Oswald Li and some other students in Canada told CBC News he feels betrayed by both the mother and daughter, with whom he placed students.""I feel angry, really, really angry. The students are young, and [Liu and Lei] lied to them,"" said Li Peng, director of CAEL Education Consulting, from his office in Beijing. He said Lei gave the families an address of a home closer to the students' school, but when they arrived in Burnaby, the teens were taken to a homestay farther away. In Toronto, Liu told some students their home was a five- to 15-minute walk to their schools. When they arrived, they realized the walk was closer to 90 minutes. All the students CBC News spoke with moved out early but not all have returned to China.Li Peng said his company and another settlement agency based in Shijiazhuang, China, that also worked with Lei in Burnaby, reimbursed the students themselves.He said he got back $9,000 from Liu after suggesting he would send friends of his to her house to collect.Both companies say they are still owed thousands of dollars.""We trusted [them],"" he said. ""It was our mistake.""Some of the parents who spoke with CBC News are considering legal action, but say it's tough because they live in China and are not able to navigate Canada's legal system from there. Li Peng said the family took advantage of young students who are alone in the country and don't have a support network or knowledge of how the legal system works. ""They don't have any other relatives in Canada,"" he said. ""They don't know how to protect themselves."" "

Others, such as India and China, are scaling up production to limit or end imports.""The net result could be significant over-investment, increasing the risk of stranded assets, workers, and communities, as well as locking in a higher emissions trajectory,"" the report said.The report precedes UNEP's annual ""emissions gap"" report, due next week, which assesses whether countries' emissions cut policies are enough."
Toronto father grateful that daughter 'shortlisted' for Canadian flight out of Wuhan | CBC News,"A Toronto father says he is grateful that his 15-month-old daughter in Wuhan, China has been ""shortlisted"" for a Canadian evacuation flight out of the city hit hardest by the new coronavirus.",2020-02-05T00:03:45.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/toronto-father-toddler-canadian-flight-out-wuhan-1.5451999,"A Toronto father says he is grateful that his 15-month-old daughter in Wuhan, China has been ""shortlisted"" for a Canadian flight out of the city hit hardest by the new coronavirus.Richard Fabic said he received an email from Ottawa on Tuesday saying Chloe is eligible to travel on the Canadian ""assisted departure"" flight from Wuhan. The city in central China is quarantined to contain an outbreak of the coronavirus that has killed more than 400 people.""I received it just before 6 a.m. and I just had to read it twice to make sure it was what I thought it was,"" Fabic told CBC News on Tuesday. Chloe is being looked after by her grandparents.The evacuation aircraft, a chartered plane that seats 250 people, is now headed to Hanoi, Vietnam where it will be on standby to make its way to Wuhan. It is scheduled to leave Wuhan Tianhe International Airport on Thursday morning, according to the Canadian government.Fabic says he was told by Global Affairs Canada that Chloe's grandparents are also eligible for the flight. They are permanent residents of Canada. That means they will accompany Chloe, if she and they receive approval to board the plane.""That's really comforting because Chloe can be a bit demanding,"" Fabic said. ""And having two people will make things easier.""Right now, Fabic said he is making sure that the necessary government documents are printed and signed for the flight.As Fabic prepares the paperwork, he and his wife, Yunfei Li, are also getting ready to move from Toronto to Victoria. Li left Chloe with her grandparents in Wuhan on a recent family trip there to give the couple time to get organized.After Li returned to Canada, the city was locked down because of the coronavirus outbreak.Fabic said he would like to visit Chloe if and when she returns to Canada, but the Canadian government has said the passengers on the flight will be quarantined at CFB Trenton for two weeks. The Ontario military base is east of Toronto near Belleville.The government said visits from family and friends will not be allowed to prevent the spread of the respiratory illness.""Top of mind is just dropping off a few supplies like diapers and stuff,"" he said. ""I would like to get further details on how I can drop that off.""Fabic said Chloe, who took her first steps in China, is starting to walk faster now, and in a video chat with her on Monday, he said she pointed to the door and said ""Open.""""I think she wants a bit more space,"" he said.Fabic added that he appreciates that the government is clearly trying to help Canadians stranded in Wuhan.""It looks like they are really trying to create a balanced approach here,"" he said.On Tuesday, Foreign Affairs Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne said the plane that will airlift the Canadians will wait in Vietnam for permission from Chinese authorities to land in Wuhan. The plane will be ready to leave hours after it receives the go-ahead from China, likely sometime Wednesday, he said.A letter sent by the government to Canadians and permanent residents of Canada currently in Wuhan said: ""Due to demand and the restrictions associated with this flight, we cannot guarantee that everyone who is eligible for a seat will be able to board the plane.""Though the numbers change by the hour, Champagne said as of Tuesday 308 Canadians have asked for help to leave the country but the plane has room for only about 250 passengers.The letter said they will be screened for any signs of the virus and those with symptoms will not be allowed to board the plane.""Chinese authorities will perform health screening and immigration controls before boarding the flight,"" the letter said.Passengers must get to the airport themselves and the letter warned of possible delays at checkpoints.The new coronavirus has killed 425 people in China and two others in Hong Kong and in the Philippines.More than 20,000 people have been sickened in China and at least 180 in other countries, including four in Canada.  "

"Apple bans 2 toxic chemicals from iPhone, iPad final assembly | CBC News",Apple is banning the use of two potentially hazardous chemicals during the final assembly of iPhones and iPads as part of the company's latest commitment to protect the factory workers who build its trendy devices.,2014-08-14T13:37:02.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/apple-bans-toxic-benzene-n-hexane-from-iphone-ipad-final-assembly-1.2736214,"Apple is banning the use of two potentially hazardous chemicals during the final assembly of iPhones and iPads as part of the company's latest commitment to protect the factory workers who build its trendy devices.The decision announced Wednesday comes five months after the activist groups China Labor Watch and Green America launched a petition drive calling on Apple Inc. to abandon the use of benzene and n-hexane in the production of iPhones.A four-month investigation at 22 factories found no evidence that benzene and n-hexane endangered the roughly 500,000 people who work at the plants, according to Apple. No traces of the chemicals were detected at 18 of the factories and the amounts found at the other four factories fell within acceptable safety levels, the Cupertino, California, company said.Nevertheless, Apple decided to order its suppliers to stop using benzene and n-hexane during the final assembly of iPhones, iPads, iPods, Mac computers and various accessories. What's more, Apple is requiring all its factories to test all substances to ensure that they don't contain benzene or n-hexane, even if the chemicals aren't listed in the ingredients.Benzene is a carcinogen that can cause leukemia if not handled properly and n-hexane has been linked to nerve damage. The substances are often found in solvents used to clean machinery and electronics.Apple is still allowing use of the two chemicals during the early production phases of its products — activities that primarily take place at hundreds of other factories besides the ones responsible for the final assembly of the devices. As an additional precaution, Apple is lowering the maximum amount of benzene and n-hexane that can present in the materials used during those earlier phases of production.""This is doing everything we can think of to do to crack down on chemical exposures and to be responsive to concerns,"" Lisa Jackson, Apple's vice-president of environmental initiatives, said in an interview with The Associated Press. ""We think it's really important that we show some leadership and really look toward the future by trying to use greener chemistries.""All but four of the final-assembly factories affected by Apple's new guidelines are operated by third-party contractors in China, where the company has faced criticism for allowing oppressive labour conditions that have sickened some workers and driven others to suicide. Apple maintains that its periodic audits of the overseas factories are weeding out abusive labour practices.The other factories covered by the final-assembly ban against benzene and n-hexane are in Brazil, Ireland, Texas and California.""This is a good first step,"" said Elizabeth O'Connell, Green America's campaign director America. ""I hope they will continue to remove the most dangerous chemicals to human health or find ways to reduce the exposure.""Green America's petition drive collected nearly 23,000 signatures urging Apple to phase out benzene and n-hexane.Neither chemical is unique to Apple's manufacturing process. They are also used in the production of electronics products sold by other large technology companies that have also been criticized for their practices.Low levels of benzene are also found in gasoline, cigarettes, paints, glues and detergents.Apple's new rules governing benzene and n-hexane hopefully will pressure other gadget makers to adopt similar policies, said Gary Cook, senior information technology analyst for environmental rights group Greenpeace.""This shows Apple can use its market muscle and influence to identify cleaner practices,"" Cook said.Even so, Apple's factories still rely on a long list of toxins that could harm people and the environment, Cook added. ""It would be great to see that list get shorter, not just in terms of protecting worker safety but in terms of protecting air quality and water quality."""

""And then there's a clinical decision whether they even qualify for our test.""Dr. Wajid Ahmed, medical officer of health with the Windsor-Essex County Health Unit, told reporters that the elderly have the highest risk of contracting coronavirus, explaining that many of those who have died in China were over the age of 60. Ahmed said that influenza is ""circulating in our community,"" adding that residents should take appropriate precautions to protect themselves from the flu and other respiratory infections. "

What you need to know about COVID-19 in Ottawa | CBC News,We answer some questions you may have about the novel coronavirus after Ottawa Public Health reports the first positive case in the capital.,2020-03-12T10:59:08.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/covid19-coronavirus-ottawa-symptoms-information-1.5494724,"Coronaviruses are a family of viruses that cause illnesses ranging from the common cold to more severe respiratory problems, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) were both examples of coronaviruses.The most recent novel (or new in humans) coronavirus, officially named SARS-CoV-2, was discovered in Wuhan, China in December 2019.SARS-CoV-2 causes a respiratory disease called COVID-19. There is no vaccine and no drugs to treat it.Coronaviruses primarily spread through droplets when an infected person coughs or sneezes. They can also spread through close, prolonged contact, such as touching or shaking hands.Politics NewsSymptoms range from a very mild, cold-like illness to a severe lung infection.The most common symptoms include fever, fatigue, and a dry cough, according to the WHO.Some patients also experience aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually.Most people recover from the disease without requiring any medical treatment and some people who are infected don't develop any symptoms at all.The WHO says about one out of every six people who contract COVID-19 become seriously ill and develop difficulty breathing.Older people, those with compromised immune systems, and those with underlying medical problems such as high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes are more likely to develop serious illness.  The experience in Italy and China suggests as many as 10 per cent of people infected can require critical care.The Public Health Agency of Canada says the health risk associated with COVID-19 is low for the general population in Canada, but that this could change rapidly.People returning from travel abroad to Hubei, China and Iran are advised to self-isolate for 14 days and contact Ottawa Public Health.All other travellers returning from outside Canada are advised to monitor their health for two weeks upon returning and to contact Ottawa Public Health (OPH) at 613-580-6744 if they start developing symptoms.If they start feeling symptoms, get away from other people as quickly as possible and call your doctor or OPH.Only people who have travelled abroad are asked to avoid crowded public spaces and areas where they cannot easily get themselves away from others if they start feeling symptoms. Ottawa's medical officer of health Dr. Vera Etches said there is currently no evidence of community transmission in the area, which occurs when the virus doesn't come from a known source such as travelling to a region with positive cases.The NationalOPH recommends people with mild symptoms should call their health care provider or a walk-in clinic prior to visiting them in person.People with severe symptoms should contact their health care provider first — and if they're unavailable, go to the hospital's emergency department and look for special signs.As of Thursday, March 12, OPH was reporting ""significant call volumes"" at its 613-580-6744 number and said its priority was to hear from:Anyone else should first read through their coronavirus website or phone TeleHealth at 1-866-797-0000.For western Quebec residents, Info-Santé 811 was also reporting ""technical difficulties"" Thursday and said people may have problems reaching someone on the other end.The province reported Ottawa's first confirmed case of COVID-19 on Wednesday, March 11.It's a man in his 40s who tested positive after returning from a vacation to Austria.He is currently in self-isolation, according to the city's medical officer of health, Dr. Vera Etches, and Ottawa Public Health is following up with a small number of people who had close contact with him.He did not take public transit.A second case was confirmed March 12, a woman in her 40s who had been to Italy.Sophie Grégoire Trudeau has tested positive after attending an event in the U.K. The Prime Minister is in self-isolation as a precaution.There have also been also cases in Trenton, Ont., and Mont-Laurier, Que.Its focus remains on detecting any cases that result from international travel and encouraging people to take measures to help prevent the spread of the virus within the community.Health officials are currently testing 10 to 20 people per day, Etches said, and there are plans to ramp up testing in the coming days.There have been more than 150 negative tests in Ottawa since January.CBC News OttawaThe city will open up a number of community assessment centres that will become hubs for testing and information about coronavirus, in an effort to take pressure off of hospital emergency rooms. The first assessment centre will open at Brewer Park near Carleton University.The Queensway Carleton Hospital has opened a drive-thru testing zone for people who have been told to go there to be checked.CBC News OttawaPublic Health officials are encouraging people with travel plans to research what is happening in their particular destination before making a decision about whether to go.Travel advice from the federal government can be found on Global Affairs Canada's website. It includes not taking a cruise.Global Affairs Canada has issued COVID-19-related travel notices for China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Iran, Italy, Japan, Singapore, South Korea and Spain.Several U.S. states, including New York, Washington, and Florida, have declared states of emergency because of COVID-19.At a press conference Wednesday, Ontario's associate chief medical officer, Barbara Yaffe, said there is no yes-or-no answer to the question of whether to cancel travel plans.""Think about how important is it that you go? If it's a work-related thing, can it be done virtually?"" said Yaffe.""Is there some way of doing it without going there? And if you are going there, what are you going to be doing there? Are you going to be around a lot of people?Public health officials say there is no reason to wear a mask if you are well because there is little evidence showing that wearing a mask in public prevents healthy people from becoming infected.As stated above, the general public does not need to avoid crowds at this time.Ottawa Public Health advises people to take the following measures to reduce the risk:In Canada (and elsewhere) large events are being cancelled, some people are being told to work from home, and some students will be taking courses online for a few weeks.It's a temporary public health strategy aimed at slowing the potential spread of COVID-19 and buying time."

Canadians celebrate Lunar New Year despite concerns over coronavirus | CBC News,At least one event in the Lower Mainland has been cancelled over fears of coronavirus.,2020-01-26T19:59:01.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/coronavirus-lunar-new-year-1.5441077,"Lunar New Year celebrations lit up Vancouver's Chinatown with firecrackers and colourful lion dancers on Sunday, though at least one other event in the Lower Mainland was cancelled over fears of the new coronavirus.The Live in Langley Chinese Association cancelled its gala, which was also sponsored by the Township of Langley, as fears rose after authorities detected Canada's first case of coronavirus on Saturday in a patient who had travelled to Toronto from Wuhan, China.Health Minister Patty Hajdu said Sunday that the risk of infection is low and Canadians should not worry about contracting the virus in a casual setting, urging people to take normal precautions but otherwise continue their lives.Vancouver's Spring Festival Parade, said to be one of the largest Lunar New Year celebrations in North America, carried on.⁠⠀Vancouver resident Jason Ng attended the Lunar New Year celebrations with his wife, father and three-year-old son to watch his other five-year-old son dance in the parade.""It was something kind of in the back of our heads,'' Ng said of the virus. ""It wasn't a huge concern.''Another spectator, Ethan Donnelly, said he works at the University of British Columbia and a coworker who is from China skipped this year's celebrations for fear of the virus.""We want to celebrate, but better safe than sorry,'' he said, gesturing to the mask he wore during the parade.Though some donned the surgical masks at the event, experts advise against them, saying the ones widely available at drug stores aren't particularly effective and noting that repeatedly adjusting them with unwashed hands can actually exacerbate risk of infection.Ella Lewis-Vass, who also works and studies at the university, said she believed those who were most concerned about contracting the virus likely stayed home.The illness has sickened at least 1,975 people and killed 56 in China, but it remains to be seen whether it's as dangerous as the common flu, which kills 3,500 people every year in Canada alone."

	Building medical clinics and treating disease doesn't leave much time for spreading the word of God. But for generations of missionaries in China, it was all part of their Christian duty and their faith in the social gospel. Canadians working in China were inspired by this movement which sought to address societal problems through social change. In this CBC Radio clip, missionaries from the 1940s and earlier remember the challenges of working in China. The social gospel movement also afforded a place for women who wanted to contribute in the missions. No longer was missionary work solely a man's job; wives, nuns and single career women also had a role to play. In China they worked for the emancipation of women in a culture where foot-binding was still the norm. Anne Story, the first social worker sent to China by a Canadian church, says the missions created generations of women who saw themselves as equals.

Paleontologists have found the tiniest dinosaur ever | CBC News,A bird-like dinosaur with a beak full of teeth and claws on its wings is the tiniest extinct dinosaur ever found.,2020-03-11T16:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/hummingbird-dinosaur-amber-1.5492775,"A bird-like dinosaur with a beak full of teeth and claws on its wings is the tiniest extinct dinosaur ever found.The dinosaur's beautifully preserved skull — about as long as your thumbnail from the tip of its beak to the back of its head — was found in a hunk of amber from northern Myanmar, researchers report in a new study published Wednesday in Nature.Its brain is a little smaller than that of the bee hummingbird, the smallest living bird, said Ryan McKellar, a Canadian paleontologist who co-authored the study with Chinese, Canadian and U.S. researchers. ""But once you include the snout, you're talking about something that's about the same size.""Technically, the bee hummingbird is a dinosaur itself, as all modern living birds are, making the new species the smallest extinct dinosaur.Despite being so tiny, the bones in its skull have fused together, indicating that it's an adult or near adult.It lived about 99 million years ago in what was then a tropical mangrove forest teeming with insects, frogs, salamanders, lizards and other bird-like dinosaurs — though they had not yet evolved completely to resemble modern birds.""They're sort of our neat little guys that scurried around on tree trunks … that still had claws in their wings and still had teeth in their snout,"" said McKellar, curator of paleontology for the Royal Saskatchewan Museum in Regina.In fact, this particular animal's teeth were unusual. Unlike most birds at the time, who had teeth just on the tips of their beaks, it had dozens that extended close to the back of its mouth under its eye. For that reason, the new species was named Oculudentavis khaungraae.The first part of its name means ""eye-teeth-bird,"" while the second part of its name honours Khuang Ra, the woman who bought the fossil at a market and donated it to the Hupoge Amber Museum in China where it could be studied.McKellar says this particular bird would likely have been adapted to eat insects and snails. Its large, lizard-like eyes were adapted to narrowing its pupil in bright light, suggesting it was active during the day. They're also pointed more sideways than forward compared with modern birds.""So [it was] maybe even better adapted for escaping as prey as opposed to actually hunting things,"" he added.The study was led by Lida Xing, an associate professor at the China University of Geosciences in Beijing who previously studied and worked in Canada, and Jingmai O'Connor, a paleontologist at the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology in Beijing.O'Connor said in the email that the discovery shows how small dinosaurs could be, and that even ones this tiny could be predators — something that wasn't known before.McKellar got involved in the project a couple of years ago while collaborating with Xing on a different study, and was tasked with figuring out how the animal became encased in amber. It appears the bird was already dead — though freshly so — and rather wet when it became trapped in sticky, syrupy amber oozing down a tree trunk. The types of insects trapped with it suggest the amber never made it to the forest floor before hardening.He said the special thing about amber is it provides a snapshot of animals so small that they're rarely preserved as fossils. Most dinosaur fossils are the size of crows or larger. In this case, Oculudentavis is even smaller than other birds found in Myanmar amber, which are usually about the size of sparrows or robins.In this case, none of Oculudentavis's feathers were preserved, as its skin got separated from its skull during decomposition.But McKellar said Myanmar amber is also key to figuring out the origin of feathers trapped in Canadian amber found in Alberta and Saskatchewan.While about 10 tonnes of amber are mined for jewelry each year in Myanmar, Canada produces only about a kilogram a year ""and the pieces are smaller and more fragile,"" McKellar said.By comparing the feathers found in those pieces to larger pieces with more body parts found in Myanmar, scientists are able to learn more about the feathered dinosaurs that lived in Canada."

Iran maintains the IAEA inspectors have no legal basis to inspect the sites.""My objective is that my meetings in Tehran will lead to concrete progress in addressing the outstanding questions that the agency has related to safeguards in Iran and, in particular, to resolve the issue of access,"" Grossi said in a statement.""I also hope to establish a fruitful and co-operative channel of direct dialogue with the Iranian government which will be valuable now and in the future.""The Iranian delegation to international organizations in Vienna tweeted that ""we hope this visit will lead to reinforced mutual co-operation.""Since President Donald Trump unilaterally pulled the U.S. out of the nuclear deal with Iran in 2018, the other countries involved — France, Britain, Germany, Russia and China — have been struggling to keep it alive.The deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, promises Iran economic incentives in exchange for curbs on its nuclear program. But with the reinstatement of some American sanctions, Iran's economy has been steadily deteriorating, and Tehran has begun violating provisions of the agreement to try to pressure the other countries to do more to offset those sanctions.At the same time, Iran has continued to provide IAEA inspectors with access to its nuclear facilities — one of the major reasons the countries still party to the agreement stress that it's important to keep it alive.Last week, the U.S. ratcheted up the pressure, officially informing the United Nations it was demanding the restoration of all UN sanctions on Iran, arguing that Iran is in non-compliance and invoking a provision of the nuclear deal to ""snap back"" even more sanctions.Russia, China, Britain, France and Germany, who often disagree, all declared the U.S. action illegal, arguing it is impossible to withdraw from a deal and then use the resolution that endorsed it to reimpose sanctions.Iran has also rejected the move, but the U.S. has stuck to its guns, declaring that a 30-day countdown for the snapback of penalties eased after the 2015 agreement was signed had begun.The five nations and Iran are due to meet in Vienna on Sept. 1."

Hong Kong braces for another weekend of protests despite leader's public meeting | CBC News,Analysts say Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam's hope of using a town hall to buy some goodwill that will diffuse tensions ahead of rallies planned this weekend in the lead-up to Oct. 1 celebrations of China's National Day is unlikely to succeed.,2019-09-27T08:00:54.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/hong-kong-weekend-demonstrations-lam-meeting-1.5299388,"Hong Kong's beleaguered leader Carrie Lam faced her public with humility, but she may not get the response she hoped for.Analysts say Lam's hope of using the community engagement to buy some goodwill that will diffuse tensions ahead of rallies planned this weekend in the lead-up to Oct. 1 celebrations of China's National Day is unlikely to succeed.In a face-off with an antagonistic audience, Lam quietly took blow after blow as citizens at a town hall session Thursday vented anger at her refusal to give more concessions to finally end more than three months of anti-government protests that have rocked the semi-autonomous Chinese territory.After the dialogue ended, Lam stayed holed up in the building for another four hours to avoid confrontation with angry protesters outside and left only after most of them dispersed.""Carrie Lam showed some sincerity,"" said Willy Lam, an adjunct professor at the Center for China Studies at Hong Kong's Chinese University who is not related to the Hong Kong leader. ""She sat through more than two hours of humiliation and demonstrated at least willingness to hear radically different views. She has the guts to face opposition but still it's not good enough.""The protests began in June in opposition to a proposed law that would have allowed some criminal suspects to be sent for trial on the mainland, but have since widened into an anti-China protest spurred by widespread concern that Beijing has been eroding the autonomy Hong Kong was promised when the former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997.Another major rally organized by the Civil Human Rights Front is set Saturday to mark the fifth anniversary of the Umbrella Revolution, when protesters occupied key thoroughfares in the city for 79 days in 2014 to demand universal suffrage. That movement ended without any government concession.Protesters are also organizing ""anti-totalitarianism"" rallies in Hong and many cities worldwide on Sunday against what they denounced as China's tyranny.The Front is also planning another big march on Oct. 1, sparking fears of a bloody showdown that will embarrass China's ruling Communist Party as it marks its 70th year in power with grand festivities in Beijing. The Hong Kong government has scaled down National Day celebrations by calling off an annual firework display and moving a reception indoors.Lam's government has insisted that it can handle the conflict on its own, amid fears of Chinese military intervention. Despite the bashing Thursday, Lam vowed to continue talks with various communities, including protesters, to hear their grievances.The response to the town hall on social media was generally negative, with many calling it a public relations stunt.The dialogue was timed to try reduce potential ferocity at upcoming rallies, but protesters aren't buying it, said Phil Chan, senior fellow at the Institute for Security and Development Policy in Stockholm.""I don't think Hong Kong people will fall for it,"" Chan said. ""She was just repeating herself and hasn't accepted another view point other than her own.""During the town hall, Lam vowed to work to regain public trust and shouldered the responsibility for causing political havoc with the extradition bill. Yet she offered no concrete actions she will take apart from promises to listen and address deep-seated societal woes such as a lack of affordable housing that the government believes has contributed to the protests.Lam stood her ground against demands for an independent inquiry into accusations of police brutality against protesters and the unconditional release of more than 1,500 people detained since the protests began in June. She also sidestepped calls for direct elections of the city's leaders.""It was a good occasion for people to reduce pent-up anger, but it will not cool down emotions because there was no concrete reconciliatory moves,"" Willy Lam said.Nevertheless, he said it was a good sign that the tightly guarded event proceeded without disruption and opens the possibility that future planned dialogue with the community could be more in-depth or even show results.So far the only concession the Hong Kong leader has made was a promise to completely withdraw the extradition bill, a move that may have eased tensions had it been made in June but did little to calm things when announced in September. Huge protests have continued on most weekends, as have the clashes with police that often break out after nightfall."

U.S. to slap tariffs on $50B in Chinese imports | CBC News,"The Trump administration said on Tuesday it would hit China with 25 per cent tariffs on some 1,300 industrial technology, transport and medical products as part of its drive to force changes in Beijing's intellectual property practices.",2018-04-03T22:33:05.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/us-tariffs-chinese-imports-1.4603826,"The Trump administration said on Tuesday it would hit China with 25 per cent tariffs on some 1,300 industrial technology, transport and medical products as part of its drive to force changes in Beijing's intellectual property practices.The U.S. Trade Representative's (USTR) office unveiled a list of mainly non-consumer products representing about $50 billion US of annual imports that would nonetheless hit supply chains for many manufacturers.The list ranges from chemicals to light-emitting diodes, motorcycles and dental devices.Publication of the tariff lists starts a public comment and consultation period expected to last around two months, after which USTR said it would issue a ""final determination"" on the product list. It has scheduled a May 15 public hearing on the tariffs.USTR said the tariffs were proposed ""in response to China's policies that coerce American companies into transferring their technology and intellectual property to domestic Chinese enterprises."" The agency added that such policies ""bolster China's stated intention of seizing economic leadership in advanced technology as set forth in its industrial plans, such as Made in China 2025.China condemned the U.S. announcement and said it would ""take corresponding measures of equal scale and strength against U.S. products.""""The Chinese side strongly condemns and firmly opposes the unfounded Section 301 investigation and the proposed list of products and tariff increases based on the investigation,"" a Chinese embassy statement said.""As the Chinese saying goes, it is only polite to reciprocate. The Chinese side will resort to the WTO dispute settlement mechanism and take corresponding measures of equal scale and strength against U.S. products in accordance with Chinese law.""At a news conference Tuesday, Chinese State Councillor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said, ""Despite the rise of protectionism in the world, China will remain committed to openness [and] will open wider to the rest of the world."" China has denied that its policies require technology transfers from U.S. companies and has suggested its own trade targets could include U.S. soybeans, aircraft or heavy equipment. The dispute has raised fears about a possible trade war between the world's two largest economies.The U.S. tariff list followed China's imposition of tariffs on $3 billion worth of U.S. fruits, nuts, pork and wine to protest new U.S. steel and aluminum tariffs imposed last month by U.S. President Donald Trump.The standoff between the world's two largest economies has sparked market fears that they could spiral into a trade war that could crush global growth. Asian share markets were mixed amid trade tension concerns, with Japan's Nikkei 225 off 0.1 per cent but Shanghai's main index poised to open 0.3 per cent higher.The U.S. list heavily targets advanced technology products that benefit from Beijing's Made in China 2025 program, which aims to replace advanced technology imports with domestic products and build a dominant position in future industries.The state-led 2025 program targets 10 strategic industries: advanced information technology, robotics, aircraft, new energy vehicles, pharmaceuticals, electric power equipment, advanced materials, agricultural machinery, shipbuilding and marine engineering and advanced rail equipment. Many products in those segments appear on the list, including antibiotics and industrial robots.Many consumer electronics products such as cellphones made by Apple Inc. and laptops made by Dell were excluded, as were footwear and clothing, drawing a sigh of relief from retailers who had feared higher costs for American consumers.But the USTR did include some key consumer products from China, including flat-panel television sets and motor vehicles, both electric and gasoline-powered with engines of three litres or less.A Reuters analysis that compared listed products with 2017 Census Bureau import data showed $3.9 billion in flat-panel television imports, and $1.4 billion in vehicle imports from China.Among vehicles likely to be hit with tariffs is General Motors Co.'s Buick Envision sport-utility vehicle, which is assembled in China and sold in the United States. Volvo, owned by China's Geely Motors, also exports Chinese-built vehicles to the United States.U.S. business groups reacted cautiously, saying they agreed with Trump's efforts to stop the theft of U.S. intellectual property, but questioning whether tariffs were the right approach.""Tariffs are one proposed response, but they are likely to create new challenges in the form of significant added costs for manufacturers and American consumers,"" National Association of Manufacturers President Jay Simmons said in a statement.U.S. Senator Marco Rubio said in a letter to U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin that he was glad to see ""bold"" action against China. ""These necessary actions constitute an important break with the appeasement of previous administrations, and provide an opportunity to chart a new course for America's relationship with this strategic competitor,"" Rubio wrote."

Toronto police investigating online abuse of student leader at U of T | CBC News,Toronto police confirmed Thursday they have launched an investigation into a barrage of online abuse directed at newly-elected student president at the University of Toronto's Scarborough campus.,2019-03-01T02:48:07.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/toronto-police-investigating-online-abuse-tibetan-canadian-student-chemi-lhamo-1.5038517,"Toronto police confirmed Thursday they have launched an investigation into a barrage of online abuse directed at the newly-elected student president on the University of Toronto's Scarborough campus.On Feb. 9, the day she was notified of her election as president, Chemi Lhamo, 22, received thousands of hateful messages on a photo she'd posted on Instagram four days earlier for the Lunar New Year.The messages were aimed at Lhamo's Tibetan heritage, and the controversy surrounding China's presence in Tibet. Some seemed threatening.""China is your daddy — you better know this,"" read one comment.""Ur not gonna be the president of UTSC,"" read another. ""Even if you do, we will make sure things get done so u won't survive a day. Peace RIP.""Police are now investigating the online threats made against Lhamo, Const. Allyson Douglas-Cook told CBC Toronto in an email.In addition to the online threats, a petition calling on Lhamo — a Canadian citizen of Tibetan origin — to step down had amassed nearly 10,000 signatures. There was also a message on the Chinese mobile service We Chat making the rounds, calling on Chinese international students to stop Lhamo from becoming president.Lhamo said she was worried about her safety and took her concerns to the University of Toronto. The students union also made the decision to close her office due to security concerns. There were mounting suspicions about possible Chinese government influence being exerted on Canadian campuses following the incident but Chinese officials swiftly denied involvement.China's consulate in Toronto said it only learned of the online attacks against Lhamo from the media.However, a statement from the consulate did not condemn the views expressed in thousands of comments on Lhamo's social media accounts.""It is believed that this is an entirely spontaneous action of those Chinese students based on objective facts and patriotic enthusiasm,"" the statement says.""The Chinese government firmly opposes anti-China separatist activities by 'Tibet independence' activists who are plotting to split Tibet from China [and] the move of any country or organization to provide support or convenience of any kind to 'Tibet independence' activities."""

Trade rows cloud IMF summit as officials fret over economic slowdown | CBC News,"The global expansion, now at its most sluggish pace in three years, is likely to firm up next year, but central banks and fiscal authorities have limited policy options to drive a rebound, officials said in the joint communiqué of the International Monetary Fund's steering committee.",2019-04-13T21:38:30.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/imf-world-bank-2019-economy-1.5097372,"Trade disputes and tighter financial conditions are among the top threats to a slowing world economy, global finance officials said on Saturday, urging countries to take steps to shore up growth.The global expansion, now seen at its most sluggish pace in three years, is likely to firm up next year, but central banks and fiscal authorities have limited policy options to drive a rebound, officials said in the joint communiqué of the International Monetary Fund's steering committee.""While we expect to see a pickup [in growth] next year, trade tensions, geopolitical risks, political instability are among the challenges,"" Lesetja Kganyago, the committee's chairman and the South African Reserve Bank's governor, said at a press conference after the panel adjourned its semi-annual meeting.""We agreed we need to act promptly to protect the expansion.""""Fiscal policy for example should remain flexible and growth-friendly, rebuild buffers, and strike the right chord between debt sustainability and supporting demand,"" Kganyago said, capping the spring meetings of the IMF and World Bank in Washington.The sober mood among finance leaders at the meetings this week was a stark contrast to the optimism that characterized the gathering one year ago when officials were heralding a rare period of robust and synchronized growth.As countries balance the challenge of volatile capital flows w/ demands of effective economic policy, it's necessary to develop a policy mix that integrates monetary policy, foreign exchange intervention, macroprudential policies and capital flow measures. <a href=""https://t.co/VYPgjvo6e6"">https://t.co/VYPgjvo6e6</a> <a href=""https://t.co/x7YoHSI40l"">pic.twitter.com/x7YoHSI40l</a>This week's proceedings kicked off with the IMF cutting its global growth outlook for the third time in six months. The world economy will likely grow 3.3 per cent this year, the slowest expansion since 2016 and 0.2 percentage points below the global lender's estimate from January.Major central banks including the U.S. Federal Reserve have responded to the slowdown by putting policy-tightening efforts on hold. That has eased the pressures that global financial markets felt at the end of 2018, when tightening loomed.Growth is projected to firm up in 2020, the IMF said, but some officials are worried the expected rebound will be threatened if the weakening in developed economies such as the United States, Japan and Europe worsens.""Despite the expected improvement in global economic growth, if economic slowdowns in major economies feed into other economies, the prospects for growth might deteriorate, bringing uncertainty across the entire global economy,"" Japanese Finance Minister Taro Aso said in his statement to the IMF committee.There is some cause for optimism. In Europe, many of the global factors weighing on growth appear to be waning, keeping alive expectations for a recovery in the second half of the year, European Central Bank President Mario Draghi said at a separate press conference.But he also warned that factors that undermine confidence, including the risk of a hard Brexit and a global trade war, continue to ""loom large,"" putting growth at risk.Trade disputes, especially the standoff between the United States and China, have been a central talking point at the meetings this week and have been widely cited as a primary driver behind the weakening of the global economy.""If you model tariffs on a large portion of the goods that are traded, you take the entire volume of goods traded between the U.S. and China in particular, $500 billion [US], you apply tariffs to that, you are putting at risk 0.8 per cent of global growth,"" IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde said.Earlier, China took a swipe at U.S. President Donald Trump's ""America First"" policies at the centre of the trade dispute between the world's two largest economies, including tit-for-tat tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars of goods.""The protectionism of some countries has harmed mutual trust among countries, limited the scope for multilateral co-operation, and impeded the willingness to achieve it,"" Chen Yulu, a vice governor at the People's Bank of China,"" said in a statement to the IMF.U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told reporters on the sidelines of the meetings that a U.S.-China trade agreement would go ""way beyond"" previous efforts to open China's markets to U.S. companies and hoped that the two sides were ""close to the final round"" of negotiations.Japan, which will kick off its own negotiations with the Trump administration in Washington on Monday aimed at averting automotive tariffs, also bemoaned the current state of trade.""The prolonging of trade tensions and policy uncertainties pose a serious risk to the global economy by undermining private investment, disrupting global supply chains and weakening productivity growth,"" Aso said."

U.S. stock indexes wobble as traders turn cautious over trade | CBC News,"Major U.S. stock indexes edged lower in afternoon trading Monday, a shaky start to the week for the market after the S&P 500 notched its first weekly gain in four weeks.",2019-10-14T16:14:17.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/stocks-us-china-trade-1.5320513,"Major U.S. stock indexes edged lower in afternoon trading Monday, a shaky start to the week for the market after the S&P 500 notched its first weekly gain in four weeks.Losses in consumer goods makers, utilities and industrial stocks outweighed gains in banks and elsewhere in the market. Energy stocks also fell as crude oil prices headed lower.Trading was choppy for much of the day after falling in the early going. The muted trading follows a rally Friday spurred by investor optimism amid signs of progress in the latest round of trade negotiations between the U.S. and China.Washington and Beijing agreed to a truce following talks last week. The U.S. held off on tariffs set to kick in this week and China agreed to buy more farm goods. But the U.S. has yet to cancel plans for more tariffs in December and the nations still have several complicated issues to negotiate, which may have dimmed some of the optimism that fuelled last week's market rally.Procter & Gamble contributed to the slide in consumer goods makers, dropping 0.8 per cent. Colgate-Palmolive fell 1.5 per cent.Deere & Co. helped pull industrial sector stocks lower, falling 1.3 per cent. Communication services companies also fell. Comcast dropped 0.7 per cent and Twitter was down 1.3 per cent.Some energy companies declined as crude oil prices dropped 2 per cent. Devon Energy slid 1.9 per cent.Financial stocks rose, with insurers among the gainers. Progressive added 0.6 per cent. Several pharmaceutical companies helped drive health care stocks higher. Amgen rose 1.3 per cent and Alexion Pharmaceuticals climbed 2.3 per cent.Bond markets and the U.S. government were closed for the Columbus Day holiday.Investors are also looking ahead to the start of the third-quarter earnings season, as companies begin to report their latest quarterly results. Major investment banks and other big companies are scheduled to serve up their report cards for the July-September quarter this week, including JPMorgan Chase, Johnson & Johnson, United Airlines, Netflix, Coca-Cola and UnitedHealth Group.Expectations for S&P 500 companies' third-quarter results are generally low, with analysts forecasting a drop of 4.2 per cent from a year ago. The results, plus what CEOs say about their spending and revenue forecasts, should give a better picture of the economy's potential direction.""The market is a little bit nervous about earnings because there are some estimates out there that say there's going to be negative growth,"" said Karyn Cavanaugh, senior markets strategist at Voya Investment Management.The S&P 500 index was down 0.1 per cent as of 3:18 p.m. ET. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 24 points, or 0.1 per cent, to 26,791. The Nasdaq rose less 0.1 per cent. Small-company stocks did worse than the rest of the market. The Russell 2000 index lost 0.4 per cent.Investors applauded the progress made by the U.S. and China last week, but uncertainty remains over whether they can ink a broader deal. The U.S. agreed to suspend a planned hike in tariffs on $250 billion US of Chinese goods that had been set to kick in Tuesday. Beijing, meanwhile, agreed to buy $40 billion to $50 billion in U.S. farm products.The truce was a result of the 13th round of negotiations between the nations since the trade war began well over a year ago. The key sticking points of intellectual property and trade secrets still hang over the dispute.The overall picture hasn't changed for companies, which are still holding off on forecasts and investments because of the uncertain trade situation.""There is not yet a viable path to existing tariffs declining and tariff escalation remains a meaningful risk,"" Michael D. Zezas, a Morgan Stanley strategist, wrote in a note to clients. ""Thus, we do not expect a meaningful rebound in corporate behaviour that would drive global growth expectations higher.""Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping are due to attend an economic conference in Chile in mid-November. That is raising hopes a face-to-face meeting might produce progress.Several major banks will report their latest quarterly financial results this week and give investors an opening glimpse into the latest round of corporate earnings. JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Wells Fargo will all report results on Tuesday. Bank of America and PNC Financial will report results on Wednesday.Investors will be watching for information on income from loans as banks contend with sinking bond yields. Falling yields force banks to set lower rates on mortgages and other kinds of loans.Shares in Parsley Energy slid 11.1 per cent on news the oil and gas company is buying Jagged Peak Energy in an all-stock deal. Jagged Peak shares dropped 1.3 per cent.Aecom climbed 6.1 per cent after the provider of technical and management-support services said it is selling its management services business.European markets closed lower. The European Union faces a potential trade war with the U.S. as the Trump administration readies trade sanctions on up to $7.5 billion worth of goods. The tariffs are set to go into effect Friday and stem from a dispute over subsidies to the airplane maker Airbus."
What you need to know about the Boeing 737 Max 8 and why it's still grounded | CBC News,"Here's what you need to know as Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg testifies before two U.S. congressional committees this week, one year after the first of two deadly crashes involving its 737 Max 8.",2019-10-29T08:00:36.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/boeing-737-max-ceo-u-s-congress-testimony-fatal-crashes-1.5338848,"The CEO of Boeing begins two days of testimony before U.S. Congress on Tuesday, the one-year anniversary of the first deadly crash of a Boeing 737 Max 8.Dennis Muilenburg, who was stripped of his Boeing chair title earlier this month, is expected to acknowledge that the aircraft manufacturer made mistakes in the wake of two crashes in 2018 and 2019 involving the aircraft, which killed a total of 346 people. ""We have learned and are still learning from these accidents,"" Muilenburg said in comments prepared for delivery Tuesday to a Senate committee. ""We know we made mistakes and got some things wrong. We own that, and we are fixing them."" Boeing is also facing a criminal probe by the U.S. Justice Department and is being sued by the families of some of the people who died in the crashes.Here's what you need to know as Muilenburg speaks to the U.S. Senate commerce committee Tuesday and the U.S. House transportation and infrastructure committee Wednesday.On Oct. 29, 2018, Lion Air Flight 610 crashed into the Java Sea minutes after takeoff from the Indonesian capital of Jakarta. All 189 passengers and crew on board died.Flight data recordings suggested the pilots struggled to maintain control of the jet as its automatic safety system repeatedly pushed down the plane's nose.Less than five months later, on March 10, 2019, another Boeing 737 Max 8 crashed, this one operated by Ethiopian Airlines. It also went down shortly after takeoff, this time from Addis Ababa.All 157 people on board died, including 18 Canadians. The second crash raised serious concerns about the safety of the jet, and airlines and aviation administrations began grounding the Boeing 737 Max. Ethiopian Airlines grounded its entire 737 Max fleet on the day of that crash. China's aviation authority ordered all jets in China grounded the next day.Also on March 11, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued a Continued Airworthiness Notification to the International Community. The U.K., the European Union, Australia and other countries moved quickly to ban the jet from their airspace. Canada, one of the final holdouts, acted on March 13, grounding all of its Boeing 737 Max 8 aircraft and banning the jet from entering its airspace until further notice.Early investigations into the two crashes focused on the jet's anti-stall system that kicked in and pushed down the noses of the planes. Boeing has acknowledged that both crashes involved the repeated activation of the Manoeuvring Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS) after the safety system received faulty sensor input. Indonesian investigators issued their final report into the Lion Air crash last week. It found that Boeing, acting with inadequate oversight from U.S. regulators, failed to grasp the risks of the design of the 737 Max cockpit software. And it concluded that the pilots had not been trained in how to respond to the jet's automated flight-control system. CBC News found that the Boeing 737 Max 8 manual only mentions MCAS once:A month earlier, the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board concluded that Boeing underestimated how long it takes pilots to diagnose and react — down to precise seconds — when they are being bombarded by multiple, cascading warning alerts. It said that in both crashes, the pilots' control columns would have shaken to warn of an impending stall, and that the pilots would have received several visual and audio alerts about things like altitude and speed.Ethiopian investigators released preliminary findings into the Ethiopian Airlines crash in April. It said the crew of the doomed jet did everything Boeing recommended when their plane started to nosedive, but that they could not save it. Their final report is expected next year.Earlier this year, several U.S. media outlets investigated whether the FAA allowed Boeing too much power to self-regulate. In March, the acting head of the FAA was grilled by a U.S. Senate panel on the subject. Daniel Elwell told senators it would cost $1.8 billion US and take 10,000 new employees for the U.S. aviation regulator to handle all aircraft certification internally.He also said the FAA ""is directly involved in the testing and certification of new and novel features and technologies.""Part of what U.S. Congress is currently looking into is whether there should be changes to how the FAA delegates some certification tasks to manufacturers for new airplanes.In the 737 Max certification, it initially delegated 40 per cent of the work to Boeing and later shifted more work to Boeing, including work on the MCAS.Last week, the U.S. Department of Transportation issued a report into the practice following its own investigation. It said the FAA faces a ""significant oversight challenge"" to ensure that companies conducting those tasks ""maintain high standards and comply with FAA safety regulations.""The Boeing 737 Max has not flown commercially since the March crash.Air Canada recently updated its plans for the jet, saying it will remain grounded until at least February 2020. Sunwing and WestJet have also confirmed they will not fly the jet before next year. U.S. airlines have cancelled 737 Max flights into January and February. The FAA has said it will not return the 737 Max to service until the regulator has determined the jet to be safe."

Election ads on WeChat posted by users: company | CBC News,"A Conservative attack ad spotted on Chinese social media giant WeChat was posted by a user without the company's knowledge, says the owner of the popular site. The platform's owner, Tencent, says election ads aren't running on its popular WeChat social media site and it has not set up an ad registry in Canada.",2019-10-14T08:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/wechat-election-social-media-1.5318589,"Note: This story has been updated from a previous version to include new information from WeChat owner Tencent. See full note below.A Conservative attack ad spotted on Chinese social media giant WeChat was posted by a user without the company's knowledge, says the owner of the popular site.The platform's owner, Tencent, says election ads aren't running on its popular WeChat social media site and it has not set up an ad registry in Canada.""WeChat does not accept or support political ads on its platform,"" spokeswoman Lisa Kennedy wrote in a statement.CBC News obtained a copy of a Conservative Party attack ad that ran on WeChat the week of October 9 in Chinese and English, claiming that a re-elected Liberal government under Justin Trudeau would legalize ""hard drugs"".""Justin Trudeau's Liberals have a plan to legalize hard drugs just like they legalized marijuana,"" reads the ad. ""Only Andrew Scheer's Conservatives will stop Trudeau's hard drug legalization plan and keep our kids safe.""The ad carries the Conservative Party's logo and says it was ""authorized by the official agent for the Conservative Party of Canada."" It's similar to an attack ad that appeared on the Conservative Party's official website on Oct. 9.Members of Elections Canada's social media monitoring team also have spotted Canadian election ads on WeChat, said spokeswoman Natasha Gauthier.""WeChat is one of the websites that they keep an eye on,"" she said. ""The team has seen political ads on WeChat but the team is not focused on detecting potential compliance or non-compliance.""Gauthier could not say which parties or candidates' ads Elections Canada officials have spotted on WeChat.Kennedy said Tencent conducted an internal review after the CBC reported on the presence of the Conservative ad on WeChat and confirmed it did not receive payment for it to be on the site. The company said it appears to have been posted there by a WeChat user.""WeChat allows users to send messages or share images and videos with other users but has no role in the creation or posting of user-content on its platform,"" the company said in a statement. ""Some user-posted content on WeChat may contain personal political views or advocacy.""She said the company has been contacted by Canadian authorities about the ad and is answering their questions.Conservative campaign manager Hamish Marshall refused to comment on which social media platforms the party is using for advertising in the election.""We don't comment on our advertising strategy,"" he said.Since then, he has not responded to requests to confirm that the party placed the ad found on WeChat. The party has been running a similar ad on Facebook.Canada's Chinese community is one of the groups the Conservative Party hopes to win over in this election.Trudeau has denied the Liberals have any plans to legalize hard drugs.The Liberals said they are advertising on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, but not on WeChat. The New Democrats said the party has focused its online advertising on Facebook and Instagram and the national campaign is not advertising on WeChat.Under recent changes to Canada's elections law, online companies that accept political ads during the election campaign have to set up digital registries of all of the political ads running on their platforms, with copies of the ads and information about who authorized them. The requirement has prompted some internet giants, including Google, to stop accepting political ads in Canada during the federal election.The law can apply to companies located anywhere in the world if the number of visitors from Canada to their sites exceeds a certain threshold.Platforms that publish in a language other than English or French must have more than 100,000 unique visitors from Canada each month to be subject to the law. Bryan Segal, senior vice-president of Comscore (which measures web traffic), said WeChat gets an average of 616,000 unique visitors in Canada per month.Gauthier said Elections Canada's monitors are looking for examples of online misinformation or disinformation about how and where to vote. They are not, however, responsible for checking whether an online platform that is subject to the law has set up an online registry.Commissioner of Canada Elections Yves Côté can investigate if someone files a complaint, said Gauthier.""It is an offence to be an online platform that meets these thresholds and to not have this registry. So that is an offence under the act,"" she said.""Penalties can range from administrative monetary penalties to what the commissioner calls compliance agreements, which it publishes on its website.""However, parties and candidates are not required by law to verify whether an online platform has set up a digital ad registry before they advertise, she said.Michelle Laliberté, a spokeswoman for Côté, said the commissioner's office doesn't ""proactively carry out monitoring or surveillance of digital platforms,"" but it can investigate complaints.""While I can't speak to whether or not we have received complaints in relation to this issue, if someone were to bring forward a complaint we would evaluate it to see if it falls within the Commissioner's mandate.""Elizabeth Thompson can be reached at elizabeth.thompson@cbc.ca"
Young Hong Kong legislators found guilty over oath-taking incident | CBC News,"A Hong Kong court has found two pro-independence activists guilty of unlawful assembly inside the legislature while they were still lawmakers, dealing a further blow to waning political dissent in the Chinese-ruled territory.",2018-05-11T11:27:21.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/hong-kong-verdict-leung-yau-1.4658323,"A Hong Kong court on Friday found two pro-independence activists guilty of unlawful assembly inside the legislature while they were still lawmakers, dealing a further blow to waning political dissent in the Chinese-ruled territory.Opposition leaders and supporters are fighting multiple court cases and Friday's verdict in Kowloon City Magistrates' Courts is likely to further dent the confidence of activists calling for full democracy, or even outright independence for the former British colony, a red line for Beijing.Sixtus (Baggio) Leung, 31, and Yau Wai-ching, 26, were democratically elected and then dramatically ousted from the Legislative Council for the way in which they took their oaths, criticizing China, in late 2016.Before they were officially disqualified, the pair tried to barge into a room along with at least eight assistants, scuffling with security officers.""Regardless of whether they were still Legislative Council members on that day, they would not be exempted from criminal liability on account of their capacity as council members,"" wrote magistrate Wong Sze-lai in the 65-page verdict. ""Their acts were likely to cause any person reasonably to fear that the persons so assembled would commit a breach of the peace.""Three assistants were also found guilty of the same charge.Leung and Yau told reporters they would decide whether to appeal after sentencing on June 4, but that they were ""actively considering it.""The two were once seen as potential leaders of a movement calling for Hong Kong's secession from China. Yau was the youngest woman ever elected to the legislature. Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule in 1997 under a ""one country, two systems"" formula which promises it a high degree of autonomy and freedoms not enjoyed in mainland China.But the perception that China is increasingly encroaching upon the city's freedoms has spurred a young generation of activists, many taking to the streets in months of pro-democracy protests in 2014 and some calling for outright independence.Communist Party leaders in Beijing, sensitive to calls for independence spreading to the mainland, have repeatedly slammed the movement. President Xi Jinping warned last year that any attempt to endanger China's sovereignty would be an act that crosses a ""red line.""The oath-taking incident triggered China's parliament to issue an interpretation over Hong Kong's mini-constitution while a court case over their seats was underway.The act spurred roughly 2,000 lawyers to protest what they called China's interference in the city's much vaunted judicial independence.Leung and Yau's disqualifications, as well as the arrest of pro-independence leader Edward Leung on rioting charges, sapped the secessionist movement of its steam. It has now largely gone underground."

OPEC faces 'make-or-break' decision on oil production | CBC News,Members of OPEC meet this week to discuss oil production cuts as the spread of COVID-19 has eroded crude prices worldwide.,2020-03-03T23:30:26.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/opec-oil-caronavirus-1.5483779,"OPEC and its allies meet regularly to assess the supply and demand for oil around the globe, but few gatherings have happened under such volatile and trying circumstances.COVID-19's spread has weighed mightily on stock markets and oil prices in recent weeks, with experts still trying to assess the risk the virus poses worldwide.For OPEC, the situation is another big test of the cartel's ability to stabilize oil prices when struck with unexpected turbulence.""It's very important,"" said Judith Dwarkin, chief economist of RS Energy Group in Calgary.""They're facing a make-or-break decision about how to respond to COVID-19 disease, which has now spread beyond China and does pose a threat to global public health and the global economy.""While the impact of the illness on citizens' welfare is a paramount concern, markets are growing increasingly troubled about the blow it will have on world economies.Global oil prices have fallen 20 per cent since the start of the year as the novel coronavirus has spread. In Canada, a downturn in oil prices might not only have an impact on the revenues of oil companies but government coffers, too.Last week, Alberta revealed a provincial budget built in part on oil prices averaging $58 US a barrel in North America. On Monday, oil prices closed a little above $47 US a barrel.Members of OPEC and their allies are meeting this week at the group's headquarters in Vienna, Austria.OPEC, Russia and other producers already have a deal in place to cut output from Jan. 1 by 2.1 million barrels per day (bpd), a figure that includes additional voluntary cuts by Saudi Arabia.But that has not been enough to counter the impact of the virus on China, the world's biggest oil importer, and on the  global economy, as factories are disrupted, fewer people travel and other business slows, curbing oil demand.""China is the front line for impact in the first quarter [of the year],"" Dwarkin said. ""We estimate roughly 900,000 barrels per day has probably been sliced out of China's oil demand. So the need to make a decision to deepen cuts is important."" On Tuesday, officials indicated they were considering deeper cuts in a bid to lift crude prices.Reuters reported a panel of OPEC and its allies recommended cutting oil output by an extra one million bpd on Tuesday signalling that Russia and Saudi Arabia were moving closer to a deal to prop up prices.Leading into this week's meetings, some experts anticipated the cartel's cut might amount to only 600,000 bpd — a figure that might have underwhelmed the market given current uncertainty.Indeed, things are moving quickly and analysts are trying to understand just how the virus' spread will impact economic activity, especially consumer activity.Denton Cinquegrana, chief oil analyst at the Oil Price Information Service by IHS Markit, said it seems like China may be turning a corner, but the virus is only beginning to impact people in the U.S.""Here, in the United States, you're starting to see a little bit of the panic and spread of the virus start to take place and have an impact on demand,"" he said. ""The demand impact we may not know for really a couple months down the road.""Cinquegrana said if OPEC agreed to just the 600,000 bpd cut, Saudi Arabia may go ""a little bit on their own"" to bring the number closer to one million bpd.""That may be enough to get it back close to the $50-a-barrel level,"" he said. ""But, again, there's some real concerns about demand going forward."" A cut in U.S. interest rates on Tuesday offered only limited support for crude ahead of the OPEC meetings on Thursday and Friday.The price of West Texas Intermediate crude, the North American benchmark, closed up 43 cents at $47.18 US per barrel on Tuesday. Brent crude, the global benchmark, fell four cents a barrel to settle at $51.86 US a barrel.Dwarkin said COVID-19 has made OPEC's work an even heavier lift this week.""But as one former Saudi oil minister said, OPEC is like a teabag,"" Dwarkin added.""It works best when it's plunged into hot water. Well, it's definitely in hot water right now.""  "

Raptors' Gasol says frustration from hamstring injury fuelled transformation | CBC Sports,"Coming off a heady few months of an NBA title and a FIBA World Cup win, Marc Gasol couldn't replicate that success with the Toronto Raptors this season. The frustration gnawed at him.",2020-07-15T19:58:06.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/sports/basketball/nba/toronto-raptors-marc-gasol-transformation-1.5650983,"Coming off a heady few months of an NBA title and a FIBA World Cup win, Marc Gasol couldn't replicate that success with the Toronto Raptors this season.The frustration gnawed at him.And so when COVID-19 shut down the NBA on March 11, the Raptors veteran forward reached out to his personal training staff and vowed to make good use of the down time.While Gasol wouldn't divulge how much weight he'd shed from his six-foot-11 frame — he said it ""wasn't relevant"" — his trimmed-down physique is obvious.""It was a frustrating season for me personally because I could never get a rhythm and help the team the way that I should be helping the team,"" Gasol said Wednesday, in his first comments to the media since the league shuttered four months ago.""As soon as... we got informed the [Toronto training] facility was closing down, I got together with my team on a phone call and got going on a plan to resolve these ongoing issues.""Those issues kept Gasol on the bench for 28 of the Raptors' 64 games with a nagging hamstring injury.The 35-year-old credited consistency with part of the weight loss — eating and sleeping with more regularity at home in Spain, removed from the rigours of NBA travel.""[Consistency] goes with training regimen, goals, sleeping habits, everything,"" he said. ""Obviously when you're at home, everything is a lot easier than when you're on the road and travelling and trying to make everything work and winning games, which at the end of the day, that's what you're judged for.""Soon after Toronto's historic championship run, Gasol punched in with Spain's national team, which won the World Cup in China in August. He figures his hamstring troubles were a product of those gruelling few months.""You have to put in the time, you have to put in the work if you're going to use that much energy,"" he said. ""If you only take money out of the bank and never put money in the bank, you're going to go broke.""Gasol's teammates have raved about his transformation.Gasol isn't the only Raptor who showed up in Florida for the NBA's restart in terrific shape. Coach Nick Nurse has praised the hard work of team leader Kyle Lowry, who looks fit and trim. And Chris Boucher put a much-needed 15 pounds of muscle on his long-limbed frame.Gasol said beyond the fitness component, he and his teammates are itching to play. He can see it in the competitiveness on the court and off.""We compete amongst each other every single day and try to go at each other's neck a little bit. I think that's always positive,"" he said. ""That is one of the things we missed the most during confinement — the competition. Some guys like to compete at computer games. Some of us are not really into those things. We missed competing against other human beings in real life.""Gasol said there's been some cutthroat video games between players.""You don't want to play me in video games, I'll tell you that much,"" Gasol said.Pascal Siakam then jumped into the frame on the Zoom call and told reporters ""FIFA king right here. Make sure you get that on camera.""Let’s do this! 👊🏽<br>It’s the little details that are vital 🤙🏽<br>Step by step ✍🏽 <a href=""https://t.co/4IgJbNhsga"">pic.twitter.com/4IgJbNhsga</a>The 22 teams in the NBA restart are being housed at Walt Disney World in Orlando under strict health and safety protocols. While there are social activities such as a players lounge, boat trips, fishing, and water parks, the Raptors know one of the toughest challenges over what could stretch into three months on the campus will be loneliness.Gasol appreciated the photos of his family Raptors staff had placed in his room before he checked in.""Obviously it's not ideal to be separated from your family but once you know they are well, also understanding and explaining to them the risk and make sure they follow all the protocols that they have to follow,"" said Gasol, whose wife and two kids are in Spain.""[The photos] were a great gesture.""While there've been complaints from players about the food and accommodations, and a couple of players have been quarantined for inadvertently straying outside the campus bubble, Gasol said they're all in the same boat, and ""trying to make the best out of it.""I'm sure if you want to you can find millions of excuses of why this is not a good idea, you just have to find a good reason to stick with it and try to win another championship,"" he said.""So, whatever that is for, for each player, I hope that they can really hold it strong and lean on one another when the tough time comes, because they will come and things will get a little bit tougher on the mental aspect, and just knowing that you have your teammates, always next to you to support you.""Gasol lived under full lockdown in Spain, which was one of the hardest hit countries in the pandemic's early days.Now, the NBA sits virtually in one of the epicentres of the coronavirus. Florida reported more than 10,000 new cases Wednesday, surpassing 300,000 cases.The Raptors play the Houston Rockets on July 24 in their first of three scrimmages. They play the Los Angeles Lakers on Aug. 1 in the first of eight seeding games.Gasol spent part of the summer of 2018 on a rescue ship in the Mediterranean Sea, helping pluck terrified people from the water, migrants fleeing Libya for the shores of Europe.Gasol was vocal about his anger and frustration at the time at an Italian government that was trying to halt the influx of refugees.The Toronto Raptors centre has seen the stain of racism in Europe, including his home country of Spain.And so while the U.S. has erupted in anti-racism Black Lives Matter protests, and social and racial justice will be a theme of the NBA's restart at Walt Disney World, Gasol knows racism extends far beyond America's borders.""We can see how we treat a lot of immigrants that come from Africa to Europe, the way we deal with it — not 'we,' but a lot of people do, sadly in Spain or Italy or other countries around Europe.""We look at them as immigrants, not only as human beings. So that tag that you put on [them] already tells you a lot of stuff about the way you view them. All those things needs to needs to change, and if it doesn't come from the top and from the government, it has to come from the people."""
Mining ventilation expert says better air flow could clear the air and curb spread of COVID | CBC News,"As store owners continue to open their doors, they're making sure to think about the health and safety of their customers and staff. But an expert in ventilation and public health wants these businesses to also be thinking about air flow in their building. He says small particles of COVID-19 can linger in the air particularly where there is poor ventilation.",2020-07-14T09:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/sudbury/indoor-air-ventilation-covid19-1.5648186,"As store owners continue to open their doors, they're making sure to think about the health and safety of their customers and staff.Of course physical distancing measures are still in place, and many communities, like Sudbury, have made face coverings a required accessory for indoor public spaces.But a Sudbury physicist who develops ventilation systems for the mining industry, feels we need to take more than just physical distancing into consideration when we're indoors.Daniel Cluff is the CEO of CanMIND Associates, which develops ventilation systems for the mining industry. He even worked on the first clean room underground for the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory (SNOlab).Cluff feels that physical distancing is important with COVID-19 to ensure droplets or large particles of the virus, from an infected person, fall to the floor instead of passing on to someone else.He admits he's not a medical expert but he's been following much of the research on ventilation systems connected to COVID-19.He thinks it's possible that smaller particles could continue to linger, suspended in the air, long after the large particles have fallen.""Eventually they might even hit the roof, depending on if there's a little bit of turbulence. As time goes by these [small particles] will build up.""In order to clear these built-up particles from the air within indoor public spaces, Cluff says proper ventilation is essential.But he says there is a danger if the air flow speeds up or blows too quickly.""The more the air is moving the more the larger particles can get entrained in the air, then it has the reverse effect. It's actually more dangerous because now you've got all the big particles flying around. They could splash you in the face, get in your eye.""He suggests a fine balance of air changing, called laminar flow.Paul Bozek is a professor in the Occupational and Environmental Health Division with the Dalla Lana School of Public Health at the University of Toronto. He teaches about ventilation to students pursuing a career in public health.He says the risk is low of contracting the virus through small particles in the air. But it's not impossible. If air flow is closed off in a space, then anyone spending a long time in that space could be affected. ""It's not just distance when you're talking about living or working or shopping indoors. Time and ventilation can affect your risk of being infected,"" Bozek said.""For a well ventilated space where you're keeping your physical distance and you're minimizing your time, it's not a risk."" He adds the same goes for just momentarily passing through a poorly ventilated space.Bozek cites one instance where individuals contracted COVID-19 at a restaurant in Guangzhou, China.A cluster of COVID-19 developed after several groups of patrons had been eating at tables which were far enough apart for physical distancing. It was the air conditioning unit that turned out to be the culprit.To improve ventilation, Bozek suggests letting some outdoor air in to help dilute any indoor air that could have lingering particles of COVID-19.Bozek says he's rather disappointed with what the provincial government has offered up for ventilation directives on its website for businesses that are looking to reopen. It simply says to ""Open doors and windows to let in more fresh air.""In an email to CBC News, Public Health Ontario (PHO) offered general advice on ventilation in indoor and general public settings, such as increasing outdoor air ventilation, maintaining air handling systems and possibly running them longer, and increasing air flows with portable fans and air conditioning.PHO also added that reducing the risk of infection also means following current public health guidance, like physical distancing, and using a non-medical face mask while in indoor public spaces."

"Cheers for trade minister's talk on canola, Churchill port at Sask. municipalities conference | CBC News",International Trade Minister Jim Carr tried to assuage fears about canola trade with China at the Saskatchewan Association of Rural Municipalities conference on Thursday.,2019-03-14T20:15:20.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatoon/sarm-conference-jim-carr-1.5056789,"China's refusal to buy Richardson International's canola has many farmers in Saskatchewan nervous, but International Trade Minister Jim Carr tried to assuage those fears Thursday.Carr spoke to a full conference hall at the Saskatchewan Association of Rural Municipalities' annual convention in Saskatoon. Unlike his federal Liberal counterpart Ralph Goodale, who was booed at the conference the day before, Carr stepped on stage to a warm reception.Early in his speech, he addressed the trade situation with China — undoubtedly one of the biggest concerns for rural municipalities in the province, which represent many of Saskatchewan's farmers.""The Canadian Food Inspection Agency said it was an  absolutely fine batch. The Chinese think differently. So what we want is the evidence that there's a problem,"" Carr told reporters after his speech at the SARM convention. He did not take questions from the audience.China banned imports of canola seed and other products from Winnipeg-based Richardson last week.The country's foreign ministry said the decision to revoke Richardson's registration to ship canola seeds to China was due to fears of insect infestation, but many in Canada suspect the issue is connected to conflict between the countries over Canada's arrest of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou.Both Goodale and Carr spoke at length at the SARM convention about the need for ""scientific evidence"" in the canola dispute, which they say is lacking from China's claims about Richardson's product.While farmers at SARM have been vocal about the fact that they want the canola trade issue resolved quickly, Carr was non-commital about what will happen if China does not produce that scientific evidence.""Let's take it one day at a time,"" Carr said.""We know that within the next 60 days, decisions will have to be made.""The Winnipeg MP did bring some well-recieved news to the SARM convention, when he mentioned the federal government's work on increasing rail service to the northern port of Churchill, Man.It's the location of Canada's only deep-water Arctic port. The feds made a $117-million commitment to reopening the rail line and port, after the railway was out of service for more than a year following flooding in 2017.The railway to the northern Manitoba town, a marine fuel tank farm there and the Port of Churchill were sold by Denver-based Omnitrax to Arctic Gateway Group last year.Carr said the Arctic Gateway deal will improve the trade prospects for products from northern Saskatchewan.""Now we have access to this port with a refurbished train track, and a port that's going to be positioned to trade with the world,"" said Carr.""Not only is it good for us as Prairie folk but it's good for the country as we expand our trade opportunities worldwide.""Speaking to reporters after the speech, he identified a facet of climate change that he believes might be beneficial for trade — more open water in Canada's north.""Some say that within a generation or more that the water is going to be open, which means that we will have access through our northern port to trading routes around the world.""Carr said research out of the University of Manitoba has centred on ice and permafrost in Churchill."

Premature victory lap?

Supreme Court.The Huawei executive took part in a staged downtown Vancouver photo shoot as security guards stood watch Saturday evening. She jumped out of a black SUV to take centre stage once a group of family and friends had arranged themselves in front of a photographer.It was an unusual move for the 48-year-old chief financial officer of the telecommunications giant. And even more so for a defendant who will learn this week whether the court's associate chief justice believes Meng is accused of an offence worthy of extradition to the United States.""I can't say that I've seen that [before],"" said Gary Botting, an expert on the Canadian extradition process.""You can hardly blame her. This has gone on for nearly two years.""Meng was arrested on Dec. 1, 2018, at Vancouver's airport after arriving from Hong Kong for what was supposed to be a stopover en route to Mexico City and Argentina.The U.S. wants Meng extradited to New York to face fraud charges for allegedly lying to an HSBC executive at a meeting in Hong Kong about Huawei's relationship with a subsidiary accused of violating U.S. sanctions against Iran.U.S. prosecutors claim banks in turn placed themselves at risk of running afoul of U.S. regulations by relying on Meng's alleged lies to continue handling Huawei's finances, risking prosecution and massive penalties in the process.B.C. Supreme Court Associate Chief Justice Heather Holmes announced her plans last week to deliver a decision Wednesday on an issue that could end the extradition process: double criminality.If Holmes rules that the offence Meng is accused of committing in the U.S. would not have been considered a crime had it occurred in Canada at the time the arrest warrant was issued, then there was no double criminality, and Meng could be free to return to China — barring further detention on appeal.Saturday's appearance on the courthouse steps marked a very different look from the one Meng first presented to the world in December 2018. At that point, she had spent a week in a women's prison in Maple Ridge, B.C., emerging from the courthouse in a tracksuit to the glare of cameras, after being released on $10 million bail. Meng is the daughter of Huawei's billionaire founder, Ren Zhengfei. She currently lives under house arrest in one of two multi-million dollar homes she owns on Vancouver's west side. The terms of her release allow her movement around the city under the constant watch of a security detail.Her plainclothes guards paced the sidewalk outside the courthouse for an hour before Meng arrived Saturday evening, their black SUV parked nearby.A CBC reporter and photographer watched unobserved, from a distance.At around 7 p.m., a photographer hauled a step ladder onto the sidewalk and another large black vehicle pulled up. A number of women and men dressed in suits began assembling on the stairs.Meng has appeared in court in designer dresses and shoes worth thousands, her wardrobe becoming part of her publicity strategy. Once the group of 11 people who would join her in the photographs found their places, Meng emerged from the SUV in a sleeveless black dress that reached to her ankles.She pulled the hem of the dress up at one point to reveal the GPS ankle monitoring bracelet she must wear under the terms of her release.Huawei board member and head of global media Vincent Peng, a longtime friend, stood next to Meng as the group smiled, made peace signs and gave thumbs-up to the camera.After no more than about four minutes, Meng was back in the vehicle.Meng has denied the charges against her, and both she and her father have expressed confidence in the Canadian judicial system. Still, it's rare to see an accused appear to celebrate before a decision.Botting believes Meng has reason to be hopeful.WATCH | Meng has courthouse photoshoots 2 days before key court decision:The NationalDuring four days of hearings in January, Meng's lawyers argued the U.S. was trying to use Canada to enforce sanctions Canadians rejected by choosing to remain in a global treaty aimed at limiting Iran's nuclear ambitions that U.S. President Donald Trump decided to leave.The Crown, on the other hand, claims Meng's alleged offence is one of fraud: depriving a bank through a lie. And that's a crime in the U.S. and Canada.""I think there's a good chance of success in the sense that when it boils down to the nitty-gritty, is this criminal in Canada? What she's alleged to have done, if instead of the United States, it was Canada who was bringing the prosecution, would we continue with the prosecution? Would we regard this as being criminal enough to carry it forward and bring it to trial?"" Botting asked.""I think the answer is, fairly clearly, we wouldn't.""Botting says the strength of the case is undermined by the fact the alleged offence occurred in Hong Kong and the alleged victim is a U.K. bank. He calls Meng's detention arbitrary.If Holmes sides with the Crown, Meng's lawyers will have another chance to fight the extradition with arguments over what they claim was an abuse of her rights at the time of her arrest.But if Meng is successful, the Crown could appeal. Botting says she would not need to be in detention while the appeal is ongoing, but says U.S. prosecutors may well want to keep her in Canada.""If she's smart, she'll go back to China,"" he says.In the meantime, Canadians Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor remain in custody in China, where they were detained just days after Meng's arrest. Kovrig, a former diplomat, and Spavor, an entrepreneur, have been accused of spying in what many observers believe is retaliation for Canada's decision to act on behalf of the U.S. in regards to Meng.The Canadian government has denounced China's treatment of the two men, who are being held behind bars and have been denied access to lawyers.Many have pointed out the disparity between Meng's gold-plated, self-funded home-arrest and Kovrig and Spavor's harsh treatment.And unlike Meng, neither man is appearing in any pictures."

I feel very fortunate to be in this position and be able to play this game and help these guys be part of history of Spanish basketball.""Llull and Rudy Fernandez — the team captain, the one who initially got to accept the Naismith Trophy — went to cut down the nets shortly after the final buzzer. Gasol carried the game ball to the gold-medal ceremony, and Spanish fans wept in the stands during the national anthem.Gabriel Deck scored 24 points for Argentina (8-1), which got off to a slow start and played uphill the rest of the way. Luis Scola was held to eight points, shooting 1 for 10 from the floor.""We're sad right now. We're very sad,"" Scola said. ""But I feel confident, in hours, we'll be able to look back and be very proud. They just played better than us. They were better. They deserved to win. They were the better team in the game and the tournament.""Spain led 43-31 at intermission, after putting together a 14-2 run to open the game and a 17-1 run later in the half.""This is basketball,"" Argentina coach Sergio Hernandez said. ""If you play better than the other team, you win the game. And Spain was the best team today.""Scola, even at 39 years old still Argentina's best player throughout the tournament, didn't get on the scoresheet until he made a pair of free throws with 2:57 left in the third quarter. But they only cut the Spain lead to 19, and by then the Argentinian fans who stood, sang and chanted for much of the game were relatively quiet.The day belonged to Spain.And the year belongs to Gasol.""It's unbelievable,"" Gasol said."

"Premier, producers commend federal government's plan to boost loans for farmers | CBC News","Help from Ottawa in the form of cash advances is a welcome short-term solution for farmers caught in a trade dispute between Canada and its number one canola customer China, according to the Premier of Saskatchewan and canola producers in the province.",2019-05-01T16:05:25.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/premier-producers-commend-federal-government-s-plan-to-boost-loans-for-farmers-1.5118347,"Help from Ottawa in the form of cash advances is a welcome short-term solution for farmers caught in a trade dispute between Canada and its number one canola customer China, according to the Premier of Saskatchewan and canola producers in the province.China has stopped taking canola seed from Canada, saying it's contaminated with pests. Experts say it's a political move after an executive from Chinese telecom company Huawei was detained in B.C.On Wednesday the federal government announced that it will more than double the maximum amount of money available to individual producers under the Advance Payments Program (APP), from $400,000 per year to $1 million.The increase will be available to all Canadian farmers. For canola producers, the interest-free portion will be increased to $500,000 from $100,000.Premier Scott Moe wrote a letter to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau last month calling for changes to the APP, including a request for interest-free loans of $1 million dollars.Although Trudeau didn't meet that specific request, Moe said Ottawa's new plan will help many farmers in Saskatchewan start seeding. ""We're appreciative of the effort. I think, in fairness, the federal government has shown that they do support Canadian, Western Canadian agriculture and Canadian agriculture by extension,"" Moe said. Moe said the next goal is restoring a positive trading relationship with China. The federal government has also announced that it will lead a trade mission to Japan and South Korea in early June and will engage in outreach to other countries, looking for new markets for Canadian canola.Moe said Saskatchewan's trade and agriculture ministers have been invited to accompany the federal government in that trade mission.""One of them, at least, will be attending that as we are always open to, and aggressively seeking, the opportunities that we have to market our exports into other markets and to expand our exports,"" Moe said.Todd Lewis, president of the Agricultural Producers Association of Saskatchewan, farms at Gray, Sask. He said the federal government's solution will work to temporarily assist producers with canola they are unable to sell.""They'll be able to take an advance on that canola and also on next year's crop. So it will help a bit on the cash flow,"" Lewis said. ""It's a short term remedy. It's not going to fix everything.""""I think the million dollars sounds like a lot of money but it just speaks to the risks in agriculture. It's not uncommon for farmers to be spending more than a million dollars to put their crop in.""Lewis said producers have been calling for an increase in APP amounts, which have remained stagnant for years.""Unfortunately we need a crisis like this canola trade situation with China to be the catalyst for it, but it's welcome,"" Lewis said. Lewis said the increase in interest-free loans will save producers thousands of dollars in interest.The federal government wants the CFIA to travel to China and test canola seeds exported from Canada. Lewis said he supports that idea.""Between the CFIA and the Canadian Green Commission we have a system in place second to none for traceability and we know that when we ship our canola off from the farm gate that it's in good shape and we're certainly have had the tools in place to back that Canada ships good canola to our customers worldwide,"" said Lewis.""Hopefully the CFIA will be able to put that part of this situation to rest, that China has in fact received good product.""Lewis said that if it is merely a political move, it will probably take longer to mend the relationship and restore trading.Moe has suggested retaliating against China for closing the door on Canadian canola. Lewis said he would caution the government to ""tread lightly.""""We sure don't want to see this trade trade situation escalate,"" Lewis said.He said a full-on trade would be bad for both Canada and China.""Food and politics don't mix and this is just another situation here where there's not going to be any winners in this if we see this trade war escalated."""

"To fight climate change, already-available clean tech needs to dramatically scale up | CBC News","From solar power to self-driving electric cars, we have access to the technologies and tools to help battle the devastating effects of climate change. But to make a difference, they need to be implemented on a global scale.",2018-10-24T08:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/technology-climate-change-1.4874850,"From solar power to self-driving electric cars, we already have access to the technologies and tools that can help battle the devastating effects of climate change. That's the good news.But in light of the dire warning about the planet's future issued by the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change earlier this month — which called for urgency in reducing global carbon emissions by more than 50 per cent in the next decade, lest we face widespread drought and extinction — those clean tech solutions might not be enough.Until enough people rally their efforts to push for global change from energy-gobbling governments and industry, experts say our individual choices and actions may be insufficient.That's where some of our most pervasive tech tools — from social media to the internet itself — can come in to play.Where we're stuck right now isn't about access to or availability of technology, according to clean tech experts. But rather it's an issue of implementation. To make any substantial difference, that implementation needs to be global in scale.It's easy to think of technology today as smartphones, virtual reality or any of the personal gadgets that distract us, making our lives easier, faster — and just more fun. But the grids that charge those devices and power our cities are, in fact, the most dominant technology in our lives. And in large part, they're still running off fossil fuels.Until that grid's energy is clean, all of the tools and toys and gadgets we plug in are not, says Tom Rand, a clean tech venture capitalist and author of Kick the Fossil Fuel Habit.""The biggest challenge is that infrastructure takes a long time to replace,"" he said.But solutions do exist. Rand explains that we're ""starting to see more grid-scale energy storage,"" which involves storing massive amounts of electricity on the grid, many magnitudes greater than say an electric car battery,  making it both cleaner and more efficient.""That makes possible endless amounts of solar and wind on the grid,"" he said.Electric vehicles, including cars and public transport, offer more hope.""Once people have affordable options for clean transportation, that will go a long way to cutting emissions,"" said John Paul Morgan, chief technology officer (CTO) of the Toronto-based Morgan Solar.And while realistically not everyone is going to buy an electric car, ""it's things like convenient apps to summon transit, bike-sharing networks, and electric scooters that are going to make a bigger difference,"" Morgan said.Yet for all of the sustainable solutions coming from the world of tech, there are also some pretty big culprits adding to our emissions, including bitcoin, which has been at the centre of its own sustainability controversy due to the excessive energy needed to run the computers that ""mine"" the cryptocurrency.New research suggests ceasing the trade of bitcoin would reduce global energy consumption by enough to account for a full year's worth of the emissions cuts required to limit temperature rises to the UN's suggestion.And while bitcoin enthusiasts argue that the conversation around the digital currency and its energy use has been oversimplified, critics maintain that it is an energy nightmare.""For the sake of the planet, I hope bitcoin dies,"" said Morgan.As for what individuals can do, experts are divided. Some say that due to the urgency of the climate situation, it's out of our hands and now up to governments, industry and policy-makers.But others believe that doing something is better than doing nothing, and reducing consumption — including how much we rely on power — is a big part of the solution.For those looking to integrate more sustainable energy sources into our daily lives, Rand says his first suggestion is to look at alternatives to natural gas for heating homes, such as installing a heat pump, which he says, ""is super-efficient at pulling heat out of even very cold air, and most importantly, it runs off solar- or wind-powered electricity.""And while electric vehicles are helpful, reducing our carbon footprint isn't just about how we get around — it's how much we travel each day, as well.While it may not be an option for workers in all sectors, more Canadians could be working from their homes, using video chat and digital communications tools to stay connected, while keeping cars off the roads.Even among those like Morgan, who says that battling climate change is no longer a challenge for individuals alone, there still are ways we can use technology to help — by using it to come together.""The most meaningful thing we can do is to organize politically and push for collective action,"" said Morgan.After all, when it comes to tech and climate change, he reminds us that the challenge isn't about a lack of tools or solutions; it's more about awareness and adoption. Technology has repeatedly been used to get people to rally behind causes they believe in, which might be the most important next step.What we need, according to Morgan, is for climate change ""to go viral."""

The USTR documents make it clear, however, that the exemptions are not permanent, which leaves the door open to reimposing them later on.The move comes as U.S. and Chinese negotiators had face-to-face talks in Washington this week. With another round of tariffs set to be implemented soon, strategist Chris Krueger of Cowan Research Group said ""we would interpret another delay as a goodwill gesture.""Last week, China made such a gesture of its own by exempting 16 different types of U.S. agricultural products, including soybeans and pork, from its own import levies, a move that Krueger described as ""the quid for the quo of some tariff relief.""""All of this could go sideways [again],"" he said, but added that even such a modest rapprochement on the trade file could be ""a signal that the trade war is entering into a frozen conflict."""

""China has been implementing his vision for more than 30 years with remarkable and tremendous results.""Wong says Sun's ideas about modernizing China are responsible for taking it from a ""poor, backward"" nation in the first half of the 20th Century to its position today as the second-largest economy on the planet.China's growth has been seen globally, he says, especially in Vancouver, where money from that nation has inflated real estate prices.However, he says his great-grandfather would be ""quite disappointed"" in how modern China has seen the benefits of that economic growth go to a select few in the country and how China has such a dismal history on human rights.Wong's mother, Lily Sun, agrees China needs to do more to adopt Sun's ideas.She is Sun's granddaughter and has spent almost 40 years studying his legacy and advocating for his three principles to be fully adopted by his home country.""Most of the overseas Chinese, yes, they accept [the three principles],"" she said. ""In China, they are in a very primitive stage. Some of them change my grandfather's ideas, like the three principles.""Wong says British Columbia has a special connection to Sun. Sun visited Vancouver three times during the revolutionary period at the turn of the 20th Century and raised $40,000 from Chinese communities in Victoria and Vancouver.""That was a huge support for the revolution,"" Wong said. ""So Dr. Sun Yat Sen remains a bridge between Vancouver and China, and it really is a tremendous honour for Vancouver to honour Dr. Sun Yat Sen by naming the Chinese classical garden after him.""With files form CBC Radio One's On The Coast"

Nissan announced an interim dividend of 10 yen per share, down from 28.50 yen a year ago.The company's global vehicle sales fell 7.5 per cent to 1.27 million in the quarter. Sales in China, its biggest market, fell 2.5 per cent, while those in the United States fell 4.5 per cent.""Our sales in China outpaced the market, but sales in other key regions, including the U.S., Europe, and Japan underperformed,"" Stephen Ma, a corporate vice-president who will become chief financial officer next month, told reporters.Slowing demand for cars in the United States and China, the world's biggest auto markets, has led to cut-throat competition, and Nissan's slump in first-half sales has knocked operating profit off course from the automaker's full-year target.""We are revisiting all our assumptions, and as you can see that is why we revised down our forecast for sales volume for the full year,"" Ma said.Nissan slashed its full-year operating profit forecast by 35 per cent to 150 billion yen, which would be its worst full-year performance in 11 years.It now sees global retail sales at 5.2 million vehicles, down from a previous forecast for 5.5 million, bracing for its worst annual sales in six years.Nissan in the past few weeks has announced a revamp of its top ranks with younger executives including Ma, while naming the head of its China business, 53-year-old Makoto Uchida, as its next chief executive. The company is seeking to draw a line under the legacy of Ghosn, who is awaiting trial in Japan on charges of financial misconduct, which he denies.The automaker said it would hold an extraordinary shareholders meeting on Feb. 18, 2020, to vote on a proposal for Uchida and other members of the new executive team to become company directors, while former Nissan CEO Hiroto Saikawa, outgoing interim CEO Yasuhiro Yamauchi and former Renault CEO Thierry Bollore were scheduled to vacate their director posts.Years of heavy discounting and fleet sales, particularly in the United States, has cheapened the automaker's brand image while lowering vehicle resale value and denting profit.Nissan is implementing a global recovery plan under which it will axe nearly one-tenth of its workforce and cut global vehicle production by 10 per cent through 2023 to rein in costs which it has said ballooned when Ghosn was CEO."

And out of the top 1,000 retweeters, 62 per cent are bots.Bots are small, automated computer programs that are able to perform a number of simple functions over the internet. Carley says they can engage in conversations, repeat back common phrases, or rebroadcast the same message over and over.""All they're doing is retweeting messages by other groups or by other individuals,"" she said.""For example, around the state media accounts for Russia and China, 95 per cent of the top three tweeters are bots. They're just retweeting those accounts.""Carley said the majority of messages that were being retweeted from these accounts were about what these governments were doing with respect to handling COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. While a large amount of the activity was coming from these two governments, a surprising surge in U.S.-based, or ""homegrown,"" bots has also been flooding the platform, especially as the debate around reopening the American economy was heating up, she said. ""There's conservative bots who are arguing against liberals. There are liberal bots arguing against conservatives. It's across the spectrum.""Other types of messages these bots were pushing included calling on people to donate money to certain organizations, or just simply introducing certain people to each other by mentioning them, she said. However, disinformation around coronavirus was not being generated by the bots, but instead was being created on different websites and blogs, then being tweeted out by bots.""They're often part of the support mechanism for spreading disinformation, but they're not the originators of it,"" Carley said. ""Not only are 45 per cent of the actors bots, [but] they're in very strategic positions in the network so they're actually often responsible for things that end up trending,"" she said. The team used a combination of ""artificial intelligence and social networks"" to analyze different factors about each of the messages. These included who the user was, what their online behaviour was like and how the tweet was written, she said. Carley says mismatches between the timing of multiple tweets sent by the same actor, the location of the messages, as well as the content, language and use of typos all gave some clues as to if it had been posted by a real person or a piece of computer script.    Carley says the pandemic is ""very ripe"" for exploitation because the crisis is global, and ""information is spreading from one country to another, which means that it's a perfect opportunity for different nation states to position themselves using these bots to [spread] their messages."" The pandemic is also affecting so many people and causing so much desperation that it's created the right conditions to conduct fraud by using bots, she said.  ""All of those factors combined to make this a very good nexus.""Written by Adam Jacobson.

Robot or worker? Why human help is still key in the booming AI market | CBC News,"From instant messaging to banking apps, the digital services we use are increasingly powered by artificial intelligence — but what users might not know is how present the human hand is in these increasingly popular tools.",2018-08-02T08:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/pseudo-ai-1.4768287,"From instant messaging to banking apps, the digital services we use are increasingly powered by artificial intelligence — but what users might not know is how present the human hand is in these increasingly popular tools.Recent reporting by The Guardian and the Wall Street Journal explored the issue of so-called pseudo AI, a practice in which users think something is powered by a bot or AI, when it's actually another person.The tangled ties between machine-driven intelligence and people power — and the questions around transparency and privacy that come with it — go back years. In 2009, after questions about how its service worked, early voice-to-text service called Spinvox explained to the media that humans helped its AI transcribe messages when there were gaps in the database.More recently there have been questions about an automated expense reporting service that sometimes drafts in human help from Amazon's Mechanical Turk service, and third-party apps that sometimes allow human engineers to scan anonymized email inboxes. In all of these examples, there was a media report, some blowback and then an explanation from the companies involved about how humans are often still part of the AI process.So does the reliance on human help indicate that perhaps the field is not as far along as enthusiasts would have us believe?Adam Drake, a startup adviser and expert in artificial intelligence, says generally speaking, AI capabilities ""are far lower than people often admit.""While the premise of automated systems is that they will eventually prove to be more cost effective than human labour, at the early stage of developing new tech, the initial investment required is higher than just hiring humans to do the job.""Developing the software can be quite expensive, and human labour is cheap,"" says Robert Seamans, an associate professor at the NYU Stern School of Business.Starting with humans doing the work ""is the way companies should go,"" says Drake, who has worked on the development of data-driven solutions for industries including e-commerce, health care, and online travel.""It is very easy to spend a lot of time and money developing an elaborate, automated, scalable system for a problem that nobody really cares about,"" he explains. ""By doing things manually and less efficiently at first, companies can ensure that they are investing in technology which solves a valuable problem for customers.""Another often overlooked reason why tech companies would turn to humans in the process of developing automated systems is that implementing AI solutions is really difficult. ""We've seen great progress in lab-like settings, but it is hard to actually implement AI in the real world,"" says Seamans.Drake says that as long as it's done well, customers don't care whether something is done by a human or by AI. But, he adds, ""without equivocation, that misleading customers, investors, or the public about the nature of the company and how it solves problems is ethically wrong and also bad business practice.""The catch is, tech companies don't want to seem low-tech, in a market in which AI is such a hot commodity. As Seamans puts it, ""it's hard to be a billion-dollar unicorn if all you are doing is paying people for manual labour.""But some say the contemporary case of the emperor's new clothes comes with ethical concerns.""It boils down to false advertising,"" says John C. Havens, an advocate of the ethical development of autonomous systems and the author of Heartificial Intelligence, which examines the dynamic between people and machines. His work stresses the importance of valuing humans in the pursuit of intelligent machines. ""If you're selling somebody something and they assume that it is software, that is not the same as selling a service that includes humans as part of the service.""Needless to say, there are also substantial privacy concerns that arise when human workers have access to personal messages — be they voicemails, emails or chats — that users assumed were between them and a machine, or being processed or scanned by an algorithm, not a stranger.Despite the fear mongering about automation displacing workers and wiping out entire industries in the coming decades, ""all of this will play out more slowly than popular media would lead you to believe,"" notes Seamans.After all, for all of the cases we hear about robots taking human jobs, there seems to still be a healthy job market for humans, pretending to be machines."

"Markets up sharply, rebounding from 7-day, coronavirus-driven decline | CBC News","Stocks rose sharply on Wall Street Monday, clawing back some of the losses they took in a seven-day rout brought on by worries that the coronavirus outbreak will stunt the global economy.",2020-03-02T15:31:18.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/markets-virus-concerns-1.5482163,"Stocks rose sharply on Wall Street Monday, clawing back some of the losses they took in a seven-day rout brought on by worries that the coronavirus outbreak will stunt the global economy.The Dow Jones Industrial Average surged more than 700 points, while the benchmark S&P 500 climbed 2.3 per cent, placing in on track for its best day since January 2019. The S&P 500 is coming off a weekly loss of 11.5 per cent, its worst since October 2008 during the global financial crisis.Despite the pickup in stocks, the bond market signalled that investors are still worried. Bond prices climbed, pushing yields to more record lows. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 1.08 per cent from 1.12 per cent late Friday. Gold, another traditional safe-haven asset, rose 1.7 per cent.The big bounce in stocks came after an especially wild day of trading on Friday in which the Dow sank more than 1,000 points before a late wave of buying left it down 350.Investors are increasingly anticipating that the Federal Reserve and other major central banks around the world will lower interest rates or take other steps to shield the global economy from the effects of the outbreak.""Investors have convinced themselves that global central banks will likely be even more accommodative in order to short-circuit any psychological damage,"" said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA.The Dow climbed 1,293.96 points, or 5.09 per cent, to 26,703.32 by market close. The S&P 500 index rose 4.6 per cent and the Nasdaq gained 4.49 per cent. European benchmarks were mostly higher, and Asian markets rose broadly. Canada's main stock index, the S&P/TSX Composite Index, dipped at opening but was up 290.21, or 1.8 per cent, to 16,553.26 by day's end.The International Monetary Fund and World Bank announced simultaneously Monday that they are ready to help countries affected by the coronavirus through their emergency lending programs and other tools.""We will use our available instruments to the fullest extent possible,"" the IMF managing director, Kristalina Georgieva, and World Bank President David Malpass said in a joint statement. ""International co-operation is essential.""The statement echoed similar promises to act if necessary from the Federal Reserve on Friday and the Bank of Japan over the weekend. Some analysts now speculate that the Fed could cut rates sometime this week, before its next formal meeting March 17-18. Traders have priced in a 100 per cent probability that the Fed will cut rates by a half-percentage point during or before its March meeting.There were signs that the economic impact was continuing to mount. A measure of China's manufacturing output plunged last month to its lowest level on record, as the viral outbreak closed factories and disrupted supply chains.Separately, economists at Goldman Sachs slashed their forecasts for U.S. growth to just 0.9 per cent in the first quarter and to zero for the April-June quarter.The Organization for Economic Development, a research organization made up of mostly advanced economies, cut its world growth forecast in a report Monday. The OECD said that even if there are only limited outbreaks outside China, the global economy will grow just 2.4 per cent this year, the weakest since the financial crisis in 2009. That forecast matches several private estimates.If other countries are hit with outbreaks similar to China's, growth could fall as low as 1.5 per cent, the OECD said.For investors, the great amount of uncertainty over how consumer behaviour and spending will be affected has been unsettling.""It's not a typical economic blow,"" said Bill Strazzullo of Bell Curve Trading. ""What if major cities are on some kind of a lockdown? What will that do to restaurants, entertainment, shopping, travel? It's almost impossible to game this out.""Last week's rout knocked every major index into what market watchers call a ""correction,"" or a fall of 10 per cent or more from a peak. Market watchers have said for months that stocks were overpriced and long overdue for another pullback. The last time the market had a drop of that size was in late 2018, when the trade war with China was escalating and investors were worried about rising interest rates.The virus outbreak that began in central China has been shutting down industrial centres, emptying shops and severely crimping travel all over the world. More companies are warning investors that their finances will take a hit because of disruptions to supply chains and sales.As fear over the coronavirus' spread hits consumers, shoppers stocking up on everyday goods helped lift shares in household goods companies. Costco jumped 8.1 per cent. Walmart rose 6 per cent. Procter & Gamble gained 3.5 per cent.Stocks in travel-related companies have been among the hardest-hit as the outbreak has led to cancelled flights and disrupted vacation plans. Cruise operators continued to pile up losses Monday. Royal Caribbean Cruises fell 2.5 per cent, Norwegian Cruise Line dropped eight per cent and Carnival fell 4.7 per cent.Technology and health-care stocks accounted for a big share of the gains. Apple climbed 5.9 per cent and Gilead Sciences rose 6.4 per cent. The biotechnology company has been testing one of its drugs as a potential treatment for the coronavirus.Given that the main economic impact so far of the virus outbreak is on the supply side of economies rather than on the demand side, questions are being asked as to whether looser monetary policy will have any meaningful impact.""For all the talk of lower rates the one thing a rate cut can't do is get people back to work and supply chains back running again,"" said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets.Stimulus hopes nevertheless helped shore up markets in Asia earlier. The Nikkei 225 index closed 1 per cent higher, while the Shanghai Composite index rose 3.2 per cent. The benchmark for the smaller exchange, in Shenzhen, jumped 3.8 per cent, while South Korea's Kospi climbed 0.8 per cent. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong climbed 0.6 per cent.China has seen most of the 90,000 or so virus cases worldwide. In the United States, authorities have counted at least 80 cases of the virus, two fatal, and concern was driving some to wipe store shelves clean of bottled water, hand sanitizer and other necessities. Both deaths were men with existing health problems who were hospitalized in Washington state.Oil prices have also slumped as traders price in the prospect of lower demand as a result of the virus outbreak. Last week, oil prices tanked by around 15 per cent. On Monday, benchmark U.S. crude was up $2.07 to $46.83 per barrel. Brent, the international standard, rose $2.28 to $51.95."

Trump shrugs off fuss over Taiwan call | CBC News,"Donald Trump rocked diplomatic waters in Beijing after breaking with diplomatic protocol by taking a call from the leader of Taiwan, but the U.S. president-elect remains unapologetic.",2016-12-03T14:30:12.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/trump-taiwan-president-china-reaction-1.3880124,"U.S. president-elect Donald Trump is unapologetic about roiling diplomatic waters with his decision to speak on the phone with Taiwan's leader, a breach of long-standing tradition that risks enmity from China.The U.S. severed diplomatic ties with the self-governing island in 1979 but has maintained close unofficial relations and a commitment to support its defence.Trump's conversation with Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen drew an irritated, although understated, response from China, as Foreign Minister Wang Yi said Saturday that the contact was ""just a small trick by Taiwan"" that he believed would not change U.S. policy toward China, according to Hong Kong's Phoenix TV.The President of Taiwan CALLED ME today to wish me congratulations on winning the Presidency. Thank you!​""The one-China policy is the cornerstone of the healthy development of China-U.S. relations and we hope this political foundation will not be interfered with or damaged,"" Wang was quoted as saying. Chinese officials said they lodged a complaint with the U.S. and reiterated a commitment to seeking ""reunification"" with the island, which they consider a renegade province.After the phone conversation Friday, Trump tweeted that Tsai ""CALLED ME."" He also groused about the reaction to the call: ""Interesting how the U.S. sells Taiwan billions of dollars of military equipment but I should not accept a congratulatory call.""The U.S. shifted diplomatic recognition to China from Taiwan in 1979. But the governments in Washington and Taipei have maintained close unofficial ties and deep economic and defence relations. The U.S. is required by law to provide Taiwan with weapons to maintain its defence.Interesting how the U.S. sells Taiwan billions of dollars of military equipment but I should not accept a congratulatory call.Since 2009, the Obama administration has approved $14 billion US in arms sales to Taiwan.The call was the starkest example yet of how Trump has flouted diplomatic conventions since he won the Nov. 8 election. He has apparently undertaken calls with foreign leaders without guidance customarily given by the State Department, which oversees U.S. diplomacy.""President-elect Trump is just shooting from the hip, trying to take phone calls of congratulatory messages from leaders around the world without consideration for the implications,"" said Bonnie Glaser, senior adviser for Asia at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.Over the decades, the status of Taiwan has been one of the most sensitive issues in U.S.-China relations. China regards Taiwan as part of its territory to be retaken by force, if necessary, if it seeks independence. It would regard any recognition of a Taiwanese leader as a head of state as unacceptable.Taiwan split from the Chinese mainland in 1949. The U.S. policy acknowledges the Chinese view over sovereignty, but considers Taiwan's status as unsettled.Ned Price, a spokesman for the White House National Security Council, said Trump's conversation does not signal any change to long-standing U.S. policy on cross-strait issues.The Taiwanese presidential office said Trump and Tsai discussed issues affecting Asia and the future of U.S. relations with Taiwan. ""The (Taiwanese) president is looking forward to strengthening bilateral interactions and contacts as well as setting up closer co-operative relations,"" the statement said.Tsai also told Trump that she hoped the U.S. would support Taiwan in its participation in international affairs, the office said, in an apparent reference to China's efforts to isolate Taiwan from global institutions such as the United Nations.Taiwan's presidential office spokesman, Alex Huang, said separately that Taiwan's relations with China and ""healthy"" Taiwan-U.S. relations can proceed in parallel. ""There is no conflict"" in that, he said.China's foreign ministry said Beijing lodged ""solemn representations"" with the U.S. over the call.""It must be pointed out that there is only one China in the world and Taiwan is an inseparable part of Chinese territory,"" Geng Shuang, a ministry spokesman, said in a statement. ""The government of the People's Republic of China is the sole legitimate government representing China.""China is likely to be trying to identify whether this signals any intent on the part of Trump to alter long-standing U.S. policy toward Taiwan, Glaser said.""They will hope that this is a misstep, but I think privately, they will definitely seek to educate this incoming president and ensure that he understands the sensitivity of Taiwan,"" she said.Last month, Trump had a call with Chinese President Xi Jinping during which Trump's office described him as saying he believed the two would have ""one of the strongest relationships for both countries.""Despite China's muted response Saturday, concern about Trump's policy toward China is growing, said Shi Yinhong of Renmin University in Beijing, one of China's best-known international relations scholars.Tsai was elected in January and took office in May. The traditional independence-leaning policies of her party have strained relations with Beijing.The call with Trump could ""convince people in Taiwan that the island can establish good relations with the U.S. and encourage (Tsai) to continue to resist pressure from Beijing,"" Shi said.In Beijing, a U.S. business group urged the new U.S. administration to respect the status quo.""The new administration needs to get up to speed quickly on the historical tensions and complex dynamics of the region,"" said James Zimmerman, chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China.​"

What would a U.S. ban on Chinese-owned app TikTok mean? | CBC News,"U.S. President Donald Trump says he wants to take action to ban TikTok, a popular Chinese-owned video app that has been a source of national security and censorship concerns.",2020-08-01T21:08:51.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/tiktok-ban-chinese-trump-1.5671958,"U.S. President Donald Trump says he wants to take action to ban TikTok, a popular Chinese-owned video app that has been a source of national security and censorship concerns.The threat comes as Microsoft Corp. is in advanced talks to buy the Chinese app, owned by ByteDance Ltd., according to a person familiar with the discussions who spoke only on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity to the negotiations. Microsoft declined to comment.It's not clear whether Trump would accept a divestment as a concession.But there have been reports of U.S. tech giants and financial firms being interested in buying or investing in TikTok as the Trump administration sets its sights on the app.Questions and answers about what's at stake:ByteDance launched TikTok in 2017 before buying Musical.ly — a video service popular with teens in Canada, the U.S. and Europe — and combined the two. A twin service, Douyin, is available for Chinese users.TikTok's fun, goofy videos and ease of use have made it immensely popular, and U.S. tech giants like Facebook and Snapchat see it as a competitive threat.It has said it has tens of millions of users in the U.S. and hundreds of millions globally. But TikTok has also been a way that millions of people have built careers and made a living.The app would be pulled from the app store of Apple and Google and not function unless used by a virtual private network, experts say.A message to the TikTok community. <a href=""https://t.co/UD3TR2HfEf"">pic.twitter.com/UD3TR2HfEf</a>Experts believe that while the ban may seem legitimate, it likely won't come to that, given the pressure by ByteDance to sell its stake and any control of TikTok to a U.S. company or completely spin off, said Ben Bajarin of Creative Strategies, an industry analysis and market research firm based in San Jose, Calif.""I think a total spinoff or U.S. tech firm acquisition is the likely scenario here so it can keep operating,"" he said.Many are trying to move followers to other platforms like YouTube and Triller, an entertainment platform built for creators. Some are trying to monetize through sites like Patreon, a crowdfunding platform for artists, musicians and other creators, said Amber Atherton, CEO at Zyper, a community marketing platform that connects brands with the top one per cent of their superfans.Atherton said teens will continue to access TikTok anyway through a virtual private network in the same way that teens access Instagram in China. But she said teenagers are devastated about a ban, since TikTok is about everyday people where users can discover product demos and other information.Industry officials say that any ban could invoke some retaliation from China against U.S. businesses.""It could make many companies wary of the U.S. government's capricious decisions, which leads to instability and uncertainty, "" said Sucharita Kodali, an analyst at Forrester Research, an e-commerce research firm.""Investors then opt to park capital in more stable, predictable environments. Something of this nature is relatively uncommon. Usually, it happens when there are sanctions or other major political action."""

Kazakhstan detains hundreds protesting rubber-stamp election | CBC News,Police in Kazakhstan detained about 500 people on Sunday after dispersing protests against an uncompetitive presidential election set to confirm Kassym-Jomart Tokayev as the successor to veteran leader Nursultan Nazarbayev.,2019-06-09T20:03:21.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/kazakhstan-election-arrests-1.5168444,"Police in Kazakhstan detained about 500 people on Sunday after dispersing protests against an uncompetitive presidential election set to confirm Kassym-Jomart Tokayev as the successor to veteran leader Nursultan Nazarbayev.Nazarbayev, who had run the oil-rich former Soviet republic for almost three decades before stepping down in March, and retains sweeping powers, hand-picked the 66-year-old diplomat to succeed him, making the outcome of the vote against challengers with little political profile all but certain.Two exit polls published by local pollsters gave Tokayev about 70 per cent of the vote.Hundreds people chanting ""Shame! Shame!"" staged protests on Sunday in Almaty and Nur-Sultan, the capital city that was renamed after Nazarbayev at Tokayev's suggestion.But a smooth transfer of power is positive news for neighbouring Russia and China, and for foreign energy and mining companies that have invested hundreds of billions of dollars.For many of Kazakhstan's 12 million registered voters, Tokayev, the interim president and also a former prime minister, was the only familiar face among seven candidates in a brief and uneventful campaign.""Well, Nazarbayev is no longer on the ballot and I don't know any of the other candidates,"" said Natalya, a pensioner, after casting her vote on Sunday for Tokayev.Nazarbayev, 78, who holds the official title of Yelbasy, or national leader, and continues to run the ruling Nur Otan party, routinely took over 90 per cent of the vote in elections described by Western observers as neither free nor fair.Kazakhstan's rubber-stamp parliament, whose upper chamber Tokayev chaired before assuming the presidency, is devoid of opposition, and dissent is largely stifled through control of traditional and electronic media and social networks.Telegram, a popular mobile messaging app, was inaccessible on Sunday in Almaty, Kazakhstan's largest city, and Facebook was also blocked for hours early in the day.Reuters correspondents in Almaty and Nur-Sultan saw police clad in riot gear detain dozens of demonstrators as they forcefully dispersed rallies. The Interior Ministry later said police had detained about 500 people, describing them as ""radical elements seeking to destabilize society.""Deputy Interior Minister Marat Kozhayev said two policemen had been hurt by rocks hurled at them from the crowd and one sustained an eye injury from pepper spray.One foreign reporter based in Almaty posted a photo of himself with a black eye sitting inside a police vehicle after being detained, but said the bruise was a result of falling on a policeman's knee rather than being struck deliberately. After casting his ballot in Nur-Sultan, Tokayev urged both police and protesters to be tolerant and planned to include young activists critical of the government in a ""special committee"" to promote dialogue.Tokayev had and he had no doubt that he would win the election and promised to take guidance from Nazarbayev on strategic matters.The arrangement under which Nazarbayev effectively remains in charge ensures policy continuity — but also means political uncertainty will linger until he withdraws from politics.On the foreign policy side, Tokayev, who studied at an elite Soviet diplomatic school in Moscow and focused on China, is likely to continue Nazarbayev's policy of balancing between Russia, China and the West.That approach has helped Kazakhstan attract foreign investment and open up markets for its oil and metals exports.The Election Commission reported a turnout of 77 per cent by 8 p.m. Nur-Sultan time (1400 GMT), when polls closed in most of the country, and said it would announce preliminary results on Monday."

Each day, he drives to work on near-empty streets in a country grappling with at least 69,000 COVID-19 cases and more than 6,800 deaths. The work conditions are physically exhausting, Alfonso said. It takes 10 minutes to suit up with all the protective gear, gloves, face masks and more once he's at the hospital. And every six hours — because shifts can last eight or even 12 hours — everything needs to be removed and changed, only to start the suiting-up process all over again. There's no drinking or eating while wearing the gear. There's no break, no ""down time"" — just a ceaseless flow of patients with the respiratory disease, not to mention those who come in for other emergency issues.The donning and doffing of gear and the being on your feet all day aren't the hardest part of the job, Alfonso said. What's hardest is feeling helpless against an invisible, seemingly never-ending force.For those who still call it “just a flu”, or complain against <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/StayAtHome?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#StayAtHome</a> policy.

""There's no way to do more than we are doing now. That's the problem.""Doctors from around the world are facing similar issues: lots of patients, long hours and frustration. And there's concern that it could lead to some serious mental health concerns, even post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD.""I expect it'll have quite a lot of psychological impact on people, not only doctors but nurses and everyone else who works within [the critical care] team,"" said Dr. Laura Hawryluck, the critical care response team lead at Toronto Western Hospital. Asked if Alfonso expected to see PTSD in doctors in Italy, he replied, ""100 per cent. The answer is yes."" His response wasn't surprising.A new study published this week in the journal JAMA Network examined the health effects of the COVID-19 outbreak in China on front-line workers. It found that front-line workers who were involved in the diagnosis, treatment and care of patients with the disease had a higher risk of symptoms of depression, anxiety, insomnia and distress.Hawryluck was on the front line during the SARS outbreak in Toronto. She said she saw the toll it took not only on patients in quarantine — a subject on which she wrote a study — but also on those in the medical field. Some, she said, chose to leave the field altogether. ""We have seen that some people they leave our fields and feel that this is no longer an area of practice that they want to be in,"" she said. ""Other people may say, 'You know what? We got through it, and I feel that this has made me stronger in terms of how I work and how I work with my team.'""Alfonso has considered leaving the profession during these difficult times.""It's quite complex to explain in simple words,"" he said. ""But apart from that feeling that you can't do enough for people, there's also added fear [for] your friends and relatives.""Doctors from Italy have shared stories about having to make the agonizing decision between who lives and who dies, due to a shortage of ventilators needed to keep people breathing. It's these choices that can deeply affect doctors, Hawryluck said, even though they're trained to make those difficult decisions.13/ Someone already to be intubated and go to intensive care. For others it's too late... Every ventilator becomes like gold: those in operating theatres that have now suspended their non-urgent activity become intensive care places that did not exist before.But those who work in intensive care units have a very strong bond, she said. It's that bond that can sometimes help them deal with such difficult situations.""Our bonds are so strong because we've lived through these moments together, and we're going to live through them again in the future. And we all know that,"" she said.But there are also colleagues in different fields they can depend on, such as counsellors, psychologists and psychiatrists. As cities, provinces, states and entire countries issue lockdown orders, what is particularly frustrating, Alfonso said, is the stubbornness or selfishness displayed by people who violate the orders.""I woke up in the morning, left my house, and I took my car and drove to the hospital. And I started looking around me.… And I see people jogging or doing silly things they shouldn't do,"" he said. ""And I got angry because I'm [putting] my life on the line — for these idiots.""And it's this behaviour, he said, that is making the fight against the virus so difficult.""We are facing a very unknown enemy. This is a big problem, but if you add to this people's behaviour, then, forgive me, we're f--ked.""All of this, Alfonso said, can be very demotivating, almost soul-sucking. But he has a job to do, and he will do it, despite the personal cost.""I've never been so stressed as I am now,"" he said.Hawryluck said the doctors and others in the field are going to be pushed to the limit.""We've got a longer journey to go — getting through this particular pandemic,"" Hawryluck said. ""I think this is going to hit the medical community quite hard."""
36 blasts recorded at American Iron & Metal site in 16 months | CBC News,Records from New Brunswick's Department of Environment and Local Government show just how routine explosions are at American Iron and Metal's Saint John recycling facility.,2018-09-20T08:30:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/scrap-metal-air-pollution-explosions-waterfront-neighbours-recycler-1.4830187,"Records from New Brunswick's Department of Environment and Local Government show just how routine explosions are at American Iron and Metal's Saint John recycling facility.Since June 1, 2017 there have been 36 blasts — small and large — at the waterfront site.The data shows 17 explosions at the site over a seven month period in 2017, followed by a further 17 over the first five months of 2018.The summer of 2018 was largely explosion free with no blasts recorded in June, July or August.But neighbours say the boom they felt Sept. 14 was the most significant so far.""It rocked my china cabinet, my bed. It woke up my entire house,"" said Emily Kinney of Blue Rock Road, who is not at all surprised to learn the official count sets the number of blasts at the site at 36.Friday's explosion was not even the most recent at the AIM site: Another was reported to the Department of Environment on Monday. Mark Wallace, whose home on Albert Street looks down on the facility, makes the same observation.""No, that doesn't surprise me at all. Thirty-six, that's probably an understatement to be honest with you,"" Wallace said.Life at the longtime family home, he says, has been turned on its head since the facility appeared in 2011.""The smell and the smoke, it's sickening is what it is. It just kind of makes you sick to your stomach. It's that bad.""American Iron and Metal did not respond Wednesday to CBC's questions about the Department of Environment records.He said the cause of Friday's blast ""has to be a contained gas unit, like a tank, propane tank or acetylene or something like that.""In June 2017 a company spokeswoman told CBC gas containers hidden in the trunks of crushed vehicles cause blasts at the facility ""from time to time.""She hopes to find a new place to live in the Grand Bay-Westfield area.Steven Hughes made that decision a year ago and has since moved with his family to Fundy Heights.""For us the vibrations [from the explosions] were actually more of a concern,"" Hughes said. ""We were close enough that we're quite sure that it damaged the foundation of our house.""Hughes said air quality is also a major factor. He describes it as an ""oily, metallic taste"" that hangs in the air.The final nudge for the family of six was a large explosion on June 6, 2017.Unable to sell their home, they cashed in RRSP's to buy a second one. Hughes says that then lead to a $14,000 tax bill. Their child tax credit was also reduced.They're much happier in their new home and, while an attempt to sell the other one was unsuccessful, they found a tenant who does not seem to mind the nearby scrap facility.WorkSafe New Brunswick investigated Friday's explosion at the recycling site.In a statement Wednesday, Director of Communications, Laragh Dooley said they do not expect to look into the matter further.""Explosive work is part of the employer's course of business,"" Dooley said. ""And a safety procedure was in place."""

Chinese army releases promo video for its troops in Hong Kong | CBC News,The Chinese army has released a promotional video for its Hong Kong-based troops at a time of uncertainty over whether its troops will intervene in the city's summer of protest.,2019-08-01T11:36:35.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/china-army-promotional-video-hong-kong-1.5232747,"The Chinese army has released a promotional video for its Hong Kong-based troops at a time of uncertainty over whether the military will intervene in the city's summer of protest.On the eve of Thursday's anniversary of the army's founding, the Hong Kong Garrison of China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) posted on its official social media account a three-minute video showing soldiers rappelling from helicopters, aiming sniper rifles and, in one sequence, throwing tear gas at a crowd dressed as civilians.This section of the footage, labelled ""anti-riot drill,"" shows armed soldiers in riot gear launching tear gas canisters and shooting water cannons in a scene with stark similarities to the current situation in Hong Kong, where the police have used tear gas, pepper spray and rubber bullets to quell pro-democracy demonstrators.Soldiers in the video hold up a red warning banner that declares: ""Stop Charging Or We Use Force."" A similar banner is used by Hong Kong police when they quell protests.""All consequences are at your own risk,"" one soldier shouted in Cantonese, the main Chinese dialect in Hong Kong, during the video clip.Some of the targeted civilians shown in the army video are wearing helmets and masks, much like those worn by protesters who have taken to Hong Kong's streets in the hundreds of thousands over the past two months.Watch part of the promotional video released by the Chinese army's Hong Kong Garrison: CBC NewsAt the end of the drill, soldiers are seen taking some handcuffed civilians away.This week, Hong Kong police arrested 44 people on rioting charges, which carry a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment. It's the first time authorities have resorted to using the rioting charge.A former British colony, Hong Kong was returned to China in 1997 on the principle of ""one country, two systems."" The framework promises Hong Kong certain democratic freedoms not afforded to the mainland. In recent years, however, Hong Kong residents have complained that Beijing is increasingly encroaching on their freedoms.An undercurrent of distrust for the Communist Party-led central government has propelled the mass demonstrations, which began in response to extradition legislation that would have allowed Hong Kong residents to be sent to mainland China to stand trial. Hong Kong suspended the bill, but protests have continued unabated over broader demands for greater democratic rights and government accountability.As the movement has progressed, both protesters and police have at times resorted to violence.In response to questions about whether the army will be sent in to handle demonstrators, Chinese officials have pointed to an article in Hong Kong's Garrison Law stating that troops already stationed in the city can be deployed at the request of the Hong Kong government.Article 14 of the Basic Law, Hong Kong's mini-constitution, says PLA troops ""shall not interfere"" in local affairs, but that Hong Kong's government can ask for assistance from the garrison ""in the maintenance of public order and in disaster relief.""In remarks ahead of Thursday's anniversary, garrison commander Maj.-Gen. Chen Daoxiang said Beijing ""firmly supports"" Hong Kong's embattled leader Carrie Lam and moves by police and the courts to enforce the law and punish ""violent criminals.""""And we firmly support the patriotic people in Hong Kong in defending the rule of law in Hong Kong and safeguarding national sovereignty and security and Hong Kong's prosperity and stability,"" Chen said.""We believe that the PLA force stationed in Hong Kong will continue to be the anchor for Hong Kong's long-term prosperity and stability.""Hong Kong's police chiefs have insisted their forces are capable of maintaining order without the assistance of Chinese troops.Any use of the PLA against protesters would conjure up memories of the army's bloody June 1989 crackdown on student pro-democracy protests centred on Beijing's Tiananmen Square in which hundreds, possibly thousands were killed. The PLA struggled in the years afterward to rehabilitate its reputation after turning its guns on its own people.The world's largest standing army, the PLA is actually the military wing of the ruling Communist Party with explicit instructions to follow the orders of the party, not the Hong Kong government."

"Veterans touched by gift of face masks, 70 years after start of Korean War | CBC News",Canadian veterans were surprised by a gesture from South Korea marking the 70th anniversary of the start of the Korean War this week.,2020-06-23T17:30:45.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/canadian-veterans-korean-war-gift-face-masks-1.5622802,"Canadian veterans and their families say they were surprised and touched by a gesture from South Korea marking the 70th anniversary of the start of the Korean War this week.  ""What a beautiful privilege it was to read this letter and think that people still thought about us,"" said Jake McDonald, 86. McDonald was 17 when he served as a communications signaller with the Canadian Army. He estimates he spent about a year in Korea during the war, which saw fighting end with an armistice declared in 1953.On June 15, a box arrived at his home in Halifax containing 30 medical face masks and a letter from the Republic of Korea, which is commonly known as South Korea. ""We are especially concerned about the well-being of you who dedicated your youth to protecting the Republic of Korea,"" the letter said in part. ""In this regard, we have prepared a token of appreciation. This can never match the warm hands you extended to us, but we hope this will help you overcome the current crisis.""McDonald was pleased to receive the masks, as he'd been having difficulty buying any at local stores. But he was just as pleased to read the letter. ""I feel very proud that they remembered some of the guys that were over there. A lot of the guys never came back,"" he said. Digital ArchivesMcDonald said he's keeping in mind that South Korea is now fighting against COVID-19. It became the second country after China to undergo a large outbreak of COVID-19. After bringing the virus under control in April, health authorities in Seoul said Monday the country is seeing a resurgence of cases.Ron Dunn, who is now 91, was in his early 20s when he sailed on HMCS Huron and HMCS Iroquois during the Korean War. He also received a shipment of masks and a letter. Ten years ago, Dunn and his wife travelled to South Korea for the 60th anniversary and he marvelled at the way South Korea has been able to rebuild after all its major cities and infrastructure were bombed. ""It's a progressive country, no doubt about that. From what they were, in shambles, it's unbelievable,"" he said.Dunn showed the box of masks and the letter to his wife Muriel and his daughter, Linda Hutt. ""When I sat down to read the letter, it just made me tear up,"" said Hutt.The letter thanked Dunn warmly saying, ""the strangers you saved were our grandfathers, grandmothers, fathers and mothers.""  ""Family was really important to Dad,"" Hutt said. ""He made sure we all stayed connected; we're all very, very close. We talk to each other daily on the phone, we see each other often."" Ambassador Yun Je Lee, the consul general of the Republic of Korea in Montreal, said the gift of masks was chosen because of the level of frailty of Korean War veterans, many of whom are in their 90s. Canada sent more than 26,000 troops to aid in the war effort, with thousands continuing to serve there after the armistice until 1957. There were 516 Canadian lives lost during the conflict.""This gift is just a small gesture, a token of our appreciation. Because we know how difficult it is to obtain this personal protective gear in Canada at this moment,"" Lee said. The country has restrictions in place surrounding the export of medical face masks, but Lee said the country made an exception for the gift of one million face masks that were shipped to Korean War veterans around the world. Of those, 35,000 ended up in Canada and 2,675 in Nova Scotia.The war between North and South Korea left millions of soldiers and civilians dead, and devastated both countries. Canada sent troops to the Korean Peninsula as part of a United Nations contingent.North and South Korea have never formally signed a peace treaty and relations between the two have remained strained during the pandemic."

Violence flares as thousands defy police ban to march in downtown Hong Kong | CBC News,"Police fired chemical-laced blue water and tear gas at protesters who lobbed Molotov cocktails outside the Hong Kong government office complex Sunday, as violence flared anew after thousands of pro-democracy supporters marched through downtown in defiance of a police ban.",2019-09-15T09:46:45.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/hong-kong-protest-violence-police-ban-1.5284330,"Police fired chemical-laced blue water and tear gas at protesters who lobbed Molotov cocktails outside the Hong Kong government office complex Sunday, as violence flared anew after thousands of pro-democracy supporters marched through downtown in defiance of a police ban.A mixed crowd of hardcore protesters in black and wearing masks, along with families with children, spilled into the roads of the Causeway Bay shopping belt and marched for over two kilometres to the Central business district. Some waved U.S. and British flags, while others carried posters reiterating their calls for democratic reforms.Police had turned down a request by the Civil Human Rights Front to hold the march, but the demonstrators were undeterred, as they have been all summer.""I feel this is our duty. The government wants to block us with the ban, but I want to say that the people will not be afraid,"" said protester Winnie Leung, 50.The march disrupted traffic, and many shops, including the Sogo department store, closed their doors. Protesters burned Chinese flags and tore down banners congratulating China's ruling Communist Party, which will celebrate its 70th year in power on Oct. 1. In familiar scenes, some protesters smashed glass windows and surveillance cameras at a subway station exit.Hundreds of protesters later targeted the government office complex, throwing bricks and petrol bombs through police barriers.Police responded by firing volleys of tear gas and using water cannon trucks to spray chemical-laced water as well as blue liquid that helped them identify offenders, in a repeat of confrontational scenes from the last several weeks of the protests.Police had earlier warned in a statement that the assembly was illegal and urged protesters to ""stop their illegal acts.""Hospital authorities said eight people were injured throughout the day, including three in serious condition.The protests were triggered in June by an extradition bill that many saw as an example of China's increasing intrusion and at chipping away at Hong Kong residents' freedoms and rights, many of which are not accorded to people in mainland China.Hong Kong's government promised this month to withdraw the bill, which would have allowed some criminal suspects to be sent to mainland China for trial, but protesters have widened their demands to include direct elections for the special administrative region's leaders and police accountability.More than 1,300 people have been arrested amid increasing clashes between protesters and police, who demonstrators have accused of abuses.The unrest has battered Hong Kong's economy, which was already reeling from the U.S.-China trade war. It is also seen as an embarrassment to Beijing, which has accused foreign powers of fomenting the unrest.Earlier Sunday, hundreds of protesters waved British flags, sang God Save the Queen and chanted ""U.K. save Hong Kong"" outside the British Consulate as they stepped up calls for international support for their campaign.With banners declaring ""one country, two systems is dead,"" they repeated calls for Hong Kong's former colonial ruler to ensure the region's autonomy is upheld under agreements made when it ceded power to China in 1997.Demonstrators held similar rallies Sept.1 at the British facility and last weekend at the U.S. Consulate.On Saturday, pro-democracy protesters and supporters of the central government in Beijing clashed at a Hong Kong shopping mall and several public places. Police arrested more than a dozen people and hospital authorities said 25 were injured.The clashes amid the mid-autumn festival holiday came after several nights of peaceful rallies that featured protesters belting out a new protest song in mass singing at shopping malls. Thousands of people also carried lanterns with pro-democracy messages in public areas and formed illuminated human chains on two of the city's peaks on Friday night to mark the Chinese festival."

""The point is not only to prevent cases arriving on your shores — the point is what you do when you have cases.""The outbreak — which the WHO has declared a global health emergency — has ""pandemic potential,"" Tedros said, noting that the WHO is working with countries around the world to prepare.He reiterated his message that fear is not the answer, and called for calm as countries prepare.Tedros noted that several countries — including Belgium, Cambodia, India, Nepal, the Philippines, Russia, Sri Lanka and Vietnam — have gone two weeks without reporting a new case. He said this signalled that ""aggressive, early measures can prevent transmission before coronavirus gets a foothold.""As of 6 a.m. Geneva time, China had reported 78,630 cases to WHO, with 2,747 deaths, Tedros said. Outside of China, there were 3,474 cases in 44 countries, with 54 deaths.Earlier, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said his country, which has 23 cases of the virus, was operating on the basis of a pandemic and hospitals were under orders to ensure enough medical supplies, personal protective equipment and staff.""There is every indication that the world will soon enter a pandemic phase of the coronavirus,"" Morrison told a news conference in Canberra.Meanwhile, The Dow Jones Industrial Average sank nearly 1,200 points Thursday, deepening a weeklong global market rout caused by worries the coronavirus outbreak will wreak havoc on the global economy.WATCH: Infectious disease doctor explains what's happening with COVID-19The NationalQuebec's first presumptive case of the coronavirus has been detected in a woman who recently returned from a trip to Iran, according to the provincial health minister. The woman took a plane from Iran to Qatar before arriving at the Montreal airport on Monday, Health Minister Danielle McCann said Thursday evening at an impromptu news conference.Earlier, Ontario reported a sixth case of COVID-19 on Thursday. The other seven cases in the country are in British Columbia.The sixth case, a man in his 60s, is married to the fifth person in Ontario to test positive for COVID-19.""We are working alongside Toronto Public Health, who is now and will continue to be in regular contact with this individual during their self-isolation period,"" Dr. David Williams, Ontario's chief medical officer of health, said in a statement.Canada's top public health official, Dr. Theresa Tam, said Canada has begun to look at tracking local spread of the virus.Tam said Thursday that Canada has methods to monitor for possible spread of the virus within the country — systems typically used to monitor influenza — and if public health agencies discover the spread of COVID-19, they will work quickly to try to contain it.""I think that's actually something that all countries should be moving toward as well,"" she said.In the meantime, the public health agency is taking stock of the need for personal protective equipment and other supplies to make sure there are enough to go around in case of a pandemic.WATCH: How Canada is preparing for a coronavirus outbreakThe NationalThe virus, which does not yet have a cure or a vaccine, keeps spreading to new places around the world.  Read on for a look at what's happening in some of the countries dealing with the most cases of the novel coronavirus.U.S. officials said Thursday they were ramping up efforts to guard against a local spread of the virus, dispatching test kits nationwide and promising funding legislation within the next two weeks.California officials said 33 people had tested positive for the virus, and 8,400 people were being monitored for symptoms. The state currently has only about 200 test kits but has been in ""constant contact with federal agencies"" that have promised to send a fresh supply in coming days, Gov. Gavin Newsom said.It's expected Capitol Hill negotiations on emergency spending to combat the outbreak are likely to produce a bill that's double or even triple the $2.5 billion US plan requested by President Donald Trump.Trump's administration is also considering invoking special powers through the Defence Production Act to rapidly expand domestic production of protective masks and clothing to combat the virus, two U.S. officials told Reuters.Meanwhile, Facebook Inc. said it would cancel its annual developer conference due to fears over the coronavirus outbreak and Microsoft Corp. followed suit by withdrawing from a gaming conference scheduled for next month.China reported 327 new cases, bringing the total case number on the mainland to 78,824, the country's National Health Commission said Friday. That was less than the 433 cases the day before and the lowest number since Jan. 23.More than 32,000 of those patients have recovered and were discharged from hospital.Of the new cases in China reported by the health commission, 318 were in the epicentre of the city of Wuhan, where the virus first emerged in December.The death toll in mainland China reached 2,788 as of the end of Thursday, up by 44 from the previous day.

A total of 26 people have died so far, it said. That pushes the region's overall cases to above 350. Iran's death toll is highest outside of China, where the outbreak began.Saudi Arabia's barring of pilgrims from Mecca, home to the cube-shaped Kaaba that the world's 1.8 billion Muslims pray toward five times a day, and also the holy city of Medina, appeared unprecedented in modern history. The kingdom's Al Saud ruling family stakes their legitimacy in overseeing and protecting the sites. Authorities also suspended entry to travellers from nations affected by the new virus who hold tourist visas for the kingdom.It appeared Saudi officials worried about the risk of pilgrims spreading the virus as they had in Iran. The virus' epicentre in the Islamic Republic is the holy Shia city of Qom, where the faithful in reverence reach out to kiss and touch a famous shrine.

At the request of our High Tech companies, and President Xi, I agreed to allow Chinese company Huawei to buy product from them which will not impact our National Security. Importantly, we have opened up negotiations...Last month, Huawei was put on the trade blacklist, and Trump said its status won't be decided until the end of the China-U.S. trade talks.Neil Shearing, London-based chief economist at Capital Economics, predicted the talks will ""ebb and flow, but the direction over the next 12 months will be toward renewed escalation because issues around industrial strategy will prove to be so intractable.""The Trump administration has said China is trying to cheat its way to dominance in the cutting-edge technologies of the future such as artificial intelligence and quantum computing.In a report last year, the Office of the United States Trade Representative accused Beijing of resorting to predatory tactics to challenge American technological supremacy.These include forcing foreign companies to hand over technology in exchange for access to the Chinese market; subsidizing its own companies (especially those owned by the state) while burying foreign firms in regulations; providing government money so Chinese firms can buy sensitive foreign technology at above-market prices; and stealing trade secrets outright."

36 blasts recorded at American Iron & Metal site in 16 months | CBC News,Records from New Brunswick's Department of Environment and Local Government show just how routine explosions are at American Iron and Metal's Saint John recycling facility.,2018-09-20T08:30:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/scrap-metal-air-pollution-explosions-waterfront-neighbours-recycler-1.4830187,"Records from New Brunswick's Department of Environment and Local Government show just how routine explosions are at American Iron and Metal's Saint John recycling facility.Since June 1, 2017 there have been 36 blasts — small and large — at the waterfront site.The data shows 17 explosions at the site over a seven month period in 2017, followed by a further 17 over the first five months of 2018.The summer of 2018 was largely explosion free with no blasts recorded in June, July or August.But neighbours say the boom they felt Sept. 14 was the most significant so far.""It rocked my china cabinet, my bed. It woke up my entire house,"" said Emily Kinney of Blue Rock Road, who is not at all surprised to learn the official count sets the number of blasts at the site at 36.Friday's explosion was not even the most recent at the AIM site: Another was reported to the Department of Environment on Monday. Mark Wallace, whose home on Albert Street looks down on the facility, makes the same observation.""No, that doesn't surprise me at all. Thirty-six, that's probably an understatement to be honest with you,"" Wallace said.Life at the longtime family home, he says, has been turned on its head since the facility appeared in 2011.""The smell and the smoke, it's sickening is what it is. It just kind of makes you sick to your stomach. It's that bad.""American Iron and Metal did not respond Wednesday to CBC's questions about the Department of Environment records.He said the cause of Friday's blast ""has to be a contained gas unit, like a tank, propane tank or acetylene or something like that.""In June 2017 a company spokeswoman told CBC gas containers hidden in the trunks of crushed vehicles cause blasts at the facility ""from time to time.""She hopes to find a new place to live in the Grand Bay-Westfield area.Steven Hughes made that decision a year ago and has since moved with his family to Fundy Heights.""For us the vibrations [from the explosions] were actually more of a concern,"" Hughes said. ""We were close enough that we're quite sure that it damaged the foundation of our house.""Hughes said air quality is also a major factor. He describes it as an ""oily, metallic taste"" that hangs in the air.The final nudge for the family of six was a large explosion on June 6, 2017.Unable to sell their home, they cashed in RRSP's to buy a second one. Hughes says that then lead to a $14,000 tax bill. Their child tax credit was also reduced.They're much happier in their new home and, while an attempt to sell the other one was unsuccessful, they found a tenant who does not seem to mind the nearby scrap facility.WorkSafe New Brunswick investigated Friday's explosion at the recycling site.In a statement Wednesday, Director of Communications, Laragh Dooley said they do not expect to look into the matter further.""Explosive work is part of the employer's course of business,"" Dooley said.

UAE's Amal spacecraft rockets toward Mars in Arab world 1st | CBC News,"A United Arab Emirates spacecraft rocketed away Monday on a seven-month journey to Mars, kicking off the Arab world's first interplanetary mission.",2020-07-20T05:13:22.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/mars-spacecraft-united-arab-emirates-amal-1.5655657,"A United Arab Emirates spacecraft rocketed away Monday on a seven-month journey to Mars, kicking off the Arab world's first interplanetary mission.The liftoff of the Mars orbiter named Amal, or Hope, from Japan marked the start of a rush to fly to Earth's neighbour that includes attempts by China and the United States.The UAE said its Amal was functioning after launch as it heads toward Mars.Omran Sharaf, the project director of Emirates Mars Mission, told journalists in Dubai about an hour and a half after the liftoff that the probe was sending signals. Sharaf said his team now would examine the data, but everything appeared good for now.People cheered and clapped, with one woman offering a celebratory cry common for weddings.Hope is set to reach Mars in February 2021, the year the UAE celebrates 50 years since the country's formation.It blasted off from the Tanegashima Space Center on a small southern Japanese island aboard a Mitsubishi Heavy Industries' H-IIA rocket, on time at 6:58 a.m. local time (5:58 ET Sunday) into the blue sky. Mitsubishi said the probe has been successfully separated from the rocket and is now on its solo journey.The launch had been delayed for five days because of stormy weather.This is us… our dream, aspiration and inspiration. Always looking up to the sky and beyond. <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/HopeMarsMission?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#HopeMarsMission</a> <a href=""https://t.co/KZ0cbrRFGH"">pic.twitter.com/KZ0cbrRFGH</a>At Mohammed bin Rashid Space Center in Dubai, Emirati men in their traditional white kandora robes and women in their black abayas watched transfixed as the rocket lifted off. As its stages separated, a cheer went out from a group of Emirati men seated on the floor. They began clapping, one using his face mask due to the coronavirus pandemic to wipe away a tear.""It was great to see everything going according to schedule today. It looks like things are all on track. It's a huge step in terms of space exploration to have a nation like the UAE taking that giant leap to send a spacecraft to Mars,"" Astronomer Fred Watson said.""Being on route to a planet like Mars is an exceptional achievement.""A newcomer in space development, the UAE has successfully put three Earth observation satellites into orbit. Two were developed by South Korea and launched by Russia, and a third — its own — was launched by Japan.A successful Hope mission to Mars would be a major step for the oil-dependent economy seeking a future in space, coming less than a year after the launch of the first UAE astronaut, Hazzaa Ali Almansoori. He spent over a week at the International Space Station last fall.The UAE has set a goal to build a human colony on Mars by 2117.""It sends a very strong message to the Arab youth that if the UAE is able to reach Mars in less than 50 years, they could do much more,"" Omran Sharaf, the project director of Emirates Mars Mission, told The Associated Press on Sunday as his colleagues prepared for the launch.The Emiratis involved in the program also acknowledged it represented a step forward for the Arab world, the home of mathematicians and scientists for centuries before the wars and chaos that have gripped wide swathes of it in recent times.""So the region has been going through tough times in the past decades, if not centuries,"" Sharaf said. ""Now we have the case of the UAE, a country that's moving forward with its plans, looking at the future and the future of region also.""For its first Mars mission, the UAE chose partners instead of doing it all on its own.""Developing a spacecraft is not easy even if there is ample funding,"" said Junya Terazono, an astronomer at Aizu University.Emirati scientists worked with researchers at the University of Colorado Boulder, University of California, Berkeley and Arizona State University. The spacecraft was assembled at Boulder and transported to Japan as the two countries looked to expand their ties with the rich and politically stable Middle Eastern nation.The Amal spacecraft, along with its launch, cost $200 million, according to Omran Sharaf, the UAE project manager. Operation costs at Mars have yet to be divulged.Amal, about the size of a small car, carries three instruments to study the upper atmosphere and monitor climate change while circling the red planet for at least two years. It is set to follow up on NASA's Maven orbiter sent to Mars in 2014 to study how it went from a warm, wet world that may have harboured microbial life during its first billion years, to the cold, barren place of today.Hope also plans to send back images of weather changes.Japan, a U.S. ally, has already long collaborated in defence and space technology.Resource-poor Japan has traditionally kept friendly ties with Middle Eastern countries. In recent years, Japan has increasingly stepped up trade and defence ties with the UAE, and now seeks to expand its space business.Two other Mars missions are planned in the coming days by the U.S. and China. The U.S. plans to send a rover named Perseverance to search for signs of ancient life and collect rock and soil samples for return to Earth. Liftoff is targeted for July 30. China aims to explore Mars with an orbiter and rover to study the planet's surface, and search for water and ice. This launch is set for around July 23.Japan has its own Mars mission planned in 2024.Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, or JAXA, plans to send a spacecraft to the Martian moon Phobos to collect samples to bring back to Earth in 2029."
Canadian Club sends notice barring reporters from Stephen Harper speech | CBC News,The news media has been uninvited to a speech by former prime minister Stephen Harper on Thursday.,2018-10-10T21:59:48.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/stephen-harper-book-canadian-club-media-barred-1.4857438,"The news media has been uninvited to a speech by Stephen Harper on Thursday, underscoring the apparent antipathy the former prime minister continues to harbour in private life towards the Canadian press corps.Harper is to address the Canadian Club of Toronto, which had previously invited reporters to cover the event. But the club sent out a notice to the media Wednesday saying the invitation had been sent in error.""The Canadian Club of Toronto would like to apologize for inviting the media to our event with The Right Honourable Stephen Harper. This is a closed event. The previous media advisories were sent in error,"" said the notice.Colleen Kennedy, the club's executive director, said the event was always considered private and that her organization should not have sent out an invitation for the media to cover it.Harper is plugging a new book, ""Right Here, Right Now,"" in which he addresses how conservatives should tackle the challenge of rising populism since the election of Donald Trump to the U.S. presidency.Harper spoke to a series of American media outlets earlier in the week to promote his book.During his near decade in power, Harper's office had an acrimonious relationship with the national media. He distrusted reporters' motives and his office tightly controlled access to his ministers, foreign diplomats and senior public servants.Harper's book argues that the forces that propelled Trump to power can't be ignored by political leaders, and that conservatives need to find practical ways to bridge the disconnect and distrust separating working people and those who govern them.The message is similar to the one Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has made in numerous speeches but Harper draws a sharp partisan distinction, arguing that ""a pragmatic conservative approach to market-oriented economics"" is the best way to deal with the current disruption.""If conservatives do not develop answers, we will not only seem disconnected, we will cede territory to the bad ideas of the other side,"" he writes.Harper says Trump supporters can't simply be written off as ill-informed bigots. While he avoids heavy-handed criticism of Trump, Harper does say the president's focus on renegotiating a well-functioning North American Free Trade Agreement was ""an enormous and unnecessary distraction for all of us.""He says the three North American countries should have been focusing on their shared problem — China.Harper says Chinese President Xi Jinping is ""utterly committed to authoritarian governance"" and holding power for life.China is poised to become the world's largest economy, and that is not a good thing in Harper's view.""This, combined with its renewed authoritarianism, its increasing foreign aggressiveness, and its military buildup, cannot be seen as anything other than a serious threat to the Western democratic model.""Harper also argues against granting China market economy status and accuses the Liberal government before him of attempting to ""slip special treatment of China into our regulations"" before he reversed them.Harper says the non-market status that China was assigned in 2001 when it joined the World Trade Organization must be maintained, and he supports Trump's efforts to do that. A controversial clause in the recently renegotiated North American free trade pact requires countries to notify each other if they enter into trade talks with a ""non-market"" economy.""Trump needs to hold his ground here and continue to resist the calls to change China's WTO status in the absence of sufficient reform,"" Harper writes.""The Chinese government wants market economy status badly. It needs to earn it."""
Hong Kong police clash with protesters opposing extradition bill | CBC News,Hong Kong was plunged into a fresh political crisis on Sunday night after hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets to thwart a proposed extradition law that would allow suspects to be sent to mainland China to face trial.,2019-06-09T11:27:36.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/hong-kong-protest-china-extradition-bill-1.5168239,"Hundreds of thousands of protesters marched through Hong Kong on Sunday to voice their opposition to government-sponsored legislation that would allow people to be extradited to mainland China to face charges.The massive demonstration took place three days before the semi-autonomous Chinese territory's government plans to bring the highly contentious bill to the full legislature, bypassing the committee process, in a bid to win approval by the end of the month.Police estimated the crowd at 240,000, but organizers said more than one million took part.The protest was one of the largest in recent Hong Kong history. It appeared to be even bigger than a massive pro-democracy demonstration in 2003 against a proposed national security law, according to Associated Press journalists who covered both events.Late Sunday night, a group of demonstrators broke through barriers at government headquarters, where the march had ended. The crowd briefly pushed its way into the lobby, but police used batons and pepper spray, and the protesters were moved outside.People of all ages took part in the march, some pushing strollers and others carrying canes, chanting slogans in the native Cantonese dialect calling for greater transparency in government.Watch: Hundreds of thousands demonstrate on Hong Kong's streetsCBC NewsKiwi Wong, 27, was among the throng, a member of the younger generation who've grown up enjoying relative prosperity, but also growing insecurity about what many see as an erosion of the rights Hong Kong residents have enjoyed.""If I didn't come out now, I don't know when I would have the chance to express my opinion again,"" Wong said. ""Because now we've got to this stage, if you don't come out to try to do what you can, then it will end up too late, you won't be able to say or do anything about it.""Alex Ng, a 67-year-old retiree, said he joined the protest because ""I think that there was never any public consultation about this law, and there are a lot of uncertainties.""Hong Kong's leader, Carrie Lam, has pushed forward with the legislation despite widespread criticism from human rights and business groups. The amendments have been criticized as eroding Hong Kong's judicial independence by making it easier to send criminal suspects to mainland China, where they could face vague national security charges and unfair trials.""What can we do to get Carrie Lam to listen to us? How many people have to come out to make her reconsider listening to the public?"" said Miu Wong, a 24-year-old office worker who was among the protesters.Tommy Lam, a 29-year-old who is working on his master's degree, said: ""All these people coming out and marching sends a definite message. If the government doesn't listen, there will be tension.""The Hong Kong government said in a statement late Sunday that it respected the right of its opponents to protest.""We acknowledge and respect that people have different views on a wide range of issues,"" the statement said. ""The procession today is an example of Hong Kong people exercising their freedom of expression within their rights as enshrined in the Basic Law and the Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance.""Hong Kong was guaranteed the right to retain its own social, legal and political systems for 50 years following its handover from British to Chinese rule in 1997, the so-called ""one country, two systems"" framework. However, China's ruling Communist Party has been seen as increasingly reneging on that agreement by forcing through unpopular legal changes.Hong Kong currently limits extraditions to jurisdictions with which it has existing extradition agreements or on an individual basis under a law passed before 1997.China was excluded because of concerns over its poor record on legal independence and human rights. In recent years, mainland authorities have gone after opponents by accusing them of dubious crimes such as tax evasion, crystalizing worries among critics and others.Lam's government argued that the revisions were needed to close legal loopholes, while opponents say that is merely an excuse to pursue China's agenda of reducing Hong Kong's legal independence.Hong Kong's Legislative Council plans to vote on the bill on Wednesday.""The people of Hong Kong want to protect our freedom, our freedom of speech, our rule of law, our judicial system, and also our economic foundation, which is welcome to international investors,"" activist Lee Cheuk-yan, a former Hong Kong legislator, said Sunday. ""If international investors lose confidence in Hong Kong because of this evil bill, then Hong Kong, economically, would also be destroyed."""
Trudeau goes where one Trudeau has gone before | CBC News,"More than four decades after his father first began paving the way in the 1970s, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau arrived in China early Tuesday to begin his first official visit there, with both countries keen to forge ever-stronger economic ties.",2016-08-30T00:23:29.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/justin-trudeau-leaves-on-china-trip-1.3740505,"More than four decades after his father first began paving the way in the 1970s, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau arrived in China early Tuesday to begin his first official visit there, with both countries keen to forge ever-stronger economic ties.Trudeau, travelling with wife Sophie Gregoire Trudeau and seven-year-old daughter Ella-Grace, said last week that he hopes the visit provides the opportunity to ""reset"" the relationship between the two countries.PMJT arrival in Beijing <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/hw?src=hash"">#hw</a> <a href=""https://t.co/7zJsDADaYb"">pic.twitter.com/7zJsDADaYb</a>China, the world's new economic superpower, sees the dawn of a new Trudeau era in Canada as a ""new opportunity"" to strengthen ties between the two countries, Chinese ambassador Luo Zhaohui said in an interview last week.Canada's relationship with China under the Harper government was at times inconsistent, many experts say. Historically, Luo acknowledged China has had warmer connections with Canada's Liberal-led governments.Indeed, the Chinese consider the Jean Chretien era of the 1990s as the ""golden years"" in their business dealings with Canada, he added.Nor has the country forgotten how Trudeau's father, Pierre Trudeau, was among the first western leaders to recognize ""new China"" when he established diplomatic ties in 1970, later becoming the first Canadian PM to travel there in 1973.The Liberal love-in, however, has at least one former Harper cabinet minister crying foul.Gerry Ritz, a former agriculture minister and veteran of some 15 trips to the east Asian country, said he laughs out loud when he hears Trudeau describe a chill in Canada-China relations.Ritz suggested there is still room for Canada to forge a free trade deal with China, even though government officials have played down any notion that such a deal could be on the table.In an online poll conducted in June and July and commissioned by the Asia Pacific Foundation of Canada, 46 per cent of respondents said they would support a free trade agreement, compared with 36 per cent in a similar 2014 poll.The exact same percentage of respondents opposed such a deal, although that's down from 50 per cent in 2014.Trudeau's visit is scheduled to include meetings with Chinese President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Keqiang, who is scheduled to pay a visit to Canada sometime in late September.His itinerary will be packed with business-related meetings. as well as the G20 leaders' summit. Between Aug. 30 and Sept. 7, he will make stops in Beijing, Shanghai, Hangzhou and Hong Kong.All the while, he will have to navigate several ongoing irritants.In his meetings with Xi and Li, Trudeau is expected to discuss a dispute over Chinese rule changes that could affect Canada's multibillion-dollar canola exports.He also plans to raise the issue of jailed Canadian Kevin Garratt, who was arrested in China two years ago for espionage. The prime minister has said there's no evidence to support the allegations.Talks with China always call for an especially delicate form of diplomacy. Ritz offered Trudeau some advice when broaching China's less-than-stellar human rights record: don't do it in public.""They take the criticism and recognize the fact they're a global entity and that social networks as well as newscasts and so on like that — there's a lot more coverage of everything that happens,"" he said.""They have to realize at some point they have to change the way they handle their own population and the way they handle outsiders trying to invest in that economy.""They do take that as constructive criticism. They may not like it.""The Conservatives made progress with China, Ritz added, and still held them to account on labour standards, the environment and human rights.""We didn't pick and choose,"" he said. ""We were very firm in our dealings with China.""Trudeau and many business leaders argue that Canada has much to gain from closer economic ties with a rapidly growing economy and middle class in China, which is already Canada's second-largest trading partner.Trudeau's schedule includes meetings with the China Entrepreneur Club, Canada China Business Council, the Chinese firm Fosun, known for its investment in Cirque de Soleil, women entrepreneurs in China and Jack Ma, founder of e-commerce giant Alibaba.The prime minister will also visit a high school with former NBA basketball player Yao Ming; take a boat cruise to highlight tourism opportunities in Canada; visit to the Great Wall of China; and pay tribute to Canadian soldiers who defended Hong Kong during the Second World War."
OPINION | Opinion: White House pressure for more Iran sanctions is isolating U.S. on international stage | CBC News,"Atrophy of U.S. political and moral authority presents Ottawa with a serious foreign policy challenge, writes Sam Khanlari.",2020-09-18T08:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/opinion/opinion-united-states-iran-nuclear-deal-1.5727821,"This column is an opinion by Sam Khanlari, a Toronto-based writer and editor. For more information about CBC's Opinion section, please see the FAQ.The announcement of a nuclear accord between Iran and several world powers five years ago signalled the opening of a new chapter of relations between Tehran and the West. After more than a decade of impasse over Iran's nuclear program, the historic diplomatic agreement would ensure Tehran never obtained atomic weapons, and in exchange Iran's economy would be gradually re-integrated into the global financial system.Fast forward to today, and despite the best efforts of the Trump administration, the deal clings to life. Although Iran has been largely deprived of the economic benefits within the agreement, the United States is the one isolated on the international stage after its repeated attempts at sabotaging the deal.Last month, the United Nations Security Council roundly dismissed a U.S.-tabled resolution to extend an expiring arms embargo on Tehran. The motion represented the Trump administration's latest salvo to discredit the 2015 accord; the first one came when Donald Trump withdrew from the deal in May 2018.The stage is now set for a showdown at the UN, as the United States pushes the Security Council — the body charged with ensuring international peace and security — into uncharted territory. U.S officials have vowed to penalize any country or entity that defies their call for sanctions to be reimposed on Tehran.The remaining members of the deal (Britain, China, France, Germany, Iran, and Russia) contend that the U.S. is no longer a participant, and therefore not in a position to alter the agreement's terms. Despite the difficulties posed by the U.S. withdrawal, they remain committed to the deal and have reportedly urged other nations to simply ignore the U.S. ultimatum.Another arena for this geopolitical standoff is a Canadian courthouse, where the United States is seeking the extradition of Meng Wanzhou, Huawei's chief financial officer, following her 2018 arrest at a Vancouver airport on charges of violating U.S. sanctions on Iran. After withdrawing from the nuclear deal in 2018, the U.S. simply reinstated its previous sanctions, which allegedly contributed to Wanzhou's arrest.At the heart of the extradition case lies what some say is the biggest strategic issue currently facing Canada's leaders, who are left in ""a no-win position"" picking sides between China and the United States.For its part, Ottawa does not have an Iran policy of its own.Most Canadians' understanding of contemporary Iran is inextricably linked to the revolution in 1979 and the seizure of the U.S. embassy in Tehran. Cinematic adaptations provide reminders of Ottawa's involvement. This legacy, coupled with a supposed paucity of Canadian interests in the region, has helped limit discussion of Canada's foreign policy toward Iran to cautious engagement, complete isolation, or support for wholesale regime change.As a result, Canadian politicians have often echoed their American counterparts' calls to delegitimize Iran's government. In 2012, Prime Minister Stephen Harper abruptly severed all relations with Tehran and enacted unprecedented legislation allowing for the seizure of Iranian state assets. ""It's no coincidence that we closed the embassy basically the day after the legislation became effective,"" Dennis Horack, a retired Canadian diplomat, said in 2018.Justin Trudeau campaigned on a pledge to restore diplomatic relations with Tehran in 2015, but his government is no longer committed to it.Meanwhile, the U.S. currently enforces some 8,000 sanctions across 30 countries and territories. But not only have sanctions largely failed to achieve their stated policy goals, their impact on the health and welfare of local populations has been extensive. Even in the midst of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, the White House has responded to calls for the U.S. to temporarily alleviate the impact of sanctions on Iranians by announcing additional ones.In addition to continuing the <a href=""https://twitter.com/UN?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">@UN</a> arms embargo, the UN sanctions we are restoring on Iran will also re-impose accountability for other forms of Iranian malign activity that the authors of the nuclear deal foolishly downplayed. <a href=""https://t.co/VV9Rhkol40"">pic.twitter.com/VV9Rhkol40</a>As The Economist put it, ""America is uniquely well positioned to use financial warfare in the service of foreign policy."" Banks in Europe and Asia may be an ocean away, but the plumbing of international finance runs through U.S territory. And by leveraging its leading financial position, Washington has, according to the Boston Review, ""effectively conscripted the worldwide banking system to enforce a punitive foreign policy that is actively opposed by most of the world's nations.""The split over the Iran nuclear deal and fear of U.S. penalties is having an impact on financial ties with traditional European allies.Mark Carney, former governor of the Bank of England, recently proposed the formation of a global digital currency to ""dampen the domineering influence of the U.S. dollar on global trade.""And in a speech last year, French President Emmanuel Macron recognized this ongoing ""geopolitical and strategic reconfiguration,"" and added that, ""I am not saying that we need to fight the dollar, but we need to build real economic and financial sovereignty.""With nationalism on the rise, faith in many multilateral institutions developed in the postwar period is foundering. The UN Security Council has slowly morphed into a battleground rather than ""a body that delivers effective management of peace and security challenges."" There is growing interest in an alternative global payment system with the potential to help targeted countries skirt U.S. sanctions. There are varied predictions of the rise of civilization-states as ideological counterweights to Western liberal democracy, as the world economy enters an ""Asian century.""In a major foreign policy speech just before the coronavirus pandemic, Canada's Minister of Foreign Affairs Francois-Phillipe Champagne highlighted some of the challenges associated with ""the emergence of a multipolar world with new epicentres of influence and competition over ideas and models of governance.""A change in U.S. leadership next year would not reverse the currents driving these changes.In tandem with the pandemic, these trends have, according to Roland Paris, an international affairs expert who has advised the federal government, ""accelerated geopolitical shifts that show no sign of dissipating — and some of them jeopardize Canadian interests in ways that may be unfamiliar to a country long used to a more benign international environment.""By virtue of geography, Ottawa has held a favourable position alongside the world's superpower. As Paris noted recently, however, Canadian foreign policy has long been characterized by complacency, and the current moment necessitates ""not only new policy approaches, but also different ways of doing foreign policy.""The atrophy of America's political and moral authority presents Ottawa with its most serious foreign policy challenge since the end of World War II. This leaves Canada and its European allies tasked with upholding — and ultimately reforming — the multilateral institutions that have animated the policies of Western countries for more than half a century.Meanwhile, President Trump's destructive policies on Iran abuse this old world order and hasten the rise of a new one."

Dozens dead after Pakistan International Airlines plane crashes into crowded Karachi neighbourhood | CBC News,A jetliner carrying 98 people crashed Friday in a crowded neighbourhood near the airport in Pakistan's port city of Karachi after an apparent engine failure during landing. Officials said there were at least two survivors from the plane.,2020-05-22T11:08:52.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/pakistan-plane-crash-1.5579961,"The latest:A jetliner carrying 98 people crashed Friday in a crowded neighbourhood near the airport in Pakistan's port city of Karachi after an apparent engine failure during landing.Officials said there were at least two survivors from the plane, that it was unknown how many people on the ground were hurt, and that at least five houses were destroyed.As darkness settled over the crash site, floodlights illuminated the wreckage, where crews were still recovering bodies. A portable morgue was set up.At least 57 bodies were recovered, health department officials said, and Pakistan International Airlines chairman Arshad Malik said finding all the dead could take two to three days.At least two people aboard survived, according to the Sindh provincial health department, revising an earlier statement that three were alive.The news from Pakistan this morning is devastating. To the families and friends of those who lost their lives in the crash of PK 8303, and to everyone affected by this terrible tragedy, our hearts go out to you. Canadians are keeping you in our thoughts today.Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan tweeted: ""Shocked & saddened by the PIA crash ... Immediate inquiry will be instituted. Prayers & condolences go to families of the deceased.""World leaders expressed condolences, including Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.Global Affairs Canada said it was not aware of any Canadian citizens affected by the crash.The pilot of Pakistan International Airlines Flight 8303 was heard transmitting a mayday to the tower shortly before the crash of the Airbus A320, which was flying from Lahore to Karachi. Video on social media appeared to show the jet flying low over a residential area with flames shooting from one of its engines.The plane came to rest at about 2:39 p.m. local time between houses smashed by its wings in a narrow alley in the poor and congested residential area known as Model Colony. Police in protective masks struggled to clear away crowds amid the smoke and dust so ambulances and fire trucks could get through.Pakistan had resumed domestic flights earlier this week ahead of the Eid-al Fitr holiday marking the end of the Islamic fasting month of Ramadan. Pakistan has been in a countrywide lockdown since mid-March because of the coronavirus, with Southern Sindh, where Karachi is the capital, the epicentre of virus infections.WATCH | Pakistan International Airlines plane crashes in Karachi, Pakistan:WorldA transmission of the pilot's final exchange with air traffic control, posted on the website LiveATC.net, indicated he had failed to land and was circling around to make another attempt.""We are proceeding direct, sir — we have lost engine,"" a pilot said.""Confirm your attempt on belly,"" the air traffic controller said, offering a runway.""Sir — mayday, mayday, mayday, mayday Pakistan 8303,"" the pilot said before the transmission ended.Witnesses said the Airbus A320 appeared to attempt to land two or three times before crashing in a residential area near Jinnah International Airport.A resident of the area, Abdul Rahman, said he saw the aircraft circle at least three times, appearing to try to land before it crashed into several houses.Pakistan officials said the plane had 91 passengers and seven crew members on board, revising earlier statements from airport officials. The airport in Lahore, where the Pakistan International Airlines flight originated on Friday, initially said there were 107 people on board. A spokesperson for Pakistan's civil aviation authority attributed the discrepancy to confusion in the tense aftermath of the crash.In a statement issued Friday, Airbus said its ""thoughts are with those affected"" by the crash and confirmed it is ""providing assistance to the investigation."" We regret to confirm that an A320 operated by Pakistan International Airlines was involved in an accident during flight <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/PK8303?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#PK8303</a> from Lahore to Karachi on May, 22 2020. Our thoughts are with all those affected. Airbus is providing assistance to the investigation.The flight from the northeastern city of Lahore typically lasts about an hour and a half.Airworthiness documents showed the plane last received a government check on Nov. 1, 2019. PIA's chief engineer signed a separate certificate on April 28 saying all maintenance had been conducted. It said, ""The aircraft is fully airworthy and meets all the safety"" standards.Ownership records for the Airbus A320 showed China Eastern Airlines flew the plane from 2004 until 2014. The plane then entered PIA's fleet, leased from GE Capital Aviation Services.Perry Bradley, a spokesperson for GE, said the firm was ""aware of reports of the accident and is closely monitoring the situation.""The plane had logged 47,100 flight hours and 25,860 flights before Friday, according to figures from Airbus."
First ship was expected to arrive in Thunder Bay overnight on Wednesday | CBC News,The Chief Executive Officer of the Thunder Bay Port Authority says China's ban on Canadian canola should not have a negative impact on this year's shipping season.,2019-03-28T11:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/thunder-bay/port-of-thunder-bay-to-open-shipping-season-today-1.5074088,"The Chief Executive Officer of the Thunder Bay Port Authority says China's ban on Canadian canola should not have a negative impact on this year's shipping season.Tim Heney said that canola is the second biggest grain crop that is handled through the port of Thunder Bay.He said most of that crop is destined for North Africa, Europe, Latin America and the Middle East.Heney said none of the canola handled in Thunder Bay goes to China.""If anything, if they look to diversify markets away from China, we could actually see a positive development,"" said Heney. ""Depending on how long the situation continues.""Last week, the Canola Council of Canada announced that orders from China had mysteriously dried up across a number of canola sellers. The Chinese government declared it had found dangerous pests such as fungus in the company's canola, so it halted all shipments. The unexpected canola ban came in the shadow of an ongoing diplomatic dispute between Canada and China.Heney said canola makes up about 20 percent of the port's shipping on an annual basis.Despite the sudden spotlight on the usually calm world of canola shipping, the port's 2019 season seems to be on track.   On Tuesday, the Soo Locks opened for this season with the first ship heading west to Thunder Bay on Wednesday morning.Heney said it's about a 10 hour sail to Thunder Bay from the Sault, although he noted there is still some heavy ice to contend with on Lake Superior.""Well the heaviest ice right now is in Whitefish Bay, and that is kind of traditional."" said Heney. ""The winds blow the ice into that area. Makes it sort of pancake. That's always the challenge when coming through Lake Superior. And it's no different this year.""Heney said ice breakers will be escorting the first few ships through Whitefish Bay to ensure a safe passage.In the mean time, he said the Samuel Risley has been busy breaking up the ice over the past five days in Thunder Bay's harbour.""A lot of the channels are all broken up,"" said Heney. ""The Risley is still here waiting for the first ship, so there shouldn't be any issues in the harbour.""Heney said the first ship of 2019 was expected to arrive in Thunder Bay's harbour overnight on Wednesday, marking the official start of the shipping season.He said the start of the season looks strong with a lot of grain in the elevators ready to go. On top of the usual grain shipping, Heney said there are some other products that will be moved through the port.""We are looking forward to some early steel shipments coming in from Europe,"" said Heney. ""We have a load of structural beams from Luxembourg, and rail from Spain. So things are going to kick off to a pretty busy start I think.""Thunder Bay's 2019 shipping season follows a very successful 2018 season.In December the port had its third-best month in the last 20 years with nearly 1.5 million metric tonnes of cargo crossing the docks.Prairie-grown grain accounted for the majority of the total; the large sum of grain exported in December brought the port's annual grain haul to 7.4 million tonnes, up from 7.3 million the prior season.Annual shipments of coal and potash from Western Canada were strong as well. Combined, the shipments amounted to 1.13 million tonnes, which is 20 percent above the five-year average.The potash tally was the second highest in the past decade."
Chinese president Xi Jinping re-appointed with no term limits | CBC News,Xi Jinping has been reappointed as China's president with no limit on the number of terms he can serve.,2018-03-17T02:55:07.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/chinese-president-xi-jinping-reappointed-no-term-limits-1.4580962,"Xi Jinping has been reappointed as China's president with no limit on the number of terms he can serve.The National People's Congress, China's rubber-stamp legislature, also appointed close Xi ally Wang Qishan to the formerly ceremonial post of vice president.Xi, 64, is considered the most powerful Chinese leader since Mao Zedong and last Sunday was given the right to continue in office indefinitely after the legislature scrapped term limits for the president and vice-president.Chinese officials defended the move saying it would bring the presidency in-line with Xi's other two main positons of head of the ruling Communist Party and commander of the armed forces.Critics say the move will likely lead to increased political repression and infighting among party factions.Xi took office as president in 2013 and hasn't said how many additional five-year terms he intends to serve. State media has said the removal of term limits will not alter conditions for retirement or create a president in perpetuity, but has offered no details.Xi is expected to expand his years-long campaign against corruption within the party to include all state employees through the creation of a new National Supervisory Commission, while continuing to pursue a muscular foreign policy and policies to upgrade the slowing economy.Economic growth and social stability have allowed Xi to amend the constitution and carry out other moves that once seemed highly contentious, said Kerry Brown, professor of Chinese Studies and director of the Lau China Institute at King's College, London.""Really no one is going to shout and moan too much"" because growth and stability are considered so important, Brown said Friday in a talk to foreign media in Beijing."
Soldiering on or fizzling out: 2 possible outcomes of the Hong Kong protests | CBC News,Hong Kong's million-person march in a downpour Sunday could mark a turning point in the standoff with the city's administration. Harder to discern is exactly which direction it will go from here.,2019-08-19T20:32:54.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/hong-kong-1.5252313,"Hong Kong's million-person march in a downpour Sunday likely marks a turning point in the almost three-month-long standoff with the city's administration.Harder to discern is exactly which direction it will go from here.""What we want is a dialogue with [Hong Kong chief executive] Carrie Lam, not many more weeks of protests,"" said Bonnie Leung of Hong Kong's Civil Human Rights Front, the group that has organized the city's best attended pro-democracy rallies since the beginning of June, including the most recent event on Sunday.""This campaign is very important to us. It's basic human rights. We simply must soldier on,"" she told CBC News.At a news conference Monday in Hong Kong, other organizers emphasized that the peaceful nature of the rally provides an opening for Hong Kong's government to respond. If the city administration chooses not to, implicit was the suggestion that the demonstrations would continue and the risk of more violence would be heightened.Tuesday morning, Lam said she hoped a peaceful weekend anti-government protest was the start of an effort to restore peace and that the government would talk to peaceful protesters and tackle complaints against police.""I have explained and elaborated on two important areas of work that we are doing,"" she told reporters. ""One is an important fact-finding study in addition to a very robust system to investigate and look at the complaints against police over this prolonged period of confrontations and violence.""On Sunday night after the protests, many younger demonstrators — clad in black and sporting gas masks — blocked streets outside police headquarters in the city's Central district. However, protest leaders with megaphones urged the crowd to disperse, saying they didn't want Sunday's peaceful rally to be marred by any late-night encounters, and people eventually melted into the nearby metro station without incident.One of the complaints of the protesters is the heavy-handed use of tear gas by police: they claim that almost 2,000 canisters have been fired at them and that police have aggravated the situation by their heavy-handed tactics.In mainland China, on the other hand, it's commonplace for state media to liken the behaviour of the Hong Kong protesters to ""rioters."" Leung says since the worst of the violent incidents at the city's international airport last week, the demonstrators have stepped back and shown restraint.""People are angry about police using excessive force again and again, so if an independent inquiry can at least be set up, the protesters will be calmed down more.""The pro-democracy movement has made a list of demands of Hong Kong's leadership, including universal suffrage for Hong Kong, the end of the extradition bill, the release of arrested protesters and a probe into police brutality.  In the aftermath of the rally, the demand for an independent inquiry into police actions was being held out as the one concession most easily acceptable by Hong Kong's administration.Still, one veteran of the Hong Kong–China relationship told us he believes the most likely outcome now is that the pro-democracy protests will quickly run out of steam.""We are seeing the beginning of the end,"" said Prof. Lau Siu-Kai of the Chinese University of Hong Kong. Lau, now 72, has more than four decades of experience advising Beijing on matters involving Hong Kong and was a key player in the transfer of power between Britain and China in 1997. ""Eventually the deadlock will disappear because people [protesters] will seek other means of putting pressure on the government.""He says upcoming municipal elections this fall may prove to be a more tempting battleground for the pro-democracy movement, as they attempt to unseat China-friendly incumbents.Whatever course the protesters take, he says several of their demands are so toxic to Beijing that there is zero chance they would ever be met, no matter what external pressure is applied.Chief among those, he says, is a direct challenge to the leadership of Lam.""Beijing cannot allow or tolerate any government in Hong Kong [that] preaches against China or against the Chinese communist party,"" said Lau.However, he concedes the protesters have also achieved a victory of sorts by forcing the withdrawal of the so-called extradition bill. It may not be the total disavowal of the legislation the protesters wanted, but he argues its not insignificant.Critics feared the legislation would have allowed China's justice system to reach into Hong Kong and violated the principles of ""one country, two systems"" that was the basis of the 1997 handover agreement with Britain.""I would think in some ways the government has already surrendered,"" said Lau.One of the few things both sides agree on is that, with Sunday's peaceful protest, the likelihood of a significant intervention by Chinese troops or police has diminished.The spectre of mainland police and armoured personnel carriers parked just across the border in Shenzhen has loomed over the city for the past week.""Beijing does not see [the] Hong Kong situation as out of control,"" said Lau. ""The number of violent people is a very limited number; as far as I can see it's about 1,000 to 2,000 people. And now some of the real leaders have been arrested by the police.""Still, even if the street protests die down and the pro-democracy movement takes a breather, he believes the conflicts have clearly highlighted significant cleavages in the city that Hong Kong's leadership will have to address.""There are a lot of grievances in Hong Kong — political, social, and economic.""The turmoil has left the Beijing and Hong Kong governments ""more determined than ever"" to make changes, particularly regarding the lack of opportunity for young people, he said."

Canada prepares pandemic response plan as coronavirus cases continue to climb | CBC News,Canada is preparing to respond to a possible pandemic as the number of coronavirus cases continues to climb around the globe.,2020-02-24T19:35:55.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/pandemic-response-cornavirus-canada-1.5473738,"Canada is preparing to respond to a possible pandemic as the number of coronavirus cases continues to climb around the globe.Chief Public Health Officer Theresa Tam said the global threat posed by the novel coronavirus, which can lead to a respiratory illness called COVID-19, is evolving fast. While the outbreak continues to be contained mostly to the epicentre in Hubei, China, she noted that the virus is spreading now at the community level, person-to-person, in several other countries.""These signs are concerning, and they mean that the window of opportunity for containment ... for stopping the global spread of the virus, is closing,"" Tam told reporters in a teleconference Monday.""It also tells countries like Canada, that have been able to manage and detect cases so far, that we have to prepare across governments, across communities, and as families and individuals, in the event of more widespread transmission in our community.""The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern, but so far hasn't declared it a pandemic.Tam said the trajectory of the coronavirus is unknown at this time and it's possible that cases have occurred in other countries that don't have the proper tools to diagnose and contain it.Canada developed a pandemic response plan in 2009, which would serve as the foundation for any shift in the official response to the current outbreak, she said.The response plan includes accelerating research work here and contributing to international efforts to develop a vaccine abroad. Tam said it also could lead to expanding laboratory testing capabilities and access to diagnostic tools, and taking stock of essential supplies to make sure authorities don't run short. She added that Canada's course of action would be much the same whether the WHO declares a pandemic or not.Health Minister Patty Hajdu said Monday that a pandemic declaration by the WHO would render travel restrictions meaningless because it would mean that efforts to contain the virus had failed.""As the window closes in terms of stopping the global spread, as we watch the WHO assess whether or not this is a full pandemic, obviously our attention turns more toward our domestic preparedness and what Canada can do to make sure our system and structures are ready for a change in our own population,"" she said.The WHO said today that China has reported 77,362 cases of COVID-19, including 2,618 deaths.Outside China, there are now 2,074 cases in 28 countries, including 10 in Canada, and 23 related deaths.Despite the rising numbers, WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said officials are encouraged by the fact that the number of new cases continues to decline in China.WorldThe epidemic peaked between Jan. 23 and Feb. 2 and has been steadily declining since, he said.Tedros said a decision on whether to declare a pandemic is based on an ongoing assessment of the geographical spread of the virus, the severity of the disease and its impact on society.""For the moment, we are not witnessing the uncontained global spread of this virus, and we are not witnessing large-scale severe disease or death,"" he said.""Does this virus have pandemic potential? Absolutely it has. Are we there yet? From our assessment, not yet.""Tedros said labelling the outbreak a pandemic could create unnecessary fear.Tam said that the goal now is to slow the spread of the virus, adding it's difficult to stop its spread because more countries are reporting people with no or mild symptoms.Canada has been successful so far in detecting imported cases and preventing person-to-person spread within communities, but is preparing for other scenarios, Tam said.Tam said enhanced border control measures and messaging at airports will be broadened to include warnings to travellers returning from other countries with reported cases of coronavirus.She said international travellers arriving at Canadian airports will be told to self-isolate if they're experiencing flu-like symptoms.Tam said all travellers should take general precautions and plan ahead by, for instance, making sure they have enough medication for a trip.She repeated the standard public health messages encouraging people to wash their hands frequently, cover coughs and sneezes, keep track of federal travel health advice posted online and share travel history with health-care providers in the event of becoming sick."
Walter Hiebert YVR lawsuit reminiscent of Dziekanksi case | CBC News,"Seven years after the death of Robert Dziekanski, Vancouver International Airport is facing a lawsuit after a man became so disoriented and frustrated at the lack of help offered, he tried to climb over a wall, fracturing his hip in the process.",2014-05-05T22:21:09.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/walter-hiebert-yvr-lawsuit-reminiscent-of-dziekanksi-case-1.2632631,"Seven years after the death of Robert Dziekanski, Vancouver International Airport is facing a lawsuit after a man became so disoriented and frustrated at the lack of help offered, he tried to climb over a wall, fracturing his hip in the process.In October, 2007, Dziekanski, 40, who did not speak English, became agitated after spending more than nine hours wandering in the airport arrivals area, before being confronted by four Mounties who stunned him several times with a Taser.In a recently filed statement of claim, Walter Hiebert says he suffered a stroke some years earlier that left him with impaired speech and an awkward gait. Hiebert says he was disembarked via wheelchair from a China Airlines flight from Taipei, in May 2012, transferred to a golf cart and left unattended for approximately 15 minutes, then offered a walker and given cursory directions.The New Westminster man (then, 57) was left to wander the hallways of the airport unassisted for twenty minutes, before opening a set of alarmed doors — an act of desperation, his statement claims — in the hope security would arrive.But no one came.A video, held by the Airport Authority, but made available to Hiebert's lawyer, Paul Warnett, apparently shows his client stuck in the restricted area for six minutes, before being asked by staff to show his passport through a glass wall. The staff member then left without comment.Frustrated at the situation, Hiebert used his wheelchair to boost himself over a wall, falling and fracturing his hip.Hiebert's suit makes claim against several organizations, including the Vancouver Airport Authority, China Airlines Limited and Canada Border Services Agency.""These sorts of things happen to people. And one of the allegations we're making is that the airport should be prepared to handle these situations,"" Warnett told CBC.""You would expect that someone is watching to make sure that you make your way down to where you're supposed to go,"" he said. ""And we know that his movements were captured on video for approximately a half hour before he has his fall and injures himself.""In an email, the Vancouver Airport Authority expressed regret at the concern the incident caused Hiebert.""We recognized a breakdown in customer care and immediately commenced an investigation involving personnel from the airline and other organizations at the airport,"" the email reads.The email also said the VAA is yet to be served with court documents.Hiebert's statement of claim only represents one side of a civil argument. None of his claims have yet been proven in court."
"Deadly explosion at Chinese kindergarten was intentional, officials say | CBC News","Chinese authorities say a homemade bomb was used in an explosion at the front gate of a kindergarten that killed eight people, including the suspect.",2017-06-16T07:13:11.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/china-kindergarten-explosion-1.4163510,"A 22-year-old man made the bomb that exploded at the front gate of a kindergarten in eastern China, killing eight people, including himself, investigators said Friday.Police said the suspect was identified primarily using security camera footage and DNA collected at the scene of the blast, which struck Thursday as relatives were waiting to pick up students at the end of the school day. Only the suspect's surname, Xu, was released and no motive was provided.Investigators say they found materials for making a homemade bomb at Xu's nearby residence. Emblazoned on its walls were the Chinese characters for death, disaster and other related dark themes.Xu had left school because of a nervous system disorder, whose symptoms can include depression, anxiety, dizziness, vision problems and problems with basic bodily functions, the police said at a news conference in the city of Xuzhou in Jiangsu province.Two people died at the scene and six died after being taken to a hospital. Sixty-five people were injured, including eight listed in critical condition.The blast at the Chuangxin Kindergarten in Xuzhou's Fengxian county occurred at 4:50 p.m. before school had let out for the day and no students or teachers from the kindergarten were among the injured, according to a statement from local authorities.However, videos purportedly from the scene showed children — possibly relatives of the kindergartners or passers-by — among the casualties.A witness identified only by the surname Shi said the force of the blast sent people flying several metres into the air, according to the state-run Global Times.Videos posted by the People's Daily showed a chaotic scene, with children and adults lying on the ground, some of them motionless, their clothes blown off them, and others struggling to get up. Clothing, shoes and other items were strewn across the area beside pools of blood.The videos showed ambulances arriving, medics wheeling people into an emergency room and medical personnel treating what appeared to be a child.Kindergartens and elementary schools in China have been attacked several times before by suspects authorities have said were mentally ill or bore grudges against their neighbours and society.In 2010, nearly 20 children were killed in attacks on schools, prompting a response from top government officials and leading many schools to beef up security by posting guards and installing gates and other barriers. Last year, a knife-wielding assailant injured seven students outside a primary school in a northern city.China maintains tight control over firearms and most attacks are carried out using knives, axes or homemade explosives."

"Virus concerns close doors at Armani, but other Milan Fashion Week shows go on | CBC News","The fashion crowd put a defiant face against the spread of a new virus, packing runway shows on the last big day of Milan Fashion Week on Sunday, even as Giorgio Armani made a last-minute decision to stream his latest collection from an empty theatre out of concerns for guests' health.",2020-02-24T15:43:33.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/milan-fashion-week-1.5473624,"The fashion crowd put a defiant face against the spread of a new virus, packing runway shows on the last big day of Milan Fashion Week on Sunday, even as Giorgio Armani made a last-minute decision to stream his latest collection from an empty theatre out of concerns for guests' health.Condé Naste artistic director Anna Wintour took her usual spot in the front-row of Dolce&Gabbana across from a gaggle of global social media Tik-Tok influencers, none of whom were deterred by the spreading virus that had put about a dozen northern Italian towns on lockdown.The Italian National Fashion Chamber said in a statement early Sunday there were no indications from health officials that changes in the schedule were called for, adding that it was up to brands to decide if they would go ahead. Only Armani made changes, among nine shows scheduled.Later in the day, Lombard officials closed theatres, cinemas and other places, like discos and pubs where people might crowd, for at least seven days, as confirmed cases in Italy jumped to at least 152.Venice officials took the step of cancelling Carnival celebrations, unprecedented in modern times, in a bid to stop the virus spread.Even as the shows went on, the coronavirus threat cast a strange mood over the Italian fashion capital. Despite pockets of activity around the venues at showtime, the city was more empty than normal for an unusually warm winter Sunday, when people from the surrounding province often come for a stroll or to soak in the fashion week energy.Inside shows, just a handful of people wore protective masks.Asked about the impact of coronavirus on the fashion schedule, Wintour pivoted to the unexpected announcement of a collaboration between creative forces Raf Simons and Miuccia Prada at Prada going forward, calling it ""the most inspiring news of the season.""""To me that just shows how we can all be much stronger together at a time when things are so politically divisive. The idea of two creative geniuses coming together supersedes other concerns,"" Wintour told The Associated Press after Dolce&Gabbana.The economic impact of the virus on the wider industry remains a concern. At least 1,000 Chinese journalists, buyers and industry insiders couldn't travel from China, which contributes one-third of global luxury revenues in domestic sales and shopping abroad.The Giorgio Armani fashion house announced overnight his runway show on Sunday would be conducted in an empty showroom and streamed for the fashion public on the internet as a ""preventative measure decided by Mr. Armani to support national efforts in safeguarding public health.""Mr Armani with his models at the <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/GiorgioArmani?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#GiorgioArmani</a> Women's FW20-21 fashion show. <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/MFW?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#MFW</a><br>Credits: Stefano Guindani / SGP Italia <a href=""https://t.co/2SfrmVLJS3"">pic.twitter.com/2SfrmVLJS3</a>It was the first time the 45-year-old Milan fashion house has taken such a step out of public health concerns, though Armani did stage a show in an empty venue in Paris in 1998 after officials said the big tent posed a safety hazard. At that time, he distributed video of the event to fashion editors, then restaged it in New York to protest what he said had been a decision dictated by fashion world politics and not safety concerns.In streaming, Armani models moved across a dark background, giving contrast to pink, teal and pearl gray silky printed trousers and skirts, while black velvet jackets that blended in with the darkness.Mr Armani with his models at the <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/GiorgioArmani?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#GiorgioArmani</a> Women's FW20-21 fashion show. <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/MFW?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#MFW</a><br>Credits: Stefano Guindani / SGP Italia <a href=""https://t.co/M95tZ1Pm5R"">pic.twitter.com/M95tZ1Pm5R</a>The show ended with what notes said was a ""message of love for China,"" where the coronavirus first broke out. Models in glistening, sculpted gowns from archival couture Armani Prive' collections inspired by China stopped along the runway, while the 85-year-old took a bow to the virtual audience. Empty seats were visible behind him.At Dolce&Gabbana, designers Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana showed a predominantly black and white collection in a world that is anything but. The looks included many iterations of the brand's famous black dresses, but this season was distinguished by cozy, enveloping knits in oversized stitching. To underline the artisanal quality, the brand's knitters and other craftspeople demonstrated their skills in the foyer.Tik-Tocker Anna O'Brien, whose videos empowering curvy women are posted as @glittersandlazers, was thrilled to be in the front row of her first-ever international runway show, virus or no.""Working in this industry, you learn about the hot story, right? And that's the hot story right now. Is it a threat? Definitely. But is it the only thing that's threatening the world right now? Not really,"" said O'Brien, who travelled from Austin, Texas, to Milan.Earlier Sunday, emerging talent Mariana Rosati was preparing models for its morning show of her Tuscan brand DROMe, which has found fans with Bella Hadid and Ariana Grande. Rosati said she didn't believe there was reason to fear, as models sat nearby waiting for hair and make-up.""I am very sorry what is going on. I know it is not predictable and obviously we need to be careful. But I actually think a lot of panic has been spread for not enough reasons,"" Rosati said.Though she expected fewer people would show, it was standing room only for the collection meant to inspire sensuality in women with its oversized jackets complemented by body-defining mini-dresses with deep slits that show off knitted underwear with a vintage feel.""Good vibes,"" Rosati said. ""This morning the news was that people would not show up. They did and that is great."" "
