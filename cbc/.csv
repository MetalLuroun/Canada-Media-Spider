"Quest for the Best: Here's the top ginger beef in Calgary, says restaurant critic | CBC News","The Calgary Eyeopener's restaurant reviewer, Elizabeth Carson, went on a hunt for the best ginger beef in Calgary and the results are in.",2020-12-12T15:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/ginger-beef-food-critic-calgary-1.5838147,"Ordering Chinese food for dinner would not be the same if it didn't come with some saucy ginger beef.Some say it makes the meal, so it's strange to think of a time when the dish didn't exist.And what's interesting is that the popular item didn't come from some far away part of the world — it is believed to have been created in Calgary.It is said that George Wong, a chef from northern China, invented it at the Silver Inn Restaurant on Centre Street North in Calgary in the 1970s.His daughter, Michelle Wong, says that it all started from a stir-fry beef recipe.""Dad was trying to find some sort of recipe that would bring a little bit of the Western cuisine to Chinese cuisine,"" she told the Calgary Eyeopener.""He kind of lightly battered the beef and tried this recipe out and that's how ginger beef was born.""The dish became so popular that it is now available in some form all across Canada.And because of its hometown roots, restaurant reviewer Elizabeth Carson has been on a quest for the best ginger beef the city has to offer.Her judges this week are self-acclaimed ginger beef addicts Michaela Marchand and Danielle La Banc.The panel of judges set off across Calgary and rated the ginger beef at four restaurants.When trying the saucy beef, the judges looked at a variety of features for their critiques.Carson says they were looking at beef-to-batter ratio, spice and sweet level, crunch, stickiness and the presentation.4. Central Grand Restaurant — 295-1623 Centre St. N.Carson says she thinks the spice in this ginger beef tasted like cinnamon, which she wasn't a big fan of.However, she says the dish did have a solid batter-to-beef ratio.3. Ginger Beef Bistro House — 388 Country Hills Blvd. N.E. and 9629 Macleod TrailThe critic says not only were they the fastest to the table when serving the ginger beef, but that it had a good crunch.""It had dark glossy sauce and no ginger in it, but it was way too sweet and had questionable beef-to-batter ratio.""2. Kam Han Szechuan House — 2318 Spiller Rd. S.E.""They had a nice kick spice level, not too sweet,"" said Carson.As well, she compliments the restaurant on having a nice beef-to-batter ratio and ginger in the sauce.1. Silver Inn Restaurant — 2702 Centre St. N.Carson says the original ginger beef spot is still the best in her books.She says their dish was not too sweet and had superb beef-to-batter ratio.""You can see the beef and it is tender with a fabulous crunchy batter,"" she said.She says it came with a deep red hued chili oil sauce, which had a fantastic depth of flavour and a perfect heat kick.""You gotta make your way to this mecca to get the real thing. It will be a revelation.""Do you have favourite ginger beef that isn't on the list? Tell us where in the comments below!With files from the Calgary Eyeopener."

"As angry protests continue over Chinese glass factory, Statford's mayor voices his regrets | CBC News","Stratford Mayor Dan Mathieson says if he could do it over again, he wouldn't have asked Municipal Affairs and Housing Minister Steve Clark for a special order, paving the way for a Chinese company to build a proposed factory on his community's rim.",2020-12-08T09:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/london/stratford-glass-factory-xinyi-1.5831901,"As angry protests continue outside city hall, Stratford Mayor Dan Mathieson is expressing his regret over the decision to ask the province for a special order, clearing legal hurdles for a proposed Chinese-owned glass factory to be built on the community's border. ""Absolutely. Seeing the challenge it has brought to the community, there's some concern around it ... I think it's safe to say we would probably love to rewind and work at this again.""While he regrets the decision, Mathieson told CBC News Monday that he cannot discuss the reasons why it was made, citing confidentiality. ""I'm not at liberty to disclose them because they're covered under a confidentiality agreement, but I can say that council, we're looking at this,"" he said.""I'm sure everyone would have like to have this done differently.""  Mathieson formally asked the province for what's known as a minister's zoning order, or MZO; three times since 2018. The power allows the minister to issue a decree on a piece of land that can't be appealed by community groups or Ontario's Local Planning Appeal Tribunal.Opposition groups have called the tactic ""anti-democratic,"" saying it unfairly circumvents the local decision-making process and was used in an effort to quash opposition to a factory critics worry would potentially pollute the community's air and waterways. The simmering public anger could be seen on display outside city hall each Monday for the past few weeks, with dozens of demonstrators waving placards to express their frustration and opposition to the proposed factory. On Monday, Mathieson acknowledged their frustration but also appealed to their civility, asking those who oppose the project to take on a more respectful tone in disagreeing with the decisions he's made. ""I appreciate that people are angry. I would ask them if they're frustrated to clearly articulate their opinion in a thoughtful way and be respectful. Making accusations, raising insults never helps a process move forward.""Get Concerned Stratford, one of two opposition groups formed to oppose the factory coming to town, has retained the services of David Donnelly, the Toronto environmental lawyer who helped a similar group stop Xinyi Canada from bringing a similar proposal to the township of Guelph-Eramosa. ""Once the citizens [of Guelph-Eramosa] had their say and all the evidence had put before council, council voted to reject the project and that's what I hope will happen here.""""Stratford is world-renown for its theatre, its art and its beautiful setting. Stratford is not world renown for its heavy manufacturing and probably never should be.""Donnelly said what really vexes people is the lack of clear information about the factory, not only from public officials, but from Xinyi Canada itself. He argues the company has been deliberately vague about the amount of pollution the factory would produce, saying his best guess based on what's available from the company is the facility would quadruple the city's green house gas (GHG) emissions.""This is information that we've had to glean off the Xinyi website based on a similar sized plant located elsewhere,"" he said.""To make float glass, you have to heat it up to an incredible temperature and basically float it on molten steel. So the energy required to heat up the thing that actually tempers the glass.""""So that's our estimate, four times Stratford's emissions, but Xinyi has not actually come out and told anyone what those GHG emissions will be.""""That, to me, in relation to Stratford's declaration of a climate emergency, that's disqualifying on its face."" Donnelly wrote a letter to Stratford city council on December 3, outlining his clients' reasons why council should vote down the proposal.While questions over the proposed factory mount, the public may be able to get a chance to have some of those questions answered in a public forum soon. A representative from Xinyi Canada is scheduled to answer questions in an open forum with Stratford city council on December 14. "

The classes are focused on language, but there is also instruction in martial arts, dancing, choir and yoga.After a few weeks of lockdown, the group started to experiment with activities online using Zoom. ""We tried some cooking classes because it's one of the favourite things that we like to do,"" Mu said, adding that the feedback was positive.CBC News New BrunswickFollowing the success of the online cooking classes, Mu and the group started to move most of the courses online. She said it was still difficult not to be together in person, but the online classes were working, especially for teaching the language.Some courses, like martial arts, couldn't really translate online.The success of the online classes gave Mu and the group the confidence to start preparing for the Chinese New Year gala. They are planning to hold it online this year.This year's theme of the gala is ""We are family"" — a nod to the community staying together during the pandemic.Jenny Zhang, a longtime volunteer with the association, said it is important to make sure there's a show this year, even if it's not on stage.""We put lots of effort, and the people worked together,"" Zhang said. Normally the group would start rehearsing in September for the show that is in January or early February, depending on the Chinese New Year.Instead of spending the fall rehearsing, they are busy recording sessions outdoors while the weather is still nice. On Sunday, about 20 people met at Killarney Lake, on Fredericton's north side, to film the choir singing.""Actually, I feel very confident right now,"" Mu said after spending the morning filming a video with the choir.""We support each other,"" she said, adding that the volunteers are learning how to make the gala online as they go. ""I think we're going to make it — I hope so,"" she said.Mu said the Chinese New Year is too important to the community to risk not having a gala, even if it's different from other years.""It is the most traditional way we will celebrate our Chinese New Year. It's kinda the most important day for the Chinese. We want to keep that tradition."""

China imposed the law on Hong Kong, which is supposed to have legal autonomy under the ""one country, two systems"" agreement.""If the Canadian side really cares about the stability and the prosperity in Hong Kong, and really cares about the good health and safety of those 300,000 Canadian passport holders in Hong Kong, and the large number of Canadian companies operating in Hong Kong … you should support those efforts to fight violent crimes,"" Cong said.Canada's deputy prime minister Chrystia Freeland said the ambassador's remarks were ""not in any way in keeping with the spirit of appropriate diplomatic relations between two countries."" Conservative Leader Erin O'Toole says that if Cong refuses to apologize, Canada should withdraw his diplomatic credentials.Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian defended Cong's remarks, saying Canadian leaders ""did not verify, but also condoned the anti-China comments spreading across the nation and made groundless accusations against China.""Edward Chin agrees with O'Toole. He is a Canadian hedge fund manager who lives and works in Hong Kong, and a longtime activist in the Hong Kong pro-democracy movement. Here is part of his conversation with As It Happens host Carol Off. Mr. Chin, how secure do you feel as a Canadian in Hong Kong right now?I think this [statement from the ambassador] is one of the so-called wolf warrior tactics they have been using over the last couple of years. But it kind of got escalated in the last little while.Do you feel secure since these remarks on the part of the [Chinese] ambassador? Even before this gentlemen's remarks, after the [national security law] came into effect, I don't think anyone would feel secure in Hong Kong because this is exactly one country, one system now. So how can anyone feel secure in Hong Kong?Because last year, every Hong Kong person, more than two million people, came out to fight very hard [against] the extradition bill that finally got retracted. Now, this is 10 times worse. This is the nuclear option that they think of.But this seems to have been in reaction to suggestions that Canada would offer asylum to people from Hong Kong, democracy activists who are feeling threatened by the … national security law since it came into place, and that this has been the way that Hong Kong [has reacted] to Canada's offer of asylum. Does that change things?I think Canada has done the right thing to give asylum to those demonstrators who came out and [fought] for democracy, because they were fighting for their life, basically.We have to go back a few months earlier. Why do people come up and protest? Because the two systems is gone. Now, the Chinese ambassador to Canada, you know, whatever he said is threatening. Threatening. This is outrageous, honestly. I think he should be reprimanded.China's ambassador in Ottawa was … warning against the granting asylum to Hong Kong dissidents, and he said, ""If the Canadian side really cares about the stability and the prosperity in Hong Kong and really cares about the good health and safety of those 300,000 Canadian passport holders in Hong Kong and the large number of Canadian companies operating Hong Kong, you should support those efforts to fight violent crimes."" And, of course, is referring to the national security law. Does that sound like a threat to you?Does it mean that they want to treat the Chinese-Canadians or Caucasian-Canadians in Hong Kong, just like the two Michaels, just to abduct them into China?They could just use any excuse and detain someone.I think that the Trudeau government, [Prime Minister] Justin Trudeau together with Chrystia Freeland, I think they should really have a strong statement saying, you know, like, ""This is a threat."" Because, you know, there are a lot of mainland students studying in Canada.Canada, they don't do the same type of threat. This is something really outrageous, and only like a totalitarian regime would do that, threatening people.Chrystia Freeland has spoken out in Canada. She has said this is not in the spirit of diplomatic relations … but the Opposition is saying that the government should go further, that in fact, they should demand the ambassador either apologize or leave the country, have his credentials pulled. Do you think that Canada should go that far?The opposition party is saying the right thing. Because definitely this Chinese ambassador … should definitely apologize.The Opposition leader, I agree with him. You know, they should do something to show that Canada is not one of the weakest Five Eyes countries. Because it's perceived that way, especially in Hong Kong.You have been an activist. You have been outspoken for years, even before this national security law came into effect, and as you point out, became something where people who speak out against China could be arrested, that free speech has been criminalized.... Are you concerned that they you might be targeted by the regime right now, given what they've said about Canada?Everyone could be targetted. I mean, we as Chinese-Canadians, we are in a very awkward situation now. Ethnically, I'm Chinese, so it is embarrassing to have a Chinese ambassador to Canada saying they will do some harm to Chinese people living in Hong Kong, whether I am Canadian or not. So they're saying they want to do something bad to their own people.I don't dislike China. I think it's a great country with a great civilization. But the CCP, the Chinese Communist Party, the way they treat their own people, is very questionable.And that's why [former Chinese leader] Deng Xiaoping promised the two systems until 2047. But now we are short-changed by 27 years.Can I just ask you, finally, do you think there will be many people in Hong Kong … the activists, will they be seeking asylum? Do you think they will ask to be refugees to Canada?I don't think there will be a massive exodus. But in terms of persecution, yes, definitely. Those people living in Hong Kong, whether they are Hong Kong permanent ID card holders or anyone in Hong Kong now, their situation is the same as if they were in mainland China. There's no difference. No doubt about it.Will you ever leave Hong Kong? Do you think that's something that you might have to do?Besides my investment business in hedge funds and all my other hedges, I'm a current affairs writer, a commentator. I think I want to wait until they put a gunpoint at someone's head; and I think that would be the time that we all should leave.And if they shut down, for instance, Apple Daily or some of the internet radio, or they arrest a lot of full-time political commentators, that's the time I think a lot of people should leave, and then the whole world should talk with the CCP and confront with them in a forceful way.Written by Sheena Goodyear with files from The Associated Press.

"I want my baby to grow up proud of her heritage. But with rising anti-Chinese racism, I'm struggling | CBC Radio",Lisa Xing wants to raise her child with pride in her Chinese heritage in spite of a surge in anti-Chinese racism due to COVID-19.,2020-10-03T09:01:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/radio/docproject/from-afar-1.5710871/i-want-my-baby-to-grow-up-proud-of-her-heritage-but-with-rising-anti-chinese-racism-i-m-struggling-1.5710879,"My parents immigrated to Canada from China in their thirties. I came when I was five. So I thought they would be honoured when I bestowed upon them the responsibility of giving their granddaughter a name. A Chinese name. To my surprise (and dismay), I realized just how much they were against this child having a Chinese name. They said the first name should be easy to pronounce.Finally, after my daughter was born on September 29, 2020, my partner Nathan and I settled on Minmin, pronounced ""Ming Ming"". The first Min means ""fall"", the second Min, ""easygoing"" and ""gentle"". It was my mom's suggestion, after she gave in to my pleas.Not only do I think it's user friendly, it's beautiful written in Chinese as 旻旼. Both words using the same two radicals (parts that form a character), just rearranged differently. The choice of my child's name is just one way I am trying to instill a sense of pride in her Chinese heritage. I want her to embrace it, even though anti-Chinese racism has been on the rise since COVID-19.My partner, Nathan, is white. He grew up on a tobacco farm in southwestern Ontario. Our baby is biracial. Throughout the pregnancy, we often talked about how she would look, how I'll manage to get her to speak Mandarin (as I am just a basic speaker myself), and the responsibility of choosing a name that would inevitably play a role in shaping her identity. But although we went ahead and named her Minmin, the current social and political climate has wedged some fear into my mind. It's not treatment from kids on the playground that worries me. It's the recent resurgence of racism that is different to the kind of intolerance I experienced as a child. Trump calls COVID-19 the ""China virus."" And since the coronavirus outbreak, there has been widespread racism against Chinese people, since the virus originated in Wuhan, China. I hate to say it, but in this context, something as superficial as looking more ""white"" or having an English name could spare my daughter a lot of pain. While I know she could get by easier by blending in, this hate also stirred up a defiance in me that made me want to instill that pride in being Chinese even more, so she can have a bulletproof attitude, as Nathan says, and so that none of it will bother her the way it bothered me. I wasn't always called ""Lisa."" My Chinese name is Yaxi (pronounced Ya-shee). That's what I went by as a child growing up in Hamilton, Ont. Everyone butchered it, intentionally or otherwise. Some called me ""Taxi"" or ""Yucky"". So the summer before high school, my best friend – who also had a difficult-for-North-Americans-to-pronounce name, Yiqing – and I decided to change our names. After fighting with my parents to let me change mine to ""Melanie,"" a cringe-worthy homage to Mel B of the Spice Girls, I finally relented and we went with ""Lisa,"" the English name my dad had chosen for me when I first came to Canada. Yiqing chose ""Myra."" The name change took some getting used to, though ultimately, it made life easier. But some time after university, I started realizing just how unique my Chinese name was: Ya, the last part of my mom's name, and Xi, which means ""dawn."" After my own experiences, and the ensuing struggle with my parents over my daughter's name, I hope Minmin will embrace it. I want her to be defiant and proud and confident. And I hope she won't take as long as I did to get there.  "
