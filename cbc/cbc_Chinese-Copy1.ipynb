      "'We’re Chinese,' says founding member Frank Fu. 'We need a voice, we need to tell people that we have our own culture.'\n",
      "2020-12-08T15:00:00.000Z\n",
      "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/yellowknife-chinese-association-1.5832028\n",
      "When Frank Fu moved to Yellowknife last October, he was all alone. \"It was very cold and a lot of snow,\" he recalls. Fu had moved to Yellowknife from Beijing under the N.W.T.'s Nominee Program, which invites people willing to invest at least $300,000 in a business to work toward permanent residency. The plan was to set up an apartment and a business, and his wife and two young children would follow. Fu spent his first two weeks in his apartment before venturing out to the grocery store, feeling very \"lonely.\" Though he speaks English proficiently, he made his first close friends at a Chinese New Year celebration at the legislative assembly the following February. That's when he began to get the idea to create a formal group to help people like himself. This fall, he helped launch the Yellowknife Chinese Association with 10 board members and 24 members. The goals are to support newcomers, promote Chinese culture and language, and to give back to the community. \"We're Chinese,\" Fu said. \"We need a voice, we need to tell people that we have our own culture.\" Fu had spent 20 years working for IBM in China. He now owns the security camera business, Intellibroad, in Yellowknife. He's still working on the association's new website. Angela Law is another founding board member. She moved to Yellowknife from Vancouver in 2002, but is originally from Hong Kong. Law and her family run Yellowknife Tours, the first company dedicated to bringing Chinese tourists to see the aurora. Law said previous generations of Chinese immigrants often had no time to organize societies: they were busy running businesses — often restaurants — working \"day and night.\" \"I thought that this is the time because there are so many Chinese investors here,\" Law said.Law and Fu estimate there are around 200 Chinese people in the N.W.T., though both believe more will follow.  \"Language is a big barrier,\" for newcomers, Law said. She wants to help connect new immigrants to those with experience in Canada. The group's website will also share information useful to potential investors, such as the recent story about a lawsuit between a Chinese investor and a Yellowknife-based business partner, which the board has already discussed.\"If these people [investors] want to know something about Yellowknife life here, then if they find us, then maybe this is also a channel for them to get someone who is living here and share the experience,\" said Law. The group hopes to mark their first event with a Spring Lantern festival, which they liken to a kind of Chinese Valentine's day, held 15 days after the Chinese lunar New Year. They hope to place red lanterns along Franklin Avenue and, pandemic permitting, hold some kind of event to celebrate. They also hope to launch classes or events for those who want to learn or improve their Chinese language skills. Members from mainland China, Taiwan and Hong Kong are all welcome to join the association. But the most important thing for now may be the social connections. While Fu was planning for his wife and children, ages 10 and three, to move to Yellowknife with him, the novel coronavirus arrived before they did. Fu now expects they won't move here until late in 2021, after the vaccine has been widely disseminated and it's safe to travel.  \"Right now, it's good because I have a lot of friends and I have a business to operate,\" Fu said.\"And we have YKCA to work on and it's very exciting, so I'm OK. I'm good here.\"\n",

      "As angry protests continue outside city hall, Stratford Mayor Dan Mathieson is expressing his regret over the decision to ask the province for a special order, clearing legal hurdles for a proposed Chinese-owned glass factory to be built on the community's border. \"Absolutely. Seeing the challenge it has brought to the community, there's some concern around it ... I think it's safe to say we would probably love to rewind and work at this again.\"While he regrets the decision, Mathieson told CBC News Monday that he cannot discuss the reasons why it was made, citing confidentiality. \"I'm not at liberty to disclose them because they're covered under a confidentiality agreement, but I can say that council, we're looking at this,\" he said.\"I'm sure everyone would have like to have this done differently.\"  Mathieson formally asked the province for what's known as a minister's zoning order, or MZO; three times since 2018. The power allows the minister to issue a decree on a piece of land that can't be appealed by community groups or Ontario's Local Planning Appeal Tribunal.Opposition groups have called the tactic \"anti-democratic,\" saying it unfairly circumvents the local decision-making process and was used in an effort to quash opposition to a factory critics worry would potentially pollute the community's air and waterways. The simmering public anger could be seen on display outside city hall each Monday for the past few weeks, with dozens of demonstrators waving placards to express their frustration and opposition to the proposed factory. On Monday, Mathieson acknowledged their frustration but also appealed to their civility, asking those who oppose the project to take on a more respectful tone in disagreeing with the decisions he's made. \"I appreciate that people are angry. I would ask them if they're frustrated to clearly articulate their opinion in a thoughtful way and be respectful. Making accusations, raising insults never helps a process move forward.\"Get Concerned Stratford, one of two opposition groups formed to oppose the factory coming to town, has retained the services of David Donnelly, the Toronto environmental lawyer who helped a similar group stop Xinyi Canada from bringing a similar proposal to the township of Guelph-Eramosa. \"Once the citizens [of Guelph-Eramosa] had their say and all the evidence had put before council, council voted to reject the project and that's what I hope will happen here.\"\"Stratford is world-renown for its theatre, its art and its beautiful setting. Stratford is not world renown for its heavy manufacturing and probably never should be.\"Donnelly said what really vexes people is the lack of clear information about the factory, not only from public officials, but from Xinyi Canada itself. He argues the company has been deliberately vague about the amount of pollution the factory would produce, saying his best guess based on what's available from the company is the facility would quadruple the city's green house gas (GHG) emissions.\"This is information that we've had to glean off the Xinyi website based on a similar sized plant located elsewhere,\" he said.\"To make float glass, you have to heat it up to an incredible temperature and basically float it on molten steel. So the energy required to heat up the thing that actually tempers the glass.\"\"So that's our estimate, four times Stratford's emissions, but Xinyi has not actually come out and told anyone what those GHG emissions will be.\"\"That, to me, in relation to Stratford's declaration of a climate emergency, that's disqualifying on its face.\" Donnelly wrote a letter to Stratford city council on December 3, outlining his clients' reasons why council should vote down the proposal.While questions over the proposed factory mount, the public may be able to get a chance to have some of those questions answered in a public forum soon. A representative from Xinyi Canada is scheduled to answer questions in an open forum with Stratford city council on December 14. \n",

      "China said Thursday its latest lunar probe has finished taking samples of the moon's surface and sealed them within the spacecraft for return to Earth, the first time such a mission has been attempted by any country in more than 40 years.The Chang'e 5, the third Chinese probe to land on the moon, is the latest in a series of increasingly ambitious missions for Beijing's space program, which also has a probe en route to Mars carrying a robot rover.The Chang'e 5 touched down Tuesday on the Sea of Storms on the moon's near side, on a mission to return lunar rocks to Earth for the first time since 1976.The probe \"has completed sampling on the moon, and the samples have been sealed within the spacecraft,\" the China National Space Administration said in a statement.Plans call for the upper stage of the probe known as the ascender to be launched back into lunar orbit to transfer the samples to a capsule for return to Earth. The timing of its return was not immediately clear and the lander can last up to one moon day, or 14 Earth days, before falling temperatures would make it inoperable.Chang'e is equipped to both scoop samples from the surface and drill two metres to retrieve materials that could provide clues into the history of the moon, Earth other planets and space features.WATCH | An animation shows how Chang'e 5 was to land on the moon and collect samples:WorldWhile retrieving samples is its main task, the lander is also equipped to extensively photograph the area surrounding its landing site, map conditions below the surface with ground-penetrating radar and analyze the lunar soil for minerals and water content.Chang'e 5's return module is supposed to touch down around the middle of December on the grasslands of Inner Mongolia, where China's crewed Shenzhou spacecraft have made their returns since China first put a person in space in 2003, becoming only the third country do so after Russia and the United States.Chang'e 5 has revived talk of China one day sending a crewed mission to the moon and possibly building a scientific base there, although no timeline has been proposed for such projects.China also launched Its first temporary orbiting laboratory in 2011 and a second in 2016. Plans call for a permanent space station after 2022, possibly to be serviced by a reusable space plane.While China is boosting co-operation with the European Space Agency and others, interactions with NASA are severely limited by concerns over the secretive nature and close military links of the Chinese program.\n",

      "A Chinese robotic probe called Chang'e 5 is on its way to the moon where it will land, scoop up samples and return them to Earth. This is the first robotic sample return mission since Russian efforts in the 1960s. Those were an effort to make their mark on the lunar surface after their manned moon program failed.When Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin made their historic landing on the moon in July 1969, a secret Russian robotic probe called Luna 15 was there at the same time. It was an attempt to grab a sample of lunar soil and return it to Earth before the American astronauts got back. The Russians had lost the race to put humans on the moon, but were trying to grab a 'first' and master the moon robotically.Unfortunately, Luna 15 crashed during it's landing attempt and the opportunity for a propaganda coup was lost. However, their Luna 16 mission did successfully return about 100 grams of lunar soil a year later and two other sample return missions succeeded in following years, with the last one, Luna 24, in 1976 — two years after the Apollo program had ended. While these robotic sample return missions did not deliver as much lunar material as the Apollo astronauts, they were considerably cheaper and part of a long history of both Russian and American robotic lunar exploration involving dozens of impactors, orbiters, landers and rovers. In a way, we're in another moon race right now that echoes the race of fifty years ago — except this time it seems the robots might be in the lead. China is using robotic landers to explore the moon, and, if all goes well, Chang'e 5 will bring back several kilograms of moon rocks. In the meantime, the U.S. is struggling to develop a far more expensive effort, relying on huge (and much delayed) rockets that will carry humans to the moon with their Artemis program. It once again brings up the question of whether humans or robots are best suited to space exploration. We debated this on a special edition of Quirks & Quarks last year.Human missions are much more expensive, and historically they are much more politically driven than robotic exploration. The decision by the Kennedy administration in 1961 to send humans to the moon was part of the Cold War competition between the U.S. and Soviet Union to prove technical superiority over one another. The current Artemis program has also been politically influenced. Originally the plan was to first build a space station called Gateway in orbit around the moon. Once it was completed, astronauts would be sent down to the surface some time later this decade. When the Trump administration came to power, the landing was pushed forward to 2024, which would have been the last year of President Trump's second term in office. The Biden administration has not said whether it will keep to that tight schedule.NASA's giant new moon rocket, the Space Launch System (SLS) is slated to make its first flight next year. In the meantime three private companies — SpaceX, Blue Origin and Dynetics — have been contracted to develop lunar landers that would ride on their own rockets. But the pace of development in these programs makes NASA's current 2024 moon landing deadline pretty ambitious.Meanwhile, China is continuing its robotic program beyond the moon with the Tianwen 1 mission currently on its way to Mars. The spacecraft includes an orbiter and a lander, which will make China the third country to make a soft landing on Mars after Russia and the U.S. This is not a sample return mission, but it is not unreasonable to think that China could apply similar technology it is using on the moon to return samples from Mars in the future.Robots have always boldly gone where no one has gone before, exploring every planet in the solar system, as well as dwarf planets, moons, asteroids and comets. They conduct the initial reconnaissance of other worlds, survey the lay of the land and choose the best landing sites for humans who follow.  A whole fleet of robots are currently flying around the solar system. Two others are on their way to Mars with the United Arab Emirates' Hope mission and NASA's Perseverance lander scheduled to arrive in February.Beyond Mars, the Japanese Hayabusa2 and American, OSIRIS-REx spacecraft are bringing home samples they collected from asteroids. NASA is planning future missions to visit Europa, a moon of Jupiter and Titan, a mysterious moon of Saturn, the only moon with a thick atmosphere and liquid methane lakes on its surface.There is no doubt it will be a dramatic moment when the next human feet step out onto lunar soil again. Human exploration of space captures the imagination of the public, provides role models for young people and tests the limits of technical, physical and psychological endurance. But humans have not gone very far. The last mission to the moon was in 1972. It will still stretch the limits of our technology to get back there almost half a century later, Meanwhile, the true explorers of space, our silent mechanical servants, will continue their more far-reaching journeys to literally reach out and touch other worlds.\n",

      "One of Canada's most controversial ex-ambassadors to China says he repeatedly tried to improve the living conditions of Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor after their imprisonment in the People's Republic almost two years ago. John McCallum also said Tuesday he regrets speaking about the October 2019 Canadian election in a meeting with Chinese officials in the months leading up to it. McCallum, the former Liberal cabinet minister who was fired as Canada's envoy to China in January 2019, was testifying at the special House of Commons committee on Canada-China relations. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau fired McCallum after he made a series of public comments that broke with the government's line following the arrests of Kovrig and Spavor. The two men were arrested nine days after Canada's arrest of Chinese high-tech scion Meng Wanzhou in December 2018 on a U.S. extradition warrant in what is widely viewed as retaliation by China. McCallum said that's when everything changed in Canada's relations with China. \"From that moment onwards, the top priority of the government and of myself as ambassador was to secure the release of the two Michaels,\" said McCallum, noting that he has been one of the few people to visit them in prison. \"On more than one occasion, I tried to convince the Chinese that if they were unable to release Kovrig and Spavor they should at least improve their living conditions. Sadly, as you all know, Canadian efforts in this area have so far been unsuccessful.\" The committee has been examining Canada's relations with China, which have plummeted to an all-time low since December 2018.Earlier Tuesday, Conservative MP Michael Chong urged Foreign Affairs Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne to adopt a more consistent approach to getting tough with China. The Conservative foreign affairs critic told Champagne during a House of Commons committee meeting Tuesday that the government needs to show Canadians how it will deal with growing Chinese intimidation of Canadians within Canada. Chong said it is inconsistent for the government to be talking tougher on China, while Canada's current ambassador, Dominic Barton, is making speeches about the need to broaden trade with the People's Republic. \"I think it needs to be a lot clearer, a lot more consistent if Canada is going to have a clear, consistent voice with respect to China on the world stage,\" said Chong. Chong sponsored a motion that won approval in the Commons last week that calls on the government to decide within 30 days whether to allow China's Huawei Technologies to supply equipment for its next generation 5G internet network. Meng is a chief executive of Huawei. Champagne replied that Canada has taken a smart and firm approach with China lately that includes speaking out against its ill treatment of pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong and of ethnic Muslim Uighurs. \"Whether it comes to the Uighurs or whether it comes to Hong Kong, I've outlined places where we're going to challenge China, places where we're going to, for example, coexist with China,\" Champagne said.\n",

      "A motion brought by CPC foreign affairs critic Michael Chong, which passed Parliament last week, gives the government 30 days to come up with a plan — like Australia's — to fight foreign (Chinese) interference and influence campaigns. What might that look like and will it come to pass?\n",

      "Some Australians see the country's new powers to stop foreign interference as an overdue shift from complacency to vigilance, while others have warned of the dangers of a McCarthyite moral panic.But all can agree that Australia's approach to foreign meddling in its politics, universities and public debate has changed a great deal in recent years.Last week, the Canadian House of Commons voted 179-146 for this country to adopt a plan similar to Australia's to counter meddling by the People's Republic of China.Experts in Canada and Australia suggest that such a change would set Canada on a much more aggressive path in countering China's inroads into this country's institutions.Conservative foreign affairs critic Michael Chong's motion requires the government to \"develop a robust plan, as Australia has done, to combat China's growing foreign operations here in Canada and its increasing intimidation of Canadians living in Canada, and table it within 30 days of the adoption of this motion.\"Chong's motion received the support of most opposition members of the House, along with Liberals Wayne Easter, Nathaniel Erskine-Smith, John McKay and Jennifer O'Connell.Chong chose Australia as a model for Canada because of a package of laws passed in 2018 in the wake of a series of revelations that brought the issue of foreign interference and espionage to the fore.Sam Dastyari was an up-and-coming Labor Party senator when the year 2018 began. By the end of it he had admitted to soliciting thousands of dollars from businesses affiliated with the Chinese Communist Party. Thousands of Australians signed petitions demanding he face charges of treason.Australian media reports on Dastyari suggested he was a good investment for China. He not only supported Beijing's claims to the South China Sea — in opposition to the official position of his Labor Party — he also worked to prevent a meeting between his party leader and a Hong Kong pro-democracy activist.Dominique Dalla-Pozza teaches at the Centre for Military and Security Law at the Australian National University in Canberra (which itself allegedly has been a target of a massive Chinese intelligence operation). She said that for the past few years, the Australian Security Intelligence Organization (the ASIO — Australia's equivalent of Canada's CSIS) has been sounding the alarm about unprecedented levels of foreign intrusion.\"ASIO said there were more foreign spies and their proxies operating in Australia than at the height of the Cold War,\" Dalla-Pozza said.In Canada, CSIS has been trying for years to draw Canadians' attention to foreign interference in everything from universities to municipal governments. Then-director Dick Fadden went public with such a warning in 2010. But Canada has seen no real legislative or organizational response.In Australia, by contrast, those warnings led the Turnbull government to introduce a new Espionage and Foreign Interference Act. Australia's laws don't single out China, the country's largest trading partner. When he introduced the bill in Parliament, then-PM Malcolm Turnbull was careful to cite other precedents, such as Russian meddling in the U.S. and French elections of 2016 and 2017. But there's no doubt in Australia about which foreign government is seen as the most active meddler. Over the last couple of months, Australia has raided the apartments of four Chinese journalists and revoked the visas of two Chinese academics.Dalla-Pozza said the law defines foreign interference as \"conduct that is engaged in concert with a foreign principal or a person that is acting on behalf of a foreign principal\" where \"the person engaging in the conduct is reckless as to whether it will influence government processes, or in other ways influence a democratic political right or duty.\"Conduct has to be covert or involve deception, or involve a person making a threat to cause serious harm, or involve a person making a threat with menaces.\"The new law produced its first arrest of a suspect two weeks ago: Di Sanh Duong, a prominent member of pro-Beijing Chinese-Australian organizations.The Turnbull government also brought in laws banning foreigners from donating to Australian politicians, placed new requirements on telecommunications companies to block foreign interference, and created a registry of critical infrastructure assets to provide more transparency on who really owns what in the country.And \"there are other mechanisms being developed in Australia that don't depend on the law,\" such as a new national coordinator, a public information campaign and a hotline, said Dalla-Pozza.\"The act prescribes in a more focused way what is foreign interference, what is espionage, what is treason,\" said Patrick Walsh, who teaches at the Australian Graduate School for Policing and Security.Walsh said one of the most significant aspects of the law is that it allows Australia to fight back outside the courts.\"The key is operational disruption of foreign interference, not just to collect information, but to disrupt it,\" he said.\"In 2019 the PM established the Counter Foreign Interference Task Force, which is an interdepartmental task force to discover, track and disrupt foreign interference. And there was $8.7 million given to this task force.\"The resources Australia devotes to this effort are not only centralized under a national coordinator, but are also far greater in terms of trained investigators than those available to the Government of Canada.Thirty days seems like a short time to design a full overhaul of Canada's approach to foreign interference, but Chong said Canada has a duty to protect people within its borders from harassment and intimidation by agents of foreign powers. \"It's long past time for the government to deal with this. Australia has already dealt with this. Our other allies have already dealt with this,\" he said. \"I note that on October 28, the FBI charged eight individuals, three of whom were Chinese citizens, for interfering and threatening American citizens through operations that are taking place on American soil.\"The motion doesn't spell out any consequences for the government if it allows the 30 days to lapse. But Chong said that would be a harmful precedent given the strong cross-party support the motion received in Parliament.\"I expect it to be carried out if the government follows democratic norms and respects the will of Parliament,\" he told CBC News. \"At a time when democracy is under pressure around the world, it's more important than ever that governments respect democratic norms.\"\n",

      "For decades, members of the Chinese Cultural Association of New Brunswick have spent Sundays together, in person, studying their language, heritage and culture.That is until the pandemic swept through and changed how they interact.It wasn't two months after the group celebrated the Chinese New Year with an annual gala on stage at The Playhouse in Fredericton that the pandemic locked down society.Kids were no longer able to meet with other kids, and adults were no longer able to teach the young generation of newcomers about their heritage.Danya Mu, president of the volunteer association, she said it has been a challenging time for the group.\"It is very important for us to keep our culture,\" Mu said. Each week, between 80 to 100 people attend Chinese school classes, organized by the group. The classes are focused on language, but there is also instruction in martial arts, dancing, choir and yoga.After a few weeks of lockdown, the group started to experiment with activities online using Zoom. \"We tried some cooking classes because it's one of the favourite things that we like to do,\" Mu said, adding that the feedback was positive.CBC News New BrunswickFollowing the success of the online cooking classes, Mu and the group started to move most of the courses online. She said it was still difficult not to be together in person, but the online classes were working, especially for teaching the language.Some courses, like martial arts, couldn't really translate online.The success of the online classes gave Mu and the group the confidence to start preparing for the Chinese New Year gala. They are planning to hold it online this year.This year's theme of the gala is \"We are family\" — a nod to the community staying together during the pandemic.Jenny Zhang, a longtime volunteer with the association, said it is important to make sure there's a show this year, even if it's not on stage.\"We put lots of effort, and the people worked together,\" Zhang said. Normally the group would start rehearsing in September for the show that is in January or early February, depending on the Chinese New Year.Instead of spending the fall rehearsing, they are busy recording sessions outdoors while the weather is still nice. On Sunday, about 20 people met at Killarney Lake, on Fredericton's north side, to film the choir singing.\"Actually, I feel very confident right now,\" Mu said after spending the morning filming a video with the choir.\"We support each other,\" she said, adding that the volunteers are learning how to make the gala online as they go. \"I think we're going to make it — I hope so,\" she said.Mu said the Chinese New Year is too important to the community to risk not having a gala, even if it's different from other years.\"It is the most traditional way we will celebrate our Chinese New Year. It's kinda the most important day for the Chinese. We want to keep that tradition.\"\n",

      "Conservative Leader Erin O'Toole said today Canada must crack down on the growing influence of the Chinese communist regime, adding there's \"no greater threat to Canada's interests than the rise of China\" in global affairs.O'Toole said the western world has tolerated China's human rights abuses, intellectual property theft and manipulative trade practices for decades in order to gain access to the country's burgeoning economy. He said it's time for Canada and its closest allies to adopt a more aggressive posture.\"The democratic world must acknowledge that the approach to China over the last two decades has not worked. In fact, the situation has gotten worse,\" O'Toole told reporters on Parliament Hill.He said the move to normalize relations and admit China to the World Trade Organization has had \"catastrophic impacts for Canadian workers.\"\"We falsely believed that ignoring the sharp edges of communism would, over time, smooth them out by putting trade ahead of our values.\"Conservative MP Michael Chong, the party's foreign affairs critic, will table a motion today to put pressure on the Liberal government to ban Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei from building Canada's 5G network. Most of the country's wireless providers have opted already to work with Sweden-based Ericsson.Huawei's founder has close ties to China's communist leadership and intelligence partners have long warned that the company's technology could be used to spy on Canadians. O'Toole said Huawei's global success is due in part to \"years of industrial espionage\" against the now-defunct Canadian tech giant Nortel.Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Tuesday the government's final decision on Huawei will be based on the recommendations of Canada's intelligence agencies. \"We've worked with our allies and we've consulted broadly,\" he said.The former director of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS), Ward Elcock, has said Huawei and all Chinese technology firms like it pose a significant risk to worldwide intelligence collection.Watch: Bains says the federal government \"will not be bullied or intimidated by any country.\":PoliticsThe Conservative motion, if passed, also would compel the Liberal government to develop a comprehensive plan to protect Canada from \"the growing influence of Chinese agents\" on our soil.O'Toole said Canada has tolerated the proliferation of Confucius Institutes — state-backed Chinese language centres — that push state propaganda.O'Toole said Canadian university professors have been bullied into weakening their teachings on human rights abuses for fear of offending mainland Chinese students, while pro-Beijing media outlets have disseminated anti-western narratives.\"Canadians of Chinese origin have been threatened by foreign agents in our country. Anti-Hong Kong protests were organized in Canada to bully democracy activists. Uighur students in our universities have been de-platformed and menaced in coordinated actions led by Chinese consulates across our country,\" he said.\"And the very values we hold dear, like openness, justice and tolerance, have been weaponized against us.\"O'Toole pointed to Australia's foreign interference law as something to emulate here. That country passed legislation in 2018 to toughen penalties on espionage while also requiring individuals or organizations acting in the interests of foreign powers to register and disclose their ties — part of an effort to reduce meddling by China in Australia's politics, universities and media.Under the legislation, it is illegal for a person to knowingly engage in covert conduct or deception on behalf of a \"foreign principal.\" The first arrest under this law was made earlier this month when a prominent Chinese-Australian community activist was accused of trying to influence the country's immigration minister.Speaking later in question period, Trudeau said Canada has a \"complex multi-dimensional relationship with China\" and the country deals with Beijing \"with eyes wide open.\"\"We will remain firm in defending our principles and interests and always will,\" he said, adding that Canada's security agencies have been working with universities and colleges to address new Chinese threats to those institutions.\"Canada has among the best security agencies in the world. The folks who work for our agencies work every single day to keep Canadians safe. Not all of it appears in the newspapers. On the contrary, a lot of the work that is done in important situations is never heard about at all,\" he said.Watch: Conservative MP Michael Chong says the federal government is \"paralyzed by indecision\" on Huawei:PoliticsAsked if passing such a motion would further damage already shaky bilateral relations between Canada and China, O'Toole said that while he's concerned about the status of two Canadians held in Chinese prisons, the current government's approach hasn't yielded results.Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor have been held in China for 708 days. \"A weak response by Mr. Trudeau has not led to any progress in the case of the two Michaels,\" O'Toole said. \"A more principled, a stronger approach may make progress.\"China has retaliated against countries that have criticized its behaviour through trade action. O'Toole said Canada shouldn't be intimidated by such threats.\"Canada should work very closely with our Five Eyes allies ... so that it's difficult for China to use its immense economic size to intimidate smaller economies like Canada,\" O'Toole said, citing the intelligence-sharing alliance between Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the U.S.\"We may be a smaller economy in comparison with China but we are a giant when it comes to the rights we hold dear, human rights, the rule of law and the security of our citizens.\"O'Toole said Canada must strengthen its relationship with other Asian economies — Canada joined the Trans-Pacific Partnership in 2017 — and bolster trade with India. \"We need to look for new markets,\" he said.The motion comes days after the House of Commons subcommittee on international human rights released a report condemning China for committing genocidal acts against the Uighur Muslim minority. Canada's ambassador to the UN, Bob Rae, said Sunday he would encourage the body's human rights committee to probe the plight of China's Uighur population.\n",

      "Ordering Chinese food for dinner would not be the same if it didn't come with some saucy ginger beef.Some say it makes the meal, so it's strange to think of a time when the dish didn't exist.And what's interesting is that the popular item didn't come from some far away part of the world — it is believed to have been created in Calgary.It is said that George Wong, a chef from northern China, invented it at the Silver Inn Restaurant on Centre Street North in Calgary in the 1970s.His daughter, Michelle Wong, says that it all started from a stir-fry beef recipe.\"Dad was trying to find some sort of recipe that would bring a little bit of the Western cuisine to Chinese cuisine,\" she told the Calgary Eyeopener.\"He kind of lightly battered the beef and tried this recipe out and that's how ginger beef was born.\"The dish became so popular that it is now available in some form all across Canada.And because of its hometown roots, restaurant reviewer Elizabeth Carson has been on a quest for the best ginger beef the city has to offer.Her judges this week are self-acclaimed ginger beef addicts Michaela Marchand and Danielle La Banc.The panel of judges set off across Calgary and rated the ginger beef at four restaurants.When trying the saucy beef, the judges looked at a variety of features for their critiques.Carson says they were looking at beef-to-batter ratio, spice and sweet level, crunch, stickiness and the presentation.4. Central Grand Restaurant — 295-1623 Centre St. N.Carson says she thinks the spice in this ginger beef tasted like cinnamon, which she wasn't a big fan of.However, she says the dish did have a solid batter-to-beef ratio.3. Ginger Beef Bistro House — 388 Country Hills Blvd. N.E. and 9629 Macleod TrailThe critic says not only were they the fastest to the table when serving the ginger beef, but that it had a good crunch.\"It had dark glossy sauce and no ginger in it, but it was way too sweet and had questionable beef-to-batter ratio.\"2. Kam Han Szechuan House — 2318 Spiller Rd. S.E.\"They had a nice kick spice level, not too sweet,\" said Carson.As well, she compliments the restaurant on having a nice beef-to-batter ratio and ginger in the sauce.1. Silver Inn Restaurant — 2702 Centre St. N.Carson says the original ginger beef spot is still the best in her books.She says their dish was not too sweet and had superb beef-to-batter ratio.\"You can see the beef and it is tender with a fabulous crunchy batter,\" she said.She says it came with a deep red hued chili oil sauce, which had a fantastic depth of flavour and a perfect heat kick.\"You gotta make your way to this mecca to get the real thing. It will be a revelation.\"Do you have favourite ginger beef that isn't on the list?

      "It's been obvious for some time that there is something weird about the way Canada approaches its relationship with China — a disconnect brought into sharp relief this week by the news that Global Affairs and the Department of National Defence were not on the same page when it came to military ties and training involving the People's Liberation Army.In some respects, the volcanic online political eruption which followed stories in The Globe and Mail and other media outlets, based on exclusive access to information documents, was predictable, as was the flurry of finger-pointing in the House of Commons on Thursday and Friday.Diplomats were alarmed when Gen. Jonathan Vance, the country's senior military commander, cancelled winter military exercises with the PLA in 2019, fretting that it might aggravate Beijing or make the lives of Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor even worse.It makes for fire-breathing memes, sizzling copy and wonderful political theatre.What's missing, though, is a recognition that Canada's policy toward a rising China has been contradictory and incoherent for almost a decade, maybe more, said Charles Burton, a political scientist at Brock University in St. Catharines, Ont. and a respected China expert at the Macdonald-Laurier Institute.\"Cabinets were always split on China, whether it's Liberal or Conservative,\" Burton said, referring to debates more than three decades ago during the government of former prime minister Brian Mulroney.It is more urgent than ever, in the context of an increasingly belligerent and assertive China, to present a united political front, he added.\"This is really about the defence of our sovereignty and security on matters over which there is consensus across the political spectrum in Canada,\" he said.Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan, in an attempt at political damage control late this week, made a point of saying that Chinese troops are no longer training for winter warfare at Garrison Petawawa, Ont.He also (rather meekly) noted that the exchange and training program with the PLA was instituted in August 2013 under the Conservatives while defence critic James Bezan, one of the most vocal and fiery opponents this week, was parliamentary secretary of defence.Bezan's retort was along the lines of that was then, this is now.\"The defence minister knows full well that the Chinese government back then and the Chinese government today are completely different,\" Bezan said during question period on Thursday.It was a different time, no question.Chinese President Xi Jinping had taken office only a few months before, and the Department of National Defence (DND) tasking order that established the exchange program, obtained by CBC News under access to information, noted that working with the PLA \"complements the Government of Canada led efforts to broaden our bilateral relationship with China.\"After years of hectoring and hammering China, the Conservatives — under former prime minister Stephen Harper — had decided that limited engagement was the way to go.And here is where Canada's curious incoherence comes into play.At precisely the moment the former chief of the defence staff, the now-retired general Tom Lawson, was penning the Canadian military's marching orders on closer cooperation with the PLA, the foreign affairs ministry — led at the time by John Baird — was firing off flares about China's unilateral declaration of an air defence zone in the East China Sea.It was a bellwether moment.\"The U.S. has indicated deep concern over the establishment of the Chinese ADIZ stating that the U.S. views this development as a destabilizing attempt to alter the status quo in the region and that this move increases the risk of misunderstanding and miscalculations,\" said a Nov. 23, 2013 briefing note to Baird, obtained by CBC News in 2017.\"More broadly, the rise of China is reshaping the strategic landscape.\"Burton said the rise of President Xi marked the beginning of the new, more aggressive China. The establishment of the air zone — now largely forgotten against a backdrop of fortified artificial islands in the South China Sea, reports of Uyghurs in concentration camps and the haze of tear gas in Hong Kong — marked the first step.So were our politicians and senior leaders paying attention not only to events, but to what other federal departments were saying?According to what former foreign affairs minister (and current finance minister) Chrystia Freeland had to say in question period this week, the answer is yes.\"I have long personal experience reporting on authoritarian communist regimes and I am very aware of the threat they pose,\" she said.Here's the question no one seemed to ask this week: why was the military exchange and training program still going on even before hostage diplomacy swept up the two Michaels?National Defence is no stranger to suspicions about China, having spent an enormous amount of time quietly defending itself from cyberattacks purportedly launched by  Beijing or by groups associated with it.The Trump administration has been tightening the screws on China from a diplomatic, security and trade perspective. There has been considerable, growing debate among Western allies — led by the Americans — about the downside of military engagement and co-operation with China, with Five Eyes intelligence partners each exchanging their own warnings — a series of discussions that eventually prompted Canada's current top military commander, Gen. Jonathan Vance, to cancel the winter warfare exercises.And then, of course, there's debate over the telecom giant Huawei and its future in this country.The signs were all there, Burton said — but no one actually woke up to the problem until Kovrig and Spavor were imprisoned. The public has been galvanized, he added, but \"it doesn't seem to have penetrated fully to the senior levels of the political and economic elite.\"Burton said that — as weird as it might sound, with everything else that has happened — he believes there are some within the Canadian Establishment who still cling to the notion that if the \"consular cases of Spavor and Kovrig are resolved, we can go back\" to business as usual.\n",

      "The remake of Mulan drew decidedly mixed reviews in China after its coronavirus-delayed release in China last week, with thousands panning it online.\n",

      "The remake of Mulan struck all the right chords to be a hit in the key Chinese market. Disney cast beloved actor Liu Yifei as Mulan and removed a dragon sidekick popular in the animated original to cater to Chinese tastes.Still, the movie drew decidedly mixed reviews after its coronavirus-delayed release in China last week, with thousands panning it online.The movie was rated 4.9 out of 10 by more than 165,000 people on Douban, a leading website for film, book and music ratings. Negative comments and jokes about the film outnumbered positive reactions on social media.Mulan has earned an estimated 198 million yuan ($39 million Cdn) since its opening last week, and was the second most watched movie in China as of Thursday, according to ticketing platform Maoyan. It scored a higher 7.5 out of 10 on Maoyan, but also with mixed reviews.\"Poor artistic level, misunderstanding of Chinese culture lead to the film's failure in China,\" the state-run Global Times newspaper tweeted.Chinese critics, both at home and abroad, said they were disappointed with the film's inaccurate and stereotypical portrayals of Chinese history and the main character, infused with nationalist tropes.Others were not as bothered.\"It's fine that different screenwriters make up different stories,\" Zhang Qin, a military veteran, said after watching the film in Beijing last week. \"They can play with imagination and it's a good thing.\"IT engineer Zhang Fan also had positive things to say about the film. \"What touched me is the humanity,\" he said.The remake of Disney's popular 1998 animation is based on the ancient tale of Hua Mulan, a young woman who takes her father's place in the army by dressing as a man.The animated version was a global hit but earned just $30 million in China, where viewers found the movie too Americanized, according to reports at the time.The original tale, The Ballad of Mulan, has gone through multiple renditions. Themes such as filial piety and being loyal to the central government have remained as core tenets, which some find outdated and problematic.\"It's a very touchy subject in modern China because a lot of people find [filial piety] very constraining, including me,\" said Xiran Jay Zhao, the Chinese Canadian author of an upcoming book about the only female emperor in China. \"It's like a moral shackle for people.\"Critics also pointed out inaccurate details such as the use of a southern-style house when Mulan is likely from the north and a depiction of \"qi\" as a magic power that only boys can wield — in Chinese philosophy, it is a force not limited by gender.Some called the makeup and costumes ugly and inauthentic.Zhao said the film comes off more like European fantasy than a Chinese story, and noted that the film's crew was mostly white, including the director, four screenwriters and costume designer.\"They didn't really get any Chinese people on the writing staff, and it really showed,\" she said.Jeannette Ng, a Chinese fantasy writer based in the United Kingdom, said the film perpetuates a narrative of China's majority Han people that assimilates and excludes minorities including ethnic Mongolians, Tibetans and Uighurs.\"The mainland Chinese people aren't the mainland Chinese viewers from 20 years ago,\" she said of the lukewarm response. \"The culture has moved on.\"Her comments mirror the latest in a series of controversies that have hit the film outside mainland China.The movie's final credits thank propaganda departments and a public security bureau in Xinjiang, where part of it was filmed.China has come under widespread criticism for detaining Uighurs and other predominantly Muslim minorities in Xinjiang as part of a campaign to snuff out sometimes-violent struggle against Chinese rule.Earlier, a boycott movement was sparked after Liu, the actor who portrays Mulan, publicly supported Hong Kong police as they battled pro-democracy protesters last year.Hong Kong resident Sarah Chan said she does not plan to see the film, which opened in her city on Thursday.\"The main actress ... supports Hong Kong police, so I don't want to watch it,\" Chan said. \"Furthermore, I think they changed the historical background of the story. It's not the same story anymore.\"Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian defended Liu last week, calling her a \"Mulan of the modern times.\"Disney did not reply to a request for comment.\n",

      "Read Story TranscriptChina's ambassador to Canada should apologize or be expelled for remarks he made about the 300,000 Canadians in Hong Kong, says a Canadian living in the semi-autonomous region. Last week, Ambassador Cong Peiwu warned the Canadian government not to grant asylum to Hong Kong residents fleeing China's controversial national security law, which bans secessionist, subversive or terrorist activities, and has been wielded against critics and protesters. China imposed the law on Hong Kong, which is supposed to have legal autonomy under the \"one country, two systems\" agreement.\"If the Canadian side really cares about the stability and the prosperity in Hong Kong, and really cares about the good health and safety of those 300,000 Canadian passport holders in Hong Kong, and the large number of Canadian companies operating in Hong Kong … you should support those efforts to fight violent crimes,\" Cong said.Canada's deputy prime minister Chrystia Freeland said the ambassador's remarks were \"not in any way in keeping with the spirit of appropriate diplomatic relations between two countries.\" Conservative Leader Erin O'Toole says that if Cong refuses to apologize, Canada should withdraw his diplomatic credentials.Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian defended Cong's remarks, saying Canadian leaders \"did not verify, but also condoned the anti-China comments spreading across the nation and made groundless accusations against China.\"Edward Chin agrees with O'Toole. He is a Canadian hedge fund manager who lives and works in Hong Kong, and a longtime activist in the Hong Kong pro-democracy movement. Here is part of his conversation with As It Happens host Carol Off. Mr. Chin, how secure do you feel as a Canadian in Hong Kong right now?I think this [statement from the ambassador] is one of the so-called wolf warrior tactics they have been using over the last couple of years. But it kind of got escalated in the last little while.Do you feel secure since these remarks on the part of the [Chinese] ambassador? Even before this gentlemen's remarks, after the [national security law] came into effect, I don't think anyone would feel secure in Hong Kong because this is exactly one country, one system now. So how can anyone feel secure in Hong Kong?Because last year, every Hong Kong person, more than two million people, came out to fight very hard [against] the extradition bill that finally got retracted. Now, this is 10 times worse. This is the nuclear option that they think of.But this seems to have been in reaction to suggestions that Canada would offer asylum to people from Hong Kong, democracy activists who are feeling threatened by the … national security law since it came into place, and that this has been the way that Hong Kong [has reacted] to Canada's offer of asylum. Does that change things?I think Canada has done the right thing to give asylum to those demonstrators who came out and [fought] for democracy, because they were fighting for their life, basically.We have to go back a few months earlier. Why do people come up and protest? Because the two systems is gone. Now, the Chinese ambassador to Canada, you know, whatever he said is threatening. Threatening. This is outrageous, honestly. I think he should be reprimanded.China's ambassador in Ottawa was … warning against the granting asylum to Hong Kong dissidents, and he said, \"If the Canadian side really cares about the stability and the prosperity in Hong Kong and really cares about the good health and safety of those 300,000 Canadian passport holders in Hong Kong and the large number of Canadian companies operating Hong Kong, you should support those efforts to fight violent crimes.\" And, of course, is referring to the national security law. Does that sound like a threat to you?Does it mean that they want to treat the Chinese-Canadians or Caucasian-Canadians in Hong Kong, just like the two Michaels, just to abduct them into China?They could just use any excuse and detain someone.I think that the Trudeau government, [Prime Minister] Justin Trudeau together with Chrystia Freeland, I think they should really have a strong statement saying, you know, like, \"This is a threat.\" Because, you know, there are a lot of mainland students studying in Canada.Canada, they don't do the same type of threat. This is something really outrageous, and only like a totalitarian regime would do that, threatening people.Chrystia Freeland has spoken out in Canada. She has said this is not in the spirit of diplomatic relations … but the Opposition is saying that the government should go further, that in fact, they should demand the ambassador either apologize or leave the country, have his credentials pulled. Do you think that Canada should go that far?The opposition party is saying the right thing. Because definitely this Chinese ambassador … should definitely apologize.The Opposition leader, I agree with him. You know, they should do something to show that Canada is not one of the weakest Five Eyes countries. Because it's perceived that way, especially in Hong Kong.You have been an activist. You have been outspoken for years, even before this national security law came into effect, and as you point out, became something where people who speak out against China could be arrested, that free speech has been criminalized.... Are you concerned that they you might be targeted by the regime right now, given what they've said about Canada?Everyone could be targetted. I mean, we as Chinese-Canadians, we are in a very awkward situation now. Ethnically, I'm Chinese, so it is embarrassing to have a Chinese ambassador to Canada saying they will do some harm to Chinese people living in Hong Kong, whether I am Canadian or not. So they're saying they want to do something bad to their own people.I don't dislike China. I think it's a great country with a great civilization. But the CCP, the Chinese Communist Party, the way they treat their own people, is very questionable.And that's why [former Chinese leader] Deng Xiaoping promised the two systems until 2047. But now we are short-changed by 27 years.Can I just ask you, finally, do you think there will be many people in Hong Kong … the activists, will they be seeking asylum? Do you think they will ask to be refugees to Canada?I don't think there will be a massive exodus. But in terms of persecution, yes, definitely. Those people living in Hong Kong, whether they are Hong Kong permanent ID card holders or anyone in Hong Kong now, their situation is the same as if they were in mainland China. There's no difference. No doubt about it.Will you ever leave Hong Kong? Do you think that's something that you might have to do?Besides my investment business in hedge funds and all my other hedges, I'm a current affairs writer, a commentator. I think I want to wait until they put a gunpoint at someone's head; and I think that would be the time that we all should leave.And if they shut down, for instance, Apple Daily or some of the internet radio, or they arrest a lot of full-time political commentators, that's the time I think a lot of people should leave, and then the whole world should talk with the CCP and confront with them in a forceful way.Written by Sheena Goodyear with files from The Associated Press.

      "The Chinese ambassador to Canada warned the Trudeau government today not to grant asylum to Hong Kong residents fleeing a widely criticized national security law imposed by Beijing.\"We strongly urge the Canadian side not (to) grant so-called political asylum to those violent criminals in Hong Kong,\" Ambassador Cong Peiwu said in a video press conference from the Chinese Embassy in Ottawa.He said that would amount to \"interference in China's domestic affairs, and certainly it will embolden those violent criminals.\"Hong Kong was supposed to operate under a \"one country, two systems\" deal after Britain handed its former colony over to Beijing in 1997 under an international agreement. But human rights and pro-democracy advocates say Beijing's new national security law is undermining freedom in what is known as the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.\"So if the Canadian side really cares about the stability and the prosperity in Hong Kong, and really cares about the good health and safety of those 300,000 Canadian passport holders in Hong Kong, and the large number of Canadian companies operating in Hong Kong SAR, you should support those efforts to fight violent crimes,\" Cong said.Cong also flatly rejected Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's assertion that China is engaging in coercive diplomacy by imprisoning two Canadian men in retaliation for the arrest of a Chinese high-tech executive on an American extradition warrant. Meng Wanzhou is living under house arrest in Vancouver while her case wends through a British Columbia court.In December 2018, China imprisoned Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor and charged them with undermining the country's national security. Cong said they are still undergoing a legal process in China but did not provide further details.He repeated his government's demand that Canada release Meng immediately but insisted her case and his government's prosecution of Kovrig and Spavor are not linked.\"We will remain absolutely committed to working with our allies to ensure that China's approach of coercive diplomacy, its arbitrary detention of two Canadian citizens, alongside other citizens of other countries around the world, is not viewed as a successful tactic by them,\" Trudeau said earlier this week as the two countries marked 50 years of relations at one of the lowest points in Canada-China bilateral relations.Cong said Canada's efforts to get other countries to join its fight for Kovrig and Spavor is \"doomed to fail.\"The European Union raised concerns about the two Canadians by name in the communique summarizing its recent summit with China.\"We oppose any remarks that interfere in our internal affairs. And I would like to point out, there is no coercive diplomacy on the Chinese side,\" Cong said.\n",

A Chinese name. To my surprise (and dismay), I realized just how much they were against this child having a Chinese name. They said the first name should be easy to pronounce.Finally, after my daughter was born on September 29, 2020, my partner Nathan and I settled on Minmin, pronounced \"Ming Ming\". The first Min means \"fall\", the second Min, \"easygoing\" and \"gentle\". It was my mom's suggestion, after she gave in to my pleas.Not only do I think it's user friendly, it's beautiful written in Chinese as 旻旼. Both words using the same two radicals (parts that form a character), just rearranged differently. The choice of my child's name is just one way I am trying to instill a sense of pride in her Chinese heritage. I want her to embrace it, even though anti-Chinese racism has been on the rise since COVID-19.My partner, Nathan, is white. He grew up on a tobacco farm in southwestern Ontario. Our baby is biracial. Throughout the pregnancy, we often talked about how she would look, how I'll manage to get her to speak Mandarin (as I am just a basic speaker myself), and the responsibility of choosing a name that would inevitably play a role in shaping her identity. But although we went ahead and named her Minmin, the current social and political climate has wedged some fear into my mind. It's not treatment from kids on the playground that worries me. It's the recent resurgence of racism that is different to the kind of intolerance I experienced as a child. Trump calls COVID-19 the \"China virus.\" And since the coronavirus outbreak, there has been widespread racism against Chinese people, since the virus originated in Wuhan, China. I hate to say it, but in this context, something as superficial as looking more \"white\" or having an English name could spare my daughter a lot of pain. While I know she could get by easier by blending in, this hate also stirred up a defiance in me that made me want to instill that pride in being Chinese even more, so she can have a bulletproof attitude, as Nathan says, and so that none of it will bother her the way it bothered me. I wasn't always called \"Lisa.\" My Chinese name is Yaxi (pronounced Ya-shee). That's what I went by as a child growing up in Hamilton, Ont. Everyone butchered it, intentionally or otherwise. Some called me \"Taxi\" or \"Yucky\". So the summer before high school, my best friend – who also had a difficult-for-North-Americans-to-pronounce name, Yiqing – and I decided to change our names. After fighting with my parents to let me change mine to \"Melanie,\" a cringe-worthy homage to Mel B of the Spice Girls, I finally relented and we went with \"Lisa,\" the English name my dad had chosen for me when I first came to Canada. Yiqing chose \"Myra.\" The name change took some getting used to, though ultimately, it made life easier. But some time after university, I started realizing just how unique my Chinese name was: Ya, the last part of my mom's name, and Xi, which means \"dawn.\" After my own experiences, and the ensuing struggle with my parents over my daughter's name, I hope Minmin will embrace it. I want her to be defiant and proud and confident. And I hope she won't take as long as I did to get there.  \n",

      "China launched its most ambitious space mission yet on Saturday, carrying its first female astronaut and two male colleagues in an attempt to dock with an orbiting module and work on board for more than a week.The Shenzhou 9 capsule lifted off as scheduled at 6:37 p.m. local time (1237 GMT) evening from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center on the edge of the Gobi Desert. All systems functioned normally and, just over 10 minutes later, it opened its solar panels and entered orbit.Female astronaut Liu Yang, 33, and two male crew members — veteran astronaut Jing Haipeng and newcomer Liu Wang — are to dock the spacecraft with a prototype space lab launched last year in a key step toward building a permanent space station.Two of the astronauts will live and work inside the module to test its life-support systems while the third will remain in the capsule to deal with any unexpected emergencies.China is hoping to join the United States and Russia as the only countries to send independently maintained space stations into orbit. It is already one of just three nations to have launched manned spacecraft on their own.Another manned mission to the module is planned for later this year, while possible future missions could include sending a man to the moon.[IMAGEGALLERY galleryid=2572 size=small]The program is a source of enormous national pride for China, reflecting its rapid economic and technological progress and ambition to rank among the world's leading nations.At a sending off ceremony for the astronauts, the ruling Communist Party's No. 2 official, Wu Bangguo, told the crew, \"The country and people await your victorious return.\"The module, called Tiangong 1, is only a prototype, and the plan is to replace it with a larger permanent space station due for completion around 2020.That station is to weigh about 60 tons, slightly smaller than NASA's Skylab of the 1970s and about one-sixth the size of the 16-nation International Space Station.China has only limited co-operation in space with other nations and its exclusion from the ISS, largely on objections from the United States, was one of the key spurs for it to pursue an independent space program 20 years ago.China first launched a man into space in 2003 followed by a two-man mission in 2005 and a three-man trip in 2008 that featured the country's first space walk.In November 2011, the unmanned Shenzhou 8 successfully docked twice with Tiangong 1 by remote control.The selection of the first female astronaut is giving the space program an additional publicity boost.\"Arranging for women astronauts to fly is not only a must for the development of human spaceflight, but also the expectation of the public,\" space program spokeswoman Wu Ping said. \"This is a landmark event.\"Speaking Friday, Liu Yang said: \"We won't let you down.

      "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/pattullo-bridge-chinese-canadian-new-name-1.5755385\n",
      "For 83 years, the Pattullo Bridge, linking Surrey and New Westminster, has carried the name of former premier Thomas 'Duff' Pattullo. But, with a new bridge in sight, a group of Chinese-Canadian veterans are calling on the government to come up with a new name representative of the diverse people living across the province.King Wan, the president of Chinese-Canadian Veterans Unit 280 said \"when premier Pattullo was running the province [in 1937], it was a very dark time for ethnic people.\"He said the name brings with it a sad and destructive past and reminds Chinese Canadians about a premier who they say wanted to block the Chinese community from making Canada its home and having the right to be franchised and able to vote.\"Perhaps we should name that bridge under a different name to honour those who came, I guess, you know, in the last century that have made a lot of contributions to the province,\" Wan said.He said it's time to put history in the past, and while he will not push to change the name of the current bridge, he'd like to see a new name on the new bridge that is set to start construction later this year.\"I'm not suggesting it be a Chinese name or whatever .. but maybe consider it being voted on by the citizens in the area,\" Wan said.New Wesminster NDP candidate Jennifer Whiteside, said she's not married to the Pattullo name for the new bridge. \"It would be entirely appropriate to look for a new name that reflects the diversity of the community, a name the community can celebrate. Yeah, I think that would be wonderful,\" Whiteside said.She said she would rely on the independent processes that exist already to address naming of major infrastructure projects, which would take into account the feelings of the community.On the other side of the Pattullo Bridge, Surrey-Whalley Liberal candidate Shaukat Khan said the name change is one he'd also support opening to consultation.\"As far as I'm concerned, we should always be engaging with our communities and taking input on all [of] the projects.Both parties are in agreement a name change wouldn't be off the table, but a consultation process would be necessary to decide the correct one.Wan said he'd like to see a vote by community members.\"A new bridge, a new beginning, a new era, it will really help strengthen our local population to be more inclusive,\" Wan said.The project for the new bridge is set to start later this year and carry through until 2023. The $1.4-billion project will see a new four-lane bridge built with wider lanes connecting Surrey and New Westminster.\n",

      "Calgary will rename James Short Park and parkade, located on the border of the city's Chinatown, because of its namesake's history of anti-Chinese racism.The park, located at 115 Fourth Avenue S.W., directly across the street from Chinatown, is currently named after Short, a lawyer, school principal and alderman who played a key role in anti-Chinese bigotry in the city in the early 1900s. \"He was one of the leaders of the anti-Chinese movement,\" said Coun. Druh Farrell, who brought the motion forward after requests from the Chinese community.\"And the fact that the park and parkade are directly across the corner … is frankly an affront to the neighbourhood of Chinatown.\"As a lawyer for the Anti-Chinese League, he petitioned city commissioners to prohibit Chinese Canadians from establishing the current location of Chinatown, claiming that Chinese residents would lower the property values.He instead pushed to segregate Chinese Calgarians as you would \"an isolated hospital.\"The motion also requests the mayor write the Calgary Board of Education to encourage the board to change the name of James Short Memorial School.\"This year Calgary Chinatown is celebrating its 110-year anniversary. Renaming the park and the parkade ... is the right approach,\" reads a letter signed by Grace Su, Terry Wong and other members of the Chinatown Business Improvement Area.\"Through research, documentation and recording this blight of history in the form of a permanent plaque is appropriate as this will ensure the history will not be forgotten and not be repeated. The selection of a new name through community engagement will allow the culture and contributions of Calgary's Chinese society to be honoured and revered respectfully.\"The Calgary Community Chinatown Association also wrote in support of the motion. A new name will be chosen with community input, with particular consideration of names recognizing historical Chinese Canadian contributions to Calgary.The motion passed 14-1, with the sole vote against, Coun. Diane Colley-Urquhart, voicing that she doesn't want the city to \"fall into cancel culture.\" Colley-Urquhart brought up a motion arising to revise the city's naming policy, to avoid names that are \"divisive in nature\" in future, and to develop a process to reevaluate requests to change current names, in consultation with the city's anti-racism committee once that committee is operational. In 2017, Calgary voted to rename Langevin Bridge as Reconciliation Bridge, replacing the name of one of the architects of the infamous residential school system. \n",

      "Hong Kong police arrested at least 60 people on suspicion of unauthorized assembly on China's National Day holiday Thursday after crowds gathered on the streets of a popular shopping district chanting pro-democracy slogans.Those arrested included two district councillors, police said in a statement posted on Facebook. They said the people were arrested after they ignored repeated warnings asking them to disperse.Online calls urged people to join protests, and crowds turned up at Hong Kong's Causeway Bay shopping district, some people chanting \"Disband the police\" and \"Liberate Hong Kong, Revolution of our time,\" a popular pro-democracy slogan that has been banned by the Hong Kong government for alleged secessionist sentiments.A heavy police presence outnumbered the protesters at the scene.WATCH | Dozens arrested in Hong Kong after anti-government protest:WorldNational Day, which celebrates the founding of the People's Republic of China, has become a day of protest in Hong Kong by those who oppose Beijing's increasing control over the semi-autonomous region. Large-scale protests are forbidden because of physical distancing restrictions due to the coronavirus.In the afternoon, police cordoned off some areas in the district and searched people on the streets. On several occasions, they unfurled warning banners that urged protesters to disperse, saying they were participating in an illegal assembly.Protests against the Hong Kong and mainland Chinese governments swelled last year, and Beijing clamped down on expressions of anti-government sentiment in the city with a new national security law that took effect June 30.The law outlaws subversive, secessionist and terrorist activity, as well as collusion with foreign powers to interfere in the city's internal affairs. The U.S. and Britain accuse China of infringing on the city's freedoms, and the U.S. has imposed sanctions on government officials in Hong Kong and China over the law.At a National Day reception, Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam said \"stability has been restored to society while national security has been safeguarded\" under the new law.Lam also accused some foreign governments of holding \"double standards\" and levelling unjustified accusations against the authorities who implement the new law.\n",

      "Executives of the Chinese infant formula manufacturer that’s building a new $332 million plant in Kingston, Ont. contacted Canadian officials to complain about the new NAFTA agreement within days of the agreement being reached — and asked for help in mitigating the harm caused by Canada's concessions.\n",

      "Less than three weeks after talks concluded on the revised North American free trade agreement, executives from a Chinese infant formula manufacturer that had invested $332 million to build a new plant in Kingston, Ont. asked for a sudden meeting with Canadian officials.Zhiwen Yang, the general manager of Canada Royal Milk — the Canadian subsidiary of China Feihe Limited — wrote to then-Agriculture Minister Lawrence MacAulay and the Liberal MP for Kingston and the Islands, Mark Gerretsen, describing how Canada's concessions in the Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement (CUSMA) put his business plans in jeopardy by limiting how much cow's milk formula it can export and dismantling the dairy ingredient pricing system.Yang asked the federal government to \"mitigate the risks to the project.\" His three-page letters, dated Oct. 16, 2018, were released to CBC News under the Access to Information Act.A few days later, Feihe International Inc. \"respectfully\" asked the president of the Canadian Food Inspection Agency and another senior government official to meet for 90 minutes on Oct. 29 with Yang and his boss, Feihe International chair Youbin Leng, who was travelling to Canada with his directors of research and regulatory affairs.\"The purpose of the meeting is to discuss the regulatory framework in China and explore how we can work together. The expectation is not for a decision to be made, but to begin a conversation,\" said the email from Carey Bidtnes, Canada Royal Milk's human resources manager, who was part of the team that worked on bringing this investment to Canada during her previous employment with the Kingston Economic Development Corporation. Bidtnes said that Canada Royal Milk was working with Health Canada and the CFIA to \"resolve a challenge\" with exporting its formula.The documents reveal that the financial stakes for Feihe were higher by the fall of 2018 than they were in 2017, when CBC News reported on the potential international trade issues triggered by Feihe's plans to export the vast majority of the infant formula it manufactures in Canada back to Chinese consumers.As construction began, the Chinese investment was pegged at $225 million. A year later, the investment was estimated at $332 million and project proponents were predicting it would bring 277 direct full-time jobs to the region once production ramps up. A further 300 construction jobs have been created in the Kingston area and the plant is expected to generate the equivalent of over 1,000 more jobs in its eventual supply chain.Chinese companies have a deeper relationship with China's central government than private sector firms in North America do with their own national governments. Feihe is listed on the Hong Kong stock exchange, but its subsidiary, Canada Royal Milk, is incorporated in Canada.The investment — the largest foreign direct investment in Ontario agriculture in the last decade — was finalized with officials from the Canadian Dairy Commission during a 2016 visit to Canada by Chinese Premier Li Keqiang.American officials were monitoring this Chinese investment. President Donald Trump — and the powerful U.S. farm lobby — regard Canada's supply management system as \"unfair\" because it blocks most American dairy from Canada's domestic market.In the CUSMA, Canada agreed to several concessions that harm its dairy industry — including strict limits, enforced by new export charges, on international exports of infant formula and skim milk.CUSMA's export limit for cow's milk formula is lower than what Feihe originally planned to produce in Kingston, according to a presentation obtained three years ago by CBC News.Newly released government talking points say Canadian negotiators \"were in contact with a number of individuals with direct knowledge of the proposed facility's operations,\" including the Kingston Economic Development Corporation, \"to ensure negotiators had a thorough understanding of the intended operation … with a view to avoiding unintended impacts.\"It's the same response CBC News got in 2018 when it asked whether Canada's NAFTA renegotiation team spoke directly to Feihe about its plans before signing off.Another concession Canada agreed to in the CUSMA talks dismantled part of its dairy pricing regime, ending lower ingredient pricing that kept processors competitive. Canada's prices are now based on American rates.When Feihe agreed to invest in Ontario, Canada's lower ingredient price was part of its forecasts.Xinhua, the Chinese news agency, reported that then-foreign affairs minister Chrystia Freeland spoke to Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi to brief him within days of concluding CUSMA negotiations.But if the two ministers discussed the dairy concessions, they apparently didn't resolve the manufacturer's concerns because the documents show that, within days of that conversation, Feihe began its own outreach to the Canadian government.Earlier presentations of Canada Royal Milk's business plans didn't mention producing and exporting skim milk powder for the adult market. But this letter to MacAulay said the company would produce skim powder for export during a \"ramp up\" period of testing the new facility. Canada already has a significant surplus of skim milk powder, left over after meeting Canada's strong demand for butter. Making baby formula at this new plant was supposed to help use up this surplus, not exacerbate it.The global market for skim is crowded and ultra-competitive, with American farmers hostile to any threats. Under the World Trade Organization's Nairobi Agreement, Canada agreed to stop exporting skim milk products as of January 2021.\"The export cap is a very serious issue for the operations of the company for 2019 and 2020,\" the letter from general manager Yang to then-minister MacAulay said, \"and we believe it will hinder the growth of the entire industry in the future.\"In its correspondence, Feihe asked for assurances that its facility had the support of all levels of government. It also requested \"reasonable quota\" so it could take maximum advantage of the tariff-free exports that would be allowed under the CUSMA, including a \"guarantee that the full annual export quota for infant formula would be assigned to Canada Royal Milk.\"Canada is allocating its export quota for skim milk powder based on processors' past production. But for infant formula, export quota was distributed according to planned production — presumably to accommodate the new plant coming online.\"Currently, details on which entities have received an allocation for the dairy export thresholds are not public,\" Jean-Sébastien Comeau, a spokesperson for Agriculture Minister Marie-Claude Bibeau, told CBC News.In a question redacted from one document released to CBC News but repeated without redaction in another, Yang also asked the government if it would \"take steps to limit the licensing of new infant formula manufacturing in Canada.\"While that appears to be anti-competitive behaviour, no other Canadian dairy processor has shown interest in making infant formula in recent years — which is why Canada pursued the Chinese investment in the first place.On the demise of ingredient pricing, \"it's unclear how this will impact our operations in the medium to long term,\" Yang's letter to MacAulay said.\"Our team has already been contacted by U.S. dairy producers who are eager to sell their products to us,\" the letter continues.\"What has the government proposed to assist dairy processors to overcome the loss of [ingredient] pricing?\"The letter sent to MP Gerretsen repeated the same demands.Although Bibeau announced funding for dairy producers harmed by trade deals with the European Union and Pacific Rim countries in the days leading up to the 2019 federal election, the industry is still waiting for the compensation it was promised when NAFTA was replaced.It's unclear whether Canada Royal Milk would be eligible for compensation but the Chinese investment has qualified for other federal and provincial support programs.If Feihe believes its investment was harmed by Canada's concessions, it could sue for damages under the 2012 Canada–China Foreign Investor Protection Agreement, which was negotiated by the previous Conservative government.\"The sued country can opt not to make public anything until an arbitration award,\" Osgoode Hall law professor and investment treaty specialist Gus Van Harten said, noting this agreement is unique in this regard.International Trade Minister Mary Ng's spokesperson Ryan Nearing said \"there has been no dispute launched against Canada under the Canada-China FIPA to date, nor notification of an intention to do so.\"In an interview with CBC, MP Gerretsen said he passed on the requests he received from the company to officials at Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada. But he said the only formal encounter he's had with Canada Royal Milk was a tour of the construction site in his riding earlier in 2018.\"A number of the issues that were in their letter I believe have been addressed,\" he said.In departmental email, one bureaucrat called Yang's correspondence \"an interesting letter indeed.\"Before federal government officials met with the Chinese, two senior officials from Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's office, Brian Clow and Simon Beauchemin, joined an \"urgent briefing\" with MacAulay's office — an \"additional twist,\" another bureaucrat called it.\"The Chairman is in Canada in the context of making more investment,\" a senior official said. The request to meet with the president of the CFIA was \"in the context of the application for export,\" he said, \"which may not be the full reality.\"Comeau, Bibeau's spokesperson, tells CBC the Kingston facility now has its licence to export from the CFIA.The Canadian Dairy Commission originally hoped an investor like Feihe could build a second facility, perhaps in Western Canada. But now, the government \"is not in discussion with Canada Royal Milk about additional future investments,\" Comeau said.Earlier plans obtained by CBC News suggested Kingston facility would be exporting by now. Bidtnes told CBC News its production lines are complete and it is pleased with the results of its test batches.\"Timelines for beginning commercial production have been stretched into the fall due to the impact of COVID-19 on some regulatory processes,\" she said, adding that the company remains \"confident in our business plans and the support we have received from all levels of government.\"\n",

      "Kazakhstan's health officials on Friday dismissed a Chinese claim that the Central Asian country is facing an outbreak of pneumonia more deadly than the new coronavirus.The Kazakh denial follows a notice issued Thursday by the Chinese Embassy that warned its citizens about an outbreak of pneumonia in the ex-Soviet nation with a death rate higher than that from coronavirus-induced pneumonia.\"This information doesn't conform to reality,\" Kazakhstan's Health Ministry said in a statement.It said that the country's statistics on pneumonia include patients who tested negative for the coronavirus but had symptoms compatible with the COVID-19 illness.According to official data, the number of pneumonia cases has increased by 55 per cent in the first half of the year, compared with the same period in 2019 — from 63,436 to 98,546.However, Health Minister Alexei Tsoi said at a briefing Thursday, mortality from pneumonia this year fell from last year's levels — from 1,780 deaths in the first half of 2019 to 1,172 in the first half of 2020.The ministry said its tallies of bacterial, fungal and viral pneumonia infections, which also included cases of unclear causes, were in line with World Health Organization guidelines.The energy-rich Central Asian nation quickly introduced regional lockdown and travel restrictions to stem the COVID-19 pandemic, but it has faced a rise in infections after it lifted the restrictions in May.In late June, Kazakh President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev fired the nation's health minister, blaming him for flaws that helped trigger a second wave of contagion.Kazakh authorities have imposed a two-week nationwide lockdown starting Sunday to contain the COVID-19 outbreak.The country so far has registered over 53,000 cases, including 264 deaths.Asked to comment on Kazakhstan's denial of the Chinese Embassy's claim, China's Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian refrained from comment, saying that Beijing hopes to receive more information.\"China looks forward to continuing co-operation with Kazakhstan to jointly fight the epidemic and safeguard public health in both countries,\" he said.WATCH | Pneumonia in Kazakhstan likely related to COVID-19: WHOMike Ryan, head of the WHO's emergencies program, told journalists on Friday that the cases in Kazakhstan are on WHO's radar.Given the country's surge in COVID-19 cases in the last seven days, there's a likely explanation, he said.\"The upward trajectory of COVID-19 in the country would suggest that many of these cases are in fact undiagnosed cases of COVID-19,\" Ryan said.Ryan said WHO is keeping an open mind and teams will checks for false negative COVID-19 tests and X-ray patterns.Clusters of atypical pneumonia can occur at any time from other causes such as bacteria that present as Legionnaires' disease or influenza.\n",

      "Taiwan's air force scrambled jets for a second consecutive day on Saturday as multiple Chinese aircraft approached the island and crossed the sensitive midline of the Taiwan Strait, with the island's government urging Beijing to \"pull back from the edge.\"Taiwan's defence ministry said 19 Chinese aircraft were involved, one more than in the previous day, with some crossing the Taiwan Strait midline and others flying into Taiwan's air defence identification zone off its southwest coast.It said China, which claims democratic Taiwan as its own territory, sent 12 J-16 fighters, two J-10 fighters, two J-11 fighters, two H-6 bombers and one Y-8 anti-submarine aircraft. According to a map the ministry provided, none got close to mainland Taiwan itself or flew over it.\"ROCAF scrambled fighters, and deployed air defence missile system to monitor the activities,\" the ministry said in a tweet, referring to the Republic of China Air Force, the formal name of Taiwan's air force.Taiwan has complained of repeated incidents of Chinese aircraft near the island this year, and has regularly had to scramble its F-16s and other jets to intercept them.China had on Friday announced at a news conference in Beijing about China's UN peacekeeping efforts combat drills near the Taiwan Strait, and denounced what it called collusion between the island and the United States.U.S. Undersecretary for Economic Affairs Keith Krach arrived in Taipei on Thursday for a three-day visit, the most senior State Department official to come to Taiwan in four decades, angering China. He left Saturday afternoon, according to Taiwan's foreign ministry.Taiwan's defence ministry, in a separate statement, said China was carrying out provocative activities, seriously damaging peace and stability.\"The defence ministry sternly condemns this, and calls on the mainland authorities to control themselves and pull back from the edge.\"China's widely read state-backed tabloid the Global Times, published by the ruling Communist Party's official People's Daily, said in a Saturday editorial that Friday's drills were a rehearsal to take over Taiwan.\"The U.S. and Taiwan must not misjudge the situation, or believe the exercise is a bluff. Should they continue to make provocations, a war will inevitably break out,\" it said.Both sides need to resume dialogue to reduce the risk of war, Johnny Chiang, leader of Taiwan's main opposition party the Kuomintang, wrote on his Facebook page.\"People who are willing to play a communication role are stigmatized and people who clamour for war are regarded as heroes. Such an atmosphere is definitely not conducive to the peaceful and stable development of the Taiwan Strait,\" said Chiang, whose party traditionally favours close ties with China.Life has continued as normal in Taiwan with no sign of panic. The island has long been accustomed to living with Chinese threats.Taiwan's people have shown no interest in being ruled by autocratic China, re-electing President Tsai Ing-wen in a landslide last year on what was largely a platform of standing up to Beijing.The latest Chinese flights came the same day Taiwan held a memorial service for former president Lee Teng-hui, dubbed \"Mr. Democracy\" for ending autocratic rule in favour of free elections and championing Taiwan's separate identity from China.Lee, who died in July, became Taiwan's first democratically elected president in March 1996 after eight months of intimidating war games and missile tests by China in waters around the island.Those events brought China and Taiwan to the verge of conflict, prompting the United States to send an aircraft carrier task force to the area in a warning to Beijing's government.\n",

      "Taiwan scrambled fighter jets on Friday as multiple Chinese aircraft buzzed the island, including crossing the sensitive mid-line of the Taiwan Strait, in an escalation of tensions the same day a senior U.S. official began meetings in Taipei.Earlier on Friday, China's Defence Ministry announced the start of combat drills near the Taiwan Strait, denouncing what it called collusion between the Chinese-claimed island and the United States.U.S. Undersecretary for Economic Affairs Keith Krach arrived in Taipei on Thursday for a three-day visit, the most senior State Department official to come to Taiwan in four decades.Beijing has watched with growing alarm the ever-closer relationship between Taipei and Washington, and has stepped up military exercises near the island, including two days of mass air and sea drills last week.Taiwan's defence ministry said 18 Chinese aircraft were involved on Friday, a far larger number than Taiwan has previously announced for such encounters.\"Sep. 18, two H-6 bombers, eight J-16 fighters, four J-10 fighters and four J-11 fighters crossed the midline of the TaiwanStrait and entered Taiwan's southwest ADIZ,\" the ministry said in an English-language statement on Twitter.\"ROCAF scrambled fighters, and deployed air defence missile system to monitor the activities,\" it added, referring to Taiwan's air force.The ministry showed a map of the flight paths of the Chinese jets and their crossing of the Taiwan Strait mid-line, which normally combat aircraft from both sides avoid passing through.Taiwan's Liberty Times newspaper said Taiwan air force jets scrambled 17 times on Friday morning over four hours, warning China's air force to stay away.It also showed a picture of missiles being loaded onto an F-16 at the Hualien air base on Taiwan's east coast.In Beijing, Chinese Defence Ministry spokesman Ren Guoqiang said Friday's drills, about which he gave no details, involved the People's Liberation Army's eastern theatre command.\"They are a reasonable, necessary action aimed at the current situation in the Taiwan Strait and protecting national sovereignty and territorial integrity,\" Ren said.Taiwan is a purely internal Chinese affair that brooks no foreign interference, he added.\"Recently the United States and Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) authorities have stepped up their collusion, frequently creating disturbances,\" Ren said, referring to Taiwan's ruling party.Trying to \"use Taiwan to control China\" or \"rely on foreigners to build oneself up\" is wishful thinking and doomed to be a dead end, he added.\"Those who play with fire will get burnt,\" he said.Hu Xijin, editor of China's widely read state-backed Global Times tabloid, wrote on his Weibo microblog that the drills were preparation for an attack on Taiwan should the need arise, and that they were valuable experience, enabling gathering of intelligence about Taiwan's defensive systems.\"If the U.S. secretary of state or defence secretary visits Taiwan, People's Liberation Army fighters should fly over Taiwan island, and directly exercise in the skies above it,\" he added.China had threatened to make a \"necessary response\" to Krach's trip, straining already poor ties between Beijing and both Taipei and Washington. Sino-U.S. relations have plummeted ahead of November's U.S. presidential election.Chinese fighter jets briefly crossed the mid-line of the Taiwan Strait last month as the U.S. Health Secretary Alex Azar was in Taipei, and last week China carried out two days of large-scale drills off Taiwan's southwestern coast.The United States, like most countries, only has official ties with China, not Taiwan, though Washington is the island's main arms supplier and most important international backer.This week, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations had lunch with Taiwan's top envoy in New York. China's U.N. mission said it had lodged \"stern representations\" over the meeting.\n",

      "Actor John Boyega stepped down from his role as a global ambassador for perfume brand Jo Malone on Monday after the company decided to hire a Chinese actor to replace him in an ad he created.The Star Wars star, who is Black, wrote on Twitter that the brand's decision to \"replace my campaign in China by using my concepts and substituting a local brand ambassador for me, without either my consent or prior notice, was wrong.\"Jo Malone, an upscale British perfume brand owned by Estée Lauder, has said that replacing Boyega with Chinese star Liu Haoran in the ad campaign was a misstep. It has removed the ad and apologized.The original ad starring Boyega, 28, aired last year and was called The London Gent. It features the London-born actor walking around the neighbourhood where he grew up and riding a horse in a park, and it makes reference to his Nigerian heritage in a scene featuring West African attire.\"The film celebrated my personal story — showcasing my hometown, including my friends and featuring my family,\" Boyega wrote.Their decision to replace my campaign in China by using my concepts and substituting a local brand ambassador for me, without either my consent or prior notice, was wrong. The film celebrated my personal story– showcasing my hometown, including my friends and featuring my family.\"While many brands understandably use a variety of global and local ambassadors, dismissively trading out one's culture this way is not something I can condone.\"It's not the first time Boyega has been deleted from a China-based ad. He played a leading role as Finn in 2015's Star Wars: The Force Awakens, but he and other nonwhite characters were removed or diminished from a Chinese poster for the movie.In an interview with GQ magazine, Boyega recently said that Black characters have been \"pushed to the side\" in Disney's Star Wars franchise. In June, the star made an emotional speech on racism when he joined Black Lives Matter protests in London.  \n",

      "An anonymous collector has bought a Chinese oil painting in Hong Kongfor the equivalent of $7.8 million Cdn, setting a record price ever paid for such a work of art.Slave and Lion was sold at a Christie's auction on Sunday. The price exceeds a benchmark set only last month for Chinese oil paintings when Danshui by Taiwanese artist Chen Chengbo fetched more than $5 million at a Sotheby's event.Xu Beihong created Slave and Lion during his stay in Berlin during the early 1920s. It depicts the story of Roman slave Androclus, who pulled thorn from a lion's paw. His act of kindness inspires the Roman emperor to free him.The work blends Western form and subject with Chinese line drawing touches.Five months ago, another Xu painting— Silly Old Man Moves a Mountain— sold in Beijing for $4.35 million.Christie's sale of more than 2,000 Chinese works of art and objects from the 20th Century was a goldmine, with buyers and collectors snapping up pieces beyond their estimated bid price.Another major work, Potted Chrysanthemum in a Blue and White Jardiniere by Sanyu, went for $4.25 million.Ken Yeh, the deputy chairman of Christie's Asia, said there's pent-up demand for art from the new wealthy class in Asia, whose bank accounts are brimming with cash from a bullish stock market.\"There's just too much money around. People are just eager to buy,\" Yeh said prior to Sunday's bidding.He added thatthe newly-rich see art as a valuable asset.Last week, Hong Kong real estate tycoon Joseph Lau, paid $17.4 million for pop artist Andy Warhol's iconic portrait of China's Mao Zedong.Yeh said at least one out of four buyers at Christie's auctions are Chinese and that number is rising.Christie's estimates Hong Kong is the world's third most important art market after New York and London.\n",

      "Communist Party media in China rebuked and threatened Nova Scotia lobster shippers this week for expressing concerns over new roadblocks to getting products into China.The party tabloid Global Times says recent border measures are about food safety after a COVID-19 outbreak was linked to a Beijing food market, \"rather than an excuse to target any specific country.\"\"It's Canada's choice to export to China, and Canada needs to abide by Chinese regulations, which may be adjusted when necessary in accordance with the COVID-19 situation,\" Bai Ming, a research fellow at the Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Co-operation, told the Global Times on Monday.The tabloid, known for its nationalist tone on international issues, discounted complaints raised by Canadian lobster shippers quoted in CBC News reporting.It also linked the issue to the arrest in Canada and ongoing extradition proceedings against Huawei chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou.\"Experts warned that the Canadian side should be fully aware that its attitude in Meng's case is the only roadblock between the two countries,\" it said. \"If the Canadian side does not remove it, a disruption in the lobster trade might be just the tip of the iceberg in bilateral trade, as fraught ties have already undermined confidence in business communities on both sides.\"Chinese authorities began random testing of imported food after a COVID-19 outbreak earlier this month was traced to a cutting board used on imported Atlantic salmon at the Xinfadi market in Beijing.Live lobster shipments from Canada, valued at $457 million last year, were particularly vulnerable.Most of that lobster comes from Nova Scotia, which has seen its sales in China soar in recent years.After the inspections started, some Nova Scotia companies cancelled live shipments rather than risk delays of up to 36 hours waiting for test results when the perishable product arrives.Exporters must now also sign a Chinese customs declaration assuming liability if COVID-19 is detected.Obsorne Burke of Victoria Co-op Fisheries in Cape Breton, which ships frozen lobster to China, refused to sign.He's leery of the Chinese legal system and dubious about the risk of the coronavirus, citing public health agencies in Canada and elsewhere that say there is no scientific evidence the virus is transmitted by food or food packaging.\"We have to take a stand or push back and say this does not make any scientific sense,\" he said.The Global Times said exporters should get over it.\"The newly adopted requirements for coronavirus-free declarations apply to all suppliers across the world and all food products,\" it said in a front page editorial this week, one of two articles devoted to the issue of Canadian lobster shipments.The tabloid hit back at reaction from Canadian lobster exporters quoted by CBC.\"A major Chinese salmon importer told the Global Times on Monday that all of its suppliers are co-operative and willing to sign the declaration as they 'want to do business with China,'\" Global Times reported.\"The company said, compared with Canada, it prefers to do business with countries like Chile, which has a mature, industrialized industry chain and is also co-operative with and respectful of Chinese regulations.\"The question of whether lobster shippers should sign a declaration that assumes some form of liability for COVID-19 in China has split the Nova Scotia lobster industry.Some exporters have agreed to sign the declaration, others have not.The Nova Scotia Seafood Alliance has lawyers from the Atlantic Canadian law firm Cox Palmer reviewing the document and drafting a declaration shippers could send to customers in China that asserts the safety of the product without assuming liability.  The industry group says there is no consensus among members at this point for a unified response.The Global Times article challenged those who have opted not to sign.\"Since the Canadian exporters are so confident about their management, why don't they have the courage to sign the declaration,\" Bai asked, noting that Canada ought to understand, \"China has such a regulation only because there is a risk of the virus spreading.\"The Trudeau government avoided taking a stand when asked by the Nova Scotia government whether exporters should sign the declaration.Global Affairs Canada said since the customs demand was delivered by Chinese companies \"to the industry from industry,\" the Canadian Food Inspection Agency is leaving it to individual exporters to decide whether they sign.\"It's absolutely not acceptable,\" said Chris d'Entremont, a Nova Scotia Conservative Member of Parliament.D'Entremont said the federal government should explain to industry exactly what accepting liability might mean.\"We should be understanding through CFIA what exactly the implications are going to be here. To accept a certain liability is one thing on your product, but a liability for the spread of a virus is something completely different. I think this is a humongous overreach by China,\" he said.The Chinese embassy in Ottawa did not respond to a request for comment from CBC News.\n",

      "Police are investigating a possible hate crime after racist graffiti was spray painted on a wall at the Chinese Consulate in downtown Calgary early Wednesday.Three people dressed in black and wearing masks approached the building on Sixth Avenue S.W. at 3:30 a.m., and spray painted a vulgar message before leaving, police said.It was the second time this month the consulate has been targeted with graffiti. Another message was spray painted in front of the building on May 19.The Chinese Consulate General turned over surveillance video captured by closed-circuit TV to police, who have released images of the suspects.The graffiti included the phrase \"China Virus.\" There have been reports of increased racism and hate-motivated crimes targeting the Chinese community and people of Asian descent during the coronavirus pandemic.\"The pandemic has led to a lot of political debate and strong views, and people are obviously free to hold whatever view they wish,\" said Const. Craig Collins, hate crimes co-ordinator with the Calgary police. \"But when people are targeting others for ill treatment or committing crimes because of those views, we have a duty to get involved.\"Police said there has been a slight increase in incidents targeting those groups.\"Generally, we have not seen the same spike in hate crimes that some other areas have seen,\" Collins said. \"But we are hearing from the Chinese community that they are concerned about growing hostility, so we are monitoring it closely.\"Police said hate-motivated crimes are crimes where the offender was motivated by bias, prejudice or hate based on certain personal characteristics of the victim, like race. Hate as a motivation is considered after a person is found guilty, during sentencing.The consulate said in a statement that it strongly condemns the insult and threat, which it said violate both international and Canadian laws.\"The Consulate General encourages the police to solve this case as soon as possible, and take necessary measures to better protect the safety and dignity of the Consulate, its staff and its properties,\" a consulate spokesperson said in an emailed statement.\n",
