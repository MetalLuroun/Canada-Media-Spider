Canada's ties to China's military underscore the weird contradictions in its foreign policy | CBC News,It's been obvious for some time that there is something a little weird about the way Canada approaches its relationship with China — a disconnect brought into sharp relief this week by the news that Global Affairs and the Department of National Defence were not the same page when it came to military ties and training involving the People’s Liberation Army.,2020-12-12T09:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canada-china-pla-peoples-liberation-army-1.5838658,Not Text Type

"Yellowknife Chinese Association launches website, welcomes members | CBC News","'We’re Chinese,' says founding member Frank Fu. 'We need a voice, we need to tell people that we have our own culture.'",2020-12-08T15:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/yellowknife-chinese-association-1.5832028,"When Frank Fu moved to Yellowknife last October, he was all alone. ""It was very cold and a lot of snow,"" he recalls. Fu had moved to Yellowknife from Beijing under the N.W.T.'s Nominee Program, which invites people willing to invest at least $300,000 in a business to work toward permanent residency. The plan was to set up an apartment and a business, and his wife and two young children would follow. Fu spent his first two weeks in his apartment before venturing out to the grocery store, feeling very ""lonely."" Though he speaks English proficiently, he made his first close friends at a Chinese New Year celebration at the legislative assembly the following February. That's when he began to get the idea to create a formal group to help people like himself. This fall, he helped launch the Yellowknife Chinese Association with 10 board members and 24 members. The goals are to support newcomers, promote Chinese culture and language, and to give back to the community. ""We're Chinese,"" Fu said. ""We need a voice, we need to tell people that we have our own culture."" Fu had spent 20 years working for IBM in China. He now owns the security camera business, Intellibroad, in Yellowknife. He's still working on the association's new website. Angela Law is another founding board member. She moved to Yellowknife from Vancouver in 2002, but is originally from Hong Kong. Law and her family run Yellowknife Tours, the first company dedicated to bringing Chinese tourists to see the aurora. Law said previous generations of Chinese immigrants often had no time to organize societies: they were busy running businesses — often restaurants — working ""day and night."" ""I thought that this is the time because there are so many Chinese investors here,"" Law said.Law and Fu estimate there are around 200 Chinese people in the N.W.T., though both believe more will follow.  ""Language is a big barrier,"" for newcomers, Law said. She wants to help connect new immigrants to those with experience in Canada. The group's website will also share information useful to potential investors, such as the recent story about a lawsuit between a Chinese investor and a Yellowknife-based business partner, which the board has already discussed.""If these people [investors] want to know something about Yellowknife life here, then if they find us, then maybe this is also a channel for them to get someone who is living here and share the experience,"" said Law. The group hopes to mark their first event with a Spring Lantern festival, which they liken to a kind of Chinese Valentine's day, held 15 days after the Chinese lunar New Year. They hope to place red lanterns along Franklin Avenue and, pandemic permitting, hold some kind of event to celebrate. They also hope to launch classes or events for those who want to learn or improve their Chinese language skills. Members from mainland China, Taiwan and Hong Kong are all welcome to join the association. But the most important thing for now may be the social connections. While Fu was planning for his wife and children, ages 10 and three, to move to Yellowknife with him, the novel coronavirus arrived before they did. Fu now expects they won't move here until late in 2021, after the vaccine has been widely disseminated and it's safe to travel.  ""Right now, it's good because I have a lot of friends and I have a business to operate,"" Fu said.""And we have YKCA to work on and it's very exciting, so I'm OK. I'm good here."""
"As angry protests continue over Chinese glass factory, Statford's mayor voices his regrets | CBC News","Stratford Mayor Dan Mathieson says if he could do it over again, he wouldn't have asked Municipal Affairs and Housing Minister Steve Clark for a special order, paving the way for a Chinese company to build a proposed factory on his community's rim.",2020-12-08T09:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/london/stratford-glass-factory-xinyi-1.5831901,"As angry protests continue outside city hall, Stratford Mayor Dan Mathieson is expressing his regret over the decision to ask the province for a special order, clearing legal hurdles for a proposed Chinese-owned glass factory to be built on the community's border. ""Absolutely. Seeing the challenge it has brought to the community, there's some concern around it ... I think it's safe to say we would probably love to rewind and work at this again.""While he regrets the decision, Mathieson told CBC News Monday that he cannot discuss the reasons why it was made, citing confidentiality. ""I'm not at liberty to disclose them because they're covered under a confidentiality agreement, but I can say that council, we're looking at this,"" he said.""I'm sure everyone would have like to have this done differently.""  Mathieson formally asked the province for what's known as a minister's zoning order, or MZO; three times since 2018. The power allows the minister to issue a decree on a piece of land that can't be appealed by community groups or Ontario's Local Planning Appeal Tribunal.Opposition groups have called the tactic ""anti-democratic,"" saying it unfairly circumvents the local decision-making process and was used in an effort to quash opposition to a factory critics worry would potentially pollute the community's air and waterways. The simmering public anger could be seen on display outside city hall each Monday for the past few weeks, with dozens of demonstrators waving placards to express their frustration and opposition to the proposed factory. On Monday, Mathieson acknowledged their frustration but also appealed to their civility, asking those who oppose the project to take on a more respectful tone in disagreeing with the decisions he's made. ""I appreciate that people are angry. I would ask them if they're frustrated to clearly articulate their opinion in a thoughtful way and be respectful. Making accusations, raising insults never helps a process move forward.""Get Concerned Stratford, one of two opposition groups formed to oppose the factory coming to town, has retained the services of David Donnelly, the Toronto environmental lawyer who helped a similar group stop Xinyi Canada from bringing a similar proposal to the township of Guelph-Eramosa. ""Once the citizens [of Guelph-Eramosa] had their say and all the evidence had put before council, council voted to reject the project and that's what I hope will happen here.""""Stratford is world-renown for its theatre, its art and its beautiful setting. Stratford is not world renown for its heavy manufacturing and probably never should be.""Donnelly said what really vexes people is the lack of clear information about the factory, not only from public officials, but from Xinyi Canada itself. He argues the company has been deliberately vague about the amount of pollution the factory would produce, saying his best guess based on what's available from the company is the facility would quadruple the city's green house gas (GHG) emissions.""This is information that we've had to glean off the Xinyi website based on a similar sized plant located elsewhere,"" he said.""To make float glass, you have to heat it up to an incredible temperature and basically float it on molten steel. So the energy required to heat up the thing that actually tempers the glass.""""So that's our estimate, four times Stratford's emissions, but Xinyi has not actually come out and told anyone what those GHG emissions will be.""""That, to me, in relation to Stratford's declaration of a climate emergency, that's disqualifying on its face."" Donnelly wrote a letter to Stratford city council on December 3, outlining his clients' reasons why council should vote down the proposal.While questions over the proposed factory mount, the public may be able to get a chance to have some of those questions answered in a public forum soon. A representative from Xinyi Canada is scheduled to answer questions in an open forum with Stratford city council on December 14. "
Chinese spacecraft has fresh moon rock samples to return to Earth | CBC News,"China said Thursday its latest lunar probe has finished taking samples of the moon's surface and sealed them within the spacecraft for return to Earth, the first time such a mission has been attempted by any country in more than 40 years.",2020-12-03T13:48:11.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/moon-samples-1.5826500,"China said Thursday its latest lunar probe has finished taking samples of the moon's surface and sealed them within the spacecraft for return to Earth, the first time such a mission has been attempted by any country in more than 40 years.The Chang'e 5, the third Chinese probe to land on the moon, is the latest in a series of increasingly ambitious missions for Beijing's space program, which also has a probe en route to Mars carrying a robot rover.The Chang'e 5 touched down Tuesday on the Sea of Storms on the moon's near side, on a mission to return lunar rocks to Earth for the first time since 1976.The probe ""has completed sampling on the moon, and the samples have been sealed within the spacecraft,"" the China National Space Administration said in a statement.Plans call for the upper stage of the probe known as the ascender to be launched back into lunar orbit to transfer the samples to a capsule for return to Earth. The timing of its return was not immediately clear and the lander can last up to one moon day, or 14 Earth days, before falling temperatures would make it inoperable.Chang'e is equipped to both scoop samples from the surface and drill two metres to retrieve materials that could provide clues into the history of the moon, Earth other planets and space features.WATCH | An animation shows how Chang'e 5 was to land on the moon and collect samples:WorldWhile retrieving samples is its main task, the lander is also equipped to extensively photograph the area surrounding its landing site, map conditions below the surface with ground-penetrating radar and analyze the lunar soil for minerals and water content.Chang'e 5's return module is supposed to touch down around the middle of December on the grasslands of Inner Mongolia, where China's crewed Shenzhou spacecraft have made their returns since China first put a person in space in 2003, becoming only the third country do so after Russia and the United States.Chang'e 5 has revived talk of China one day sending a crewed mission to the moon and possibly building a scientific base there, although no timeline has been proposed for such projects.China also launched Its first temporary orbiting laboratory in 2011 and a second in 2016. Plans call for a permanent space station after 2022, possibly to be serviced by a reusable space plane.While China is boosting co-operation with the European Space Agency and others, interactions with NASA are severely limited by concerns over the secretive nature and close military links of the Chinese program."

Chinese sample return mission to the moon harkens back to 1960s lunar race | CBC Radio,Bob McDonald's blog: Robot mission will return first moon rocks since 1976,2020-11-27T19:50:56.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/radio/quirks/chinese-sample-return-mission-to-the-moon-harkens-back-to-1960s-lunar-race-1.5817888,"A Chinese robotic probe called Chang'e 5 is on its way to the moon where it will land, scoop up samples and return them to Earth. This is the first robotic sample return mission since Russian efforts in the 1960s. Those were an effort to make their mark on the lunar surface after their manned moon program failed.When Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin made their historic landing on the moon in July 1969, a secret Russian robotic probe called Luna 15 was there at the same time. It was an attempt to grab a sample of lunar soil and return it to Earth before the American astronauts got back. The Russians had lost the race to put humans on the moon, but were trying to grab a 'first' and master the moon robotically.Unfortunately, Luna 15 crashed during it's landing attempt and the opportunity for a propaganda coup was lost. However, their Luna 16 mission did successfully return about 100 grams of lunar soil a year later and two other sample return missions succeeded in following years, with the last one, Luna 24, in 1976 — two years after the Apollo program had ended. While these robotic sample return missions did not deliver as much lunar material as the Apollo astronauts, they were considerably cheaper and part of a long history of both Russian and American robotic lunar exploration involving dozens of impactors, orbiters, landers and rovers. In a way, we're in another moon race right now that echoes the race of fifty years ago — except this time it seems the robots might be in the lead. China is using robotic landers to explore the moon, and, if all goes well, Chang'e 5 will bring back several kilograms of moon rocks. In the meantime, the U.S. is struggling to develop a far more expensive effort, relying on huge (and much delayed) rockets that will carry humans to the moon with their Artemis program. It once again brings up the question of whether humans or robots are best suited to space exploration. We debated this on a special edition of Quirks & Quarks last year.Human missions are much more expensive, and historically they are much more politically driven than robotic exploration. The decision by the Kennedy administration in 1961 to send humans to the moon was part of the Cold War competition between the U.S. and Soviet Union to prove technical superiority over one another. The current Artemis program has also been politically influenced. Originally the plan was to first build a space station called Gateway in orbit around the moon. Once it was completed, astronauts would be sent down to the surface some time later this decade. When the Trump administration came to power, the landing was pushed forward to 2024, which would have been the last year of President Trump's second term in office. The Biden administration has not said whether it will keep to that tight schedule.NASA's giant new moon rocket, the Space Launch System (SLS) is slated to make its first flight next year. In the meantime three private companies — SpaceX, Blue Origin and Dynetics — have been contracted to develop lunar landers that would ride on their own rockets. But the pace of development in these programs makes NASA's current 2024 moon landing deadline pretty ambitious.Meanwhile, China is continuing its robotic program beyond the moon with the Tianwen 1 mission currently on its way to Mars. The spacecraft includes an orbiter and a lander, which will make China the third country to make a soft landing on Mars after Russia and the U.S. This is not a sample return mission, but it is not unreasonable to think that China could apply similar technology it is using on the moon to return samples from Mars in the future.Robots have always boldly gone where no one has gone before, exploring every planet in the solar system, as well as dwarf planets, moons, asteroids and comets. They conduct the initial reconnaissance of other worlds, survey the lay of the land and choose the best landing sites for humans who follow.  A whole fleet of robots are currently flying around the solar system. Two others are on their way to Mars with the United Arab Emirates' Hope mission and NASA's Perseverance lander scheduled to arrive in February.Beyond Mars, the Japanese Hayabusa2 and American, OSIRIS-REx spacecraft are bringing home samples they collected from asteroids. NASA is planning future missions to visit Europa, a moon of Jupiter and Titan, a mysterious moon of Saturn, the only moon with a thick atmosphere and liquid methane lakes on its surface.There is no doubt it will be a dramatic moment when the next human feet step out onto lunar soil again. Human exploration of space captures the imagination of the public, provides role models for young people and tests the limits of technical, physical and psychological endurance. But humans have not gone very far. The last mission to the moon was in 1972. It will still stretch the limits of our technology to get back there almost half a century later, Meanwhile, the true explorers of space, our silent mechanical servants, will continue their more far-reaching journeys to literally reach out and touch other worlds."
"McCallum says he tried to improve conditions for Kovrig, Spavor in Chinese prison | CBC News",One of Canada's most controversial ex-ambassadors to China says he repeatedly tried to improve the living conditions of Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor after their imprisonment in the People's Republic almost two years ago.,2020-11-25T01:09:05.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/chong-champagne-china-committee-1.5815179,"One of Canada's most controversial ex-ambassadors to China says he repeatedly tried to improve the living conditions of Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor after their imprisonment in the People's Republic almost two years ago. John McCallum also said Tuesday he regrets speaking about the October 2019 Canadian election in a meeting with Chinese officials in the months leading up to it. McCallum, the former Liberal cabinet minister who was fired as Canada's envoy to China in January 2019, was testifying at the special House of Commons committee on Canada-China relations. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau fired McCallum after he made a series of public comments that broke with the government's line following the arrests of Kovrig and Spavor. The two men were arrested nine days after Canada's arrest of Chinese high-tech scion Meng Wanzhou in December 2018 on a U.S. extradition warrant in what is widely viewed as retaliation by China. McCallum said that's when everything changed in Canada's relations with China. ""From that moment onwards, the top priority of the government and of myself as ambassador was to secure the release of the two Michaels,"" said McCallum, noting that he has been one of the few people to visit them in prison. ""On more than one occasion, I tried to convince the Chinese that if they were unable to release Kovrig and Spavor they should at least improve their living conditions. Sadly, as you all know, Canadian efforts in this area have so far been unsuccessful."" The committee has been examining Canada's relations with China, which have plummeted to an all-time low since December 2018.Earlier Tuesday, Conservative MP Michael Chong urged Foreign Affairs Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne to adopt a more consistent approach to getting tough with China. The Conservative foreign affairs critic told Champagne during a House of Commons committee meeting Tuesday that the government needs to show Canadians how it will deal with growing Chinese intimidation of Canadians within Canada. Chong said it is inconsistent for the government to be talking tougher on China, while Canada's current ambassador, Dominic Barton, is making speeches about the need to broaden trade with the People's Republic. ""I think it needs to be a lot clearer, a lot more consistent if Canada is going to have a clear, consistent voice with respect to China on the world stage,"" said Chong. Chong sponsored a motion that won approval in the Commons last week that calls on the government to decide within 30 days whether to allow China's Huawei Technologies to supply equipment for its next generation 5G internet network. Meng is a chief executive of Huawei. Champagne replied that Canada has taken a smart and firm approach with China lately that includes speaking out against its ill treatment of pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong and of ethnic Muslim Uighurs. ""Whether it comes to the Uighurs or whether it comes to Hong Kong, I've outlined places where we're going to challenge China, places where we're going to, for example, coexist with China,"" Champagne said."

What an Australian-style push against Chinese interference might look like | CBC News,"A motion brought by CPC foreign affairs critic Michael Chong, which passed Parliament last week, gives the government 30 days to come up with a plan — like Australia's — to fight foreign (Chinese) interference and influence campaigns. What might that look like and will it come to pass?",2020-11-24T09:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/china-canada-australia-espionage-1.5813364,"Some Australians see the country's new powers to stop foreign interference as an overdue shift from complacency to vigilance, while others have warned of the dangers of a McCarthyite moral panic.But all can agree that Australia's approach to foreign meddling in its politics, universities and public debate has changed a great deal in recent years.Last week, the Canadian House of Commons voted 179-146 for this country to adopt a plan similar to Australia's to counter meddling by the People's Republic of China.Experts in Canada and Australia suggest that such a change would set Canada on a much more aggressive path in countering China's inroads into this country's institutions.Conservative foreign affairs critic Michael Chong's motion requires the government to ""develop a robust plan, as Australia has done, to combat China's growing foreign operations here in Canada and its increasing intimidation of Canadians living in Canada, and table it within 30 days of the adoption of this motion.""Chong's motion received the support of most opposition members of the House, along with Liberals Wayne Easter, Nathaniel Erskine-Smith, John McKay and Jennifer O'Connell.Chong chose Australia as a model for Canada because of a package of laws passed in 2018 in the wake of a series of revelations that brought the issue of foreign interference and espionage to the fore.Sam Dastyari was an up-and-coming Labor Party senator when the year 2018 began. By the end of it he had admitted to soliciting thousands of dollars from businesses affiliated with the Chinese Communist Party. Thousands of Australians signed petitions demanding he face charges of treason.Australian media reports on Dastyari suggested he was a good investment for China. He not only supported Beijing's claims to the South China Sea — in opposition to the official position of his Labor Party — he also worked to prevent a meeting between his party leader and a Hong Kong pro-democracy activist.Dominique Dalla-Pozza teaches at the Centre for Military and Security Law at the Australian National University in Canberra (which itself allegedly has been a target of a massive Chinese intelligence operation). She said that for the past few years, the Australian Security Intelligence Organization (the ASIO — Australia's equivalent of Canada's CSIS) has been sounding the alarm about unprecedented levels of foreign intrusion.""ASIO said there were more foreign spies and their proxies operating in Australia than at the height of the Cold War,"" Dalla-Pozza said.In Canada, CSIS has been trying for years to draw Canadians' attention to foreign interference in everything from universities to municipal governments. Then-director Dick Fadden went public with such a warning in 2010. But Canada has seen no real legislative or organizational response.In Australia, by contrast, those warnings led the Turnbull government to introduce a new Espionage and Foreign Interference Act. Australia's laws don't single out China, the country's largest trading partner. When he introduced the bill in Parliament, then-PM Malcolm Turnbull was careful to cite other precedents, such as Russian meddling in the U.S. and French elections of 2016 and 2017. But there's no doubt in Australia about which foreign government is seen as the most active meddler. Over the last couple of months, Australia has raided the apartments of four Chinese journalists and revoked the visas of two Chinese academics.Dalla-Pozza said the law defines foreign interference as ""conduct that is engaged in concert with a foreign principal or a person that is acting on behalf of a foreign principal"" where ""the person engaging in the conduct is reckless as to whether it will influence government processes, or in other ways influence a democratic political right or duty.""Conduct has to be covert or involve deception, or involve a person making a threat to cause serious harm, or involve a person making a threat with menaces.""The new law produced its first arrest of a suspect two weeks ago: Di Sanh Duong, a prominent member of pro-Beijing Chinese-Australian organizations.The Turnbull government also brought in laws banning foreigners from donating to Australian politicians, placed new requirements on telecommunications companies to block foreign interference, and created a registry of critical infrastructure assets to provide more transparency on who really owns what in the country.And ""there are other mechanisms being developed in Australia that don't depend on the law,"" such as a new national coordinator, a public information campaign and a hotline, said Dalla-Pozza.""The act prescribes in a more focused way what is foreign interference, what is espionage, what is treason,"" said Patrick Walsh, who teaches at the Australian Graduate School for Policing and Security.Walsh said one of the most significant aspects of the law is that it allows Australia to fight back outside the courts.""The key is operational disruption of foreign interference, not just to collect information, but to disrupt it,"" he said.""In 2019 the PM established the Counter Foreign Interference Task Force, which is an interdepartmental task force to discover, track and disrupt foreign interference. And there was $8.7 million given to this task force.""The resources Australia devotes to this effort are not only centralized under a national coordinator, but are also far greater in terms of trained investigators than those available to the Government of Canada.Thirty days seems like a short time to design a full overhaul of Canada's approach to foreign interference, but Chong said Canada has a duty to protect people within its borders from harassment and intimidation by agents of foreign powers. ""It's long past time for the government to deal with this. Australia has already dealt with this. Our other allies have already dealt with this,"" he said. ""I note that on October 28, the FBI charged eight individuals, three of whom were Chinese citizens, for interfering and threatening American citizens through operations that are taking place on American soil.""The motion doesn't spell out any consequences for the government if it allows the 30 days to lapse. But Chong said that would be a harmful precedent given the strong cross-party support the motion received in Parliament.""I expect it to be carried out if the government follows democratic norms and respects the will of Parliament,"" he told CBC News. ""At a time when democracy is under pressure around the world, it's more important than ever that governments respect democratic norms."""

They are planning to hold it online this year.This year's theme of the gala is ""We are family"" — a nod to the community staying together during the pandemic.Jenny Zhang, a longtime volunteer with the association, said it is important to make sure there's a show this year, even if it's not on stage.""We put lots of effort, and the people worked together,"" Zhang said. Normally the group would start rehearsing in September for the show that is in January or early February, depending on the Chinese New Year.Instead of spending the fall rehearsing, they are busy recording sessions outdoors while the weather is still nice. On Sunday, about 20 people met at Killarney Lake, on Fredericton's north side, to film the choir singing.""Actually, I feel very confident right now,"" Mu said after spending the morning filming a video with the choir.""We support each other,"" she said, adding that the volunteers are learning how to make the gala online as they go. ""I think we're going to make it — I hope so,"" she said.Mu said the Chinese New Year is too important to the community to risk not having a gala, even if it's different from other years.""It is the most traditional way we will celebrate our Chinese New Year. It's kinda the most important day for the Chinese. We want to keep that tradition."""

Central Grand Restaurant — 295-1623 Centre St. N.Carson says she thinks the spice in this ginger beef tasted like cinnamon, which she wasn't a big fan of.However, she says the dish did have a solid batter-to-beef ratio.3.

He said it's time for Canada and its closest allies to adopt a more aggressive posture.""The democratic world must acknowledge that the approach to China over the last two decades has not worked. In fact, the situation has gotten worse,"" O'Toole told reporters on Parliament Hill.He said the move to normalize relations and admit China to the World Trade Organization has had ""catastrophic impacts for Canadian workers.""""We falsely believed that ignoring the sharp edges of communism would, over time, smooth them out by putting trade ahead of our values.""Conservative MP Michael Chong, the party's foreign affairs critic, will table a motion today to put pressure on the Liberal government to ban Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei from building Canada's 5G network. Most of the country's wireless providers have opted already to work with Sweden-based Ericsson.Huawei's founder has close ties to China's communist leadership and intelligence partners have long warned that the company's technology could be used to spy on Canadians. O'Toole said Huawei's global success is due in part to ""years of industrial espionage"" against the now-defunct Canadian tech giant Nortel.Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Tuesday the government's final decision on Huawei will be based on the recommendations of Canada's intelligence agencies. ""We've worked with our allies and we've consulted broadly,"" he said.The former director of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS), Ward Elcock, has said Huawei and all Chinese technology firms like it pose a significant risk to worldwide intelligence collection.Watch: Bains says the federal government ""will not be bullied or intimidated by any country."":PoliticsThe Conservative motion, if passed, also would compel the Liberal government to develop a comprehensive plan to protect Canada from ""the growing influence of Chinese agents"" on our soil.O'Toole said Canada has tolerated the proliferation of Confucius Institutes — state-backed Chinese language centres — that push state propaganda.O'Toole said Canadian university professors have been bullied into weakening their teachings on human rights abuses for fear of offending mainland Chinese students, while pro-Beijing media outlets have disseminated anti-western narratives.""Canadians of Chinese origin have been threatened by foreign agents in our country. Anti-Hong Kong protests were organized in Canada to bully democracy activists. Uighur students in our universities have been de-platformed and menaced in coordinated actions led by Chinese consulates across our country,"" he said.""And the very values we hold dear, like openness, justice and tolerance, have been weaponized against us.""O'Toole pointed to Australia's foreign interference law as something to emulate here. That country passed legislation in 2018 to toughen penalties on espionage while also requiring individuals or organizations acting in the interests of foreign powers to register and disclose their ties — part of an effort to reduce meddling by China in Australia's politics, universities and media.Under the legislation, it is illegal for a person to knowingly engage in covert conduct or deception on behalf of a ""foreign principal."" The first arrest under this law was made earlier this month when a prominent Chinese-Australian community activist was accused of trying to influence the country's immigration minister.Speaking later in question period, Trudeau said Canada has a ""complex multi-dimensional relationship with China"" and the country deals with Beijing ""with eyes wide open.""""We will remain firm in defending our principles and interests and always will,"" he said, adding that Canada's security agencies have been working with universities and colleges to address new Chinese threats to those institutions.""Canada has among the best security agencies in the world. The folks who work for our agencies work every single day to keep Canadians safe. Not all of it appears in the newspapers. On the contrary, a lot of the work that is done in important situations is never heard about at all,"" he said.Watch: Conservative MP Michael Chong says the federal government is ""paralyzed by indecision"" on Huawei:PoliticsAsked if passing such a motion would further damage already shaky bilateral relations between Canada and China, O'Toole said that while he's concerned about the status of two Canadians held in Chinese prisons, the current government's approach hasn't yielded results.Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor have been held in China for 708 days. ""A weak response by Mr. Trudeau has not led to any progress in the case of the two Michaels,"" O'Toole said. ""A more principled, a stronger approach may make progress.""China has retaliated against countries that have criticized its behaviour through trade action. O'Toole said Canada shouldn't be intimidated by such threats.""Canada should work very closely with our Five Eyes allies ... so that it's difficult for China to use its immense economic size to intimidate smaller economies like Canada,"" O'Toole said, citing the intelligence-sharing alliance between Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the U.S.""We may be a smaller economy in comparison with China but we are a giant when it comes to the rights we hold dear, human rights, the rule of law and the security of our citizens.""O'Toole said Canada must strengthen its relationship with other Asian economies — Canada joined the Trans-Pacific Partnership in 2017 — and bolster trade with India. ""We need to look for new markets,"" he said.The motion comes days after the House of Commons subcommittee on international human rights released a report condemning China for committing genocidal acts against the Uighur Muslim minority. Canada's ambassador to the UN, Bob Rae, said Sunday he would encourage the body's human rights committee to probe the plight of China's Uighur population."
Canada's ties to China's military underscore the weird contradictions in its foreign policy | CBC News,It's been obvious for some time that there is something a little weird about the way Canada approaches its relationship with China — a disconnect brought into sharp relief this week by the news that Global Affairs and the Department of National Defence were not on the same page when it came to military ties and training involving the People’s Liberation Army.,2020-12-12T09:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canada-china-pla-peoples-liberation-army-1.5838658,"It's been obvious for some time that there is something weird about the way Canada approaches its relationship with China — a disconnect brought into sharp relief this week by the news that Global Affairs and the Department of National Defence were not on the same page when it came to military ties and training involving the People's Liberation Army.In some respects, the volcanic online political eruption which followed stories in The Globe and Mail and other media outlets, based on exclusive access to information documents, was predictable, as was the flurry of finger-pointing in the House of Commons on Thursday and Friday.Diplomats were alarmed when Gen. Jonathan Vance, the country's senior military commander, cancelled winter military exercises with the PLA in 2019, fretting that it might aggravate Beijing or make the lives of Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor even worse.It makes for fire-breathing memes, sizzling copy and wonderful political theatre.What's missing, though, is a recognition that Canada's policy toward a rising China has been contradictory and incoherent for almost a decade, maybe more, said Charles Burton, a political scientist at Brock University in St. Catharines, Ont. and a respected China expert at the Macdonald-Laurier Institute.""Cabinets were always split on China, whether it's Liberal or Conservative,"" Burton said, referring to debates more than three decades ago during the government of former prime minister Brian Mulroney.It is more urgent than ever, in the context of an increasingly belligerent and assertive China, to present a united political front, he added.""This is really about the defence of our sovereignty and security on matters over which there is consensus across the political spectrum in Canada,"" he said.Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan, in an attempt at political damage control late this week, made a point of saying that Chinese troops are no longer training for winter warfare at Garrison Petawawa, Ont.He also (rather meekly) noted that the exchange and training program with the PLA was instituted in August 2013 under the Conservatives while defence critic James Bezan, one of the most vocal and fiery opponents this week, was parliamentary secretary of defence.Bezan's retort was along the lines of that was then, this is now.""The defence minister knows full well that the Chinese government back then and the Chinese government today are completely different,"" Bezan said during question period on Thursday.It was a different time, no question.Chinese President Xi Jinping had taken office only a few months before, and the Department of National Defence (DND) tasking order that established the exchange program, obtained by CBC News under access to information, noted that working with the PLA ""complements the Government of Canada led efforts to broaden our bilateral relationship with China.""After years of hectoring and hammering China, the Conservatives — under former prime minister Stephen Harper — had decided that limited engagement was the way to go.And here is where Canada's curious incoherence comes into play.At precisely the moment the former chief of the defence staff, the now-retired general Tom Lawson, was penning the Canadian military's marching orders on closer cooperation with the PLA, the foreign affairs ministry — led at the time by John Baird — was firing off flares about China's unilateral declaration of an air defence zone in the East China Sea.It was a bellwether moment.""The U.S. has indicated deep concern over the establishment of the Chinese ADIZ stating that the U.S. views this development as a destabilizing attempt to alter the status quo in the region and that this move increases the risk of misunderstanding and miscalculations,"" said a Nov. 23, 2013 briefing note to Baird, obtained by CBC News in 2017.""More broadly, the rise of China is reshaping the strategic landscape.""Burton said the rise of President Xi marked the beginning of the new, more aggressive China. The establishment of the air zone — now largely forgotten against a backdrop of fortified artificial islands in the South China Sea, reports of Uyghurs in concentration camps and the haze of tear gas in Hong Kong — marked the first step.So were our politicians and senior leaders paying attention not only to events, but to what other federal departments were saying?According to what former foreign affairs minister (and current finance minister) Chrystia Freeland had to say in question period this week, the answer is yes.""I have long personal experience reporting on authoritarian communist regimes and I am very aware of the threat they pose,"" she said.Here's the question no one seemed to ask this week: why was the military exchange and training program still going on even before hostage diplomacy swept up the two Michaels?National Defence is no stranger to suspicions about China, having spent an enormous amount of time quietly defending itself from cyberattacks purportedly launched by  Beijing or by groups associated with it.The Trump administration has been tightening the screws on China from a diplomatic, security and trade perspective. There has been considerable, growing debate among Western allies — led by the Americans — about the downside of military engagement and co-operation with China, with Five Eyes intelligence partners each exchanging their own warnings — a series of discussions that eventually prompted Canada's current top military commander, Gen. Jonathan Vance, to cancel the winter warfare exercises.And then, of course, there's debate over the telecom giant Huawei and its future in this country.The signs were all there, Burton said — but no one actually woke up to the problem until Kovrig and Spavor were imprisoned. The public has been galvanized, he added, but ""it doesn't seem to have penetrated fully to the senior levels of the political and economic elite.""Burton said that — as weird as it might sound, with everything else that has happened — he believes there are some within the Canadian Establishment who still cling to the notion that if the ""consular cases of Spavor and Kovrig are resolved, we can go back"" to business as usual."

Chinese viewers pan Disney's new Mulan as inauthentic | CBC News,"The remake of Mulan drew decidedly mixed reviews in China after its coronavirus-delayed release in China last week, with thousands panning it online.",2020-09-17T15:37:10.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/chinese-viewers-pan-mulan-1.5727823,"The remake of Mulan struck all the right chords to be a hit in the key Chinese market. Disney cast beloved actor Liu Yifei as Mulan and removed a dragon sidekick popular in the animated original to cater to Chinese tastes.Still, the movie drew decidedly mixed reviews after its coronavirus-delayed release in China last week, with thousands panning it online.The movie was rated 4.9 out of 10 by more than 165,000 people on Douban, a leading website for film, book and music ratings. Negative comments and jokes about the film outnumbered positive reactions on social media.Mulan has earned an estimated 198 million yuan ($39 million Cdn) since its opening last week, and was the second most watched movie in China as of Thursday, according to ticketing platform Maoyan. It scored a higher 7.5 out of 10 on Maoyan, but also with mixed reviews.""Poor artistic level, misunderstanding of Chinese culture lead to the film's failure in China,"" the state-run Global Times newspaper tweeted.Chinese critics, both at home and abroad, said they were disappointed with the film's inaccurate and stereotypical portrayals of Chinese history and the main character, infused with nationalist tropes.Others were not as bothered.""It's fine that different screenwriters make up different stories,"" Zhang Qin, a military veteran, said after watching the film in Beijing last week. ""They can play with imagination and it's a good thing.""IT engineer Zhang Fan also had positive things to say about the film. ""What touched me is the humanity,"" he said.The remake of Disney's popular 1998 animation is based on the ancient tale of Hua Mulan, a young woman who takes her father's place in the army by dressing as a man.The animated version was a global hit but earned just $30 million in China, where viewers found the movie too Americanized, according to reports at the time.The original tale, The Ballad of Mulan, has gone through multiple renditions. Themes such as filial piety and being loyal to the central government have remained as core tenets, which some find outdated and problematic.""It's a very touchy subject in modern China because a lot of people find [filial piety] very constraining, including me,"" said Xiran Jay Zhao, the Chinese Canadian author of an upcoming book about the only female emperor in China. ""It's like a moral shackle for people.""Critics also pointed out inaccurate details such as the use of a southern-style house when Mulan is likely from the north and a depiction of ""qi"" as a magic power that only boys can wield — in Chinese philosophy, it is a force not limited by gender.Some called the makeup and costumes ugly and inauthentic.Zhao said the film comes off more like European fantasy than a Chinese story, and noted that the film's crew was mostly white, including the director, four screenwriters and costume designer.""They didn't really get any Chinese people on the writing staff, and it really showed,"" she said.Jeannette Ng, a Chinese fantasy writer based in the United Kingdom, said the film perpetuates a narrative of China's majority Han people that assimilates and excludes minorities including ethnic Mongolians, Tibetans and Uighurs.""The mainland Chinese people aren't the mainland Chinese viewers from 20 years ago,"" she said of the lukewarm response. ""The culture has moved on.""Her comments mirror the latest in a series of controversies that have hit the film outside mainland China.The movie's final credits thank propaganda departments and a public security bureau in Xinjiang, where part of it was filmed.China has come under widespread criticism for detaining Uighurs and other predominantly Muslim minorities in Xinjiang as part of a campaign to snuff out sometimes-violent struggle against Chinese rule.Earlier, a boycott movement was sparked after Liu, the actor who portrays Mulan, publicly supported Hong Kong police as they battled pro-democracy protesters last year.Hong Kong resident Sarah Chan said she does not plan to see the film, which opened in her city on Thursday.""The main actress ... supports Hong Kong police, so I don't want to watch it,"" Chan said. ""Furthermore, I think they changed the historical background of the story. It's not the same story anymore.""Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian defended Liu last week, calling her a ""Mulan of the modern times.""Disney did not reply to a request for comment."

Chinese ambassador should apologize or be expelled for 'threatening' Canadians in Hong Kong: activist | CBC Radio,"China's ambassador to Canada should apologize or be expelled for remarks he made about the 300,000 Canadians in Hong Kong, says a Canadian living in the semi-autonomous region.",2020-10-21T20:40:26.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/radio/asithappens/as-it-happens-wednesday-edition-1.5771041/chinese-ambassador-should-apologize-or-be-expelled-for-threatening-canadians-in-hong-kong-activist-1.5771042,"Read Story TranscriptChina's ambassador to Canada should apologize or be expelled for remarks he made about the 300,000 Canadians in Hong Kong, says a Canadian living in the semi-autonomous region. Last week, Ambassador Cong Peiwu warned the Canadian government not to grant asylum to Hong Kong residents fleeing China's controversial national security law, which bans secessionist, subversive or terrorist activities, and has been wielded against critics and protesters. China imposed the law on Hong Kong, which is supposed to have legal autonomy under the ""one country, two systems"" agreement.""If the Canadian side really cares about the stability and the prosperity in Hong Kong, and really cares about the good health and safety of those 300,000 Canadian passport holders in Hong Kong, and the large number of Canadian companies operating in Hong Kong … you should support those efforts to fight violent crimes,"" Cong said.Canada's deputy prime minister Chrystia Freeland said the ambassador's remarks were ""not in any way in keeping with the spirit of appropriate diplomatic relations between two countries."" Conservative Leader Erin O'Toole says that if Cong refuses to apologize, Canada should withdraw his diplomatic credentials.Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian defended Cong's remarks, saying Canadian leaders ""did not verify, but also condoned the anti-China comments spreading across the nation and made groundless accusations against China.""Edward Chin agrees with O'Toole. He is a Canadian hedge fund manager who lives and works in Hong Kong, and a longtime activist in the Hong Kong pro-democracy movement. Here is part of his conversation with As It Happens host Carol Off. Mr. Chin, how secure do you feel as a Canadian in Hong Kong right now?I think this [statement from the ambassador] is one of the so-called wolf warrior tactics they have been using over the last couple of years. But it kind of got escalated in the last little while.Do you feel secure since these remarks on the part of the [Chinese] ambassador? Even before this gentlemen's remarks, after the [national security law] came into effect, I don't think anyone would feel secure in Hong Kong because this is exactly one country, one system now. So how can anyone feel secure in Hong Kong?Because last year, every Hong Kong person, more than two million people, came out to fight very hard [against] the extradition bill that finally got retracted. Now, this is 10 times worse. This is the nuclear option that they think of.But this seems to have been in reaction to suggestions that Canada would offer asylum to people from Hong Kong, democracy activists who are feeling threatened by the … national security law since it came into place, and that this has been the way that Hong Kong [has reacted] to Canada's offer of asylum. Does that change things?I think Canada has done the right thing to give asylum to those demonstrators who came out and [fought] for democracy, because they were fighting for their life, basically.We have to go back a few months earlier. Why do people come up and protest? Because the two systems is gone. Now, the Chinese ambassador to Canada, you know, whatever he said is threatening. Threatening. This is outrageous, honestly. I think he should be reprimanded.China's ambassador in Ottawa was … warning against the granting asylum to Hong Kong dissidents, and he said, ""If the Canadian side really cares about the stability and the prosperity in Hong Kong and really cares about the good health and safety of those 300,000 Canadian passport holders in Hong Kong and the large number of Canadian companies operating Hong Kong, you should support those efforts to fight violent crimes."" And, of course, is referring to the national security law. Does that sound like a threat to you?Does it mean that they want to treat the Chinese-Canadians or Caucasian-Canadians in Hong Kong, just like the two Michaels, just to abduct them into China?They could just use any excuse and detain someone.I think that the Trudeau government, [Prime Minister] Justin Trudeau together with Chrystia Freeland, I think they should really have a strong statement saying, you know, like, ""This is a threat."" Because, you know, there are a lot of mainland students studying in Canada.Canada, they don't do the same type of threat. This is something really outrageous, and only like a totalitarian regime would do that, threatening people.Chrystia Freeland has spoken out in Canada. She has said this is not in the spirit of diplomatic relations … but the Opposition is saying that the government should go further, that in fact, they should demand the ambassador either apologize or leave the country, have his credentials pulled. Do you think that Canada should go that far?The opposition party is saying the right thing. Because definitely this Chinese ambassador … should definitely apologize.The Opposition leader, I agree with him. You know, they should do something to show that Canada is not one of the weakest Five Eyes countries. Because it's perceived that way, especially in Hong Kong.You have been an activist. You have been outspoken for years, even before this national security law came into effect, and as you point out, became something where people who speak out against China could be arrested, that free speech has been criminalized.... Are you concerned that they you might be targeted by the regime right now, given what they've said about Canada?Everyone could be targetted. I mean, we as Chinese-Canadians, we are in a very awkward situation now. Ethnically, I'm Chinese, so it is embarrassing to have a Chinese ambassador to Canada saying they will do some harm to Chinese people living in Hong Kong, whether I am Canadian or not. So they're saying they want to do something bad to their own people.I don't dislike China. I think it's a great country with a great civilization. But the CCP, the Chinese Communist Party, the way they treat their own people, is very questionable.And that's why [former Chinese leader] Deng Xiaoping promised the two systems until 2047. But now we are short-changed by 27 years.Can I just ask you, finally, do you think there will be many people in Hong Kong … the activists, will they be seeking asylum? Do you think they will ask to be refugees to Canada?I don't think there will be a massive exodus. But in terms of persecution, yes, definitely. Those people living in Hong Kong, whether they are Hong Kong permanent ID card holders or anyone in Hong Kong now, their situation is the same as if they were in mainland China. There's no difference. No doubt about it.Will you ever leave Hong Kong? Do you think that's something that you might have to do?Besides my investment business in hedge funds and all my other hedges, I'm a current affairs writer, a commentator. I think I want to wait until they put a gunpoint at someone's head; and I think that would be the time that we all should leave.And if they shut down, for instance, Apple Daily or some of the internet radio, or they arrest a lot of full-time political commentators, that's the time I think a lot of people should leave, and then the whole world should talk with the CCP and confront with them in a forceful way.Written by Sheena Goodyear with files from The Associated Press.

But human rights and pro-democracy advocates say Beijing's new national security law is undermining freedom in what is known as the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.""So if the Canadian side really cares about the stability and the prosperity in Hong Kong, and really cares about the good health and safety of those 300,000 Canadian passport holders in Hong Kong, and the large number of Canadian companies operating in Hong Kong SAR, you should support those efforts to fight violent crimes,"" Cong said.Cong also flatly rejected Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's assertion that China is engaging in coercive diplomacy by imprisoning two Canadian men in retaliation for the arrest of a Chinese high-tech executive on an American extradition warrant. Meng Wanzhou is living under house arrest in Vancouver while her case wends through a British Columbia court.In December 2018, China imprisoned Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor and charged them with undermining the country's national security. Cong said they are still undergoing a legal process in China but did not provide further details.He repeated his government's demand that Canada release Meng immediately but insisted her case and his government's prosecution of Kovrig and Spavor are not linked.""We will remain absolutely committed to working with our allies to ensure that China's approach of coercive diplomacy, its arbitrary detention of two Canadian citizens, alongside other citizens of other countries around the world, is not viewed as a successful tactic by them,"" Trudeau said earlier this week as the two countries marked 50 years of relations at one of the lowest points in Canada-China bilateral relations.Cong said Canada's efforts to get other countries to join its fight for Kovrig and Spavor is ""doomed to fail.""The European Union raised concerns about the two Canadians by name in the communique summarizing its recent summit with China.""We oppose any remarks that interfere in our internal affairs. And I would like to point out, there is no coercive diplomacy on the Chinese side,"" Cong said."

"I want my baby to grow up proud of her heritage. But with rising anti-Chinese racism, I'm struggling | CBC Radio",Lisa Xing wants to raise her child with pride in her Chinese heritage in spite of a surge in anti-Chinese racism due to COVID-19.,2020-10-03T09:01:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/radio/docproject/from-afar-1.5710871/i-want-my-baby-to-grow-up-proud-of-her-heritage-but-with-rising-anti-chinese-racism-i-m-struggling-1.5710879,"My parents immigrated to Canada from China in their thirties. I came when I was five. So I thought they would be honoured when I bestowed upon them the responsibility of giving their granddaughter a name. A Chinese name. To my surprise (and dismay), I realized just how much they were against this child having a Chinese name. They said the first name should be easy to pronounce.Finally, after my daughter was born on September 29, 2020, my partner Nathan and I settled on Minmin, pronounced ""Ming Ming"". The first Min means ""fall"", the second Min, ""easygoing"" and ""gentle"". It was my mom's suggestion, after she gave in to my pleas.Not only do I think it's user friendly, it's beautiful written in Chinese as 旻旼. Both words using the same two radicals (parts that form a character), just rearranged differently. The choice of my child's name is just one way I am trying to instill a sense of pride in her Chinese heritage. I want her to embrace it, even though anti-Chinese racism has been on the rise since COVID-19.My partner, Nathan, is white. He grew up on a tobacco farm in southwestern Ontario. Our baby is biracial. Throughout the pregnancy, we often talked about how she would look, how I'll manage to get her to speak Mandarin (as I am just a basic speaker myself), and the responsibility of choosing a name that would inevitably play a role in shaping her identity. But although we went ahead and named her Minmin, the current social and political climate has wedged some fear into my mind. It's not treatment from kids on the playground that worries me. It's the recent resurgence of racism that is different to the kind of intolerance I experienced as a child. Trump calls COVID-19 the ""China virus."" And since the coronavirus outbreak, there has been widespread racism against Chinese people, since the virus originated in Wuhan, China. I hate to say it, but in this context, something as superficial as looking more ""white"" or having an English name could spare my daughter a lot of pain. While I know she could get by easier by blending in, this hate also stirred up a defiance in me that made me want to instill that pride in being Chinese even more, so she can have a bulletproof attitude, as Nathan says, and so that none of it will bother her the way it bothered me. I wasn't always called ""Lisa."" My Chinese name is Yaxi (pronounced Ya-shee). That's what I went by as a child growing up in Hamilton, Ont. Everyone butchered it, intentionally or otherwise. Some called me ""Taxi"" or ""Yucky"". So the summer before high school, my best friend – who also had a difficult-for-North-Americans-to-pronounce name, Yiqing – and I decided to change our names. After fighting with my parents to let me change mine to ""Melanie,"" a cringe-worthy homage to Mel B of the Spice Girls, I finally relented and we went with ""Lisa,"" the English name my dad had chosen for me when I first came to Canada. Yiqing chose ""Myra."" The name change took some getting used to, though ultimately, it made life easier. But some time after university, I started realizing just how unique my Chinese name was: Ya, the last part of my mom's name, and Xi, which means ""dawn."" After my own experiences, and the ensuing struggle with my parents over my daughter's name, I hope Minmin will embrace it. I want her to be defiant and proud and confident. And I hope she won't take as long as I did to get there.  "

Yeah, I think that would be wonderful,"" Whiteside said.She said she would rely on the independent processes that exist already to address naming of major infrastructure projects, which would take into account the feelings of the community.On the other side of the Pattullo Bridge, Surrey-Whalley Liberal candidate Shaukat Khan said the name change is one he'd also support opening to consultation.""As far as I'm concerned, we should always be engaging with our communities and taking input on all [of] the projects.Both parties are in agreement a name change wouldn't be off the table, but a consultation process would be necessary to decide the correct one.Wan said he'd like to see a vote by community members.""A new bridge, a new beginning, a new era, it will really help strengthen our local population to be more inclusive,"" Wan said.The project for the new bridge is set to start later this year and carry through until 2023. The $1.4-billion project will see a new four-lane bridge built with wider lanes connecting Surrey and New Westminster."

Hong Kong police arrest at least 60 after pro-democracy protest on Chinese holiday | CBC News,Hong Kong police arrested at least 60 people on suspicion of unauthorized assembly on China's National Day holiday Thursday after crowds gathered on the streets of a popular shopping district chanting pro-democracy slogans.,2020-10-01T15:58:48.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/hong-kong-police-arrest-protest-china-holiday-1.5745990,"Hong Kong police arrested at least 60 people on suspicion of unauthorized assembly on China's National Day holiday Thursday after crowds gathered on the streets of a popular shopping district chanting pro-democracy slogans.Those arrested included two district councillors, police said in a statement posted on Facebook. They said the people were arrested after they ignored repeated warnings asking them to disperse.Online calls urged people to join protests, and crowds turned up at Hong Kong's Causeway Bay shopping district, some people chanting ""Disband the police"" and ""Liberate Hong Kong, Revolution of our time,"" a popular pro-democracy slogan that has been banned by the Hong Kong government for alleged secessionist sentiments.A heavy police presence outnumbered the protesters at the scene.WATCH | Dozens arrested in Hong Kong after anti-government protest:WorldNational Day, which celebrates the founding of the People's Republic of China, has become a day of protest in Hong Kong by those who oppose Beijing's increasing control over the semi-autonomous region. Large-scale protests are forbidden because of physical distancing restrictions due to the coronavirus.In the afternoon, police cordoned off some areas in the district and searched people on the streets. On several occasions, they unfurled warning banners that urged protesters to disperse, saying they were participating in an illegal assembly.Protests against the Hong Kong and mainland Chinese governments swelled last year, and Beijing clamped down on expressions of anti-government sentiment in the city with a new national security law that took effect June 30.The law outlaws subversive, secessionist and terrorist activity, as well as collusion with foreign powers to interfere in the city's internal affairs. The U.S. and Britain accuse China of infringing on the city's freedoms, and the U.S. has imposed sanctions on government officials in Hong Kong and China over the law.At a National Day reception, Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam said ""stability has been restored to society while national security has been safeguarded"" under the new law.Lam also accused some foreign governments of holding ""double standards"" and levelling unjustified accusations against the authorities who implement the new law."
Chinese dairy investor pressed Canada to 'mitigate the risk' of new NAFTA | CBC News,"Executives of the Chinese infant formula manufacturer that’s building a new $332 million plant in Kingston, Ont. contacted Canadian officials to complain about the new NAFTA agreement within days of the agreement being reached — and asked for help in mitigating the harm caused by Canada's concessions.",2020-09-29T08:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/monday-feihe-nafta-atip-1.5739152,"Less than three weeks after talks concluded on the revised North American free trade agreement, executives from a Chinese infant formula manufacturer that had invested $332 million to build a new plant in Kingston, Ont. asked for a sudden meeting with Canadian officials.Zhiwen Yang, the general manager of Canada Royal Milk — the Canadian subsidiary of China Feihe Limited — wrote to then-Agriculture Minister Lawrence MacAulay and the Liberal MP for Kingston and the Islands, Mark Gerretsen, describing how Canada's concessions in the Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement (CUSMA) put his business plans in jeopardy by limiting how much cow's milk formula it can export and dismantling the dairy ingredient pricing system.Yang asked the federal government to ""mitigate the risks to the project."" His three-page letters, dated Oct. 16, 2018, were released to CBC News under the Access to Information Act.A few days later, Feihe International Inc. ""respectfully"" asked the president of the Canadian Food Inspection Agency and another senior government official to meet for 90 minutes on Oct. 29 with Yang and his boss, Feihe International chair Youbin Leng, who was travelling to Canada with his directors of research and regulatory affairs.""The purpose of the meeting is to discuss the regulatory framework in China and explore how we can work together. The expectation is not for a decision to be made, but to begin a conversation,"" said the email from Carey Bidtnes, Canada Royal Milk's human resources manager, who was part of the team that worked on bringing this investment to Canada during her previous employment with the Kingston Economic Development Corporation. Bidtnes said that Canada Royal Milk was working with Health Canada and the CFIA to ""resolve a challenge"" with exporting its formula.The documents reveal that the financial stakes for Feihe were higher by the fall of 2018 than they were in 2017, when CBC News reported on the potential international trade issues triggered by Feihe's plans to export the vast majority of the infant formula it manufactures in Canada back to Chinese consumers.As construction began, the Chinese investment was pegged at $225 million. A year later, the investment was estimated at $332 million and project proponents were predicting it would bring 277 direct full-time jobs to the region once production ramps up. A further 300 construction jobs have been created in the Kingston area and the plant is expected to generate the equivalent of over 1,000 more jobs in its eventual supply chain.Chinese companies have a deeper relationship with China's central government than private sector firms in North America do with their own national governments. Feihe is listed on the Hong Kong stock exchange, but its subsidiary, Canada Royal Milk, is incorporated in Canada.The investment — the largest foreign direct investment in Ontario agriculture in the last decade — was finalized with officials from the Canadian Dairy Commission during a 2016 visit to Canada by Chinese Premier Li Keqiang.American officials were monitoring this Chinese investment. President Donald Trump — and the powerful U.S. farm lobby — regard Canada's supply management system as ""unfair"" because it blocks most American dairy from Canada's domestic market.In the CUSMA, Canada agreed to several concessions that harm its dairy industry — including strict limits, enforced by new export charges, on international exports of infant formula and skim milk.CUSMA's export limit for cow's milk formula is lower than what Feihe originally planned to produce in Kingston, according to a presentation obtained three years ago by CBC News.Newly released government talking points say Canadian negotiators ""were in contact with a number of individuals with direct knowledge of the proposed facility's operations,"" including the Kingston Economic Development Corporation, ""to ensure negotiators had a thorough understanding of the intended operation … with a view to avoiding unintended impacts.""It's the same response CBC News got in 2018 when it asked whether Canada's NAFTA renegotiation team spoke directly to Feihe about its plans before signing off.Another concession Canada agreed to in the CUSMA talks dismantled part of its dairy pricing regime, ending lower ingredient pricing that kept processors competitive. Canada's prices are now based on American rates.When Feihe agreed to invest in Ontario, Canada's lower ingredient price was part of its forecasts.Xinhua, the Chinese news agency, reported that then-foreign affairs minister Chrystia Freeland spoke to Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi to brief him within days of concluding CUSMA negotiations.But if the two ministers discussed the dairy concessions, they apparently didn't resolve the manufacturer's concerns because the documents show that, within days of that conversation, Feihe began its own outreach to the Canadian government.Earlier presentations of Canada Royal Milk's business plans didn't mention producing and exporting skim milk powder for the adult market. But this letter to MacAulay said the company would produce skim powder for export during a ""ramp up"" period of testing the new facility. Canada already has a significant surplus of skim milk powder, left over after meeting Canada's strong demand for butter. Making baby formula at this new plant was supposed to help use up this surplus, not exacerbate it.The global market for skim is crowded and ultra-competitive, with American farmers hostile to any threats. Under the World Trade Organization's Nairobi Agreement, Canada agreed to stop exporting skim milk products as of January 2021.""The export cap is a very serious issue for the operations of the company for 2019 and 2020,"" the letter from general manager Yang to then-minister MacAulay said, ""and we believe it will hinder the growth of the entire industry in the future.""In its correspondence, Feihe asked for assurances that its facility had the support of all levels of government. It also requested ""reasonable quota"" so it could take maximum advantage of the tariff-free exports that would be allowed under the CUSMA, including a ""guarantee that the full annual export quota for infant formula would be assigned to Canada Royal Milk.""Canada is allocating its export quota for skim milk powder based on processors' past production. But for infant formula, export quota was distributed according to planned production — presumably to accommodate the new plant coming online.""Currently, details on which entities have received an allocation for the dairy export thresholds are not public,"" Jean-Sébastien Comeau, a spokesperson for Agriculture Minister Marie-Claude Bibeau, told CBC News.In a question redacted from one document released to CBC News but repeated without redaction in another, Yang also asked the government if it would ""take steps to limit the licensing of new infant formula manufacturing in Canada.""While that appears to be anti-competitive behaviour, no other Canadian dairy processor has shown interest in making infant formula in recent years — which is why Canada pursued the Chinese investment in the first place.On the demise of ingredient pricing, ""it's unclear how this will impact our operations in the medium to long term,"" Yang's letter to MacAulay said.""Our team has already been contacted by U.S. dairy producers who are eager to sell their products to us,"" the letter continues.""What has the government proposed to assist dairy processors to overcome the loss of [ingredient] pricing?""The letter sent to MP Gerretsen repeated the same demands.Although Bibeau announced funding for dairy producers harmed by trade deals with the European Union and Pacific Rim countries in the days leading up to the 2019 federal election, the industry is still waiting for the compensation it was promised when NAFTA was replaced.It's unclear whether Canada Royal Milk would be eligible for compensation but the Chinese investment has qualified for other federal and provincial support programs.If Feihe believes its investment was harmed by Canada's concessions, it could sue for damages under the 2012 Canada–China Foreign Investor Protection Agreement, which was negotiated by the previous Conservative government.""The sued country can opt not to make public anything until an arbitration award,"" Osgoode Hall law professor and investment treaty specialist Gus Van Harten said, noting this agreement is unique in this regard.International Trade Minister Mary Ng's spokesperson Ryan Nearing said ""there has been no dispute launched against Canada under the Canada-China FIPA to date, nor notification of an intention to do so.""In an interview with CBC, MP Gerretsen said he passed on the requests he received from the company to officials at Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada. But he said the only formal encounter he's had with Canada Royal Milk was a tour of the construction site in his riding earlier in 2018.""A number of the issues that were in their letter I believe have been addressed,"" he said.In departmental email, one bureaucrat called Yang's correspondence ""an interesting letter indeed.""Before federal government officials met with the Chinese, two senior officials from Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's office, Brian Clow and Simon Beauchemin, joined an ""urgent briefing"" with MacAulay's office — an ""additional twist,"" another bureaucrat called it.""The Chairman is in Canada in the context of making more investment,"" a senior official said. The request to meet with the president of the CFIA was ""in the context of the application for export,"" he said, ""which may not be the full reality.""Comeau, Bibeau's spokesperson, tells CBC the Kingston facility now has its licence to export from the CFIA.The Canadian Dairy Commission originally hoped an investor like Feihe could build a second facility, perhaps in Western Canada. But now, the government ""is not in discussion with Canada Royal Milk about additional future investments,"" Comeau said.Earlier plans obtained by CBC News suggested Kingston facility would be exporting by now. Bidtnes told CBC News its production lines are complete and it is pleased with the results of its test batches.""Timelines for beginning commercial production have been stretched into the fall due to the impact of COVID-19 on some regulatory processes,"" she said, adding that the company remains ""confident in our business plans and the support we have received from all levels of government."""

Kazakhstan rejects Chinese warning over pneumonia outbreak | CBC News,Kazakhstan's health officials on Friday dismissed a Chinese claim that the Central Asian country is facing an outbreak of pneumonia more deadly than the new coronavirus.,2020-07-10T15:32:20.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/pneumonia-kazakhstan-1.5644849,"Kazakhstan's health officials on Friday dismissed a Chinese claim that the Central Asian country is facing an outbreak of pneumonia more deadly than the new coronavirus.The Kazakh denial follows a notice issued Thursday by the Chinese Embassy that warned its citizens about an outbreak of pneumonia in the ex-Soviet nation with a death rate higher than that from coronavirus-induced pneumonia.""This information doesn't conform to reality,"" Kazakhstan's Health Ministry said in a statement.It said that the country's statistics on pneumonia include patients who tested negative for the coronavirus but had symptoms compatible with the COVID-19 illness.According to official data, the number of pneumonia cases has increased by 55 per cent in the first half of the year, compared with the same period in 2019 — from 63,436 to 98,546.However, Health Minister Alexei Tsoi said at a briefing Thursday, mortality from pneumonia this year fell from last year's levels — from 1,780 deaths in the first half of 2019 to 1,172 in the first half of 2020.The ministry said its tallies of bacterial, fungal and viral pneumonia infections, which also included cases of unclear causes, were in line with World Health Organization guidelines.The energy-rich Central Asian nation quickly introduced regional lockdown and travel restrictions to stem the COVID-19 pandemic, but it has faced a rise in infections after it lifted the restrictions in May.In late June, Kazakh President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev fired the nation's health minister, blaming him for flaws that helped trigger a second wave of contagion.Kazakh authorities have imposed a two-week nationwide lockdown starting Sunday to contain the COVID-19 outbreak.The country so far has registered over 53,000 cases, including 264 deaths.Asked to comment on Kazakhstan's denial of the Chinese Embassy's claim, China's Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian refrained from comment, saying that Beijing hopes to receive more information.""China looks forward to continuing co-operation with Kazakhstan to jointly fight the epidemic and safeguard public health in both countries,"" he said.WATCH | Pneumonia in Kazakhstan likely related to COVID-19: WHOMike Ryan, head of the WHO's emergencies program, told journalists on Friday that the cases in Kazakhstan are on WHO's radar.Given the country's surge in COVID-19 cases in the last seven days, there's a likely explanation, he said.""The upward trajectory of COVID-19 in the country would suggest that many of these cases are in fact undiagnosed cases of COVID-19,"" Ryan said.Ryan said WHO is keeping an open mind and teams will checks for false negative COVID-19 tests and X-ray patterns.Clusters of atypical pneumonia can occur at any time from other causes such as bacteria that present as Legionnaires' disease or influenza."

Taiwan scrambles fighters as Chinese jets again fly near island | CBC News,"Taiwan's air force scrambled jets for a second consecutive day on Saturday as multiple Chinese aircraft approached the island and crossed the sensitive midline of the Taiwan Strait, with the island's government urging Beijing to ""pull back from the edge.""",2020-09-19T09:08:01.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/china-taiwan-fighter-jets-1.5731034,"Taiwan's air force scrambled jets for a second consecutive day on Saturday as multiple Chinese aircraft approached the island and crossed the sensitive midline of the Taiwan Strait, with the island's government urging Beijing to ""pull back from the edge.""Taiwan's defence ministry said 19 Chinese aircraft were involved, one more than in the previous day, with some crossing the Taiwan Strait midline and others flying into Taiwan's air defence identification zone off its southwest coast.It said China, which claims democratic Taiwan as its own territory, sent 12 J-16 fighters, two J-10 fighters, two J-11 fighters, two H-6 bombers and one Y-8 anti-submarine aircraft. According to a map the ministry provided, none got close to mainland Taiwan itself or flew over it.""ROCAF scrambled fighters, and deployed air defence missile system to monitor the activities,"" the ministry said in a tweet, referring to the Republic of China Air Force, the formal name of Taiwan's air force.Taiwan has complained of repeated incidents of Chinese aircraft near the island this year, and has regularly had to scramble its F-16s and other jets to intercept them.China had on Friday announced at a news conference in Beijing about China's UN peacekeeping efforts combat drills near the Taiwan Strait, and denounced what it called collusion between the island and the United States.U.S. Undersecretary for Economic Affairs Keith Krach arrived in Taipei on Thursday for a three-day visit, the most senior State Department official to come to Taiwan in four decades, angering China. He left Saturday afternoon, according to Taiwan's foreign ministry.Taiwan's defence ministry, in a separate statement, said China was carrying out provocative activities, seriously damaging peace and stability.""The defence ministry sternly condemns this, and calls on the mainland authorities to control themselves and pull back from the edge.""China's widely read state-backed tabloid the Global Times, published by the ruling Communist Party's official People's Daily, said in a Saturday editorial that Friday's drills were a rehearsal to take over Taiwan.""The U.S. and Taiwan must not misjudge the situation, or believe the exercise is a bluff. Should they continue to make provocations, a war will inevitably break out,"" it said.Both sides need to resume dialogue to reduce the risk of war, Johnny Chiang, leader of Taiwan's main opposition party the Kuomintang, wrote on his Facebook page.""People who are willing to play a communication role are stigmatized and people who clamour for war are regarded as heroes. Such an atmosphere is definitely not conducive to the peaceful and stable development of the Taiwan Strait,"" said Chiang, whose party traditionally favours close ties with China.Life has continued as normal in Taiwan with no sign of panic. The island has long been accustomed to living with Chinese threats.Taiwan's people have shown no interest in being ruled by autocratic China, re-electing President Tsai Ing-wen in a landslide last year on what was largely a platform of standing up to Beijing.The latest Chinese flights came the same day Taiwan held a memorial service for former president Lee Teng-hui, dubbed ""Mr. Democracy"" for ending autocratic rule in favour of free elections and championing Taiwan's separate identity from China.Lee, who died in July, became Taiwan's first democratically elected president in March 1996 after eight months of intimidating war games and missile tests by China in waters around the island.Those events brought China and Taiwan to the verge of conflict, prompting the United States to send an aircraft carrier task force to the area in a warning to Beijing's government."

Sino-U.S. relations have plummeted ahead of November's U.S. presidential election.Chinese fighter jets briefly crossed the mid-line of the Taiwan Strait last month as the U.S. Health Secretary Alex Azar was in Taipei, and last week China carried out two days of large-scale drills off Taiwan's southwestern coast.The United States, like most countries, only has official ties with China, not Taiwan, though Washington is the island's main arms supplier and most important international backer.This week, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations had lunch with Taiwan's top envoy in New York. China's U.N. mission said it had lodged ""stern representations"" over the meeting."

John Boyega quits perfume ambassador role over Chinese ad | CBC News,Actor John Boyega stepped down from his role as a global ambassador for perfume brand Jo Malone on Monday after the company decided to hire a Chinese actor to replace him in an ad he created.,2020-09-15T13:57:46.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/john-boyega-perfume-1.5724428,"Actor John Boyega stepped down from his role as a global ambassador for perfume brand Jo Malone on Monday after the company decided to hire a Chinese actor to replace him in an ad he created.The Star Wars star, who is Black, wrote on Twitter that the brand's decision to ""replace my campaign in China by using my concepts and substituting a local brand ambassador for me, without either my consent or prior notice, was wrong.""Jo Malone, an upscale British perfume brand owned by Estée Lauder, has said that replacing Boyega with Chinese star Liu Haoran in the ad campaign was a misstep. It has removed the ad and apologized.The original ad starring Boyega, 28, aired last year and was called The London Gent. It features the London-born actor walking around the neighbourhood where he grew up and riding a horse in a park, and it makes reference to his Nigerian heritage in a scene featuring West African attire.""The film celebrated my personal story — showcasing my hometown, including my friends and featuring my family,"" Boyega wrote.Their decision to replace my campaign in China by using my concepts and substituting a local brand ambassador for me, without either my consent or prior notice, was wrong.

He played a leading role as Finn in 2015's Star Wars: The Force Awakens, but he and other nonwhite characters were removed or diminished from a Chinese poster for the movie.In an interview with GQ magazine, Boyega recently said that Black characters have been ""pushed to the side"" in Disney's Star Wars franchise.

Chinese oil painting fetches record $7.8M,"An anonymous collector has paid the equivalent of $7.8 million Cdn for the Chinese oil painting Slave and Lion, setting new record price paid for such a painting.",2006-11-26T00:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/chinese-oil-painting-fetches-record-7-8m-1.598550,"An anonymous collector has bought a Chinese oil painting in Hong Kongfor the equivalent of $7.8 million Cdn, setting a record price ever paid for such a work of art.Slave and Lion was sold at a Christie's auction on Sunday. The price exceeds a benchmark set only last month for Chinese oil paintings when Danshui by Taiwanese artist Chen Chengbo fetched more than $5 million at a Sotheby's event.Xu Beihong created Slave and Lion during his stay in Berlin during the early 1920s. It depicts the story of Roman slave Androclus, who pulled thorn from a lion's paw. His act of kindness inspires the Roman emperor to free him.The work blends Western form and subject with Chinese line drawing touches.Five months ago, another Xu painting— Silly Old Man Moves a Mountain— sold in Beijing for $4.35 million.Christie's sale of more than 2,000 Chinese works of art and objects from the 20th Century was a goldmine, with buyers and collectors snapping up pieces beyond their estimated bid price.Another major work, Potted Chrysanthemum in a Blue and White Jardiniere by Sanyu, went for $4.25 million.Ken Yeh, the deputy chairman of Christie's Asia, said there's pent-up demand for art from the new wealthy class in Asia, whose bank accounts are brimming with cash from a bullish stock market.""There's just too much money around. People are just eager to buy,"" Yeh said prior to Sunday's bidding.He added thatthe newly-rich see art as a valuable asset.Last week, Hong Kong real estate tycoon Joseph Lau, paid $17.4 million for pop artist Andy Warhol's iconic portrait of China's Mao Zedong.Yeh said at least one out of four buyers at Christie's auctions are Chinese and that number is rising.Christie's estimates Hong Kong is the world's third most important art market after New York and London."

Chinese tabloid blasts Canada over lobster dispute | CBC News,Communist Party media in China rebuked and threatened Nova Scotia lobster shippers this week for expressing concerns over new roadblocks to getting products into China.,2020-06-25T09:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/chinese-state-media-global-times-lobster-dispute-canada-1.5626025,"Communist Party media in China rebuked and threatened Nova Scotia lobster shippers this week for expressing concerns over new roadblocks to getting products into China.The party tabloid Global Times says recent border measures are about food safety after a COVID-19 outbreak was linked to a Beijing food market, ""rather than an excuse to target any specific country.""""It's Canada's choice to export to China, and Canada needs to abide by Chinese regulations, which may be adjusted when necessary in accordance with the COVID-19 situation,"" Bai Ming, a research fellow at the Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Co-operation, told the Global Times on Monday.The tabloid, known for its nationalist tone on international issues, discounted complaints raised by Canadian lobster shippers quoted in CBC News reporting.It also linked the issue to the arrest in Canada and ongoing extradition proceedings against Huawei chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou.""Experts warned that the Canadian side should be fully aware that its attitude in Meng's case is the only roadblock between the two countries,"" it said. ""If the Canadian side does not remove it, a disruption in the lobster trade might be just the tip of the iceberg in bilateral trade, as fraught ties have already undermined confidence in business communities on both sides.""Chinese authorities began random testing of imported food after a COVID-19 outbreak earlier this month was traced to a cutting board used on imported Atlantic salmon at the Xinfadi market in Beijing.Live lobster shipments from Canada, valued at $457 million last year, were particularly vulnerable.Most of that lobster comes from Nova Scotia, which has seen its sales in China soar in recent years.After the inspections started, some Nova Scotia companies cancelled live shipments rather than risk delays of up to 36 hours waiting for test results when the perishable product arrives.Exporters must now also sign a Chinese customs declaration assuming liability if COVID-19 is detected.Obsorne Burke of Victoria Co-op Fisheries in Cape Breton, which ships frozen lobster to China, refused to sign.He's leery of the Chinese legal system and dubious about the risk of the coronavirus, citing public health agencies in Canada and elsewhere that say there is no scientific evidence the virus is transmitted by food or food packaging.""We have to take a stand or push back and say this does not make any scientific sense,"" he said.The Global Times said exporters should get over it.""The newly adopted requirements for coronavirus-free declarations apply to all suppliers across the world and all food products,"" it said in a front page editorial this week, one of two articles devoted to the issue of Canadian lobster shipments.The tabloid hit back at reaction from Canadian lobster exporters quoted by CBC.""A major Chinese salmon importer told the Global Times on Monday that all of its suppliers are co-operative and willing to sign the declaration as they 'want to do business with China,'"" Global Times reported.""The company said, compared with Canada, it prefers to do business with countries like Chile, which has a mature, industrialized industry chain and is also co-operative with and respectful of Chinese regulations.""The question of whether lobster shippers should sign a declaration that assumes some form of liability for COVID-19 in China has split the Nova Scotia lobster industry.Some exporters have agreed to sign the declaration, others have not.The Nova Scotia Seafood Alliance has lawyers from the Atlantic Canadian law firm Cox Palmer reviewing the document and drafting a declaration shippers could send to customers in China that asserts the safety of the product without assuming liability.  The industry group says there is no consensus among members at this point for a unified response.The Global Times article challenged those who have opted not to sign.""Since the Canadian exporters are so confident about their management, why don't they have the courage to sign the declaration,"" Bai asked, noting that Canada ought to understand, ""China has such a regulation only because there is a risk of the virus spreading.""The Trudeau government avoided taking a stand when asked by the Nova Scotia government whether exporters should sign the declaration.Global Affairs Canada said since the customs demand was delivered by Chinese companies ""to the industry from industry,"" the Canadian Food Inspection Agency is leaving it to individual exporters to decide whether they sign.""It's absolutely not acceptable,"" said Chris d'Entremont, a Nova Scotia Conservative Member of Parliament.D'Entremont said the federal government should explain to industry exactly what accepting liability might mean.""We should be understanding through CFIA what exactly the implications are going to be here. To accept a certain liability is one thing on your product, but a liability for the spread of a virus is something completely different. I think this is a humongous overreach by China,"" he said.The Chinese embassy in Ottawa did not respond to a request for comment from CBC News."
Calgary police investigate racist graffiti at Chinese Consulate | CBC News,Racist graffiti on the Chinese Consulate downtown is being investigated by Calgary police.,2020-05-27T19:46:58.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/calgary-police-investigate-racist-graffiti-on-chinese-consulate-1.5587110,"Police are investigating a possible hate crime after racist graffiti was spray painted on a wall at the Chinese Consulate in downtown Calgary early Wednesday.Three people dressed in black and wearing masks approached the building on Sixth Avenue S.W. at 3:30 a.m., and spray painted a vulgar message before leaving, police said.It was the second time this month the consulate has been targeted with graffiti. Another message was spray painted in front of the building on May 19.The Chinese Consulate General turned over surveillance video captured by closed-circuit TV to police, who have released images of the suspects.The graffiti included the phrase ""China Virus."" There have been reports of increased racism and hate-motivated crimes targeting the Chinese community and people of Asian descent during the coronavirus pandemic.""The pandemic has led to a lot of political debate and strong views, and people are obviously free to hold whatever view they wish,"" said Const. Craig Collins, hate crimes co-ordinator with the Calgary police. ""But when people are targeting others for ill treatment or committing crimes because of those views, we have a duty to get involved.""Police said there has been a slight increase in incidents targeting those groups.""Generally, we have not seen the same spike in hate crimes that some other areas have seen,"" Collins said. ""But we are hearing from the Chinese community that they are concerned about growing hostility, so we are monitoring it closely.""Police said hate-motivated crimes are crimes where the offender was motivated by bias, prejudice or hate based on certain personal characteristics of the victim, like race. Hate as a motivation is considered after a person is found guilty, during sentencing.The consulate said in a statement that it strongly condemns the insult and threat, which it said violate both international and Canadian laws.""The Consulate General encourages the police to solve this case as soon as possible, and take necessary measures to better protect the safety and dignity of the Consulate, its staff and its properties,"" a consulate spokesperson said in an emailed statement."

New poll reveals Chinese-Canadians' experiences with racism | CBC News,A new poll from the Angus Reid Institute and the University of Alberta suggests the majority of people who identify as Chinese-Canadian have experience some type of racism since the pandemic began.,2020-06-22T07:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/new-poll-reveals-chinese-canadians-experiences-with-racism-1.5621261,"A new poll from the non-profit Angus Reid Institute and the University of Alberta suggests a large percentage of people who identify as Chinese-Canadian have experienced some type of racism since the coronavirus pandemic began. Of the more than 500 Canadians of Chinese ethnicity surveyed from across Canada, half reported being called names or insulted as a direct result of COVID-19, and 43 per cent said they had been personally threatened or intimidated. Shachi Kurl, executive director of the Angus Reid Institute, says the poll shines a light on the extent of racism across the country. ""I think the numbers are fairly stark,"" Kurl said.Of those who responded, nearly a third said they had been frequently exposed to racist graffiti or messaging on social media. Also, 61 per cent said they had adjusted their routines ""to avoid run-ins or otherwise unpleasant encounters"" since the pandemic began. The online survey was conducted from June 15-18, 2020 among a representative randomized sample of 516 Canadian adults who self-identify as being ethnically Chinese and are members of Angus Reid Forum or Inclusive Insights. For comparison purposes only, a probability sample of this size would carry a margin of error of plus or minus 4.3 percentage points, 19 times out of 20.For Kurl, one of the most troubling findings of the survey is despite the fact that 88 per cent of respondents agreed that ""being Canadian is an important part of my identity,"" only 13 per cent agreed that others see them as Canadian all the time.""It says to me that you can be in this country for five years or you can be fourth generation but because of the way you look there is still a barrier to being accepted or to be viewed as fully Canadian by others,"" Kurl said.WATCH | Many Asian-Canadians experienced racism during pandemic: surveyThe NationalNearly 80 per cent of the respondents said they felt strongly that Canadians blame people of Chinese ethnicity for COVID-19, and two-thirds said North American news outlets have had a negative effect on Canadian views of people of Chinese ethnicity.Henry Yu, a history professor at the University of British Columbia, says the results of the survey don't come as a surprise at all.Yu commended the Angus Reid Institute for capturing the systemic racism that is often dismissed as an isolated incident.""I think it's vitally important in Canada that we do more collection of this kind of data,"" Yu said. ""How do you know where there's racism if you never actually look for it?""Yu says to date it has been up to victims of racism themselves to track trends through strategies like Project 1907's centralized racism reporting centre to prove that incidents of hate are widespread.Treating incidents of racism and discrimination as isolated incidents bolsters denial and silence about racism in Canada, Yu says, and makes it difficult for those who have experienced it to believe that it's happening to them. The survey was limited to people who identify as being of Chinese ethnicity, but Yu says the same results would likely apply to many Asian-Canadians or anyone else who might be seen as Chinese-Canadian — as was the case with Dakota Holmes, an Indigenous woman who was attacked and told to ""go back to Asia"" when she was out walking her dog in East Vancouver."

Taiwan warns off Chinese fighters that approached island | CBC News,"Taiwan's air force warned off several Chinese fighter jets that briefly entered Taiwan's air defence identification zone to its southwest on Tuesday, the defence ministry said.",2020-06-09T12:46:44.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/taiwan-warns-off-chinese-fighters-that-approached-island-1.5604180,"Taiwan's air force warned off several Chinese fighter jets that briefly entered Taiwan's air defence identification zone to its southwest on Tuesday, the defence ministry said.The Su-30 fighters, some of China's most advanced jets, were given verbal warnings to leave and Taiwanese air force jets ""drove away"" the intruders, the ministry added.Taiwan has complained that China, which claims the democratic island as its own, has stepped up military activities in recent months, menacing Taiwan even as the world deals with the coronavirus pandemic.China says such exercises are nothing unusual.China has never renounced the use of force to bring Taiwan under its control. One of China's most senior generals last month said China would attack if there was no other way of stopping Taiwan from becoming independent.China is deeply suspicious of Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen, whom it accuses of being a separatist bent on declaring formal independence. Tsai says Taiwan is already an independent country called the Republic of China, its official name.The United States has stepped up its military activities near the island too, with semi-regular navy voyages through the narrow Taiwan Strait.A U.S. C-40A, a military version of the Boeing 737, had entered Taiwanese air space with permission, though it did not land at any Taiwanese airports, Taiwan's defence ministry said in a separate statement on Tuesday.The U.S. aircraft took off from Japan's Okinawa island, where there is a major U.S. air base, and flew over northern and western Taiwan on its way to Southeast Asia, Taiwanese media reported.While Washington and Taipei have no formal diplomatic ties, the United States is Taiwan's strongest international supporter and main arms supplier, which is another source of U.S.-China tension."
Retailers hope Chinese New Year sales bring good fortune,Hong Kong is even more of a shopper's paradise this week than usual thanks to sales marking Lunar New Year.,2013-02-11T00:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/retailers-hope-chinese-new-year-sales-bring-good-fortune-1.1314443,"It may be the Year of the Snake but there are 20 adorable panda bears greeting shoppers this week at Hong Kong's ifc mall as they pick up last minute gifts for Lunar New Year.The animals aren't real but the lifelike pandas are still a hit with locals and tourists who pose for photos with the bears.""We try and do things that are relevant to Chinese society and to Hong Kong society and pandas are one of those things,"" said Karim Azar, general manager of retail leasing for the mall's management company.""Pandas are a national treasure for Chinese people,"" he said, adding they are a symbol of friendship and good luck.The panda displays are the main attraction of ifc's Chinese New Year promotion campaign, which also includes gift giveaways, performances and other activities. After Christmas, this is the second biggest time of year for the mall, said Azar.""It's been very busy, a couple of shops have run out of things,"" he said, noting that shoes and watches are big sellers before the new year because it's bad luck to buy them after. Clothing is also popular because of the tradition of wearing new clothes when visiting family over the holiday period that begins on Sunday.Hong Kong, known as a prime shopping destination in Asia, has been even more of a shopper's paradise this week than usual with Lunar New Year sales now in full effect.Major multinational stores that are keen to grow in the Asian market have promotional campaigns specifically targeting the holiday. A Gap store in Hong Kong's Central district is giving away Chinese New Year-themed t-shirts and tote bags with purchases over $65, while across the street at H&M, signs proclaiming ""Chinese New Year Deals"" hang from the ceiling.Further down the street at Marks & Spencer, shoppers are getting 20 per cent off seasonal food. Burberry has been running full-page advertisements in newspapers, and their store windows, decorated in red, are wishing passers-by a happy new year. Starbucks stores, meanwhile, are selling gift envelopes with Chinese New Year designs.Meagan Fitzpatrick has been posted to Hong Kong to bolster CBC's coverage of a dynamic region of the world. Hong Kong is known as an international financial centre, but there is much more to it than that, and it has close connections to Canada. The city of seven million hosts nearly 300,000 Canadians, and about 500,000 people of Hong Kong descent make their home in Canada. Meagan is a senior online writer who covers national news and federal politics in CBC's Ottawa bureau. You can follow her on Twitter @fitzpatrick_m.Apple's Asia division has an online New Year gift guide urging shoppers to ""Take home the perfect gifts,"" referencing the millions of Chinese who travel home to see family over the holiday period. The company held a ""Red Friday"" sale on Jan. 25, offering deals only to its customers in Hong Kong and other Asian countries.Kenneth Chiu left work on Thursday with an iPad mini, courtesy of his boss, and was carrying it under his arm as he walked with a colleague, who also had one under her arm. All employees in their office received one as an end-of-year treat.""Nice boss,"" Chiu said with a big smile. Chiu has already finished his own shopping for Chinese New Year, buying all new basketball clothes for his son, whom he is trying to sway away from playing soccer.This is a peak time of year for multinationals to make gains in their Asian markets, according to Niraj Dawar, a marketing professor at Richard Ivey School of Business at Western University in London, Ont., so they are trying to make the most of the holiday season.""They're doing this because they expect 50 per cent of their growth over the next 10 years to come from the emerging markets and of course China is at the forefront,"" said Dawar, who teaches at Ivey's Hong Kong campus every year.""It pays for them to understand the consumer, what drives the consumer, when are they most likely to spend money … most likely to be susceptible to marketing messages,"" said Dawar.One Chinese New Year tradition is to give money in red envelopes to children and unmarried friends and relatives but the holiday is increasingly becoming a more commercial one, according to Dawar.That's good news for the retail sector in Hong Kong, which has been struggling in the last year. The Hong Kong Retail Management Association called 2012 a ""bumpy"" year. Retail sales slipped from double-digit growth at the start of the year down to 3.9 per cent in July.But there are recent signs of a rebound. Growth in December was up at 8.8 per cent, and the sector is hoping for sustained growth through the holiday period.The ifc mall along Hong Kong's iconic waterfront sees 225,000 people pass through its doors on an average day, and Azar said he's happy with the amount of added traffic this holiday season. Sales figures will be hard to compare to last year since Chinese New Year fell in January in 2012, but he's expecting at least a 20 per cent increase over last February."

Rescue efforts continue after deadly Chinese quake,Stranded tourists and residents struggle to clear roads and cope with power cuts caused by a powerful earthquake that killed at least 19 people and injured 247.,2017-08-09T00:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/china-earthquake-sichuan-1.4239892,"Stranded tourists and residents struggled Wednesday to clear roads and cope with power cuts caused by a powerful earthquake that killed at least 19 people and injured 247.The magnitude 6.5 quake struck a mountainous region near a national park that is one of the country's top tourist attractions. Rescuers dug through rubble with their hands and used detectors to search for signs of life. The Tuesday night quake knocked out power and phone networks, complicating efforts to locate and evacuate survivors.Most of the deaths and injuries were recorded in Zhangzha township, near to Jiuzhaigou or Jiuzhai Valley, a national park known for spectacular waterfalls and karst formations that attracts visitors from China and overseas.Yang Jie, who owns a hostel in Zhangzha, said she was at a hotpot restaurant with friends when the lights went out and everything started shaking at around 9:20 p.m. Tuesday.""People were rushing out, some people were screaming,"" Yang said by phone. ""On our way home, there were rocks falling down from the hills on both sides of the road. We couldn't get through on the phone because there was no signal.""Yang and her friends returned to find large cracks in her hostel and set up tents outside for guests to sleep in.On Wednesday, she said the building was still without power, stores were closed and ""houses around us are [damaged] beyond recognition.""""The whole night, even right now, there has been no one from the government dropping by to tell us what's going on or what to do,"" Yang said. ""There were more than 30 guests at my hostel, I have to start fires to keep them warm. ... We cleared the path and moved rocks away this morning so that my guests could leave by car.""President Xi Jinping called for rapid efforts to respond to the disaster, which struck a quake-prone region bordered by Sichuan and Gansu provinces. The area is on the edge of the Tibetan Plateau and home to many Tibetan and other ethnic minority villages.Among the injured, 40 were listed in serious condition, according to the Aba Tibetan and Qiang Autonomous Prefecture government in Sichuan. At least five of the dead were tourists, China's official Xinhua News Agency said. Hong Kong's immigration department said one of the city's residents was missing in the quake.A Canadian woman suffered a slight head injury and a French citizen was wounded in both legs and needed surgery to remove stone fragments, according to Xinhua. It said Frenchman Maxence Vallon, 18, was staying with his mother and brother at a hotel in Jiuzhaigou.They were seeking shelter outside ""when a big stone fell and hit my brother right in the leg,"" said Romain Vallon, who studies in Beijing.The dead included a performer in an arts group who was buried in the quake and found Wednesday morning. She and others had been performing in Jiuzhaigou when the quake struck. According to the Legal Evening News, they were acting out a scene about a deadly 2008 earthquake that struck nearby and killed nearly 90,000 people. When Tuesday's quake hit, the performers ran off the stage in terror and the audience thought the tremor was part of the show.In footage shown on state broadcaster China Central Television, rescuers picked away rubble from around a body, then stood silently in a row, with helmets off and heads bowed to pay their respects.Other orange-suited rescuers were shown using detectors to search for survivors in the dark of night, carrying a girl to safety and leading other people along a rubble-strewn road.Prelim M6.3 earthquake northern Xinjiang, China Aug-8 23:27 UTC, updates <a href=""https://t.co/gEFJWMbjgZ"">https://t.co/gEFJWMbjgZ</a>The U.S. Geological Survey measured the quake at magnitude 6.5 and said it struck at a depth of just nine kilometres. Shallow earthquakes tend to cause more damage than deeper ones.Xinhua said more than 30,000 tourists visiting Jiuzhaigou were relocated to safer accommodations.On Wednesday morning, another strong earthquake struck far northwestern China, some 2,200 kilometres from Jiuzhaigou, injuring 32 people, two of them seriously, and damaging more than 1,000 houses, Xinhua reported. That quake was measured at 6.3 by the USGS and struck in a sparsely populated area of the Xinjiang region near the Kazakhstan border. "

Chinese lawmakers endorse Hong Kong national security law | CBC News,China's ceremonial legislature overwhelmingly endorsed a national security law for Hong Kong on Thursday that has strained relations with the United States and Britain and triggered protests in the semi-autonomous territory.,2020-05-28T06:49:40.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/china-security-law-hong-kong-1.5587892,"China's ceremonial legislature overwhelmingly endorsed a national security law for Hong Kong on Thursday that has strained relations with the United States and Britain and triggered protests in the semi-autonomous territory.The National People's Congress backed the bill by a vote of 2,878 to one with six abstentions as it wrapped up an annual session that was held under intensive anti-coronavirus controls.The move will ultimately change the territory's mini-constitution, or Basic Law, adding a national security law to be decided later by Chinese leaders. The standing committee of the National People's Congress that handles most legislation will work out its details.Activists in Hong Kong say the law will undermine civil liberties and might be used to suppress political activity.Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam, who came under fire for her handling of protests last year over an extradition bill that was eventually scrapped, said that fear was misplaced. She said the decision from Beijing was welcome because of the difficulty her government faces in passing national security legislation on its own. Lam said in a statement that new laws would ""sanction an extremely small minority of criminals who threaten national security"" and ""not affect the legitimate rights and freedoms enjoyed by Hong Kong residents.""The law and the way it is being enacted prompted U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to announce on Wednesday that Washington will no longer treat Hong Kong as autonomous from Beijing. That sets the stage for the possible withdrawal of the preferential trade and financial status the U.S. accords the former British colony.On Thursday, Canada, Australia, the United Kingdom and the U.S. issued a statement condemning the legislation as a violation of a previous United Nations joint declaration concerning Hong Kong and an action that threatens to undermine the ""one country, two systems"" arrangement under which the territory retained its own Western-style social, legal and political institutions after being handed over from British to Chinese rule in 1997.""Direct imposition of national security legislation on Hong Kong by the Beijing authorities, rather than through Hong Kong's own institutions as provided for under Article 23 of the Basic Law, would curtail the Hong Kong people's liberties, and in doing so, dramatically erode the autonomy and the system that made it so prosperous,"" the statement read.The countries said they were concerned the move ""will exacerbate the existing deep divisions in Hong Kong society; the law does nothing to build mutual understanding and foster reconciliation within Hong Kong.""Joining the U.S. and other countries in expressing concern, Japan's chief cabinet secretary Yoshihide Suga said it was important for Hong Kong to have a ""stable and democratic development.""""We are deeply worried about the National People's Congress this time conducting the vote amid deep concern within the international community and Hong Kong citizens"" Suga said.The measure is designed for ""Hong Kong's long-term prosperity and stability,"" Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said following the closing of the NPC's annual session. Li offered no details about what specific areas the law would cover. At the United Nations, China blocked a United Nations Security Council meeting to discuss the legislation on Wednesday. Ambassador Zhang Jun said on Twitter that Hong Kong matters are ""purely China's internal affairs.""Earlier Thursday, three pro-democracy lawmakers were ejected from Hong Kong's legislative chamber, disrupting the second day of debate on a contentious bill that would criminalize insulting or abusing the Chinese national anthem.The legislature's president, Andrew Leung, suspended the meeting minutes after it began and ejected Eddie Chu for holding up a sarcastic sign about a pro-Beijing lawmaker that read, ""Best Chairperson, Starry Lee.""A second pro-democracy lawmaker was ejected for yelling after the meeting resumed, and then a third after rushing forward with a large plastic bottle in a cloth bag that spilled its brownish contents on the floor in front of the president's raised dais.The third lawmaker, Ted Hui, later described the contents as a rotten plant, and said he wanted Leung to feel and smell the rotting of Hong Kong's civilization and rule of law, and of the ""one country, two systems"" framework that democracy activists feel is under attack by China's ruling Communist Party. The city's pro-democracy opposition sees both the security legislation and the anthem law as assaults on that autonomy, and the U.S. has called on China to back off on the security law."

Canadian-approved N95 mask targeted by Chinese counterfeiters | CBC News,A Chinese-made mask approved by Health Canada is the subject of a counterfeit warning issued by the Centers for Disease Control in the U.S.,2020-05-14T08:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/chinese-masks-counterfeit-pandemic-covid-1.5568246,"A Chinese-made mask approved by Health Canada is the subject of a counterfeit warning issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the U.S.The Associated Press has reported that counterfeit masks, intended to mimic medical-grade N95 masks made by the Shanghai Dasheng company and approved for use in Canada, already have been distributed to front-line medical staff at some U.S. hospitals.And a separate Chinese mask maker also licensed by Health Canada has seen its approval pulled by the Food and Drug Administration in the United States.The Guangdong Golden Leaves Technology Development Co. Ltd. was one of 65 Chinese manufacturers whose authorization to sell in the U.S. was withdrawn following tests by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC).The manufacturer remains approved in Canada, but its product has not been distributed to health care workers here, a spokesperson for Public Services and Procurement Canada told CBC News.Both cases illustrate the difficulties faced by governments in trying to procure reliable masks when a flood of fake, shoddy and deceptively-labelled products is pouring out of China.All masks approved for use in U.S. hospitals must have a Testing and Certification (TC) number issued by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. The CDC has warned that the TC number issued to the Shanghai Dasheng Co. for its masks — TC 84A-4329 — has been misappropriated by other Chinese makers seeking to sell substandard products in the U.S. market.U.S. government agencies like the National Park Service have been warning their workers to watch out for the fake masks.Health Canada approved Shanghai Dasheng's DTC3X N95 masks by interim order on April 27. That interim order process has been used during the pandemic to fast-track approval of medical devices for use in Canada.West Virginia distributed 50,000 fake DTC3X masks to first responders — and kept them in use after the CDC warned the state they might be counterfeit, and after the real Shanghai Dasheng Co. warned that its products were being faked.CBC News has asked Health Canada and Public Services and Procurement Canada about the masks, but has not yet received an answer.Canada was badly burned once already when it bought millions of defective masks from a Montreal-based supplier that uses Chinese manufacturers.The U.S. government had to withdraw dozens of approvals for Chinese manufacturers of medical masks last week after tests showed that many did not meet minimum standards for protecting medical workers.One of those mask manufacturers also had received approval in Canada.Products made by Guangdong Golden Leaves Technology Development Co. Ltd. had been cleared for use in the U.S. under an ""Emergency Use Authorization"" (EUA) issued by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on April 3.The same maker was approved by Health Canada on May 5.But on May 9, the FDA withdrew the company's U.S. licence. That decision followed tests by the CDC that showed many of the Chinese masks permitted under the EUA fell far below the filtration standards guaranteed by their producers.CDC has not published a test of the Guangdong Golden Leaves mask, but appears to have de-listed it as a precaution after other masks approved by the same Emergency Use Authorization tested poorly.While Canada tests masks before approving them for use, the U.S. government chose to grant approvals before testing.Of 11 masks tested by the CDC for which results were published, only four met specifications. The stop-use order relates not only to the seven that failed, but also to dozens of others that have yet to be tested, including the Guangdong Golden Leaves mask.Just 14 of the 80 Chinese mask makers approved in the original order remain cleared for use in the United States today.""While the FDA continues to take action to balance the urgent need of supplies of respirators for health care personnel, we are also doing everything in our authority to ensure health care personnel receive adequate protection,"" the agency said in a statement.The test results just for masks shipped from China's Guangdong province show vast differences in quality.Some of the Chinese manufacturers shipped masks that performed superbly in tests.N95 and KN95 masks are supposed to be able to filter at least 95 per cent of all particles measuring 0.3 microns in diameter. All 10 samples of the KN95 produced by Guangdong Energy Fortress Pharmaceutical Co. passed that test, and four of them performed at 100 per cent filtration.A mask produced by Guangdong Medical Technology Co. produced equally consistent results.But none of the 10 samples of the mask produced by Guangdong Qian Jing Testing Co. filtered more than 76 per cent of particles — a dismal rating.And masks produced by Guangdong Nuokong Medical Technology Co. appeared to be from two very different production runs. Of the 10 samples tested, five produced good filtration rates of between 98 and 99 per cent, but five gave only 24 to 26 per cent protection.The pandemic has inspired many manufacturers in China to jump into the personal protective equipment (PPE) business to take advantage of the scramble among countries around the world to procure supplies.While many of the companies approved by the FDA in the April 4 emergency order were traditional medical supply firms with a history of making such products, the names of some approved companies reveal an origin that has little to do with health or medicine: DongGuan HuaGang Communication Technology Co., Fujian Pageone Garment Co, Ltd., Guangzhou Sunjoy Auto Supplies Co., Yiwu Henghao Household Products Co., Yiwu Yifan Knitting Co., the Zhejiang Shengtai Baby Products Co.None of those non-medical companies appear to have survived the FDA's cull of manufacturers.Nine of the Chinese mask manufacturers that retained their approvals in the U.S. also have been approved in Canada, but none of the masks that failed CDC tests appear on the Canadian approved list.However, on Monday, Health Canada issued a recall of KN95 respirators manufactured by dozens of Chinese companies following CDC tests that found the masks ""failed to meet 95 per cent filtration specifications.""A recall bulletin was sent to companies across Canada authorized to import or distribute supplies for use in hospitals or other health-care institutions, instructing them to ""stop-sale"" of the masks and relabel them for use in non-healthcare settings where 95 per cent filtration isn't necessary.Ottawa said the recall action did ""not implicate KN95 respirators purchased by the Government of Canada and tested by the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC).""Concerns over the quality of PPE and test kits have arisen outside North America as well. Several European countries have had sometimes acrimonious disputes with China over the quality and reliability of shipments.Fast-track approval processes were adopted in many countries to speed up the delivery of supplies, and sometimes that has opened the door to substandard equipment.Both the U.S. and the United Kingdom have reported serious problems with test kits that were granted expedited approval.Canada also has bought defective test kits from China.In some cases, disputes over shoddy Chinese shipments to Europe have led to diplomatic incidents, with Chinese embassies vigorously defending the quality of shipments condemned by local health authorities."
N.L. woman accosted with anti-Chinese racism for 3rd time during pandemic | CBC News,A Chinese woman says she was called a pig and a dog-eater on a popular walking trail in St. John's.,2020-09-07T16:01:56.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/racism-mundy-pond-st-johns-1.5714808,"A PhD student from China says she was called a pig and a dog-eater during a racist confrontation with two teenagers on a popular walking trail in St. John's.Ting-ting Chen managed to snap a picture of the boys running away after accosting her on Friday on the Mundy Pond trail.It's just the latest racist incident Chen has encountered since the COVID-19 pandemic arrived in Newfoundland and Labrador, bringing with it a wave of anti-Chinese sentiment, some of which has been caught on camera.""I have been here two years, and I can hardly imagine I would have suffered from this two years ago before the pandemic,"" Chen told CBC N.L.'s Meg Roberts on Sunday.""I think the pandemic just became [an] impetus for the racism here to be thriving and rise up, and that really saddens my heart.""In a recent video shared with NTV News, well-known brewery owner Dave Fong was accosted by a woman outside his home in the historic Quidi Vidi Village of St. John's. The video shows her screaming at Fong to ""go back to where you came from.""Fong's family has been in Newfoundland and Labrador since the 1890s.He did spend some time in nearby Carbonear as a child, but that doesn't seem to be what the woman was referring to.She's been charged with criminal harassment and has a court date Oct. 5 in St. John's.Chen — who is studying Newfoundland folklore at Memorial University — has been subject to the same vitriol.The first time happened when she was walking downtown and a car rolled past her with the windows down. Someone leaned out and shouted ""Virus!"" at her.The second time, a man shouted at her to ""Go back to China.""The last straw was when the two teenaged boys made squinted eyes at her and spewed lewd nonsense in her direction.""I just tell them this is not right and you should be better taught. Shame on you,"" she said.""Racist ideas have already poisoned our young generations like that. I was astonished.""Chen stressed that the real troublesome minority is not any racial or ethnic group, but the racists themselves.She said her time in Newfoundland has been marked by wonderful hospitality. A local resident invited her to live rent-free with them for two months when she first arrived so she could have a guided introduction to the province. Another friend has invited her to spend Christmas with her family for the last two years.But she said it was time to speak about the ugly side and address it head-on.The first time she experienced racism, it shocked her.The second time, it scared her. She didn't go outside for a month, afraid of what people would say or think about her.The third time, it made her angry.""I don't want to see this small percentage of people destroy the beauty of Newfoundland,"" Chen said. ""I still love Newfoundland for sure, because I know all these haters and racists are only a small percentage, and they don't, and they can't, represent all Newfoundlanders at all.""Read more from CBC Newfoundland and Labrador"

Chinese Canadian Museum of B.C. opens first exhibit in Vancouver's Chinatown | CBC News,"A giant, intricate dragon mask and a hand-painted wok greet visitors to the first-ever exhibition of the Chinese Canadian Museum of British Columbia in Vancouver's Chinatown.",2020-08-13T21:57:45.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/chinese-canadian-museum-bc-exhibit-vancouver-chinatown-1.5685481,"A giant, intricate dragon mask and a hand-painted wok greet visitors to the first-ever exhibition of the Chinese Canadian Museum of British Columbia in Vancouver's Chinatown.The exhibition called A Seat at the Table explores historical and contemporary experiences of Chinese Canadians, particularly through the lens of food and restaurants.""A close look at the food industry reveals the impact of racial discrimination on Chinese Canadians, but it also tells us much about their ability to resist, organize, seek justice and thrive,"" reads the museum's description of the exhibition that opens Saturday.In one installation, the story of a campaign to save barbecue meat stores in Chinatown in the mid-1970s is told through delicate, miniature paper cut-outs of the storefronts and their supporters, as a spotlight casts their shadows high up on the wall.Co-curator Viviane Gosselin said the exhibition was two years in the making and involved historians, educators, students, community activists and staff at the Museum of Vancouver, who collected a wide range of personal stories and items of significance from members of the Chinese Canadian community in B.C.Their goal was to highlight the diversity of Chinese Canadian experiences and create a space where people feel comfortable sharing their own stories, she said.""All the clusters of images and videos and artifacts are there to act as prompts for people to kind of trigger their memory,"" said Gosselin, the director of collections and exhibitions at the Museum of Vancouver, which is partnered with the Chinese Canadian Museum of B.C.A Seat at the Table includes stations for writing and recording videos, as well as a large map where visitors can illustrate where they have come from, she said.""The whole idea is to kind of generate a new body of historical knowledge that the Chinese Canadian Museum can use for future research and programming,"" said Gosselin.Grace Wong, the chair of the society that's working to fully establish the Chinese Canadian Museum, said the exhibition recognizes the contributions of Chinese Canadians across B.C.""Everything from the 1880s — all the struggles, all the contributions, all of the work, whether it was building the railway, whether it was contributing in the world wars, despite not having any status.""A Seat at the Table opens amid the COVID-19 pandemic and the Vancouver Police Department has reported that incidents of racism directed at Asian people are on the rise.Co-curator Denise Fong wore a face mask printed with the phrase ""stop the spread of racism"" while touring the exhibition this week, saying she hopes the exhibition will spur conversations about how people can make change in their day-to-day lives.A Seat at the Table is presented in English as well as traditional and simplified Chinese, Fong noted.A so-called sister exhibition is set to open at the Museum of Vancouver's main location in the fall.Both exhibitions are expected to travel across B.C. within a year, said Gosselin, noting they're designed to incorporate fresh content each time they open in a new location.The B.C. government announced an investment of $10 million to establish the Chinese Canadian Museum last month, calling it the first museum of its kind in Canada.It also gave the City of Vancouver $1 million last year to support the establishment of the museum with satellite locations planned in other communities, as well as an online portal offering interactive experiences at historical locations across the province.The museum is part of a joint effort by the province and Vancouver to have the city's Chinatown designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site."

Mystery surrounds explosion in North Korean city on Chinese border | CBC News,A video obtained by The Associated Press shows plumes of black smoke rising from a North Korean city near the border with China amid reports that deadly explosions occurred there earlier this week.,2020-08-05T14:18:13.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/north-korea-hyesan-explosion-1.5674866,"A video obtained by The Associated Press shows plumes of black smoke rising from a North Korean city near the border with China amid reports that deadly explosions occurred there earlier this week.There has been no official word from North Korea or China about what happened in the North Korean city of Hyesan on Monday. But South Korean media and outside monitoring groups reported that gas explosions in a residential area left dozens of people dead or injured. The AP couldn't independently confirm the reports.The video acquired by AP shows orange flames and black smoke shooting into the sky from Hyesan as loud explosion-like sounds are heard. A few people can be seen watching the scene from the Chinese side of the border.The video was provided by Wang Bo, a travel agent who said he shot it from a park in the Chinese border town of Changbai.""I just saw explosions and there were a lot of onlookers who were looking in that direction. We don't know the reason why there were explosions,"" Wang said.Wang, who said he has previously visited Hyesan, said the explosions happened not far from the city's orphanage and tourism office.Many Chinese border towns are very close to North Korea, separated only by the river border.Wang said from Binjiang Park in Changbai, where he shot the video, ""in summer, we can see North Koreans swim in the river, and in winter, people can walk on the frozen Yalu River.""The Associated Press verified the location after examining other tourist videos of the park that show the same structures and lights. Other videos of the reported explosions have been circulating on Chinese and South Korean social media.In Seoul, South Korea's spy agency and the Unification Ministry, which handles relations with North Korea, said they couldn't immediately confirm the reported explosions. Still, Unification Ministry spokesperson Yoh Sangkey told reporters he felt sorry for any possible casualties.The Seoul-based Daily NK, which specializes in North Korea news, on Wednesday cited unidentified sources in North Korea as saying that the explosions left 15 people dead and the death toll could rise. It earlier reported that gasoline stored at a house in Hyesan ignited and led to the explosion of a nearby liquid petroleum gas cylinder, and this caused chain explosions of gas cylinders attached to other houses.Other South Korean media carried similar reports. Ahn Kyung-su, a researcher, said one of his North Korean refugee sources in South Korea told him that she heard from her relative in Hyesan about the reported explosions during a phone conversation on Tuesday.North Korean state media, which rarely acknowledge deadly accidents in the country, haven't commented on the reported explosions.But in 2017, state media reported six people died when the roof of a mine collapsed. In 2014, state media said government officials had offered an apology for the collapse of an apartment building under construction in Pyongyang, the capital."

Ltd. says it has appointed Mark Wall as CEO of Streamers Gold Mining Corp. Ltd., its wholly owned subsidiary in Canada.Shandong's $230-million offer to buy TMAC, owner of the Hope Bay mining project in Nunavut, has received Chinese regulatory approvals and TMAC shareholders voted in favour of it in June. The Hope Bay gold mine project is located 125 kilometres southwest of Cambridge Bay.The Commissioner of Competition has issued a ""no action"" letter, but it is still being reviewed under the Investment Canada Act and Ottawa could veto the deal if it finds it would harm national security. Wall has more than 24 years of experience in the mining industry, most recently at Nevada Copper Corp.During a 12-year stint at Barrick that ended in 2018, the Canadian citizen served as executive general manager of the Veladero gold mine in Argentina.Shandong bought a 50 per cent stake in the mine in the high Andes mountains three years ago."

She noted that she was the deputy when she applied for her U.S. visa in 2016.""By the way, my entry visa to the U.S. is valid until 2026. Since I have no desire to visit this country, it looks like I can take the initiative to cancel it,"" Lam said.The sanctions, announced Friday by the U.S. Treasury Department, block all property or other assets that the individuals have within U.S. jurisdiction.Luo Huining, the director of the central government's liaison office in Hong Kong, said being included on the list shows that he has done what he should for the city and his country.""I don't have a penny of assets abroad. Isn't it in vain to impose `sanctions'? Of course, I can also send 100 U.S. dollars to Mr. Trump for freezing,"" he said in a statement on the office's website.Hong Kong Commerce Secretary Edward Yau, who wasn't sanctioned, called the sanctions ""unreasonable and barbarous"" and said they would harm U.S. interests in the city, an Asian financial and shipping hub.Hong Kong has long enjoyed civil liberties not seen in mainland China because it is governed under the ""one country, two systems"" principle, which was been in place since it reverted to Chinese rule in 1997.However, Beijing imposed a national security law on Hong Kong at the end of June, following months of anti-government protests last year.The new law prohibits what Beijing views as secessionist, subversive or terrorist activities or what it sees as foreign intervention in Hong Kong's internal affairs. Police now have sweeping powers to conduct searches without warrants and order internet service providers and platforms to remove messages deemed to be in violation of the legislation.WATCH | Hundreds arrested in first hours of Hong Kong's new security law:CBC NewsCritics see the law as Beijing's boldest move yet to erase the divide between Hong Kong's Western-style system and the mainland's authoritarian way of governing.""The recent imposition of draconian national security legislation on Hong Kong has not only undermined Hong Kong's autonomy, it has also infringed on the rights of people in Hong Kong,"" the U.S. Treasury Department said.The Hong Kong government accused the U.S. of using Hong Kong as a pawn to create trouble in the China-U.S. relationship, calling the sanctions ""blatant and barbaric interference"" in China's internal affairs.It said that while national security is under the purview of the central government in any country, the new law authorizes local authorities in Hong Kong to be its main enforcer and specifies that human rights will be protected.""These legal provisions, coupled with the rule of law and an independent judiciary in Hong Kong, are clearly ignored by relevant U.S. officials who have chosen to make unsubstantiated and sweeping comments to serve their own interest,"" a government statement said.""We will not be intimidated."""
Chinese authorities take control of U.S. consulate in Chengdu | CBC News,"The United States says it has closed its consulate in Chengdu, China. China ordered the consulate closed in retaliation for a U.S. order to shut down the Chinese Consulate in Houston last week.",2020-07-27T02:59:31.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/us-chengdu-china-consulate-closed-1.5664015,"Chinese authorities took control of the former U.S. consulate in the southwestern Chinese city of Chengdu on Monday after it was ordered closed amid rising tensions between the global powers.China ordered the mission to be shut in retaliation for a U.S. order to close the Chinese Consulate in Houston.The tit-for-tat closings marked a significant escalation in the multiple disputes between the countries over issues ranging from trade and technology to national security, human rights, Taiwan and Hong Kong.A U.S. State Department statement expressed disappointment, saying the consulate ""has stood at the centre of our relations with the people in Western China, including Tibet, for 35 years.""The statement went on: ""We are disappointed by the Chinese Communist Party's decision and will strive to continue our outreach to the people in this important region through our other posts in China.""China's foreign ministry issued a brief notice saying ""competent authorities"" entered through the front entrance and took over the premises after U.S. diplomats closed it at 10 a.m.A day earlier, China's foreign ministry issued a statement of protest over what it called intrusions into the Houston consulate that violated the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations and the China-U.S. Consular Convention.""The Chinese side deplores and firmly opposes the U.S. move of forcibly entering China's Consulate General in Houston and has lodged solemn representations. China will make legitimate and necessary reactions,"" the statement said.China maintains consulates in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Chicago and New York in addition to its embassy in Washington.The U.S. has four other consulates in China and an embassy in Beijing, keeping the sides in parity in terms of diplomatic missions.The Chengdu consulate briefly came to prominence when the police chief of the nearby city of Chongqing fled there in 2012, precipitating the downfall of Chongqing's politically ambitious leader Bo Xilai in China's biggest political scandal in decades. It also played host to former vice-president Joe Biden during a visit when the current prospective Democratic Party presidential candidate was accompanied by China's now-leader Xi Jinping.The American flag was taken down at the Chengdu mission at 6:18 a.m. local time, China's state broadcaster CCTV said on its social media account.Police closed off a two- to three-block area around the consulate, cutting off virtually any view of the property including the flag. A few vehicles were allowed through after police checks, and others could be seen moving in the distance.Moving trucks arrived at the U.S. consulate the previous day and left a few hours later. Late Sunday night, flatbed trailers entered the complex. One later emerged carrying a large shipping container and a crane.Before the area was closed, the impending closure of the consulate drew a steady stream of onlookers over the weekend as Chengdu, like Houston, found itself in the limelight of international politics.People stopped to take selfies and photos, jamming a sidewalk busy with shoppers and families with strollers on a sunny day in the city of Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan province. A little boy posed with a small Chinese flag before plainclothes police shooed him away as foreign media cameras zoomed in.Police had shut the street and sidewalk in front of the consulate and set up metal barriers along the sidewalk on the other side of the tree-lined road.Uniformed and plainclothes officers kept watch on both sides of the barriers after scattered incidents following the Chengdu announcement on Friday, including a man who set off firecrackers and hecklers who cursed at foreign media shooting video and photos of the scene.A man who tried to unfurl a large placard late Sunday that he called an open letter to the Chinese government was quickly taken away.Earlier, a bus left the consulate grounds and what appeared to be embassy staff spoke with plainclothes police before retreating back behind the property's solid black gates. It wasn't clear who or what was on the bus.Three medium-size trucks arrived and left a few hours later, and cars with diplomatic plates departed in between.The U.S. alleged that the Houston consulate was a nest of Chinese spies who tried to steal data from facilities in Texas, including the Texas A&M medical system and the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. China said the allegations were ""malicious slander."""

U.S. accuses Chinese hackers of targeting COVID-19 research | CBC News,The U.S. Justice Department is accusing two Chinese hackers of stealing trade secrets from companies around the world and targeting firms developing a vaccine for COVID-19.,2020-07-21T17:10:24.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/us-chinese-hackers-coronavirus-1.5657424,"Hackers working with the Chinese government targeted firms developing vaccines for the coronavirus and stole hundreds of millions of dollars worth of intellectual property and trade secrets from companies across the world, the Justice Department said Tuesday as it announced criminal charges.The indictment does not accuse the two Chinese defendants of actually obtaining the coronavirus research, but it does underscore the extent to which scientific innovation has been a top target for foreign governments and criminal hackers looking to know what American companies are developing during the pandemic. In this case, the hackers researched vulnerabilities in the computer networks of biotech firms and diagnostic companies that were developing vaccines and testing kits and researching antiviral drugs.The charges are the latest in a series of aggressive Trump administration actions targeting China. They come as President Donald Trump, his reelection prospects damaged by the coronavirus outbreak, has blamed China for the pandemic and as administration officials have escalated their denunciations of Beijing, including over alleged efforts to steal intellectual property through hacking.The indictment includes trade secret theft and wire fraud conspiracy charges against the hackers, former classmates at an electrical engineering college who prosecutors say worked together for more than a decade targeting high-tech companies in more than 10 countries.The hackers, identified as Li Xiaoyu and Dong Jiazhi, stole information not only for their personal profit but also research and technology that they knew would be of value to the Chinese government, prosecutors say.Two Chinese Hackers Working with the Ministry of State Security Charged with Global Computer Intrusion Campaign Targeting Intellectual Property and Confidential Business Information, Including COVID-19 Research <a href=""https://t.co/qFWk5BA8Zb"">https://t.co/qFWk5BA8Zb</a> <a href=""https://t.co/pUiaStKbqn"">pic.twitter.com/pUiaStKbqn</a>In some instances, the indictment says, they provided an officer for a Chinese intelligence service with whom they worked email accounts and passwords belonging to clergymen, dissidents and pro-democracy activists who could then be targeted. The officer gave help of his own, providing malicious software after one of the hackers struggled to compromise the mail server of a Burmese human rights group.The two defendants are not in custody, and federal officials conceded Tuesday that they were not likely to step foot in an American courtroom. But the indictment carries important symbolic and deterrence value for the Justice Department, which decided that publicly calling out the behaviour was more worthwhile than waiting for the unlikely scenario in which the defendants would travel to the U.S. and risk arrest.The hacking began more than 10 years ago, with targets including pharmaceutical, solar energy and medical device companies but also political dissidents, activists and clergy in the United States, China and Hong Kong, federal authorities said.The charges were brought as Trump administration officials, including national security adviser Robert O'Brien and Attorney General William Barr, have delivered public warnings about what they say are Chinese government efforts to use hacking to steal trade secrets for Beijing's financial benefit and to covertly influence American policy.The hacking is part of what Assistant Attorney General John Demers, the Justice Department's top national security official, described as a sweeping effort to ""rob, replicate and replace"" strategy for technological development.In addition, he said, ""China is providing a safe haven for criminal hackers who, as in this case, are hacking in part for their own personal gain but willing to help the state — and on call to do so.""The criminal charges are the first from the Justice Department accusing foreign hackers of targeting innovation related to the coronavirus, though U.S. and Western intelligence agencies have warned for months about those efforts.Last week, for instance, authorities in the U.S., Canada and the United Kingdom accused a hacking group with links to Russian intelligence of trying to target research on the disease, which has killed more than 140,000 people in the United States and more than 600,000 worldwide, according to figures compiled by Johns Hopkins University.The indictment describes multiple efforts by the hackers to snoop on companies engaged in coronavirus-related research, though it does not accuse them of success in any theft.Prosecutors say Li in January conducted reconnaissance on the computer network of a Massachusetts biotech firm known to be researching a potential vaccine, and searched for vulnerabilities on the network of a Maryland firm less than a week after the company said it was conducting similar scientific work.Li also probed the networks of a California diagnostics company involved in developing testing kits, and a biotech firm from the same state that was researching antiviral drugs.Hacking of vaccine information slows down research as the institution must scramble not only to fix the breach but also to ensure the data it has accumulated has not been altered, Demers said.""Once someone is in your system, they can not only take the data, they can manipulate the data,"" Demers said. ""We do worry to that extent that there could be a slowdown in the research efforts of that particular institution.""The indictment was returned earlier this month in federal court in the Eastern District of Washington, where the hacking outlined by prosecutors was first discovered at the Department of Energy's Hanford site.""If it can occur there, we all must know that it can occur anywhere,"" U.S. Attorney William Hyslop said of his district.The Chinese Embassy in Washington, D.C., did not directly respond to the indictment but pointed to remarks made last week by the Foreign Ministry spokesperson, who described China as the victim of ""groundless speculations"" but also a country whose scientific prowess means it does not need to ""secure an edge by theft.""Ben Buchanan, a Georgetown University professor and author of ""The Hacker and the State,"" said that though the U.S. has made clear its views on what kinds of economic espionage are permitted and not permitted, it is unclear where it draws the line on espionage related to the coronavirus or what kind of espionage the U.S. might conduct.He said he was not sure that this indictment, without other meaningful consequences, would get China to cease its activities.""The upside of spying in this way is simply too high for many governments to pass up,"" Buchanan said in an email."
Gold rush garbage mined to unearth history of Chinese miners in B.C. | CBC News,"A B.C. archaeologist is digging through the garbage of a gold rush restaurant to unearth the history of the several thousand Chinese miners who used to dine there, 150 years ago.",2020-06-07T13:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/gold-rush-garbage-mined-to-unearth-history-of-chinese-miners-in-b-c-1.5595906,"A B.C. archaeologist is mining a garbage dump beside an old Chinese restaurant, working to unearth clues about the lives of Chinese gold miners more than a century ago. Dawn Ainsley's dig site is in the Chinatown section of Barkerville Historic Town and Park, about 700 kilometres north of Vancouver. At the height of the gold rush, about 2,000 Chinese miners lived in the area, making up about half of the local population.Now, working beside historical wooden buildings, Ainsley picks through layers of trash thrown off the side porch of the Doy Ying Low restaurant as far back as 1870. The garbage has been buried in layers of mud from the flooding that's occurred in the last 150 years.The treasure trove of trash was discovered during modern-day excavations for water and sewer lines.  Now, several days a week, Ainsley digs into the refuse pile with a shovel, filling a simple, silver bucket labelled ""archeology."" Then she sifts the material and dries the artifacts at her lab.Some days are very mundane, ""with nothing but broken glass and rusted metal,"" she says. ""But then other days, amazing things come out of there.""Her discoveries include dominoes, Chinese medicine bottles, opium tins and pipe pieces, beer bottles, and a bone that appears to be a crochet hook. Ainsley has found Qing dynasty coins that are almost 400 years old.There has also been a toothpaste cap, a can of tinned meat, and many pork bones. Ainsley thinks some of the bones came from suckling pigs, and there's evidence there was a pig roasting pit near the restaurant. ""There's a lot of history in garbage, absolutely,"" said James Douglas, who heads Barkerville's public programming and global media development.""In fact some of the greatest things we've ever [discovered] have come out of garbage dumps,"" he said. ""She's been finding some remarkable artifacts.""Barkerville already has one of the largest Chinese archival collections in Canada, with approximately 18,500 items.Ben Zhou has worked in Barkerville's living history program, dressing in costume to portray a gold rush era Chinese school teacher.Tourists visit his Chinese school house for old-fashioned lessons in Mandarin and calligraphy.Zhou says many visitors are surprised to learn about the gold rush's rich Chinese history. ""The men came here from Guangdong province,"" said Zhou. ""They were looking forward to make some money to help [their] family back home. They wanted to find gold. They worked hard.""Zhou applauds Ainsley's efforts to find out more about the lives of these Chinese men.""It's very important,"" he said."

Canada 'profoundly concerned' over Chinese death sentence for citizen in drug case | CBC News,"Canada is ""profoundly concerned"" about a Canadian citizen sentenced to death on drug charges in China Thursday, the foreign affairs minister says amid heightened tension between the two countries.",2020-08-06T08:17:39.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/canadian-death-sentence-1.5676132,"Ottawa is ""profoundly concerned"" about a Canadian citizen who has been sentenced to death on drug charges in China, the foreign affairs minister said Thursday amid heightened tension between the two countries.""We oppose the death penalty at every step of the way,"" Foreign Affairs Minister François-Philippe Champagne said in an interview on CBC's Power and Politics. ""We have said it time and time and time again to the Chinese government and will continue to do that.""The Guangzhou Municipal Intermediate Court announced Xu Weihong's penalty on Thursday and said an alleged accomplice, Wen Guanxiong, had been given a life sentence.The brief court statement gave no details but local media in the southern Chinese city at the heart of the country's manufacturing industry said Xu and Wen had gathered ingredients and tools and began making the drug ketamine in October 2016, then stored the final product in Xu's home in Guangzhou's Haizhu district.Police later confiscated more than 120 kilograms of the drug from Xu's home and another address, the reports said. Ketamine is a powerful painkiller that has become popular among clubgoers in China and elsewhere.Champagne said consular officials were following Xu's case closely and were present at the sentencing. Canada is seeking clemency.Death sentences are automatically referred to China's highest court for review.Relations between China and Canada soured over the arrest of Meng Wanzhou, an executive and the daughter of the founder of Chinese tech giant Huawei, at Vancouver's airport in late 2018. The U.S. wants her extradited to face fraud charges over the company's dealings with Iran. Her arrest infuriated Beijing, which sees her case as a political move designed to prevent China's rise as a global technology power.In apparent retaliation, China detained former Canadian diplomat Michael Kovrig and Canadian entrepreneur Michael Spavor, accusing them of vague national security crimes.Canada has accused China of arbitrarily detaining Kovrig and Spavor and has been lobbying for their freedom.Champagne said Canada is trying to build an international coalition of nations to advocate against the arbitrary detention of foreign nationals and for consular access when they are detained.""What we're trying to do also is to broaden the coalition because we think that when we act as the international community we have a bigger impact,"" said Champagne.Xu was arrested two years before Canada detained Meng and relations deteriorated, and death sentences when cases involve large amounts of drugs are not rare in China.In April 2019, China gave the death penalty to a Canadian citizen identified as Fan Wei in a multinational drug smuggling case.China also handed a death sentence to convicted Canadian drug smuggler Robert Schellenberg in a sudden retrial following Meng's arrest, after he had already been sentenced.The country has also placed restrictions on various Canadian exports to China, including canola seed, in an apparent attempt to pressure Ottawa into releasing Meng.These tensions, and how the Liberal government has handled them, are the subject of a hearing by a House of Commons committee Thursday afternoon.Formed by a vote of opposition parties, the committee on Canada-China relations is to hear from a leader of Tibet's unofficial government in exile, and then from Canada's former ambassador David Mulroney.Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said there was no connection between Xu's sentencing and current China-Canada relations.""I would like to stress that China's judicial authorities handle the relevant case independently in strict accordance with Chinese law and legal procedures,"" Wang said at a daily briefing Thursday.""This case should not inflict any impact on China-Canada relations.""Like many Asian nations, China deals out stiff penalties for manufacturing and selling illegal drugs, including the death penalty. In December 2009, Pakistani-British businessman Akmal Shaikh was executed after being convicted of smuggling heroin, despite allegations he was mentally disturbed.""Death sentences for drug-related crimes that are extremely dangerous will help deter and prevent such crimes,"" Wang said. ""China's judicial authorities handle cases involving criminals of different nationalities in accordance with law."""

The email, which the company immediately described on Twitter as fake, carried a one-word subject line: coronavirus.Since the outbreak of the new virus that has infected more than 76,000 people and killed more than 2,300 in mainland China, Russia has reported two cases. Both patients, Chinese nationals hospitalized in Siberia, recovered quickly. Russian authorities nevertheless are going to significant — some argue discriminatory — lengths to keep the virus from resurfacing and spreading.Moscow officials ordered police raids of hotels, dormitories, apartment buildings and businesses to track down the shrinking number of Chinese people remaining in the city. They also authorized the use of facial recognition technology to find those suspected of evading a 14-day self-quarantine period upon their arrival in Russia.""Conducting raids is an unpleasant task, but it is necessary, for the potential carriers of the virus as well,"" Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said in a statement outlining various methods to find and track Chinese people the city approved as a virus prevention strategy.The effort to identify Chinese citizens on public transportation applies not only to buses, but underground trains and street trams in Moscow, Russian media reported Wednesday.Metro workers were instructed to stop riders from China and ask them to fill out questionnaires asking why they were in Russia and whether they observed the two-week quarantine, the reports said. The forms also ask respondents for their health condition and the address of where they are staying.In Yekaterinburg, a city located 1,790 kilometres away from Moscow in the Urals Mountains, members of the local Chinese community also are under watch. Self-styled Cossack patrols in the city hand out medical masks along with strong recommendations to visit a health clinic to Chinese residents.Human rights advocates have condemned the targeting of Chinese nationals as racial profiling, not an effective epidemic control strategy.""Prevention of any serious virus, be it a flu or the new coronavirus, should involve a proper information campaign and not discrimination of other people,"" said Alyona Popova, an activist engaged in a year-long court challenge of Moscow's use of facial recognition technology.The containment measures in the capital came as the Russian government instituted an indefinite ban on Chinese nationals entering the country that could block up to 90 per cent of travellers coming to Russia from China. Weeks before, Russia shut down the country's long land border with China, suspended all trains and most flights between the two countries.An employee of a Moscow-based company that employs Chinese nationals told the AP on condition of anonymity that police officers came to their office on Thursday and asked a dozen Chinese staffers to stay home for two weeks. The visit took place a little more than two weeks after these staffers returned from China and went through health checks at the airport, the employee said.The employee spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about what had happened.The Moscow Metro confirmed to The Associated Press that the underground system was ""actively monitoring the stations"" and has a protocol in place for dealing with people who ""have recently returned from the People's Republic of China.""""We ask to see their documents and to show us documents (proving) that if they have recently returned from the People's Republic of China, they have undergone a two-week quarantine period,"" Yulia Temnikova, Moscow Metro's deputy chief of client and passenger services, said.If an individual does not show proof of completing the quarantine, Metro workers ask the person to fill out the form and call an ambulance, Temnikova said.Bus and tram drivers contacted their labour union about the instructions to look for Chinese nationals and report them to the dispatch cente. The drivers were outraged and didn't know what to do, Public Transport Workers Union chairman Yuri Dashkov said.""So he saw a Chinese national, and then what?"" Dashkov said. ""How can he ascertain that he saw a Chinese national, or a Vietnamese national, or a Japanese, or (someone from the Russian region of) Yakutia?""Dashkov showed the AP a photo of the email that officials at Mosgortrans were said to have sent out. He also showed three photos of on-bus electronic displays reading, ""If Chinese nationals are discovered in the carriage, inform the dispatcher.""The AP was unable to independently verify the authenticity of the email and the photos. Dashkov shared screenshots of what appeared to be a genuine bus drivers' group chat in WhatsApp.While Moscow public transit operator Mosgortrans dismissed the email as phony on its official Twitter account Wednesday, the company told the AP in a statement two days later that it does ""conduct monitoring"" and ""sends data to the medics when necessary.""Mosgortrans referred additional questions to the detailed statement from Moscow's mayor, who on Friday acknowledged the sharp focus on Chinese people in the city's virus-control plan.Officials ordered everyone arriving from China to isolate themselves for two weeks, and those who skip the quarantine step will be identified through video surveillance and facial recognition technology, Sobyanin said. The systems give authorities the ability to ""constantly control compliance with the protocol,"" he said in the statement.The mayor's office did not respond to a request for comment on the city's containment approach and the accusation that it's discriminatory. But rights activist Popova insists the facial recognition program is unlawful whether the searches are seeking Russian or Chinese faces.""We have a constitutional right to privacy, and citizens of (other countries) have it according to foreign and international legal norms,"" she said.Temnikova from the Moscow Metro rejected accusations of racial profiling. Subway workers ""mainly look at the passenger's (health) condition,"" she said, and approach ""people who need help.""Addressing identification questions like the ones that worried the bus drivers, Temnikova said it should be ""clear who could have arrived from China"" because ""it is obvious.""The Cossacks of Yekaterinburg - men in conservative, often pro-Kremlin groups claiming to be successors of the proud guards who policed the Russian Empire's frontiers - took fighting the virus into their own hands three weeks ago. They also have a system of sorts for deciding who needs a face mask and advice to see a medical professional.""Mainly (we approach) people from China because it is from them that the coronavirus came. They are the main source,"" Igor Gorbunov, elder of the Ural Volunteer Cossack Corps, told the AP during one such patrol Friday.""But not only them,"" Gorbunov continued. ""There are different nationalities, there are many people of Asian appearance, and they seem to be vulnerable to this disease, the coronavirus, because it is them who are most often affected. Europeans are not yet affected much.""The viral outbreak that began in China has infected more than 78,000 people globally. The World Health Organization has named the illness COVID-19, referring to its origin late last year and the coronavirus that causes it.  "

What would a U.S. ban on Chinese-owned app TikTok mean? | CBC News,"U.S. President Donald Trump says he wants to take action to ban TikTok, a popular Chinese-owned video app that has been a source of national security and censorship concerns.",2020-08-01T21:08:51.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/tiktok-ban-chinese-trump-1.5671958,"U.S. President Donald Trump says he wants to take action to ban TikTok, a popular Chinese-owned video app that has been a source of national security and censorship concerns.The threat comes as Microsoft Corp. is in advanced talks to buy the Chinese app, owned by ByteDance Ltd., according to a person familiar with the discussions who spoke only on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity to the negotiations. Microsoft declined to comment.It's not clear whether Trump would accept a divestment as a concession.But there have been reports of U.S. tech giants and financial firms being interested in buying or investing in TikTok as the Trump administration sets its sights on the app.Questions and answers about what's at stake:ByteDance launched TikTok in 2017 before buying Musical.ly — a video service popular with teens in Canada, the U.S. and Europe — and combined the two. A twin service, Douyin, is available for Chinese users.TikTok's fun, goofy videos and ease of use have made it immensely popular, and U.S. tech giants like Facebook and Snapchat see it as a competitive threat.It has said it has tens of millions of users in the U.S. and hundreds of millions globally. But TikTok has also been a way that millions of people have built careers and made a living.The app would be pulled from the app store of Apple and Google and not function unless used by a virtual private network, experts say.A message to the TikTok community. <a href=""https://t.co/UD3TR2HfEf"">pic.twitter.com/UD3TR2HfEf</a>Experts believe that while the ban may seem legitimate, it likely won't come to that, given the pressure by ByteDance to sell its stake and any control of TikTok to a U.S. company or completely spin off, said Ben Bajarin of Creative Strategies, an industry analysis and market research firm based in San Jose, Calif.""I think a total spinoff or U.S. tech firm acquisition is the likely scenario here so it can keep operating,"" he said.Many are trying to move followers to other platforms like YouTube and Triller, an entertainment platform built for creators. Some are trying to monetize through sites like Patreon, a crowdfunding platform for artists, musicians and other creators, said Amber Atherton, CEO at Zyper, a community marketing platform that connects brands with the top one per cent of their superfans.Atherton said teens will continue to access TikTok anyway through a virtual private network in the same way that teens access Instagram in China. But she said teenagers are devastated about a ban, since TikTok is about everyday people where users can discover product demos and other information.Industry officials say that any ban could invoke some retaliation from China against U.S. businesses.""It could make many companies wary of the U.S. government's capricious decisions, which leads to instability and uncertainty, "" said Sucharita Kodali, an analyst at Forrester Research, an e-commerce research firm.""Investors then opt to park capital in more stable, predictable environments. Something of this nature is relatively uncommon. Usually, it happens when there are sanctions or other major political action."""
"Yellowknife Chinese Association launches website, welcomes members | CBC News","'We’re Chinese,' says founding member Frank Fu. 'We need a voice, we need to tell people that we have our own culture.'",2020-12-08T15:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/yellowknife-chinese-association-1.5832028,"When Frank Fu moved to Yellowknife last October, he was all alone. ""It was very cold and a lot of snow,"" he recalls. Fu had moved to Yellowknife from Beijing under the N.W.T.'s Nominee Program, which invites people willing to invest at least $300,000 in a business to work toward permanent residency. The plan was to set up an apartment and a business, and his wife and two young children would follow. Fu spent his first two weeks in his apartment before venturing out to the grocery store, feeling very ""lonely."" Though he speaks English proficiently, he made his first close friends at a Chinese New Year celebration at the legislative assembly the following February. That's when he began to get the idea to create a formal group to help people like himself. This fall, he helped launch the Yellowknife Chinese Association with 10 board members and 24 members. The goals are to support newcomers, promote Chinese culture and language, and to give back to the community. ""We're Chinese,"" Fu said. ""We need a voice, we need to tell people that we have our own culture."" Fu had spent 20 years working for IBM in China. He now owns the security camera business, Intellibroad, in Yellowknife. He's still working on the association's new website. Angela Law is another founding board member. She moved to Yellowknife from Vancouver in 2002, but is originally from Hong Kong. Law and her family run Yellowknife Tours, the first company dedicated to bringing Chinese tourists to see the aurora. Law said previous generations of Chinese immigrants often had no time to organize societies: they were busy running businesses — often restaurants — working ""day and night."" ""I thought that this is the time because there are so many Chinese investors here,"" Law said.Law and Fu estimate there are around 200 Chinese people in the N.W.T., though both believe more will follow.  ""Language is a big barrier,"" for newcomers, Law said. She wants to help connect new immigrants to those with experience in Canada. The group's website will also share information useful to potential investors, such as the recent story about a lawsuit between a Chinese investor and a Yellowknife-based business partner, which the board has already discussed.""If these people [investors] want to know something about Yellowknife life here, then if they find us, then maybe this is also a channel for them to get someone who is living here and share the experience,"" said Law. The group hopes to mark their first event with a Spring Lantern festival, which they liken to a kind of Chinese Valentine's day, held 15 days after the Chinese lunar New Year. They hope to place red lanterns along Franklin Avenue and, pandemic permitting, hold some kind of event to celebrate. They also hope to launch classes or events for those who want to learn or improve their Chinese language skills. Members from mainland China, Taiwan and Hong Kong are all welcome to join the association. But the most important thing for now may be the social connections. While Fu was planning for his wife and children, ages 10 and three, to move to Yellowknife with him, the novel coronavirus arrived before they did. Fu now expects they won't move here until late in 2021, after the vaccine has been widely disseminated and it's safe to travel.  ""Right now, it's good because I have a lot of friends and I have a business to operate,"" Fu said.""And we have YKCA to work on and it's very exciting, so I'm OK. I'm good here."""
"As angry protests continue over Chinese glass factory, Statford's mayor voices his regrets | CBC News","Stratford Mayor Dan Mathieson says if he could do it over again, he wouldn't have asked Municipal Affairs and Housing Minister Steve Clark for a special order, paving the way for a Chinese company to build a proposed factory on his community's rim.",2020-12-08T09:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/london/stratford-glass-factory-xinyi-1.5831901,"As angry protests continue outside city hall, Stratford Mayor Dan Mathieson is expressing his regret over the decision to ask the province for a special order, clearing legal hurdles for a proposed Chinese-owned glass factory to be built on the community's border. ""Absolutely. Seeing the challenge it has brought to the community, there's some concern around it ... I think it's safe to say we would probably love to rewind and work at this again.""While he regrets the decision, Mathieson told CBC News Monday that he cannot discuss the reasons why it was made, citing confidentiality. ""I'm not at liberty to disclose them because they're covered under a confidentiality agreement, but I can say that council, we're looking at this,"" he said.""I'm sure everyone would have like to have this done differently.""  Mathieson formally asked the province for what's known as a minister's zoning order, or MZO; three times since 2018. The power allows the minister to issue a decree on a piece of land that can't be appealed by community groups or Ontario's Local Planning Appeal Tribunal.Opposition groups have called the tactic ""anti-democratic,"" saying it unfairly circumvents the local decision-making process and was used in an effort to quash opposition to a factory critics worry would potentially pollute the community's air and waterways. The simmering public anger could be seen on display outside city hall each Monday for the past few weeks, with dozens of demonstrators waving placards to express their frustration and opposition to the proposed factory. On Monday, Mathieson acknowledged their frustration but also appealed to their civility, asking those who oppose the project to take on a more respectful tone in disagreeing with the decisions he's made. ""I appreciate that people are angry. I would ask them if they're frustrated to clearly articulate their opinion in a thoughtful way and be respectful. Making accusations, raising insults never helps a process move forward.""Get Concerned Stratford, one of two opposition groups formed to oppose the factory coming to town, has retained the services of David Donnelly, the Toronto environmental lawyer who helped a similar group stop Xinyi Canada from bringing a similar proposal to the township of Guelph-Eramosa. ""Once the citizens [of Guelph-Eramosa] had their say and all the evidence had put before council, council voted to reject the project and that's what I hope will happen here.""""Stratford is world-renown for its theatre, its art and its beautiful setting. Stratford is not world renown for its heavy manufacturing and probably never should be.""Donnelly said what really vexes people is the lack of clear information about the factory, not only from public officials, but from Xinyi Canada itself. He argues the company has been deliberately vague about the amount of pollution the factory would produce, saying his best guess based on what's available from the company is the facility would quadruple the city's green house gas (GHG) emissions.""This is information that we've had to glean off the Xinyi website based on a similar sized plant located elsewhere,"" he said.""To make float glass, you have to heat it up to an incredible temperature and basically float it on molten steel. So the energy required to heat up the thing that actually tempers the glass.""""So that's our estimate, four times Stratford's emissions, but Xinyi has not actually come out and told anyone what those GHG emissions will be.""""That, to me, in relation to Stratford's declaration of a climate emergency, that's disqualifying on its face."" Donnelly wrote a letter to Stratford city council on December 3, outlining his clients' reasons why council should vote down the proposal.While questions over the proposed factory mount, the public may be able to get a chance to have some of those questions answered in a public forum soon. A representative from Xinyi Canada is scheduled to answer questions in an open forum with Stratford city council on December 14. "
Chinese spacecraft has fresh moon rock samples to return to Earth | CBC News,"China said Thursday its latest lunar probe has finished taking samples of the moon's surface and sealed them within the spacecraft for return to Earth, the first time such a mission has been attempted by any country in more than 40 years.",2020-12-03T13:48:11.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/moon-samples-1.5826500,"China said Thursday its latest lunar probe has finished taking samples of the moon's surface and sealed them within the spacecraft for return to Earth, the first time such a mission has been attempted by any country in more than 40 years.The Chang'e 5, the third Chinese probe to land on the moon, is the latest in a series of increasingly ambitious missions for Beijing's space program, which also has a probe en route to Mars carrying a robot rover.The Chang'e 5 touched down Tuesday on the Sea of Storms on the moon's near side, on a mission to return lunar rocks to Earth for the first time since 1976.The probe ""has completed sampling on the moon, and the samples have been sealed within the spacecraft,"" the China National Space Administration said in a statement.Plans call for the upper stage of the probe known as the ascender to be launched back into lunar orbit to transfer the samples to a capsule for return to Earth. The timing of its return was not immediately clear and the lander can last up to one moon day, or 14 Earth days, before falling temperatures would make it inoperable.Chang'e is equipped to both scoop samples from the surface and drill two metres to retrieve materials that could provide clues into the history of the moon, Earth other planets and space features.WATCH | An animation shows how Chang'e 5 was to land on the moon and collect samples:WorldWhile retrieving samples is its main task, the lander is also equipped to extensively photograph the area surrounding its landing site, map conditions below the surface with ground-penetrating radar and analyze the lunar soil for minerals and water content.Chang'e 5's return module is supposed to touch down around the middle of December on the grasslands of Inner Mongolia, where China's crewed Shenzhou spacecraft have made their returns since China first put a person in space in 2003, becoming only the third country do so after Russia and the United States.Chang'e 5 has revived talk of China one day sending a crewed mission to the moon and possibly building a scientific base there, although no timeline has been proposed for such projects.China also launched Its first temporary orbiting laboratory in 2011 and a second in 2016. Plans call for a permanent space station after 2022, possibly to be serviced by a reusable space plane.While China is boosting co-operation with the European Space Agency and others, interactions with NASA are severely limited by concerns over the secretive nature and close military links of the Chinese program."

Chinese sample return mission to the moon harkens back to 1960s lunar race | CBC Radio,Bob McDonald's blog: Robot mission will return first moon rocks since 1976,2020-11-27T19:50:56.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/radio/quirks/chinese-sample-return-mission-to-the-moon-harkens-back-to-1960s-lunar-race-1.5817888,"A Chinese robotic probe called Chang'e 5 is on its way to the moon where it will land, scoop up samples and return them to Earth. This is the first robotic sample return mission since Russian efforts in the 1960s. Those were an effort to make their mark on the lunar surface after their manned moon program failed.When Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin made their historic landing on the moon in July 1969, a secret Russian robotic probe called Luna 15 was there at the same time. It was an attempt to grab a sample of lunar soil and return it to Earth before the American astronauts got back. The Russians had lost the race to put humans on the moon, but were trying to grab a 'first' and master the moon robotically.Unfortunately, Luna 15 crashed during it's landing attempt and the opportunity for a propaganda coup was lost. However, their Luna 16 mission did successfully return about 100 grams of lunar soil a year later and two other sample return missions succeeded in following years, with the last one, Luna 24, in 1976 — two years after the Apollo program had ended. While these robotic sample return missions did not deliver as much lunar material as the Apollo astronauts, they were considerably cheaper and part of a long history of both Russian and American robotic lunar exploration involving dozens of impactors, orbiters, landers and rovers. In a way, we're in another moon race right now that echoes the race of fifty years ago — except this time it seems the robots might be in the lead. China is using robotic landers to explore the moon, and, if all goes well, Chang'e 5 will bring back several kilograms of moon rocks. In the meantime, the U.S. is struggling to develop a far more expensive effort, relying on huge (and much delayed) rockets that will carry humans to the moon with their Artemis program. It once again brings up the question of whether humans or robots are best suited to space exploration. We debated this on a special edition of Quirks & Quarks last year.Human missions are much more expensive, and historically they are much more politically driven than robotic exploration. The decision by the Kennedy administration in 1961 to send humans to the moon was part of the Cold War competition between the U.S. and Soviet Union to prove technical superiority over one another. The current Artemis program has also been politically influenced. Originally the plan was to first build a space station called Gateway in orbit around the moon. Once it was completed, astronauts would be sent down to the surface some time later this decade. When the Trump administration came to power, the landing was pushed forward to 2024, which would have been the last year of President Trump's second term in office. The Biden administration has not said whether it will keep to that tight schedule.NASA's giant new moon rocket, the Space Launch System (SLS) is slated to make its first flight next year. In the meantime three private companies — SpaceX, Blue Origin and Dynetics — have been contracted to develop lunar landers that would ride on their own rockets. But the pace of development in these programs makes NASA's current 2024 moon landing deadline pretty ambitious.Meanwhile, China is continuing its robotic program beyond the moon with the Tianwen 1 mission currently on its way to Mars. The spacecraft includes an orbiter and a lander, which will make China the third country to make a soft landing on Mars after Russia and the U.S. This is not a sample return mission, but it is not unreasonable to think that China could apply similar technology it is using on the moon to return samples from Mars in the future.Robots have always boldly gone where no one has gone before, exploring every planet in the solar system, as well as dwarf planets, moons, asteroids and comets. They conduct the initial reconnaissance of other worlds, survey the lay of the land and choose the best landing sites for humans who follow.  A whole fleet of robots are currently flying around the solar system. Two others are on their way to Mars with the United Arab Emirates' Hope mission and NASA's Perseverance lander scheduled to arrive in February.Beyond Mars, the Japanese Hayabusa2 and American, OSIRIS-REx spacecraft are bringing home samples they collected from asteroids. NASA is planning future missions to visit Europa, a moon of Jupiter and Titan, a mysterious moon of Saturn, the only moon with a thick atmosphere and liquid methane lakes on its surface.There is no doubt it will be a dramatic moment when the next human feet step out onto lunar soil again. Human exploration of space captures the imagination of the public, provides role models for young people and tests the limits of technical, physical and psychological endurance. But humans have not gone very far. The last mission to the moon was in 1972. It will still stretch the limits of our technology to get back there almost half a century later, Meanwhile, the true explorers of space, our silent mechanical servants, will continue their more far-reaching journeys to literally reach out and touch other worlds."
"McCallum says he tried to improve conditions for Kovrig, Spavor in Chinese prison | CBC News",One of Canada's most controversial ex-ambassadors to China says he repeatedly tried to improve the living conditions of Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor after their imprisonment in the People's Republic almost two years ago.,2020-11-25T01:09:05.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/chong-champagne-china-committee-1.5815179,"One of Canada's most controversial ex-ambassadors to China says he repeatedly tried to improve the living conditions of Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor after their imprisonment in the People's Republic almost two years ago. John McCallum also said Tuesday he regrets speaking about the October 2019 Canadian election in a meeting with Chinese officials in the months leading up to it. McCallum, the former Liberal cabinet minister who was fired as Canada's envoy to China in January 2019, was testifying at the special House of Commons committee on Canada-China relations. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau fired McCallum after he made a series of public comments that broke with the government's line following the arrests of Kovrig and Spavor. The two men were arrested nine days after Canada's arrest of Chinese high-tech scion Meng Wanzhou in December 2018 on a U.S. extradition warrant in what is widely viewed as retaliation by China. McCallum said that's when everything changed in Canada's relations with China. ""From that moment onwards, the top priority of the government and of myself as ambassador was to secure the release of the two Michaels,"" said McCallum, noting that he has been one of the few people to visit them in prison. ""On more than one occasion, I tried to convince the Chinese that if they were unable to release Kovrig and Spavor they should at least improve their living conditions. Sadly, as you all know, Canadian efforts in this area have so far been unsuccessful."" The committee has been examining Canada's relations with China, which have plummeted to an all-time low since December 2018.Earlier Tuesday, Conservative MP Michael Chong urged Foreign Affairs Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne to adopt a more consistent approach to getting tough with China. The Conservative foreign affairs critic told Champagne during a House of Commons committee meeting Tuesday that the government needs to show Canadians how it will deal with growing Chinese intimidation of Canadians within Canada. Chong said it is inconsistent for the government to be talking tougher on China, while Canada's current ambassador, Dominic Barton, is making speeches about the need to broaden trade with the People's Republic. ""I think it needs to be a lot clearer, a lot more consistent if Canada is going to have a clear, consistent voice with respect to China on the world stage,"" said Chong. Chong sponsored a motion that won approval in the Commons last week that calls on the government to decide within 30 days whether to allow China's Huawei Technologies to supply equipment for its next generation 5G internet network. Meng is a chief executive of Huawei. Champagne replied that Canada has taken a smart and firm approach with China lately that includes speaking out against its ill treatment of pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong and of ethnic Muslim Uighurs. ""Whether it comes to the Uighurs or whether it comes to Hong Kong, I've outlined places where we're going to challenge China, places where we're going to, for example, coexist with China,"" Champagne said."

What an Australian-style push against Chinese interference might look like | CBC News,"A motion brought by CPC foreign affairs critic Michael Chong, which passed Parliament last week, gives the government 30 days to come up with a plan — like Australia's — to fight foreign (Chinese) interference and influence campaigns. What might that look like and will it come to pass?",2020-11-24T09:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/china-canada-australia-espionage-1.5813364,"Some Australians see the country's new powers to stop foreign interference as an overdue shift from complacency to vigilance, while others have warned of the dangers of a McCarthyite moral panic.But all can agree that Australia's approach to foreign meddling in its politics, universities and public debate has changed a great deal in recent years.Last week, the Canadian House of Commons voted 179-146 for this country to adopt a plan similar to Australia's to counter meddling by the People's Republic of China.Experts in Canada and Australia suggest that such a change would set Canada on a much more aggressive path in countering China's inroads into this country's institutions.Conservative foreign affairs critic Michael Chong's motion requires the government to ""develop a robust plan, as Australia has done, to combat China's growing foreign operations here in Canada and its increasing intimidation of Canadians living in Canada, and table it within 30 days of the adoption of this motion.""Chong's motion received the support of most opposition members of the House, along with Liberals Wayne Easter, Nathaniel Erskine-Smith, John McKay and Jennifer O'Connell.Chong chose Australia as a model for Canada because of a package of laws passed in 2018 in the wake of a series of revelations that brought the issue of foreign interference and espionage to the fore.Sam Dastyari was an up-and-coming Labor Party senator when the year 2018 began. By the end of it he had admitted to soliciting thousands of dollars from businesses affiliated with the Chinese Communist Party. Thousands of Australians signed petitions demanding he face charges of treason.Australian media reports on Dastyari suggested he was a good investment for China. He not only supported Beijing's claims to the South China Sea — in opposition to the official position of his Labor Party — he also worked to prevent a meeting between his party leader and a Hong Kong pro-democracy activist.Dominique Dalla-Pozza teaches at the Centre for Military and Security Law at the Australian National University in Canberra (which itself allegedly has been a target of a massive Chinese intelligence operation). She said that for the past few years, the Australian Security Intelligence Organization (the ASIO — Australia's equivalent of Canada's CSIS) has been sounding the alarm about unprecedented levels of foreign intrusion.""ASIO said there were more foreign spies and their proxies operating in Australia than at the height of the Cold War,"" Dalla-Pozza said.In Canada, CSIS has been trying for years to draw Canadians' attention to foreign interference in everything from universities to municipal governments. Then-director Dick Fadden went public with such a warning in 2010. But Canada has seen no real legislative or organizational response.In Australia, by contrast, those warnings led the Turnbull government to introduce a new Espionage and Foreign Interference Act. Australia's laws don't single out China, the country's largest trading partner. When he introduced the bill in Parliament, then-PM Malcolm Turnbull was careful to cite other precedents, such as Russian meddling in the U.S. and French elections of 2016 and 2017. But there's no doubt in Australia about which foreign government is seen as the most active meddler. Over the last couple of months, Australia has raided the apartments of four Chinese journalists and revoked the visas of two Chinese academics.Dalla-Pozza said the law defines foreign interference as ""conduct that is engaged in concert with a foreign principal or a person that is acting on behalf of a foreign principal"" where ""the person engaging in the conduct is reckless as to whether it will influence government processes, or in other ways influence a democratic political right or duty.""Conduct has to be covert or involve deception, or involve a person making a threat to cause serious harm, or involve a person making a threat with menaces.""The new law produced its first arrest of a suspect two weeks ago: Di Sanh Duong, a prominent member of pro-Beijing Chinese-Australian organizations.The Turnbull government also brought in laws banning foreigners from donating to Australian politicians, placed new requirements on telecommunications companies to block foreign interference, and created a registry of critical infrastructure assets to provide more transparency on who really owns what in the country.And ""there are other mechanisms being developed in Australia that don't depend on the law,"" such as a new national coordinator, a public information campaign and a hotline, said Dalla-Pozza.""The act prescribes in a more focused way what is foreign interference, what is espionage, what is treason,"" said Patrick Walsh, who teaches at the Australian Graduate School for Policing and Security.Walsh said one of the most significant aspects of the law is that it allows Australia to fight back outside the courts.""The key is operational disruption of foreign interference, not just to collect information, but to disrupt it,"" he said.""In 2019 the PM established the Counter Foreign Interference Task Force, which is an interdepartmental task force to discover, track and disrupt foreign interference. And there was $8.7 million given to this task force.""The resources Australia devotes to this effort are not only centralized under a national coordinator, but are also far greater in terms of trained investigators than those available to the Government of Canada.Thirty days seems like a short time to design a full overhaul of Canada's approach to foreign interference, but Chong said Canada has a duty to protect people within its borders from harassment and intimidation by agents of foreign powers. ""It's long past time for the government to deal with this. Australia has already dealt with this. Our other allies have already dealt with this,"" he said. ""I note that on October 28, the FBI charged eight individuals, three of whom were Chinese citizens, for interfering and threatening American citizens through operations that are taking place on American soil.""The motion doesn't spell out any consequences for the government if it allows the 30 days to lapse. But Chong said that would be a harmful precedent given the strong cross-party support the motion received in Parliament.""I expect it to be carried out if the government follows democratic norms and respects the will of Parliament,"" he told CBC News. ""At a time when democracy is under pressure around the world, it's more important than ever that governments respect democratic norms."""

They are planning to hold it online this year.This year's theme of the gala is ""We are family"" — a nod to the community staying together during the pandemic.Jenny Zhang, a longtime volunteer with the association, said it is important to make sure there's a show this year, even if it's not on stage.""We put lots of effort, and the people worked together,"" Zhang said. Normally the group would start rehearsing in September for the show that is in January or early February, depending on the Chinese New Year.Instead of spending the fall rehearsing, they are busy recording sessions outdoors while the weather is still nice. On Sunday, about 20 people met at Killarney Lake, on Fredericton's north side, to film the choir singing.""Actually, I feel very confident right now,"" Mu said after spending the morning filming a video with the choir.""We support each other,"" she said, adding that the volunteers are learning how to make the gala online as they go. ""I think we're going to make it — I hope so,"" she said.Mu said the Chinese New Year is too important to the community to risk not having a gala, even if it's different from other years.""It is the most traditional way we will celebrate our Chinese New Year.

He said it's time for Canada and its closest allies to adopt a more aggressive posture.""The democratic world must acknowledge that the approach to China over the last two decades has not worked. In fact, the situation has gotten worse,"" O'Toole told reporters on Parliament Hill.He said the move to normalize relations and admit China to the World Trade Organization has had ""catastrophic impacts for Canadian workers.""""We falsely believed that ignoring the sharp edges of communism would, over time, smooth them out by putting trade ahead of our values.""Conservative MP Michael Chong, the party's foreign affairs critic, will table a motion today to put pressure on the Liberal government to ban Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei from building Canada's 5G network. Most of the country's wireless providers have opted already to work with Sweden-based Ericsson.Huawei's founder has close ties to China's communist leadership and intelligence partners have long warned that the company's technology could be used to spy on Canadians. O'Toole said Huawei's global success is due in part to ""years of industrial espionage"" against the now-defunct Canadian tech giant Nortel.Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Tuesday the government's final decision on Huawei will be based on the recommendations of Canada's intelligence agencies.

Anti-Hong Kong protests were organized in Canada to bully democracy activists. Uighur students in our universities have been de-platformed and menaced in coordinated actions led by Chinese consulates across our country,"" he said.""And the very values we hold dear, like openness, justice and tolerance, have been weaponized against us.""O'Toole pointed to Australia's foreign interference law as something to emulate here. That country passed legislation in 2018 to toughen penalties on espionage while also requiring individuals or organizations acting in the interests of foreign powers to register and disclose their ties — part of an effort to reduce meddling by China in Australia's politics, universities and media.Under the legislation, it is illegal for a person to knowingly engage in covert conduct or deception on behalf of a ""foreign principal."" The first arrest under this law was made earlier this month when a prominent Chinese-Australian community activist was accused of trying to influence the country's immigration minister.Speaking later in question period, Trudeau said Canada has a ""complex multi-dimensional relationship with China"" and the country deals with Beijing ""with eyes wide open.""""We will remain firm in defending our principles and interests and always will,"" he said, adding that Canada's security agencies have been working with universities and colleges to address new Chinese threats to those institutions.""Canada has among the best security agencies in the world.

""A weak response by Mr. Trudeau has not led to any progress in the case of the two Michaels,"" O'Toole said. ""A more principled, a stronger approach may make progress.""China has retaliated against countries that have criticized its behaviour through trade action. O'Toole said Canada shouldn't be intimidated by such threats.""Canada should work very closely with our Five Eyes allies ... so that it's difficult for China to use its immense economic size to intimidate smaller economies like Canada,"" O'Toole said, citing the intelligence-sharing alliance between Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the U.S.""We may be a smaller economy in comparison with China but we are a giant when it comes to the rights we hold dear, human rights, the rule of law and the security of our citizens.""O'Toole said Canada must strengthen its relationship with other Asian economies — Canada joined the Trans-Pacific Partnership in 2017 — and bolster trade with India. ""We need to look for new markets,"" he said.The motion comes days after the House of Commons subcommittee on international human rights released a report condemning China for committing genocidal acts against the Uighur Muslim minority.

Canada's ties to China's military underscore the weird contradictions in its foreign policy | CBC News,It's been obvious for some time that there is something a little weird about the way Canada approaches its relationship with China — a disconnect brought into sharp relief this week by the news that Global Affairs and the Department of National Defence were not on the same page when it came to military ties and training involving the People’s Liberation Army.,2020-12-12T09:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canada-china-pla-peoples-liberation-army-1.5838658,"It's been obvious for some time that there is something weird about the way Canada approaches its relationship with China — a disconnect brought into sharp relief this week by the news that Global Affairs and the Department of National Defence were not on the same page when it came to military ties and training involving the People's Liberation Army.In some respects, the volcanic online political eruption which followed stories in The Globe and Mail and other media outlets, based on exclusive access to information documents, was predictable, as was the flurry of finger-pointing in the House of Commons on Thursday and Friday.Diplomats were alarmed when Gen. Jonathan Vance, the country's senior military commander, cancelled winter military exercises with the PLA in 2019, fretting that it might aggravate Beijing or make the lives of Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor even worse.It makes for fire-breathing memes, sizzling copy and wonderful political theatre.What's missing, though, is a recognition that Canada's policy toward a rising China has been contradictory and incoherent for almost a decade, maybe more, said Charles Burton, a political scientist at Brock University in St. Catharines, Ont. and a respected China expert at the Macdonald-Laurier Institute.""Cabinets were always split on China, whether it's Liberal or Conservative,"" Burton said, referring to debates more than three decades ago during the government of former prime minister Brian Mulroney.It is more urgent than ever, in the context of an increasingly belligerent and assertive China, to present a united political front, he added.""This is really about the defence of our sovereignty and security on matters over which there is consensus across the political spectrum in Canada,"" he said.Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan, in an attempt at political damage control late this week, made a point of saying that Chinese troops are no longer training for winter warfare at Garrison Petawawa, Ont.He also (rather meekly) noted that the exchange and training program with the PLA was instituted in August 2013 under the Conservatives while defence critic James Bezan, one of the most vocal and fiery opponents this week, was parliamentary secretary of defence.Bezan's retort was along the lines of that was then, this is now.""The defence minister knows full well that the Chinese government back then and the Chinese government today are completely different,"" Bezan said during question period on Thursday.It was a different time, no question.Chinese President Xi Jinping had taken office only a few months before, and the Department of National Defence (DND) tasking order that established the exchange program, obtained by CBC News under access to information, noted that working with the PLA ""complements the Government of Canada led efforts to broaden our bilateral relationship with China.""After years of hectoring and hammering China, the Conservatives — under former prime minister Stephen Harper — had decided that limited engagement was the way to go.And here is where Canada's curious incoherence comes into play.At precisely the moment the former chief of the defence staff, the now-retired general Tom Lawson, was penning the Canadian military's marching orders on closer cooperation with the PLA, the foreign affairs ministry — led at the time by John Baird — was firing off flares about China's unilateral declaration of an air defence zone in the East China Sea.It was a bellwether moment.""The U.S. has indicated deep concern over the establishment of the Chinese ADIZ stating that the U.S. views this development as a destabilizing attempt to alter the status quo in the region and that this move increases the risk of misunderstanding and miscalculations,"" said a Nov. 23, 2013 briefing note to Baird, obtained by CBC News in 2017.""More broadly, the rise of China is reshaping the strategic landscape.""Burton said the rise of President Xi marked the beginning of the new, more aggressive China. The establishment of the air zone — now largely forgotten against a backdrop of fortified artificial islands in the South China Sea, reports of Uyghurs in concentration camps and the haze of tear gas in Hong Kong — marked the first step.So were our politicians and senior leaders paying attention not only to events, but to what other federal departments were saying?According to what former foreign affairs minister (and current finance minister) Chrystia Freeland had to say in question period this week, the answer is yes.""I have long personal experience reporting on authoritarian communist regimes and I am very aware of the threat they pose,"" she said.Here's the question no one seemed to ask this week: why was the military exchange and training program still going on even before hostage diplomacy swept up the two Michaels?National Defence is no stranger to suspicions about China, having spent an enormous amount of time quietly defending itself from cyberattacks purportedly launched by  Beijing or by groups associated with it.The Trump administration has been tightening the screws on China from a diplomatic, security and trade perspective. There has been considerable, growing debate among Western allies — led by the Americans — about the downside of military engagement and co-operation with China, with Five Eyes intelligence partners each exchanging their own warnings — a series of discussions that eventually prompted Canada's current top military commander, Gen. Jonathan Vance, to cancel the winter warfare exercises.And then, of course, there's debate over the telecom giant Huawei and its future in this country.The signs were all there, Burton said — but no one actually woke up to the problem until Kovrig and Spavor were imprisoned. The public has been galvanized, he added, but ""it doesn't seem to have penetrated fully to the senior levels of the political and economic elite.""Burton said that — as weird as it might sound, with everything else that has happened — he believes there are some within the Canadian Establishment who still cling to the notion that if the ""consular cases of Spavor and Kovrig are resolved, we can go back"" to business as usual."

Chinese viewers pan Disney's new Mulan as inauthentic | CBC News,"The remake of Mulan drew decidedly mixed reviews in China after its coronavirus-delayed release in China last week, with thousands panning it online.",2020-09-17T15:37:10.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/chinese-viewers-pan-mulan-1.5727823,"The remake of Mulan struck all the right chords to be a hit in the key Chinese market. Disney cast beloved actor Liu Yifei as Mulan and removed a dragon sidekick popular in the animated original to cater to Chinese tastes.Still, the movie drew decidedly mixed reviews after its coronavirus-delayed release in China last week, with thousands panning it online.The movie was rated 4.9 out of 10 by more than 165,000 people on Douban, a leading website for film, book and music ratings. Negative comments and jokes about the film outnumbered positive reactions on social media.Mulan has earned an estimated 198 million yuan ($39 million Cdn) since its opening last week, and was the second most watched movie in China as of Thursday, according to ticketing platform Maoyan. It scored a higher 7.5 out of 10 on Maoyan, but also with mixed reviews.""Poor artistic level, misunderstanding of Chinese culture lead to the film's failure in China,"" the state-run Global Times newspaper tweeted.Chinese critics, both at home and abroad, said they were disappointed with the film's inaccurate and stereotypical portrayals of Chinese history and the main character, infused with nationalist tropes.Others were not as bothered.""It's fine that different screenwriters make up different stories,"" Zhang Qin, a military veteran, said after watching the film in Beijing last week. ""They can play with imagination and it's a good thing.""IT engineer Zhang Fan also had positive things to say about the film. ""What touched me is the humanity,"" he said.The remake of Disney's popular 1998 animation is based on the ancient tale of Hua Mulan, a young woman who takes her father's place in the army by dressing as a man.The animated version was a global hit but earned just $30 million in China, where viewers found the movie too Americanized, according to reports at the time.The original tale, The Ballad of Mulan, has gone through multiple renditions. Themes such as filial piety and being loyal to the central government have remained as core tenets, which some find outdated and problematic.""It's a very touchy subject in modern China because a lot of people find [filial piety] very constraining, including me,"" said Xiran Jay Zhao, the Chinese Canadian author of an upcoming book about the only female emperor in China. ""It's like a moral shackle for people.""Critics also pointed out inaccurate details such as the use of a southern-style house when Mulan is likely from the north and a depiction of ""qi"" as a magic power that only boys can wield — in Chinese philosophy, it is a force not limited by gender.Some called the makeup and costumes ugly and inauthentic.Zhao said the film comes off more like European fantasy than a Chinese story, and noted that the film's crew was mostly white, including the director, four screenwriters and costume designer.""They didn't really get any Chinese people on the writing staff, and it really showed,"" she said.Jeannette Ng, a Chinese fantasy writer based in the United Kingdom, said the film perpetuates a narrative of China's majority Han people that assimilates and excludes minorities including ethnic Mongolians, Tibetans and Uighurs.""The mainland Chinese people aren't the mainland Chinese viewers from 20 years ago,"" she said of the lukewarm response. ""The culture has moved on.""Her comments mirror the latest in a series of controversies that have hit the film outside mainland China.The movie's final credits thank propaganda departments and a public security bureau in Xinjiang, where part of it was filmed.China has come under widespread criticism for detaining Uighurs and other predominantly Muslim minorities in Xinjiang as part of a campaign to snuff out sometimes-violent struggle against Chinese rule.Earlier, a boycott movement was sparked after Liu, the actor who portrays Mulan, publicly supported Hong Kong police as they battled pro-democracy protesters last year.Hong Kong resident Sarah Chan said she does not plan to see the film, which opened in her city on Thursday.""The main actress ... supports Hong Kong police, so I don't want to watch it,"" Chan said. ""Furthermore, I think they changed the historical background of the story. It's not the same story anymore.""Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian defended Liu last week, calling her a ""Mulan of the modern times.""Disney did not reply to a request for comment."

China imposed the law on Hong Kong, which is supposed to have legal autonomy under the ""one country, two systems"" agreement.""If the Canadian side really cares about the stability and the prosperity in Hong Kong, and really cares about the good health and safety of those 300,000 Canadian passport holders in Hong Kong, and the large number of Canadian companies operating in Hong Kong … you should support those efforts to fight violent crimes,"" Cong said.Canada's deputy prime minister Chrystia Freeland said the ambassador's remarks were ""not in any way in keeping with the spirit of appropriate diplomatic relations between two countries."" Conservative Leader Erin O'Toole says that if Cong refuses to apologize, Canada should withdraw his diplomatic credentials.Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian defended Cong's remarks, saying Canadian leaders ""did not verify, but also condoned the anti-China comments spreading across the nation and made groundless accusations against China.""Edward Chin agrees with O'Toole. He is a Canadian hedge fund manager who lives and works in Hong Kong, and a longtime activist in the Hong Kong pro-democracy movement. Here is part of his conversation with As It Happens host Carol Off. Mr. Chin, how secure do you feel as a Canadian in Hong Kong right now?I think this [statement from the ambassador] is one of the so-called wolf warrior tactics they have been using over the last couple of years. But it kind of got escalated in the last little while.Do you feel secure since these remarks on the part of the [Chinese] ambassador? Even before this gentlemen's remarks, after the [national security law] came into effect, I don't think anyone would feel secure in Hong Kong because this is exactly one country, one system now. So how can anyone feel secure in Hong Kong?Because last year, every Hong Kong person, more than two million people, came out to fight very hard [against] the extradition bill that finally got retracted. Now, this is 10 times worse. This is the nuclear option that they think of.But this seems to have been in reaction to suggestions that Canada would offer asylum to people from Hong Kong, democracy activists who are feeling threatened by the … national security law since it came into place, and that this has been the way that Hong Kong [has reacted] to Canada's offer of asylum. Does that change things?I think Canada has done the right thing to give asylum to those demonstrators who came out and [fought] for democracy, because they were fighting for their life, basically.We have to go back a few months earlier. Why do people come up and protest? Because the two systems is gone. Now, the Chinese ambassador to Canada, you know, whatever he said is threatening. Threatening. This is outrageous, honestly. I think he should be reprimanded.China's ambassador in Ottawa was … warning against the granting asylum to Hong Kong dissidents, and he said, ""If the Canadian side really cares about the stability and the prosperity in Hong Kong and really cares about the good health and safety of those 300,000 Canadian passport holders in Hong Kong and the large number of Canadian companies operating Hong Kong, you should support those efforts to fight violent crimes."" And, of course, is referring to the national security law. Does that sound like a threat to you?Does it mean that they want to treat the Chinese-Canadians or Caucasian-Canadians in Hong Kong, just like the two Michaels, just to abduct them into China?They could just use any excuse and detain someone.I think that the Trudeau government, [Prime Minister] Justin Trudeau together with Chrystia Freeland, I think they should really have a strong statement saying, you know, like, ""This is a threat."" Because, you know, there are a lot of mainland students studying in Canada.Canada, they don't do the same type of threat. This is something really outrageous, and only like a totalitarian regime would do that, threatening people.Chrystia Freeland has spoken out in Canada. She has said this is not in the spirit of diplomatic relations … but the Opposition is saying that the government should go further, that in fact, they should demand the ambassador either apologize or leave the country, have his credentials pulled. Do you think that Canada should go that far?The opposition party is saying the right thing. Because definitely this Chinese ambassador … should definitely apologize.The Opposition leader, I agree with him. You know, they should do something to show that Canada is not one of the weakest Five Eyes countries. Because it's perceived that way, especially in Hong Kong.You have been an activist. You have been outspoken for years, even before this national security law came into effect, and as you point out, became something where people who speak out against China could be arrested, that free speech has been criminalized.... Are you concerned that they you might be targeted by the regime right now, given what they've said about Canada?Everyone could be targetted. I mean, we as Chinese-Canadians, we are in a very awkward situation now. Ethnically, I'm Chinese, so it is embarrassing to have a Chinese ambassador to Canada saying they will do some harm to Chinese people living in Hong Kong, whether I am Canadian or not. So they're saying they want to do something bad to their own people.I don't dislike China. I think it's a great country with a great civilization. But the CCP, the Chinese Communist Party, the way they treat their own people, is very questionable.And that's why [former Chinese leader] Deng Xiaoping promised the two systems until 2047. But now we are short-changed by 27 years.Can I just ask you, finally, do you think there will be many people in Hong Kong … the activists, will they be seeking asylum? Do you think they will ask to be refugees to Canada?I don't think there will be a massive exodus. But in terms of persecution, yes, definitely. Those people living in Hong Kong, whether they are Hong Kong permanent ID card holders or anyone in Hong Kong now, their situation is the same as if they were in mainland China. There's no difference. No doubt about it.Will you ever leave Hong Kong? Do you think that's something that you might have to do?Besides my investment business in hedge funds and all my other hedges, I'm a current affairs writer, a commentator. I think I want to wait until they put a gunpoint at someone's head; and I think that would be the time that we all should leave.And if they shut down, for instance, Apple Daily or some of the internet radio, or they arrest a lot of full-time political commentators, that's the time I think a lot of people should leave, and then the whole world should talk with the CCP and confront with them in a forceful way.Written by Sheena Goodyear with files from The Associated Press.

Chinese envoy warns Canada against granting asylum to Hong Kong protesters | CBC News,The Chinese ambassador to Canada warned the Trudeau government today not to grant asylum to Hong Kong residents fleeing a widely criticized national security law imposed by Beijing.,2020-10-15T18:12:27.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/china-canada-ambassador-hong-kong-spavor-kovrig-meng-huawei-1.5763677,"The Chinese ambassador to Canada warned the Trudeau government today not to grant asylum to Hong Kong residents fleeing a widely criticized national security law imposed by Beijing.""We strongly urge the Canadian side not (to) grant so-called political asylum to those violent criminals in Hong Kong,"" Ambassador Cong Peiwu said in a video press conference from the Chinese Embassy in Ottawa.He said that would amount to ""interference in China's domestic affairs, and certainly it will embolden those violent criminals.""Hong Kong was supposed to operate under a ""one country, two systems"" deal after Britain handed its former colony over to Beijing in 1997 under an international agreement. But human rights and pro-democracy advocates say Beijing's new national security law is undermining freedom in what is known as the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.""So if the Canadian side really cares about the stability and the prosperity in Hong Kong, and really cares about the good health and safety of those 300,000 Canadian passport holders in Hong Kong, and the large number of Canadian companies operating in Hong Kong SAR, you should support those efforts to fight violent crimes,"" Cong said.Cong also flatly rejected Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's assertion that China is engaging in coercive diplomacy by imprisoning two Canadian men in retaliation for the arrest of a Chinese high-tech executive on an American extradition warrant. Meng Wanzhou is living under house arrest in Vancouver while her case wends through a British Columbia court.In December 2018, China imprisoned Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor and charged them with undermining the country's national security. Cong said they are still undergoing a legal process in China but did not provide further details.He repeated his government's demand that Canada release Meng immediately but insisted her case and his government's prosecution of Kovrig and Spavor are not linked.""We will remain absolutely committed to working with our allies to ensure that China's approach of coercive diplomacy, its arbitrary detention of two Canadian citizens, alongside other citizens of other countries around the world, is not viewed as a successful tactic by them,"" Trudeau said earlier this week as the two countries marked 50 years of relations at one of the lowest points in Canada-China bilateral relations.Cong said Canada's efforts to get other countries to join its fight for Kovrig and Spavor is ""doomed to fail.""The European Union raised concerns about the two Canadians by name in the communique summarizing its recent summit with China.""We oppose any remarks that interfere in our internal affairs. And I would like to point out, there is no coercive diplomacy on the Chinese side,"" Cong said."

"I want my baby to grow up proud of her heritage. But with rising anti-Chinese racism, I'm struggling | CBC Radio",Lisa Xing wants to raise her child with pride in her Chinese heritage in spite of a surge in anti-Chinese racism due to COVID-19.,2020-10-03T09:01:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/radio/docproject/from-afar-1.5710871/i-want-my-baby-to-grow-up-proud-of-her-heritage-but-with-rising-anti-chinese-racism-i-m-struggling-1.5710879,"My parents immigrated to Canada from China in their thirties. I came when I was five. So I thought they would be honoured when I bestowed upon them the responsibility of giving their granddaughter a name. A Chinese name. To my surprise (and dismay), I realized just how much they were against this child having a Chinese name. They said the first name should be easy to pronounce.Finally, after my daughter was born on September 29, 2020, my partner Nathan and I settled on Minmin, pronounced ""Ming Ming"". The first Min means ""fall"", the second Min, ""easygoing"" and ""gentle"". It was my mom's suggestion, after she gave in to my pleas.Not only do I think it's user friendly, it's beautiful written in Chinese as 旻旼. Both words using the same two radicals (parts that form a character), just rearranged differently. The choice of my child's name is just one way I am trying to instill a sense of pride in her Chinese heritage. I want her to embrace it, even though anti-Chinese racism has been on the rise since COVID-19.My partner, Nathan, is white. He grew up on a tobacco farm in southwestern Ontario. Our baby is biracial. Throughout the pregnancy, we often talked about how she would look, how I'll manage to get her to speak Mandarin (as I am just a basic speaker myself), and the responsibility of choosing a name that would inevitably play a role in shaping her identity. But although we went ahead and named her Minmin, the current social and political climate has wedged some fear into my mind. It's not treatment from kids on the playground that worries me. It's the recent resurgence of racism that is different to the kind of intolerance I experienced as a child. Trump calls COVID-19 the ""China virus."" And since the coronavirus outbreak, there has been widespread racism against Chinese people, since the virus originated in Wuhan, China. I hate to say it, but in this context, something as superficial as looking more ""white"" or having an English name could spare my daughter a lot of pain. While I know she could get by easier by blending in, this hate also stirred up a defiance in me that made me want to instill that pride in being Chinese even more, so she can have a bulletproof attitude, as Nathan says, and so that none of it will bother her the way it bothered me. I wasn't always called ""Lisa."" My Chinese name is Yaxi (pronounced Ya-shee). That's what I went by as a child growing up in Hamilton, Ont. Everyone butchered it, intentionally or otherwise. Some called me ""Taxi"" or ""Yucky"". So the summer before high school, my best friend – who also had a difficult-for-North-Americans-to-pronounce name, Yiqing – and I decided to change our names. After fighting with my parents to let me change mine to ""Melanie,"" a cringe-worthy homage to Mel B of the Spice Girls, I finally relented and we went with ""Lisa,"" the English name my dad had chosen for me when I first came to Canada. Yiqing chose ""Myra."" The name change took some getting used to, though ultimately, it made life easier. But some time after university, I started realizing just how unique my Chinese name was: Ya, the last part of my mom's name, and Xi, which means ""dawn."" After my own experiences, and the ensuing struggle with my parents over my daughter's name, I hope Minmin will embrace it. I want her to be defiant and proud and confident. And I hope she won't take as long as I did to get there.  "

Chinese astronauts blast off on historic mission,"China has launched its historic space docking mission, carrying the country's first female astronaut into space.",2012-06-16T00:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/chinese-astronauts-blast-off-on-historic-mission-1.1202532,"China launched its most ambitious space mission yet on Saturday, carrying its first female astronaut and two male colleagues in an attempt to dock with an orbiting module and work on board for more than a week.The Shenzhou 9 capsule lifted off as scheduled at 6:37 p.m. local time (1237 GMT) evening from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center on the edge of the Gobi Desert. All systems functioned normally and, just over 10 minutes later, it opened its solar panels and entered orbit.Female astronaut Liu Yang, 33, and two male crew members — veteran astronaut Jing Haipeng and newcomer Liu Wang — are to dock the spacecraft with a prototype space lab launched last year in a key step toward building a permanent space station.Two of the astronauts will live and work inside the module to test its life-support systems while the third will remain in the capsule to deal with any unexpected emergencies.China is hoping to join the United States and Russia as the only countries to send independently maintained space stations into orbit. It is already one of just three nations to have launched manned spacecraft on their own.Another manned mission to the module is planned for later this year, while possible future missions could include sending a man to the moon.[IMAGEGALLERY galleryid=2572 size=small]The program is a source of enormous national pride for China, reflecting its rapid economic and technological progress and ambition to rank among the world's leading nations.At a sending off ceremony for the astronauts, the ruling Communist Party's No. 2 official, Wu Bangguo, told the crew, ""The country and people await your victorious return.""The module, called Tiangong 1, is only a prototype, and the plan is to replace it with a larger permanent space station due for completion around 2020.That station is to weigh about 60 tons, slightly smaller than NASA's Skylab of the 1970s and about one-sixth the size of the 16-nation International Space Station.China has only limited co-operation in space with other nations and its exclusion from the ISS, largely on objections from the United States, was one of the key spurs for it to pursue an independent space program 20 years ago.China first launched a man into space in 2003 followed by a two-man mission in 2005 and a three-man trip in 2008 that featured the country's first space walk.In November 2011, the unmanned Shenzhou 8 successfully docked twice with Tiangong 1 by remote control.The selection of the first female astronaut is giving the space program an additional publicity boost.""Arranging for women astronauts to fly is not only a must for the development of human spaceflight, but also the expectation of the public,"" space program spokeswoman Wu Ping said. ""This is a landmark event.""Speaking Friday, Liu Yang said: ""We won't let you down. We will work together and successfully complete this mission."""

Druh Farrell, who brought the motion forward after requests from the Chinese community.""And the fact that the park and parkade are directly across the corner … is frankly an affront to the neighbourhood of Chinatown.""As a lawyer for the Anti-Chinese League, he petitioned city commissioners to prohibit Chinese Canadians from establishing the current location of Chinatown, claiming that Chinese residents would lower the property values.He instead pushed to segregate Chinese Calgarians as you would ""an isolated hospital.""The motion also requests the mayor write the Calgary Board of Education to encourage the board to change the name of James Short Memorial School.""This year Calgary Chinatown is celebrating its 110-year anniversary. Renaming the park and the parkade ... is the right approach,"" reads a letter signed by Grace Su, Terry Wong and other members of the Chinatown Business Improvement Area.""Through research, documentation and recording this blight of history in the form of a permanent plaque is appropriate as this will ensure the history will not be forgotten and not be repeated. The selection of a new name through community engagement will allow the culture and contributions of Calgary's Chinese society to be honoured and revered respectfully.""The Calgary Community Chinatown Association also wrote in support of the motion. A new name will be chosen with community input, with particular consideration of names recognizing historical Chinese Canadian contributions to Calgary.The motion passed 14-1, with the sole vote against, Coun. Diane Colley-Urquhart, voicing that she doesn't want the city to ""fall into cancel culture."" Colley-Urquhart brought up a motion arising to revise the city's naming policy, to avoid names that are ""divisive in nature"" in future, and to develop a process to reevaluate requests to change current names, in consultation with the city's anti-racism committee once that committee is operational. In 2017, Calgary voted to rename Langevin Bridge as Reconciliation Bridge, replacing the name of one of the architects of the infamous residential school system. "
Chinese-Canadian veteran's group issues call to remove Duff Pattullo's name from new bridge | CBC News,"With a new Pattullo bridge in sight, a group of Chinese-Canadian veterans is calling on the government to come up with a new name more reflective of the community.",2020-10-08T20:00:25.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/pattullo-bridge-chinese-canadian-new-name-1.5755385,"For 83 years, the Pattullo Bridge, linking Surrey and New Westminster, has carried the name of former premier Thomas 'Duff' Pattullo. But, with a new bridge in sight, a group of Chinese-Canadian veterans are calling on the government to come up with a new name representative of the diverse people living across the province.King Wan, the president of Chinese-Canadian Veterans Unit 280 said ""when premier Pattullo was running the province [in 1937], it was a very dark time for ethnic people.""He said the name brings with it a sad and destructive past and reminds Chinese Canadians about a premier who they say wanted to block the Chinese community from making Canada its home and having the right to be franchised and able to vote.""Perhaps we should name that bridge under a different name to honour those who came, I guess, you know, in the last century that have made a lot of contributions to the province,"" Wan said.He said it's time to put history in the past, and while he will not push to change the name of the current bridge, he'd like to see a new name on the new bridge that is set to start construction later this year.""I'm not suggesting it be a Chinese name or whatever .. but maybe consider it being voted on by the citizens in the area,"" Wan said.New Wesminster NDP candidate Jennifer Whiteside, said she's not married to the Pattullo name for the new bridge. ""It would be entirely appropriate to look for a new name that reflects the diversity of the community, a name the community can celebrate. Yeah, I think that would be wonderful,"" Whiteside said.She said she would rely on the independent processes that exist already to address naming of major infrastructure projects, which would take into account the feelings of the community.On the other side of the Pattullo Bridge, Surrey-Whalley Liberal candidate Shaukat Khan said the name change is one he'd also support opening to consultation.""As far as I'm concerned, we should always be engaging with our communities and taking input on all [of] the projects.Both parties are in agreement a name change wouldn't be off the table, but a consultation process would be necessary to decide the correct one.Wan said he'd like to see a vote by community members.""A new bridge, a new beginning, a new era, it will really help strengthen our local population to be more inclusive,"" Wan said.The project for the new bridge is set to start later this year and carry through until 2023. The $1.4-billion project will see a new four-lane bridge built with wider lanes connecting Surrey and New Westminster."

Hong Kong police arrest at least 60 after pro-democracy protest on Chinese holiday | CBC News,Hong Kong police arrested at least 60 people on suspicion of unauthorized assembly on China's National Day holiday Thursday after crowds gathered on the streets of a popular shopping district chanting pro-democracy slogans.,2020-10-01T15:58:48.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/hong-kong-police-arrest-protest-china-holiday-1.5745990,"Hong Kong police arrested at least 60 people on suspicion of unauthorized assembly on China's National Day holiday Thursday after crowds gathered on the streets of a popular shopping district chanting pro-democracy slogans.Those arrested included two district councillors, police said in a statement posted on Facebook. They said the people were arrested after they ignored repeated warnings asking them to disperse.Online calls urged people to join protests, and crowds turned up at Hong Kong's Causeway Bay shopping district, some people chanting ""Disband the police"" and ""Liberate Hong Kong, Revolution of our time,"" a popular pro-democracy slogan that has been banned by the Hong Kong government for alleged secessionist sentiments.A heavy police presence outnumbered the protesters at the scene.WATCH | Dozens arrested in Hong Kong after anti-government protest:WorldNational Day, which celebrates the founding of the People's Republic of China, has become a day of protest in Hong Kong by those who oppose Beijing's increasing control over the semi-autonomous region. Large-scale protests are forbidden because of physical distancing restrictions due to the coronavirus.In the afternoon, police cordoned off some areas in the district and searched people on the streets. On several occasions, they unfurled warning banners that urged protesters to disperse, saying they were participating in an illegal assembly.Protests against the Hong Kong and mainland Chinese governments swelled last year, and Beijing clamped down on expressions of anti-government sentiment in the city with a new national security law that took effect June 30.The law outlaws subversive, secessionist and terrorist activity, as well as collusion with foreign powers to interfere in the city's internal affairs. The U.S. and Britain accuse China of infringing on the city's freedoms, and the U.S. has imposed sanctions on government officials in Hong Kong and China over the law.At a National Day reception, Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam said ""stability has been restored to society while national security has been safeguarded"" under the new law.Lam also accused some foreign governments of holding ""double standards"" and levelling unjustified accusations against the authorities who implement the new law."
Chinese dairy investor pressed Canada to 'mitigate the risk' of new NAFTA | CBC News,"Executives of the Chinese infant formula manufacturer that’s building a new $332 million plant in Kingston, Ont. contacted Canadian officials to complain about the new NAFTA agreement within days of the agreement being reached — and asked for help in mitigating the harm caused by Canada's concessions.",2020-09-29T08:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/monday-feihe-nafta-atip-1.5739152,"Less than three weeks after talks concluded on the revised North American free trade agreement, executives from a Chinese infant formula manufacturer that had invested $332 million to build a new plant in Kingston, Ont. asked for a sudden meeting with Canadian officials.Zhiwen Yang, the general manager of Canada Royal Milk — the Canadian subsidiary of China Feihe Limited — wrote to then-Agriculture Minister Lawrence MacAulay and the Liberal MP for Kingston and the Islands, Mark Gerretsen, describing how Canada's concessions in the Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement (CUSMA) put his business plans in jeopardy by limiting how much cow's milk formula it can export and dismantling the dairy ingredient pricing system.Yang asked the federal government to ""mitigate the risks to the project."" His three-page letters, dated Oct. 16, 2018, were released to CBC News under the Access to Information Act.A few days later, Feihe International Inc. ""respectfully"" asked the president of the Canadian Food Inspection Agency and another senior government official to meet for 90 minutes on Oct. 29 with Yang and his boss, Feihe International chair Youbin Leng, who was travelling to Canada with his directors of research and regulatory affairs.""The purpose of the meeting is to discuss the regulatory framework in China and explore how we can work together. The expectation is not for a decision to be made, but to begin a conversation,"" said the email from Carey Bidtnes, Canada Royal Milk's human resources manager, who was part of the team that worked on bringing this investment to Canada during her previous employment with the Kingston Economic Development Corporation. Bidtnes said that Canada Royal Milk was working with Health Canada and the CFIA to ""resolve a challenge"" with exporting its formula.The documents reveal that the financial stakes for Feihe were higher by the fall of 2018 than they were in 2017, when CBC News reported on the potential international trade issues triggered by Feihe's plans to export the vast majority of the infant formula it manufactures in Canada back to Chinese consumers.As construction began, the Chinese investment was pegged at $225 million. A year later, the investment was estimated at $332 million and project proponents were predicting it would bring 277 direct full-time jobs to the region once production ramps up. A further 300 construction jobs have been created in the Kingston area and the plant is expected to generate the equivalent of over 1,000 more jobs in its eventual supply chain.Chinese companies have a deeper relationship with China's central government than private sector firms in North America do with their own national governments. Feihe is listed on the Hong Kong stock exchange, but its subsidiary, Canada Royal Milk, is incorporated in Canada.The investment — the largest foreign direct investment in Ontario agriculture in the last decade — was finalized with officials from the Canadian Dairy Commission during a 2016 visit to Canada by Chinese Premier Li Keqiang.American officials were monitoring this Chinese investment. President Donald Trump — and the powerful U.S. farm lobby — regard Canada's supply management system as ""unfair"" because it blocks most American dairy from Canada's domestic market.In the CUSMA, Canada agreed to several concessions that harm its dairy industry — including strict limits, enforced by new export charges, on international exports of infant formula and skim milk.CUSMA's export limit for cow's milk formula is lower than what Feihe originally planned to produce in Kingston, according to a presentation obtained three years ago by CBC News.Newly released government talking points say Canadian negotiators ""were in contact with a number of individuals with direct knowledge of the proposed facility's operations,"" including the Kingston Economic Development Corporation, ""to ensure negotiators had a thorough understanding of the intended operation … with a view to avoiding unintended impacts.""It's the same response CBC News got in 2018 when it asked whether Canada's NAFTA renegotiation team spoke directly to Feihe about its plans before signing off.Another concession Canada agreed to in the CUSMA talks dismantled part of its dairy pricing regime, ending lower ingredient pricing that kept processors competitive. Canada's prices are now based on American rates.When Feihe agreed to invest in Ontario, Canada's lower ingredient price was part of its forecasts.Xinhua, the Chinese news agency, reported that then-foreign affairs minister Chrystia Freeland spoke to Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi to brief him within days of concluding CUSMA negotiations.But if the two ministers discussed the dairy concessions, they apparently didn't resolve the manufacturer's concerns because the documents show that, within days of that conversation, Feihe began its own outreach to the Canadian government.Earlier presentations of Canada Royal Milk's business plans didn't mention producing and exporting skim milk powder for the adult market. But this letter to MacAulay said the company would produce skim powder for export during a ""ramp up"" period of testing the new facility. Canada already has a significant surplus of skim milk powder, left over after meeting Canada's strong demand for butter. Making baby formula at this new plant was supposed to help use up this surplus, not exacerbate it.The global market for skim is crowded and ultra-competitive, with American farmers hostile to any threats. Under the World Trade Organization's Nairobi Agreement, Canada agreed to stop exporting skim milk products as of January 2021.""The export cap is a very serious issue for the operations of the company for 2019 and 2020,"" the letter from general manager Yang to then-minister MacAulay said, ""and we believe it will hinder the growth of the entire industry in the future.""In its correspondence, Feihe asked for assurances that its facility had the support of all levels of government. It also requested ""reasonable quota"" so it could take maximum advantage of the tariff-free exports that would be allowed under the CUSMA, including a ""guarantee that the full annual export quota for infant formula would be assigned to Canada Royal Milk.""Canada is allocating its export quota for skim milk powder based on processors' past production. But for infant formula, export quota was distributed according to planned production — presumably to accommodate the new plant coming online.""Currently, details on which entities have received an allocation for the dairy export thresholds are not public,"" Jean-Sébastien Comeau, a spokesperson for Agriculture Minister Marie-Claude Bibeau, told CBC News.In a question redacted from one document released to CBC News but repeated without redaction in another, Yang also asked the government if it would ""take steps to limit the licensing of new infant formula manufacturing in Canada.""While that appears to be anti-competitive behaviour, no other Canadian dairy processor has shown interest in making infant formula in recent years — which is why Canada pursued the Chinese investment in the first place.On the demise of ingredient pricing, ""it's unclear how this will impact our operations in the medium to long term,"" Yang's letter to MacAulay said.""Our team has already been contacted by U.S. dairy producers who are eager to sell their products to us,"" the letter continues.""What has the government proposed to assist dairy processors to overcome the loss of [ingredient] pricing?""The letter sent to MP Gerretsen repeated the same demands.Although Bibeau announced funding for dairy producers harmed by trade deals with the European Union and Pacific Rim countries in the days leading up to the 2019 federal election, the industry is still waiting for the compensation it was promised when NAFTA was replaced.It's unclear whether Canada Royal Milk would be eligible for compensation but the Chinese investment has qualified for other federal and provincial support programs.If Feihe believes its investment was harmed by Canada's concessions, it could sue for damages under the 2012 Canada–China Foreign Investor Protection Agreement, which was negotiated by the previous Conservative government.""The sued country can opt not to make public anything until an arbitration award,"" Osgoode Hall law professor and investment treaty specialist Gus Van Harten said, noting this agreement is unique in this regard.International Trade Minister Mary Ng's spokesperson Ryan Nearing said ""there has been no dispute launched against Canada under the Canada-China FIPA to date, nor notification of an intention to do so.""In an interview with CBC, MP Gerretsen said he passed on the requests he received from the company to officials at Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada. But he said the only formal encounter he's had with Canada Royal Milk was a tour of the construction site in his riding earlier in 2018.""A number of the issues that were in their letter I believe have been addressed,"" he said.In departmental email, one bureaucrat called Yang's correspondence ""an interesting letter indeed.""Before federal government officials met with the Chinese, two senior officials from Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's office, Brian Clow and Simon Beauchemin, joined an ""urgent briefing"" with MacAulay's office — an ""additional twist,"" another bureaucrat called it.""The Chairman is in Canada in the context of making more investment,"" a senior official said. The request to meet with the president of the CFIA was ""in the context of the application for export,"" he said, ""which may not be the full reality.""Comeau, Bibeau's spokesperson, tells CBC the Kingston facility now has its licence to export from the CFIA.The Canadian Dairy Commission originally hoped an investor like Feihe could build a second facility, perhaps in Western Canada. But now, the government ""is not in discussion with Canada Royal Milk about additional future investments,"" Comeau said.Earlier plans obtained by CBC News suggested Kingston facility would be exporting by now. Bidtnes told CBC News its production lines are complete and it is pleased with the results of its test batches.""Timelines for beginning commercial production have been stretched into the fall due to the impact of COVID-19 on some regulatory processes,"" she said, adding that the company remains ""confident in our business plans and the support we have received from all levels of government."""
Kazakhstan rejects Chinese warning over pneumonia outbreak | CBC News,Kazakhstan's health officials on Friday dismissed a Chinese claim that the Central Asian country is facing an outbreak of pneumonia more deadly than the new coronavirus.,2020-07-10T15:32:20.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/pneumonia-kazakhstan-1.5644849,"Kazakhstan's health officials on Friday dismissed a Chinese claim that the Central Asian country is facing an outbreak of pneumonia more deadly than the new coronavirus.The Kazakh denial follows a notice issued Thursday by the Chinese Embassy that warned its citizens about an outbreak of pneumonia in the ex-Soviet nation with a death rate higher than that from coronavirus-induced pneumonia.""This information doesn't conform to reality,"" Kazakhstan's Health Ministry said in a statement.It said that the country's statistics on pneumonia include patients who tested negative for the coronavirus but had symptoms compatible with the COVID-19 illness.According to official data, the number of pneumonia cases has increased by 55 per cent in the first half of the year, compared with the same period in 2019 — from 63,436 to 98,546.However, Health Minister Alexei Tsoi said at a briefing Thursday, mortality from pneumonia this year fell from last year's levels — from 1,780 deaths in the first half of 2019 to 1,172 in the first half of 2020.The ministry said its tallies of bacterial, fungal and viral pneumonia infections, which also included cases of unclear causes, were in line with World Health Organization guidelines.The energy-rich Central Asian nation quickly introduced regional lockdown and travel restrictions to stem the COVID-19 pandemic, but it has faced a rise in infections after it lifted the restrictions in May.In late June, Kazakh President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev fired the nation's health minister, blaming him for flaws that helped trigger a second wave of contagion.Kazakh authorities have imposed a two-week nationwide lockdown starting Sunday to contain the COVID-19 outbreak.The country so far has registered over 53,000 cases, including 264 deaths.Asked to comment on Kazakhstan's denial of the Chinese Embassy's claim, China's Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian refrained from comment, saying that Beijing hopes to receive more information.""China looks forward to continuing co-operation with Kazakhstan to jointly fight the epidemic and safeguard public health in both countries,"" he said.WATCH | Pneumonia in Kazakhstan likely related to COVID-19: WHOMike Ryan, head of the WHO's emergencies program, told journalists on Friday that the cases in Kazakhstan are on WHO's radar.Given the country's surge in COVID-19 cases in the last seven days, there's a likely explanation, he said.""The upward trajectory of COVID-19 in the country would suggest that many of these cases are in fact undiagnosed cases of COVID-19,"" Ryan said.Ryan said WHO is keeping an open mind and teams will checks for false negative COVID-19 tests and X-ray patterns.Clusters of atypical pneumonia can occur at any time from other causes such as bacteria that present as Legionnaires' disease or influenza."

Taiwan scrambles fighters as Chinese jets again fly near island | CBC News,"Taiwan's air force scrambled jets for a second consecutive day on Saturday as multiple Chinese aircraft approached the island and crossed the sensitive midline of the Taiwan Strait, with the island's government urging Beijing to ""pull back from the edge.""",2020-09-19T09:08:01.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/china-taiwan-fighter-jets-1.5731034,"Taiwan's air force scrambled jets for a second consecutive day on Saturday as multiple Chinese aircraft approached the island and crossed the sensitive midline of the Taiwan Strait, with the island's government urging Beijing to ""pull back from the edge.""Taiwan's defence ministry said 19 Chinese aircraft were involved, one more than in the previous day, with some crossing the Taiwan Strait midline and others flying into Taiwan's air defence identification zone off its southwest coast.It said China, which claims democratic Taiwan as its own territory, sent 12 J-16 fighters, two J-10 fighters, two J-11 fighters, two H-6 bombers and one Y-8 anti-submarine aircraft. According to a map the ministry provided, none got close to mainland Taiwan itself or flew over it.""ROCAF scrambled fighters, and deployed air defence missile system to monitor the activities,"" the ministry said in a tweet, referring to the Republic of China Air Force, the formal name of Taiwan's air force.Taiwan has complained of repeated incidents of Chinese aircraft near the island this year, and has regularly had to scramble its F-16s and other jets to intercept them.China had on Friday announced at a news conference in Beijing about China's UN peacekeeping efforts combat drills near the Taiwan Strait, and denounced what it called collusion between the island and the United States.U.S. Undersecretary for Economic Affairs Keith Krach arrived in Taipei on Thursday for a three-day visit, the most senior State Department official to come to Taiwan in four decades, angering China. He left Saturday afternoon, according to Taiwan's foreign ministry.Taiwan's defence ministry, in a separate statement, said China was carrying out provocative activities, seriously damaging peace and stability.""The defence ministry sternly condemns this, and calls on the mainland authorities to control themselves and pull back from the edge.""China's widely read state-backed tabloid the Global Times, published by the ruling Communist Party's official People's Daily, said in a Saturday editorial that Friday's drills were a rehearsal to take over Taiwan.""The U.S. and Taiwan must not misjudge the situation, or believe the exercise is a bluff. Should they continue to make provocations, a war will inevitably break out,"" it said.Both sides need to resume dialogue to reduce the risk of war, Johnny Chiang, leader of Taiwan's main opposition party the Kuomintang, wrote on his Facebook page.""People who are willing to play a communication role are stigmatized and people who clamour for war are regarded as heroes. Such an atmosphere is definitely not conducive to the peaceful and stable development of the Taiwan Strait,"" said Chiang, whose party traditionally favours close ties with China.Life has continued as normal in Taiwan with no sign of panic. The island has long been accustomed to living with Chinese threats.Taiwan's people have shown no interest in being ruled by autocratic China, re-electing President Tsai Ing-wen in a landslide last year on what was largely a platform of standing up to Beijing.The latest Chinese flights came the same day Taiwan held a memorial service for former president Lee Teng-hui, dubbed ""Mr. Democracy"" for ending autocratic rule in favour of free elections and championing Taiwan's separate identity from China.Lee, who died in July, became Taiwan's first democratically elected president in March 1996 after eight months of intimidating war games and missile tests by China in waters around the island.Those events brought China and Taiwan to the verge of conflict, prompting the United States to send an aircraft carrier task force to the area in a warning to Beijing's government."

John Boyega quits perfume ambassador role over Chinese ad | CBC News,Actor John Boyega stepped down from his role as a global ambassador for perfume brand Jo Malone on Monday after the company decided to hire a Chinese actor to replace him in an ad he created.,2020-09-15T13:57:46.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/john-boyega-perfume-1.5724428,"Actor John Boyega stepped down from his role as a global ambassador for perfume brand Jo Malone on Monday after the company decided to hire a Chinese actor to replace him in an ad he created.The Star Wars star, who is Black, wrote on Twitter that the brand's decision to ""replace my campaign in China by using my concepts and substituting a local brand ambassador for me, without either my consent or prior notice, was wrong.""Jo Malone, an upscale British perfume brand owned by Estée Lauder, has said that replacing Boyega with Chinese star Liu Haoran in the ad campaign was a misstep. It has removed the ad and apologized.The original ad starring Boyega, 28, aired last year and was called The London Gent. It features the London-born actor walking around the neighbourhood where he grew up and riding a horse in a park, and it makes reference to his Nigerian heritage in a scene featuring West African attire.""The film celebrated my personal story — showcasing my hometown, including my friends and featuring my family,"" Boyega wrote.Their decision to replace my campaign in China by using my concepts and substituting a local brand ambassador for me, without either my consent or prior notice, was wrong. The film celebrated my personal story– showcasing my hometown, including my friends and featuring my family.""While many brands understandably use a variety of global and local ambassadors, dismissively trading out one's culture this way is not something I can condone.""It's not the first time Boyega has been deleted from a China-based ad. He played a leading role as Finn in 2015's Star Wars: The Force Awakens, but he and other nonwhite characters were removed or diminished from a Chinese poster for the movie.In an interview with GQ magazine, Boyega recently said that Black characters have been ""pushed to the side"" in Disney's Star Wars franchise.

Chinese oil painting fetches record $7.8M,"An anonymous collector has paid the equivalent of $7.8 million Cdn for the Chinese oil painting Slave and Lion, setting new record price paid for such a painting.",2006-11-26T00:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/chinese-oil-painting-fetches-record-7-8m-1.598550,"An anonymous collector has bought a Chinese oil painting in Hong Kongfor the equivalent of $7.8 million Cdn, setting a record price ever paid for such a work of art.Slave and Lion was sold at a Christie's auction on Sunday. The price exceeds a benchmark set only last month for Chinese oil paintings when Danshui by Taiwanese artist Chen Chengbo fetched more than $5 million at a Sotheby's event.Xu Beihong created Slave and Lion during his stay in Berlin during the early 1920s. It depicts the story of Roman slave Androclus, who pulled thorn from a lion's paw. His act of kindness inspires the Roman emperor to free him.The work blends Western form and subject with Chinese line drawing touches.Five months ago, another Xu painting— Silly Old Man Moves a Mountain— sold in Beijing for $4.35 million.Christie's sale of more than 2,000 Chinese works of art and objects from the 20th Century was a goldmine, with buyers and collectors snapping up pieces beyond their estimated bid price.Another major work, Potted Chrysanthemum in a Blue and White Jardiniere by Sanyu, went for $4.25 million.Ken Yeh, the deputy chairman of Christie's Asia, said there's pent-up demand for art from the new wealthy class in Asia, whose bank accounts are brimming with cash from a bullish stock market.""There's just too much money around. People are just eager to buy,"" Yeh said prior to Sunday's bidding.He added thatthe newly-rich see art as a valuable asset.Last week, Hong Kong real estate tycoon Joseph Lau, paid $17.4 million for pop artist Andy Warhol's iconic portrait of China's Mao Zedong.Yeh said at least one out of four buyers at Christie's auctions are Chinese and that number is rising.Christie's estimates Hong Kong is the world's third most important art market after New York and London."

Chinese tabloid blasts Canada over lobster dispute | CBC News,Communist Party media in China rebuked and threatened Nova Scotia lobster shippers this week for expressing concerns over new roadblocks to getting products into China.,2020-06-25T09:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/chinese-state-media-global-times-lobster-dispute-canada-1.5626025,"Communist Party media in China rebuked and threatened Nova Scotia lobster shippers this week for expressing concerns over new roadblocks to getting products into China.The party tabloid Global Times says recent border measures are about food safety after a COVID-19 outbreak was linked to a Beijing food market, ""rather than an excuse to target any specific country.""""It's Canada's choice to export to China, and Canada needs to abide by Chinese regulations, which may be adjusted when necessary in accordance with the COVID-19 situation,"" Bai Ming, a research fellow at the Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Co-operation, told the Global Times on Monday.The tabloid, known for its nationalist tone on international issues, discounted complaints raised by Canadian lobster shippers quoted in CBC News reporting.It also linked the issue to the arrest in Canada and ongoing extradition proceedings against Huawei chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou.""Experts warned that the Canadian side should be fully aware that its attitude in Meng's case is the only roadblock between the two countries,"" it said. ""If the Canadian side does not remove it, a disruption in the lobster trade might be just the tip of the iceberg in bilateral trade, as fraught ties have already undermined confidence in business communities on both sides.""Chinese authorities began random testing of imported food after a COVID-19 outbreak earlier this month was traced to a cutting board used on imported Atlantic salmon at the Xinfadi market in Beijing.Live lobster shipments from Canada, valued at $457 million last year, were particularly vulnerable.Most of that lobster comes from Nova Scotia, which has seen its sales in China soar in recent years.After the inspections started, some Nova Scotia companies cancelled live shipments rather than risk delays of up to 36 hours waiting for test results when the perishable product arrives.Exporters must now also sign a Chinese customs declaration assuming liability if COVID-19 is detected.Obsorne Burke of Victoria Co-op Fisheries in Cape Breton, which ships frozen lobster to China, refused to sign.He's leery of the Chinese legal system and dubious about the risk of the coronavirus, citing public health agencies in Canada and elsewhere that say there is no scientific evidence the virus is transmitted by food or food packaging.""We have to take a stand or push back and say this does not make any scientific sense,"" he said.The Global Times said exporters should get over it.""The newly adopted requirements for coronavirus-free declarations apply to all suppliers across the world and all food products,"" it said in a front page editorial this week, one of two articles devoted to the issue of Canadian lobster shipments.The tabloid hit back at reaction from Canadian lobster exporters quoted by CBC.""A major Chinese salmon importer told the Global Times on Monday that all of its suppliers are co-operative and willing to sign the declaration as they 'want to do business with China,'"" Global Times reported.""The company said, compared with Canada, it prefers to do business with countries like Chile, which has a mature, industrialized industry chain and is also co-operative with and respectful of Chinese regulations.""The question of whether lobster shippers should sign a declaration that assumes some form of liability for COVID-19 in China has split the Nova Scotia lobster industry.Some exporters have agreed to sign the declaration, others have not.The Nova Scotia Seafood Alliance has lawyers from the Atlantic Canadian law firm Cox Palmer reviewing the document and drafting a declaration shippers could send to customers in China that asserts the safety of the product without assuming liability.  The industry group says there is no consensus among members at this point for a unified response.The Global Times article challenged those who have opted not to sign.""Since the Canadian exporters are so confident about their management, why don't they have the courage to sign the declaration,"" Bai asked, noting that Canada ought to understand, ""China has such a regulation only because there is a risk of the virus spreading.""The Trudeau government avoided taking a stand when asked by the Nova Scotia government whether exporters should sign the declaration.Global Affairs Canada said since the customs demand was delivered by Chinese companies ""to the industry from industry,"" the Canadian Food Inspection Agency is leaving it to individual exporters to decide whether they sign.""It's absolutely not acceptable,"" said Chris d'Entremont, a Nova Scotia Conservative Member of Parliament.D'Entremont said the federal government should explain to industry exactly what accepting liability might mean.""We should be understanding through CFIA what exactly the implications are going to be here. To accept a certain liability is one thing on your product, but a liability for the spread of a virus is something completely different. I think this is a humongous overreach by China,"" he said.The Chinese embassy in Ottawa did not respond to a request for comment from CBC News."
Calgary police investigate racist graffiti at Chinese Consulate | CBC News,Racist graffiti on the Chinese Consulate downtown is being investigated by Calgary police.,2020-05-27T19:46:58.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/calgary-police-investigate-racist-graffiti-on-chinese-consulate-1.5587110,"Police are investigating a possible hate crime after racist graffiti was spray painted on a wall at the Chinese Consulate in downtown Calgary early Wednesday.Three people dressed in black and wearing masks approached the building on Sixth Avenue S.W. at 3:30 a.m., and spray painted a vulgar message before leaving, police said.It was the second time this month the consulate has been targeted with graffiti. Another message was spray painted in front of the building on May 19.The Chinese Consulate General turned over surveillance video captured by closed-circuit TV to police, who have released images of the suspects.The graffiti included the phrase ""China Virus."" There have been reports of increased racism and hate-motivated crimes targeting the Chinese community and people of Asian descent during the coronavirus pandemic.""The pandemic has led to a lot of political debate and strong views, and people are obviously free to hold whatever view they wish,"" said Const. Craig Collins, hate crimes co-ordinator with the Calgary police. ""But when people are targeting others for ill treatment or committing crimes because of those views, we have a duty to get involved.""Police said there has been a slight increase in incidents targeting those groups.""Generally, we have not seen the same spike in hate crimes that some other areas have seen,"" Collins said. ""But we are hearing from the Chinese community that they are concerned about growing hostility, so we are monitoring it closely.""Police said hate-motivated crimes are crimes where the offender was motivated by bias, prejudice or hate based on certain personal characteristics of the victim, like race. Hate as a motivation is considered after a person is found guilty, during sentencing.The consulate said in a statement that it strongly condemns the insult and threat, which it said violate both international and Canadian laws.""The Consulate General encourages the police to solve this case as soon as possible, and take necessary measures to better protect the safety and dignity of the Consulate, its staff and its properties,"" a consulate spokesperson said in an emailed statement."

New poll reveals Chinese-Canadians' experiences with racism | CBC News,A new poll from the Angus Reid Institute and the University of Alberta suggests the majority of people who identify as Chinese-Canadian have experience some type of racism since the pandemic began.,2020-06-22T07:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/new-poll-reveals-chinese-canadians-experiences-with-racism-1.5621261,"A new poll from the non-profit Angus Reid Institute and the University of Alberta suggests a large percentage of people who identify as Chinese-Canadian have experienced some type of racism since the coronavirus pandemic began. Of the more than 500 Canadians of Chinese ethnicity surveyed from across Canada, half reported being called names or insulted as a direct result of COVID-19, and 43 per cent said they had been personally threatened or intimidated. Shachi Kurl, executive director of the Angus Reid Institute, says the poll shines a light on the extent of racism across the country. ""I think the numbers are fairly stark,"" Kurl said.Of those who responded, nearly a third said they had been frequently exposed to racist graffiti or messaging on social media. Also, 61 per cent said they had adjusted their routines ""to avoid run-ins or otherwise unpleasant encounters"" since the pandemic began. The online survey was conducted from June 15-18, 2020 among a representative randomized sample of 516 Canadian adults who self-identify as being ethnically Chinese and are members of Angus Reid Forum or Inclusive Insights. For comparison purposes only, a probability sample of this size would carry a margin of error of plus or minus 4.3 percentage points, 19 times out of 20.For Kurl, one of the most troubling findings of the survey is despite the fact that 88 per cent of respondents agreed that ""being Canadian is an important part of my identity,"" only 13 per cent agreed that others see them as Canadian all the time.""It says to me that you can be in this country for five years or you can be fourth generation but because of the way you look there is still a barrier to being accepted or to be viewed as fully Canadian by others,"" Kurl said.WATCH | Many Asian-Canadians experienced racism during pandemic: surveyThe NationalNearly 80 per cent of the respondents said they felt strongly that Canadians blame people of Chinese ethnicity for COVID-19, and two-thirds said North American news outlets have had a negative effect on Canadian views of people of Chinese ethnicity.Henry Yu, a history professor at the University of British Columbia, says the results of the survey don't come as a surprise at all.Yu commended the Angus Reid Institute for capturing the systemic racism that is often dismissed as an isolated incident.""I think it's vitally important in Canada that we do more collection of this kind of data,"" Yu said. ""How do you know where there's racism if you never actually look for it?""Yu says to date it has been up to victims of racism themselves to track trends through strategies like Project 1907's centralized racism reporting centre to prove that incidents of hate are widespread.Treating incidents of racism and discrimination as isolated incidents bolsters denial and silence about racism in Canada, Yu says, and makes it difficult for those who have experienced it to believe that it's happening to them. The survey was limited to people who identify as being of Chinese ethnicity, but Yu says the same results would likely apply to many Asian-Canadians or anyone else who might be seen as Chinese-Canadian — as was the case with Dakota Holmes, an Indigenous woman who was attacked and told to ""go back to Asia"" when she was out walking her dog in East Vancouver."

One of China's most senior generals last month said China would attack if there was no other way of stopping Taiwan from becoming independent.China is deeply suspicious of Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen, whom it accuses of being a separatist bent on declaring formal independence. Tsai says Taiwan is already an independent country called the Republic of China, its official name.The United States has stepped up its military activities near the island too, with semi-regular navy voyages through the narrow Taiwan Strait.A U.S. C-40A, a military version of the Boeing 737, had entered Taiwanese air space with permission, though it did not land at any Taiwanese airports, Taiwan's defence ministry said in a separate statement on Tuesday.The U.S. aircraft took off from Japan's Okinawa island, where there is a major U.S. air base, and flew over northern and western Taiwan on its way to Southeast Asia, Taiwanese media reported.While Washington and Taipei have no formal diplomatic ties, the United States is Taiwan's strongest international supporter and main arms supplier, which is another source of U.S.-China tension."

After Christmas, this is the second biggest time of year for the mall, said Azar.""It's been very busy, a couple of shops have run out of things,"" he said, noting that shoes and watches are big sellers before the new year because it's bad luck to buy them after. Clothing is also popular because of the tradition of wearing new clothes when visiting family over the holiday period that begins on Sunday.Hong Kong, known as a prime shopping destination in Asia, has been even more of a shopper's paradise this week than usual with Lunar New Year sales now in full effect.Major multinational stores that are keen to grow in the Asian market have promotional campaigns specifically targeting the holiday. A Gap store in Hong Kong's Central district is giving away Chinese New Year-themed t-shirts and tote bags with purchases over $65, while across the street at H&M, signs proclaiming ""Chinese New Year Deals"" hang from the ceiling.Further down the street at Marks & Spencer, shoppers are getting 20 per cent off seasonal food. Burberry has been running full-page advertisements in newspapers, and their store windows, decorated in red, are wishing passers-by a happy new year. Starbucks stores, meanwhile, are selling gift envelopes with Chinese New Year designs.Meagan Fitzpatrick has been posted to Hong Kong to bolster CBC's coverage of a dynamic region of the world. Hong Kong is known as an international financial centre, but there is much more to it than that, and it has close connections to Canada. The city of seven million hosts nearly 300,000 Canadians, and about 500,000 people of Hong Kong descent make their home in Canada. Meagan is a senior online writer who covers national news and federal politics in CBC's Ottawa bureau. You can follow her on Twitter @fitzpatrick_m.Apple's Asia division has an online New Year gift guide urging shoppers to ""Take home the perfect gifts,"" referencing the millions of Chinese who travel home to see family over the holiday period. The company held a ""Red Friday"" sale on Jan. 25, offering deals only to its customers in Hong Kong and other Asian countries.Kenneth Chiu left work on Thursday with an iPad mini, courtesy of his boss, and was carrying it under his arm as he walked with a colleague, who also had one under her arm. All employees in their office received one as an end-of-year treat.""Nice boss,"" Chiu said with a big smile. Chiu has already finished his own shopping for Chinese New Year, buying all new basketball clothes for his son, whom he is trying to sway away from playing soccer.This is a peak time of year for multinationals to make gains in their Asian markets, according to Niraj Dawar, a marketing professor at Richard Ivey School of Business at Western University in London, Ont., so they are trying to make the most of the holiday season.""They're doing this because they expect 50 per cent of their growth over the next 10 years to come from the emerging markets and of course China is at the forefront,"" said Dawar, who teaches at Ivey's Hong Kong campus every year.""It pays for them to understand the consumer, what drives the consumer, when are they most likely to spend money … most likely to be susceptible to marketing messages,"" said Dawar.One Chinese New Year tradition is to give money in red envelopes to children and unmarried friends and relatives but the holiday is increasingly becoming a more commercial one, according to Dawar.That's good news for the retail sector in Hong Kong, which has been struggling in the last year. The Hong Kong Retail Management Association called 2012 a ""bumpy"" year. Retail sales slipped from double-digit growth at the start of the year down to 3.9 per cent in July.But there are recent signs of a rebound. Growth in December was up at 8.8 per cent, and the sector is hoping for sustained growth through the holiday period.The ifc mall along Hong Kong's iconic waterfront sees 225,000 people pass through its doors on an average day, and Azar said he's happy with the amount of added traffic this holiday season. Sales figures will be hard to compare to last year since Chinese New Year fell in January in 2012, but he's expecting at least a 20 per cent increase over last February."
Rescue efforts continue after deadly Chinese quake,Stranded tourists and residents struggle to clear roads and cope with power cuts caused by a powerful earthquake that killed at least 19 people and injured 247.,2017-08-09T00:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/china-earthquake-sichuan-1.4239892,"Stranded tourists and residents struggled Wednesday to clear roads and cope with power cuts caused by a powerful earthquake that killed at least 19 people and injured 247.The magnitude 6.5 quake struck a mountainous region near a national park that is one of the country's top tourist attractions. Rescuers dug through rubble with their hands and used detectors to search for signs of life. The Tuesday night quake knocked out power and phone networks, complicating efforts to locate and evacuate survivors.Most of the deaths and injuries were recorded in Zhangzha township, near to Jiuzhaigou or Jiuzhai Valley, a national park known for spectacular waterfalls and karst formations that attracts visitors from China and overseas.Yang Jie, who owns a hostel in Zhangzha, said she was at a hotpot restaurant with friends when the lights went out and everything started shaking at around 9:20 p.m. Tuesday.""People were rushing out, some people were screaming,"" Yang said by phone. ""On our way home, there were rocks falling down from the hills on both sides of the road.

The area is on the edge of the Tibetan Plateau and home to many Tibetan and other ethnic minority villages.Among the injured, 40 were listed in serious condition, according to the Aba Tibetan and Qiang Autonomous Prefecture government in Sichuan. At least five of the dead were tourists, China's official Xinhua News Agency said. Hong Kong's immigration department said one of the city's residents was missing in the quake.A Canadian woman suffered a slight head injury and a French citizen was wounded in both legs and needed surgery to remove stone fragments, according to Xinhua. It said Frenchman Maxence Vallon, 18, was staying with his mother and brother at a hotel in Jiuzhaigou.They were seeking shelter outside ""when a big stone fell and hit my brother right in the leg,"" said Romain Vallon, who studies in Beijing.The dead included a performer in an arts group who was buried in the quake and found Wednesday morning. She and others had been performing in Jiuzhaigou when the quake struck. According to the Legal Evening News, they were acting out a scene about a deadly 2008 earthquake that struck nearby and killed nearly 90,000 people. When Tuesday's quake hit, the performers ran off the stage in terror and the audience thought the tremor was part of the show.In footage shown on state broadcaster China Central Television, rescuers picked away rubble from around a body, then stood silently in a row, with helmets off and heads bowed to pay their respects.Other orange-suited rescuers were shown using detectors to search for survivors in the dark of night, carrying a girl to safety and leading other people along a rubble-strewn road.Prelim M6.3 earthquake northern Xinjiang, China Aug-8 23:27 UTC, updates <a href=""https://t.co/gEFJWMbjgZ"">https://t.co/gEFJWMbjgZ</a>The U.S. Geological Survey measured the quake at magnitude 6.5 and said it struck at a depth of just nine kilometres. Shallow earthquakes tend to cause more damage than deeper ones.Xinhua said more than 30,000 tourists visiting Jiuzhaigou were relocated to safer accommodations.On Wednesday morning, another strong earthquake struck far northwestern China, some 2,200 kilometres from Jiuzhaigou, injuring 32 people, two of them seriously, and damaging more than 1,000 houses, Xinhua reported. That quake was measured at 6.3 by the USGS and struck in a sparsely populated area of the Xinjiang region near the Kazakhstan border. "

Chinese lawmakers endorse Hong Kong national security law | CBC News,China's ceremonial legislature overwhelmingly endorsed a national security law for Hong Kong on Thursday that has strained relations with the United States and Britain and triggered protests in the semi-autonomous territory.,2020-05-28T06:49:40.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/china-security-law-hong-kong-1.5587892,"China's ceremonial legislature overwhelmingly endorsed a national security law for Hong Kong on Thursday that has strained relations with the United States and Britain and triggered protests in the semi-autonomous territory.The National People's Congress backed the bill by a vote of 2,878 to one with six abstentions as it wrapped up an annual session that was held under intensive anti-coronavirus controls.The move will ultimately change the territory's mini-constitution, or Basic Law, adding a national security law to be decided later by Chinese leaders. The standing committee of the National People's Congress that handles most legislation will work out its details.Activists in Hong Kong say the law will undermine civil liberties and might be used to suppress political activity.Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam, who came under fire for her handling of protests last year over an extradition bill that was eventually scrapped, said that fear was misplaced. She said the decision from Beijing was welcome because of the difficulty her government faces in passing national security legislation on its own. Lam said in a statement that new laws would ""sanction an extremely small minority of criminals who threaten national security"" and ""not affect the legitimate rights and freedoms enjoyed by Hong Kong residents.""The law and the way it is being enacted prompted U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to announce on Wednesday that Washington will no longer treat Hong Kong as autonomous from Beijing. That sets the stage for the possible withdrawal of the preferential trade and financial status the U.S. accords the former British colony.On Thursday, Canada, Australia, the United Kingdom and the U.S. issued a statement condemning the legislation as a violation of a previous United Nations joint declaration concerning Hong Kong and an action that threatens to undermine the ""one country, two systems"" arrangement under which the territory retained its own Western-style social, legal and political institutions after being handed over from British to Chinese rule in 1997.""Direct imposition of national security legislation on Hong Kong by the Beijing authorities, rather than through Hong Kong's own institutions as provided for under Article 23 of the Basic Law, would curtail the Hong Kong people's liberties, and in doing so, dramatically erode the autonomy and the system that made it so prosperous,"" the statement read.The countries said they were concerned the move ""will exacerbate the existing deep divisions in Hong Kong society; the law does nothing to build mutual understanding and foster reconciliation within Hong Kong.""Joining the U.S. and other countries in expressing concern, Japan's chief cabinet secretary Yoshihide Suga said it was important for Hong Kong to have a ""stable and democratic development.""""We are deeply worried about the National People's Congress this time conducting the vote amid deep concern within the international community and Hong Kong citizens"" Suga said.The measure is designed for ""Hong Kong's long-term prosperity and stability,"" Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said following the closing of the NPC's annual session. Li offered no details about what specific areas the law would cover. At the United Nations, China blocked a United Nations Security Council meeting to discuss the legislation on Wednesday. Ambassador Zhang Jun said on Twitter that Hong Kong matters are ""purely China's internal affairs.""Earlier Thursday, three pro-democracy lawmakers were ejected from Hong Kong's legislative chamber, disrupting the second day of debate on a contentious bill that would criminalize insulting or abusing the Chinese national anthem.The legislature's president, Andrew Leung, suspended the meeting minutes after it began and ejected Eddie Chu for holding up a sarcastic sign about a pro-Beijing lawmaker that read, ""Best Chairperson, Starry Lee.""A second pro-democracy lawmaker was ejected for yelling after the meeting resumed, and then a third after rushing forward with a large plastic bottle in a cloth bag that spilled its brownish contents on the floor in front of the president's raised dais.The third lawmaker, Ted Hui, later described the contents as a rotten plant, and said he wanted Leung to feel and smell the rotting of Hong Kong's civilization and rule of law, and of the ""one country, two systems"" framework that democracy activists feel is under attack by China's ruling Communist Party. The city's pro-democracy opposition sees both the security legislation and the anthem law as assaults on that autonomy, and the U.S. has called on China to back off on the security law."

Canadian-approved N95 mask targeted by Chinese counterfeiters | CBC News,A Chinese-made mask approved by Health Canada is the subject of a counterfeit warning issued by the Centers for Disease Control in the U.S.,2020-05-14T08:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/chinese-masks-counterfeit-pandemic-covid-1.5568246,"A Chinese-made mask approved by Health Canada is the subject of a counterfeit warning issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the U.S.The Associated Press has reported that counterfeit masks, intended to mimic medical-grade N95 masks made by the Shanghai Dasheng company and approved for use in Canada, already have been distributed to front-line medical staff at some U.S. hospitals.And a separate Chinese mask maker also licensed by Health Canada has seen its approval pulled by the Food and Drug Administration in the United States.The Guangdong Golden Leaves Technology Development Co. Ltd. was one of 65 Chinese manufacturers whose authorization to sell in the U.S. was withdrawn following tests by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC).The manufacturer remains approved in Canada, but its product has not been distributed to health care workers here, a spokesperson for Public Services and Procurement Canada told CBC News.Both cases illustrate the difficulties faced by governments in trying to procure reliable masks when a flood of fake, shoddy and deceptively-labelled products is pouring out of China.All masks approved for use in U.S. hospitals must have a Testing and Certification (TC) number issued by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. The CDC has warned that the TC number issued to the Shanghai Dasheng Co. for its masks — TC 84A-4329 — has been misappropriated by other Chinese makers seeking to sell substandard products in the U.S. market.U.S. government agencies like the National Park Service have been warning their workers to watch out for the fake masks.Health Canada approved Shanghai Dasheng's DTC3X N95 masks by interim order on April 27. That interim order process has been used during the pandemic to fast-track approval of medical devices for use in Canada.West Virginia distributed 50,000 fake DTC3X masks to first responders — and kept them in use after the CDC warned the state they might be counterfeit, and after the real Shanghai Dasheng Co. warned that its products were being faked.CBC News has asked Health Canada and Public Services and Procurement Canada about the masks, but has not yet received an answer.Canada was badly burned once already when it bought millions of defective masks from a Montreal-based supplier that uses Chinese manufacturers.The U.S. government had to withdraw dozens of approvals for Chinese manufacturers of medical masks last week after tests showed that many did not meet minimum standards for protecting medical workers.One of those mask manufacturers also had received approval in Canada.Products made by Guangdong Golden Leaves Technology Development Co. Ltd. had been cleared for use in the U.S. under an ""Emergency Use Authorization"" (EUA) issued by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on April 3.The same maker was approved by Health Canada on May 5.But on May 9, the FDA withdrew the company's U.S. licence. That decision followed tests by the CDC that showed many of the Chinese masks permitted under the EUA fell far below the filtration standards guaranteed by their producers.CDC has not published a test of the Guangdong Golden Leaves mask, but appears to have de-listed it as a precaution after other masks approved by the same Emergency Use Authorization tested poorly.While Canada tests masks before approving them for use, the U.S. government chose to grant approvals before testing.Of 11 masks tested by the CDC for which results were published, only four met specifications. The stop-use order relates not only to the seven that failed, but also to dozens of others that have yet to be tested, including the Guangdong Golden Leaves mask.Just 14 of the 80 Chinese mask makers approved in the original order remain cleared for use in the United States today.""While the FDA continues to take action to balance the urgent need of supplies of respirators for health care personnel, we are also doing everything in our authority to ensure health care personnel receive adequate protection,"" the agency said in a statement.The test results just for masks shipped from China's Guangdong province show vast differences in quality.Some of the Chinese manufacturers shipped masks that performed superbly in tests.N95 and KN95 masks are supposed to be able to filter at least 95 per cent of all particles measuring 0.3 microns in diameter. All 10 samples of the KN95 produced by Guangdong Energy Fortress Pharmaceutical Co. passed that test, and four of them performed at 100 per cent filtration.A mask produced by Guangdong Medical Technology Co. produced equally consistent results.But none of the 10 samples of the mask produced by Guangdong Qian Jing Testing Co. filtered more than 76 per cent of particles — a dismal rating.And masks produced by Guangdong Nuokong Medical Technology Co. appeared to be from two very different production runs. Of the 10 samples tested, five produced good filtration rates of between 98 and 99 per cent, but five gave only 24 to 26 per cent protection.The pandemic has inspired many manufacturers in China to jump into the personal protective equipment (PPE) business to take advantage of the scramble among countries around the world to procure supplies.While many of the companies approved by the FDA in the April 4 emergency order were traditional medical supply firms with a history of making such products, the names of some approved companies reveal an origin that has little to do with health or medicine: DongGuan HuaGang Communication Technology Co., Fujian Pageone Garment Co, Ltd., Guangzhou Sunjoy Auto Supplies Co., Yiwu Henghao Household Products Co., Yiwu Yifan Knitting Co., the Zhejiang Shengtai Baby Products Co.None of those non-medical companies appear to have survived the FDA's cull of manufacturers.Nine of the Chinese mask manufacturers that retained their approvals in the U.S. also have been approved in Canada, but none of the masks that failed CDC tests appear on the Canadian approved list.However, on Monday, Health Canada issued a recall of KN95 respirators manufactured by dozens of Chinese companies following CDC tests that found the masks ""failed to meet 95 per cent filtration specifications.""A recall bulletin was sent to companies across Canada authorized to import or distribute supplies for use in hospitals or other health-care institutions, instructing them to ""stop-sale"" of the masks and relabel them for use in non-healthcare settings where 95 per cent filtration isn't necessary.Ottawa said the recall action did ""not implicate KN95 respirators purchased by the Government of Canada and tested by the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC).""Concerns over the quality of PPE and test kits have arisen outside North America as well. Several European countries have had sometimes acrimonious disputes with China over the quality and reliability of shipments.Fast-track approval processes were adopted in many countries to speed up the delivery of supplies, and sometimes that has opened the door to substandard equipment.Both the U.S. and the United Kingdom have reported serious problems with test kits that were granted expedited approval.Canada also has bought defective test kits from China.In some cases, disputes over shoddy Chinese shipments to Europe have led to diplomatic incidents, with Chinese embassies vigorously defending the quality of shipments condemned by local health authorities."
N.L. woman accosted with anti-Chinese racism for 3rd time during pandemic | CBC News,A Chinese woman says she was called a pig and a dog-eater on a popular walking trail in St. John's.,2020-09-07T16:01:56.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/racism-mundy-pond-st-johns-1.5714808,"A PhD student from China says she was called a pig and a dog-eater during a racist confrontation with two teenagers on a popular walking trail in St. John's.Ting-ting Chen managed to snap a picture of the boys running away after accosting her on Friday on the Mundy Pond trail.It's just the latest racist incident Chen has encountered since the COVID-19 pandemic arrived in Newfoundland and Labrador, bringing with it a wave of anti-Chinese sentiment, some of which has been caught on camera.""I have been here two years, and I can hardly imagine I would have suffered from this two years ago before the pandemic,"" Chen told CBC N.L.'s Meg Roberts on Sunday.""I think the pandemic just became [an] impetus for the racism here to be thriving and rise up, and that really saddens my heart.""In a recent video shared with NTV News, well-known brewery owner Dave Fong was accosted by a woman outside his home in the historic Quidi Vidi Village of St. John's. The video shows her screaming at Fong to ""go back to where you came from.""Fong's family has been in Newfoundland and Labrador since the 1890s.He did spend some time in nearby Carbonear as a child, but that doesn't seem to be what the woman was referring to.She's been charged with criminal harassment and has a court date Oct. 5 in St. John's.Chen — who is studying Newfoundland folklore at Memorial University — has been subject to the same vitriol.The first time happened when she was walking downtown and a car rolled past her with the windows down. Someone leaned out and shouted ""Virus!"" at her.The second time, a man shouted at her to ""Go back to China.""The last straw was when the two teenaged boys made squinted eyes at her and spewed lewd nonsense in her direction.""I just tell them this is not right and you should be better taught. Shame on you,"" she said.""Racist ideas have already poisoned our young generations like that. I was astonished.""Chen stressed that the real troublesome minority is not any racial or ethnic group, but the racists themselves.She said her time in Newfoundland has been marked by wonderful hospitality. A local resident invited her to live rent-free with them for two months when she first arrived so she could have a guided introduction to the province. Another friend has invited her to spend Christmas with her family for the last two years.But she said it was time to speak about the ugly side and address it head-on.The first time she experienced racism, it shocked her.The second time, it scared her. She didn't go outside for a month, afraid of what people would say or think about her.The third time, it made her angry.""I don't want to see this small percentage of people destroy the beauty of Newfoundland,"" Chen said. ""I still love Newfoundland for sure, because I know all these haters and racists are only a small percentage, and they don't, and they can't, represent all Newfoundlanders at all.""Read more from CBC Newfoundland and Labrador"

Chinese Canadian Museum of B.C. opens first exhibit in Vancouver's Chinatown | CBC News,"A giant, intricate dragon mask and a hand-painted wok greet visitors to the first-ever exhibition of the Chinese Canadian Museum of British Columbia in Vancouver's Chinatown.",2020-08-13T21:57:45.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/chinese-canadian-museum-bc-exhibit-vancouver-chinatown-1.5685481,"A giant, intricate dragon mask and a hand-painted wok greet visitors to the first-ever exhibition of the Chinese Canadian Museum of British Columbia in Vancouver's Chinatown.The exhibition called A Seat at the Table explores historical and contemporary experiences of Chinese Canadians, particularly through the lens of food and restaurants.""A close look at the food industry reveals the impact of racial discrimination on Chinese Canadians, but it also tells us much about their ability to resist, organize, seek justice and thrive,"" reads the museum's description of the exhibition that opens Saturday.In one installation, the story of a campaign to save barbecue meat stores in Chinatown in the mid-1970s is told through delicate, miniature paper cut-outs of the storefronts and their supporters, as a spotlight casts their shadows high up on the wall.Co-curator Viviane Gosselin said the exhibition was two years in the making and involved historians, educators, students, community activists and staff at the Museum of Vancouver, who collected a wide range of personal stories and items of significance from members of the Chinese Canadian community in B.C.Their goal was to highlight the diversity of Chinese Canadian experiences and create a space where people feel comfortable sharing their own stories, she said.""All the clusters of images and videos and artifacts are there to act as prompts for people to kind of trigger their memory,"" said Gosselin, the director of collections and exhibitions at the Museum of Vancouver, which is partnered with the Chinese Canadian Museum of B.C.A Seat at the Table includes stations for writing and recording videos, as well as a large map where visitors can illustrate where they have come from, she said.""The whole idea is to kind of generate a new body of historical knowledge that the Chinese Canadian Museum can use for future research and programming,"" said Gosselin.Grace Wong, the chair of the society that's working to fully establish the Chinese Canadian Museum, said the exhibition recognizes the contributions of Chinese Canadians across B.C.""Everything from the 1880s — all the struggles, all the contributions, all of the work, whether it was building the railway, whether it was contributing in the world wars, despite not having any status.""A Seat at the Table opens amid the COVID-19 pandemic and the Vancouver Police Department has reported that incidents of racism directed at Asian people are on the rise.Co-curator Denise Fong wore a face mask printed with the phrase ""stop the spread of racism"" while touring the exhibition this week, saying she hopes the exhibition will spur conversations about how people can make change in their day-to-day lives.A Seat at the Table is presented in English as well as traditional and simplified Chinese, Fong noted.A so-called sister exhibition is set to open at the Museum of Vancouver's main location in the fall.Both exhibitions are expected to travel across B.C. within a year, said Gosselin, noting they're designed to incorporate fresh content each time they open in a new location.The B.C. government announced an investment of $10 million to establish the Chinese Canadian Museum last month, calling it the first museum of its kind in Canada.It also gave the City of Vancouver $1 million last year to support the establishment of the museum with satellite locations planned in other communities, as well as an online portal offering interactive experiences at historical locations across the province.The museum is part of a joint effort by the province and Vancouver to have the city's Chinatown designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site."

"Yellowknife Chinese Association launches website, welcomes members | CBC News","'We’re Chinese,' says founding member Frank Fu. 'We need a voice, we need to tell people that we have our own culture.'",2020-12-08T15:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/yellowknife-chinese-association-1.5832028,"When Frank Fu moved to Yellowknife last October, he was all alone. ""It was very cold and a lot of snow,"" he recalls. Fu had moved to Yellowknife from Beijing under the N.W.T.'s Nominee Program, which invites people willing to invest at least $300,000 in a business to work toward permanent residency. The plan was to set up an apartment and a business, and his wife and two young children would follow. Fu spent his first two weeks in his apartment before venturing out to the grocery store, feeling very ""lonely."" Though he speaks English proficiently, he made his first close friends at a Chinese New Year celebration at the legislative assembly the following February. That's when he began to get the idea to create a formal group to help people like himself. This fall, he helped launch the Yellowknife Chinese Association with 10 board members and 24 members. The goals are to support newcomers, promote Chinese culture and language, and to give back to the community. ""We're Chinese,"" Fu said. ""We need a voice, we need to tell people that we have our own culture."" Fu had spent 20 years working for IBM in China. He now owns the security camera business, Intellibroad, in Yellowknife. He's still working on the association's new website. Angela Law is another founding board member. She moved to Yellowknife from Vancouver in 2002, but is originally from Hong Kong. Law and her family run Yellowknife Tours, the first company dedicated to bringing Chinese tourists to see the aurora. Law said previous generations of Chinese immigrants often had no time to organize societies: they were busy running businesses — often restaurants — working ""day and night."" ""I thought that this is the time because there are so many Chinese investors here,"" Law said.Law and Fu estimate there are around 200 Chinese people in the N.W.T., though both believe more will follow.  ""Language is a big barrier,"" for newcomers, Law said. She wants to help connect new immigrants to those with experience in Canada. The group's website will also share information useful to potential investors, such as the recent story about a lawsuit between a Chinese investor and a Yellowknife-based business partner, which the board has already discussed.""If these people [investors] want to know something about Yellowknife life here, then if they find us, then maybe this is also a channel for them to get someone who is living here and share the experience,"" said Law. The group hopes to mark their first event with a Spring Lantern festival, which they liken to a kind of Chinese Valentine's day, held 15 days after the Chinese lunar New Year. They hope to place red lanterns along Franklin Avenue and, pandemic permitting, hold some kind of event to celebrate. They also hope to launch classes or events for those who want to learn or improve their Chinese language skills. Members from mainland China, Taiwan and Hong Kong are all welcome to join the association. But the most important thing for now may be the social connections. While Fu was planning for his wife and children, ages 10 and three, to move to Yellowknife with him, the novel coronavirus arrived before they did. Fu now expects they won't move here until late in 2021, after the vaccine has been widely disseminated and it's safe to travel.  ""Right now, it's good because I have a lot of friends and I have a business to operate,"" Fu said.""And we have YKCA to work on and it's very exciting, so I'm OK. I'm good here."""
"As angry protests continue over Chinese glass factory, Statford's mayor voices his regrets | CBC News","Stratford Mayor Dan Mathieson says if he could do it over again, he wouldn't have asked Municipal Affairs and Housing Minister Steve Clark for a special order, paving the way for a Chinese company to build a proposed factory on his community's rim.",2020-12-08T09:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/london/stratford-glass-factory-xinyi-1.5831901,"As angry protests continue outside city hall, Stratford Mayor Dan Mathieson is expressing his regret over the decision to ask the province for a special order, clearing legal hurdles for a proposed Chinese-owned glass factory to be built on the community's border. ""Absolutely. Seeing the challenge it has brought to the community, there's some concern around it ... I think it's safe to say we would probably love to rewind and work at this again.""While he regrets the decision, Mathieson told CBC News Monday that he cannot discuss the reasons why it was made, citing confidentiality. ""I'm not at liberty to disclose them because they're covered under a confidentiality agreement, but I can say that council, we're looking at this,"" he said.""I'm sure everyone would have like to have this done differently.""  Mathieson formally asked the province for what's known as a minister's zoning order, or MZO; three times since 2018. The power allows the minister to issue a decree on a piece of land that can't be appealed by community groups or Ontario's Local Planning Appeal Tribunal.Opposition groups have called the tactic ""anti-democratic,"" saying it unfairly circumvents the local decision-making process and was used in an effort to quash opposition to a factory critics worry would potentially pollute the community's air and waterways. The simmering public anger could be seen on display outside city hall each Monday for the past few weeks, with dozens of demonstrators waving placards to express their frustration and opposition to the proposed factory. On Monday, Mathieson acknowledged their frustration but also appealed to their civility, asking those who oppose the project to take on a more respectful tone in disagreeing with the decisions he's made. ""I appreciate that people are angry. I would ask them if they're frustrated to clearly articulate their opinion in a thoughtful way and be respectful. Making accusations, raising insults never helps a process move forward.""Get Concerned Stratford, one of two opposition groups formed to oppose the factory coming to town, has retained the services of David Donnelly, the Toronto environmental lawyer who helped a similar group stop Xinyi Canada from bringing a similar proposal to the township of Guelph-Eramosa. ""Once the citizens [of Guelph-Eramosa] had their say and all the evidence had put before council, council voted to reject the project and that's what I hope will happen here.""""Stratford is world-renown for its theatre, its art and its beautiful setting. Stratford is not world renown for its heavy manufacturing and probably never should be.""Donnelly said what really vexes people is the lack of clear information about the factory, not only from public officials, but from Xinyi Canada itself. He argues the company has been deliberately vague about the amount of pollution the factory would produce, saying his best guess based on what's available from the company is the facility would quadruple the city's green house gas (GHG) emissions.""This is information that we've had to glean off the Xinyi website based on a similar sized plant located elsewhere,"" he said.""To make float glass, you have to heat it up to an incredible temperature and basically float it on molten steel. So the energy required to heat up the thing that actually tempers the glass.""""So that's our estimate, four times Stratford's emissions, but Xinyi has not actually come out and told anyone what those GHG emissions will be.""""That, to me, in relation to Stratford's declaration of a climate emergency, that's disqualifying on its face."" Donnelly wrote a letter to Stratford city council on December 3, outlining his clients' reasons why council should vote down the proposal.While questions over the proposed factory mount, the public may be able to get a chance to have some of those questions answered in a public forum soon. A representative from Xinyi Canada is scheduled to answer questions in an open forum with Stratford city council on December 14. "
Chinese spacecraft has fresh moon rock samples to return to Earth | CBC News,"China said Thursday its latest lunar probe has finished taking samples of the moon's surface and sealed them within the spacecraft for return to Earth, the first time such a mission has been attempted by any country in more than 40 years.",2020-12-03T13:48:11.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/moon-samples-1.5826500,"China said Thursday its latest lunar probe has finished taking samples of the moon's surface and sealed them within the spacecraft for return to Earth, the first time such a mission has been attempted by any country in more than 40 years.The Chang'e 5, the third Chinese probe to land on the moon, is the latest in a series of increasingly ambitious missions for Beijing's space program, which also has a probe en route to Mars carrying a robot rover.The Chang'e 5 touched down Tuesday on the Sea of Storms on the moon's near side, on a mission to return lunar rocks to Earth for the first time since 1976.The probe ""has completed sampling on the moon, and the samples have been sealed within the spacecraft,"" the China National Space Administration said in a statement.Plans call for the upper stage of the probe known as the ascender to be launched back into lunar orbit to transfer the samples to a capsule for return to Earth. The timing of its return was not immediately clear and the lander can last up to one moon day, or 14 Earth days, before falling temperatures would make it inoperable.Chang'e is equipped to both scoop samples from the surface and drill two metres to retrieve materials that could provide clues into the history of the moon, Earth other planets and space features.WATCH | An animation shows how Chang'e 5 was to land on the moon and collect samples:WorldWhile retrieving samples is its main task, the lander is also equipped to extensively photograph the area surrounding its landing site, map conditions below the surface with ground-penetrating radar and analyze the lunar soil for minerals and water content.Chang'e 5's return module is supposed to touch down around the middle of December on the grasslands of Inner Mongolia, where China's crewed Shenzhou spacecraft have made their returns since China first put a person in space in 2003, becoming only the third country do so after Russia and the United States.Chang'e 5 has revived talk of China one day sending a crewed mission to the moon and possibly building a scientific base there, although no timeline has been proposed for such projects.China also launched Its first temporary orbiting laboratory in 2011 and a second in 2016. Plans call for a permanent space station after 2022, possibly to be serviced by a reusable space plane.While China is boosting co-operation with the European Space Agency and others, interactions with NASA are severely limited by concerns over the secretive nature and close military links of the Chinese program."

Chinese sample return mission to the moon harkens back to 1960s lunar race | CBC Radio,Bob McDonald's blog: Robot mission will return first moon rocks since 1976,2020-11-27T19:50:56.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/radio/quirks/chinese-sample-return-mission-to-the-moon-harkens-back-to-1960s-lunar-race-1.5817888,"A Chinese robotic probe called Chang'e 5 is on its way to the moon where it will land, scoop up samples and return them to Earth. This is the first robotic sample return mission since Russian efforts in the 1960s. Those were an effort to make their mark on the lunar surface after their manned moon program failed.When Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin made their historic landing on the moon in July 1969, a secret Russian robotic probe called Luna 15 was there at the same time. It was an attempt to grab a sample of lunar soil and return it to Earth before the American astronauts got back. The Russians had lost the race to put humans on the moon, but were trying to grab a 'first' and master the moon robotically.Unfortunately, Luna 15 crashed during it's landing attempt and the opportunity for a propaganda coup was lost. However, their Luna 16 mission did successfully return about 100 grams of lunar soil a year later and two other sample return missions succeeded in following years, with the last one, Luna 24, in 1976 — two years after the Apollo program had ended. While these robotic sample return missions did not deliver as much lunar material as the Apollo astronauts, they were considerably cheaper and part of a long history of both Russian and American robotic lunar exploration involving dozens of impactors, orbiters, landers and rovers. In a way, we're in another moon race right now that echoes the race of fifty years ago — except this time it seems the robots might be in the lead. China is using robotic landers to explore the moon, and, if all goes well, Chang'e 5 will bring back several kilograms of moon rocks. In the meantime, the U.S. is struggling to develop a far more expensive effort, relying on huge (and much delayed) rockets that will carry humans to the moon with their Artemis program. It once again brings up the question of whether humans or robots are best suited to space exploration. We debated this on a special edition of Quirks & Quarks last year.Human missions are much more expensive, and historically they are much more politically driven than robotic exploration. The decision by the Kennedy administration in 1961 to send humans to the moon was part of the Cold War competition between the U.S. and Soviet Union to prove technical superiority over one another. The current Artemis program has also been politically influenced. Originally the plan was to first build a space station called Gateway in orbit around the moon. Once it was completed, astronauts would be sent down to the surface some time later this decade. When the Trump administration came to power, the landing was pushed forward to 2024, which would have been the last year of President Trump's second term in office. The Biden administration has not said whether it will keep to that tight schedule.NASA's giant new moon rocket, the Space Launch System (SLS) is slated to make its first flight next year. In the meantime three private companies — SpaceX, Blue Origin and Dynetics — have been contracted to develop lunar landers that would ride on their own rockets. But the pace of development in these programs makes NASA's current 2024 moon landing deadline pretty ambitious.Meanwhile, China is continuing its robotic program beyond the moon with the Tianwen 1 mission currently on its way to Mars. The spacecraft includes an orbiter and a lander, which will make China the third country to make a soft landing on Mars after Russia and the U.S. This is not a sample return mission, but it is not unreasonable to think that China could apply similar technology it is using on the moon to return samples from Mars in the future.Robots have always boldly gone where no one has gone before, exploring every planet in the solar system, as well as dwarf planets, moons, asteroids and comets. They conduct the initial reconnaissance of other worlds, survey the lay of the land and choose the best landing sites for humans who follow.  A whole fleet of robots are currently flying around the solar system. Two others are on their way to Mars with the United Arab Emirates' Hope mission and NASA's Perseverance lander scheduled to arrive in February.Beyond Mars, the Japanese Hayabusa2 and American, OSIRIS-REx spacecraft are bringing home samples they collected from asteroids. NASA is planning future missions to visit Europa, a moon of Jupiter and Titan, a mysterious moon of Saturn, the only moon with a thick atmosphere and liquid methane lakes on its surface.There is no doubt it will be a dramatic moment when the next human feet step out onto lunar soil again. Human exploration of space captures the imagination of the public, provides role models for young people and tests the limits of technical, physical and psychological endurance. But humans have not gone very far. The last mission to the moon was in 1972. It will still stretch the limits of our technology to get back there almost half a century later, Meanwhile, the true explorers of space, our silent mechanical servants, will continue their more far-reaching journeys to literally reach out and touch other worlds."
"McCallum says he tried to improve conditions for Kovrig, Spavor in Chinese prison | CBC News",One of Canada's most controversial ex-ambassadors to China says he repeatedly tried to improve the living conditions of Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor after their imprisonment in the People's Republic almost two years ago.,2020-11-25T01:09:05.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/chong-champagne-china-committee-1.5815179,"One of Canada's most controversial ex-ambassadors to China says he repeatedly tried to improve the living conditions of Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor after their imprisonment in the People's Republic almost two years ago. John McCallum also said Tuesday he regrets speaking about the October 2019 Canadian election in a meeting with Chinese officials in the months leading up to it. McCallum, the former Liberal cabinet minister who was fired as Canada's envoy to China in January 2019, was testifying at the special House of Commons committee on Canada-China relations. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau fired McCallum after he made a series of public comments that broke with the government's line following the arrests of Kovrig and Spavor. The two men were arrested nine days after Canada's arrest of Chinese high-tech scion Meng Wanzhou in December 2018 on a U.S. extradition warrant in what is widely viewed as retaliation by China. McCallum said that's when everything changed in Canada's relations with China. ""From that moment onwards, the top priority of the government and of myself as ambassador was to secure the release of the two Michaels,"" said McCallum, noting that he has been one of the few people to visit them in prison. ""On more than one occasion, I tried to convince the Chinese that if they were unable to release Kovrig and Spavor they should at least improve their living conditions. Sadly, as you all know, Canadian efforts in this area have so far been unsuccessful."" The committee has been examining Canada's relations with China, which have plummeted to an all-time low since December 2018.Earlier Tuesday, Conservative MP Michael Chong urged Foreign Affairs Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne to adopt a more consistent approach to getting tough with China. The Conservative foreign affairs critic told Champagne during a House of Commons committee meeting Tuesday that the government needs to show Canadians how it will deal with growing Chinese intimidation of Canadians within Canada. Chong said it is inconsistent for the government to be talking tougher on China, while Canada's current ambassador, Dominic Barton, is making speeches about the need to broaden trade with the People's Republic. ""I think it needs to be a lot clearer, a lot more consistent if Canada is going to have a clear, consistent voice with respect to China on the world stage,"" said Chong. Chong sponsored a motion that won approval in the Commons last week that calls on the government to decide within 30 days whether to allow China's Huawei Technologies to supply equipment for its next generation 5G internet network. Meng is a chief executive of Huawei. Champagne replied that Canada has taken a smart and firm approach with China lately that includes speaking out against its ill treatment of pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong and of ethnic Muslim Uighurs. ""Whether it comes to the Uighurs or whether it comes to Hong Kong, I've outlined places where we're going to challenge China, places where we're going to, for example, coexist with China,"" Champagne said."

What an Australian-style push against Chinese interference might look like | CBC News,"A motion brought by CPC foreign affairs critic Michael Chong, which passed Parliament last week, gives the government 30 days to come up with a plan — like Australia's — to fight foreign (Chinese) interference and influence campaigns. What might that look like and will it come to pass?",2020-11-24T09:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/china-canada-australia-espionage-1.5813364,"Some Australians see the country's new powers to stop foreign interference as an overdue shift from complacency to vigilance, while others have warned of the dangers of a McCarthyite moral panic.But all can agree that Australia's approach to foreign meddling in its politics, universities and public debate has changed a great deal in recent years.Last week, the Canadian House of Commons voted 179-146 for this country to adopt a plan similar to Australia's to counter meddling by the People's Republic of China.Experts in Canada and Australia suggest that such a change would set Canada on a much more aggressive path in countering China's inroads into this country's institutions.Conservative foreign affairs critic Michael Chong's motion requires the government to ""develop a robust plan, as Australia has done, to combat China's growing foreign operations here in Canada and its increasing intimidation of Canadians living in Canada, and table it within 30 days of the adoption of this motion.""Chong's motion received the support of most opposition members of the House, along with Liberals Wayne Easter, Nathaniel Erskine-Smith, John McKay and Jennifer O'Connell.Chong chose Australia as a model for Canada because of a package of laws passed in 2018 in the wake of a series of revelations that brought the issue of foreign interference and espionage to the fore.Sam Dastyari was an up-and-coming Labor Party senator when the year 2018 began. By the end of it he had admitted to soliciting thousands of dollars from businesses affiliated with the Chinese Communist Party. Thousands of Australians signed petitions demanding he face charges of treason.Australian media reports on Dastyari suggested he was a good investment for China. He not only supported Beijing's claims to the South China Sea — in opposition to the official position of his Labor Party — he also worked to prevent a meeting between his party leader and a Hong Kong pro-democracy activist.Dominique Dalla-Pozza teaches at the Centre for Military and Security Law at the Australian National University in Canberra (which itself allegedly has been a target of a massive Chinese intelligence operation). She said that for the past few years, the Australian Security Intelligence Organization (the ASIO — Australia's equivalent of Canada's CSIS) has been sounding the alarm about unprecedented levels of foreign intrusion.""ASIO said there were more foreign spies and their proxies operating in Australia than at the height of the Cold War,"" Dalla-Pozza said.In Canada, CSIS has been trying for years to draw Canadians' attention to foreign interference in everything from universities to municipal governments. Then-director Dick Fadden went public with such a warning in 2010. But Canada has seen no real legislative or organizational response.In Australia, by contrast, those warnings led the Turnbull government to introduce a new Espionage and Foreign Interference Act. Australia's laws don't single out China, the country's largest trading partner. When he introduced the bill in Parliament, then-PM Malcolm Turnbull was careful to cite other precedents, such as Russian meddling in the U.S. and French elections of 2016 and 2017. But there's no doubt in Australia about which foreign government is seen as the most active meddler. Over the last couple of months, Australia has raided the apartments of four Chinese journalists and revoked the visas of two Chinese academics.Dalla-Pozza said the law defines foreign interference as ""conduct that is engaged in concert with a foreign principal or a person that is acting on behalf of a foreign principal"" where ""the person engaging in the conduct is reckless as to whether it will influence government processes, or in other ways influence a democratic political right or duty.""Conduct has to be covert or involve deception, or involve a person making a threat to cause serious harm, or involve a person making a threat with menaces.""The new law produced its first arrest of a suspect two weeks ago: Di Sanh Duong, a prominent member of pro-Beijing Chinese-Australian organizations.The Turnbull government also brought in laws banning foreigners from donating to Australian politicians, placed new requirements on telecommunications companies to block foreign interference, and created a registry of critical infrastructure assets to provide more transparency on who really owns what in the country.And ""there are other mechanisms being developed in Australia that don't depend on the law,"" such as a new national coordinator, a public information campaign and a hotline, said Dalla-Pozza.""The act prescribes in a more focused way what is foreign interference, what is espionage, what is treason,"" said Patrick Walsh, who teaches at the Australian Graduate School for Policing and Security.Walsh said one of the most significant aspects of the law is that it allows Australia to fight back outside the courts.""The key is operational disruption of foreign interference, not just to collect information, but to disrupt it,"" he said.""In 2019 the PM established the Counter Foreign Interference Task Force, which is an interdepartmental task force to discover, track and disrupt foreign interference. And there was $8.7 million given to this task force.""The resources Australia devotes to this effort are not only centralized under a national coordinator, but are also far greater in terms of trained investigators than those available to the Government of Canada.Thirty days seems like a short time to design a full overhaul of Canada's approach to foreign interference, but Chong said Canada has a duty to protect people within its borders from harassment and intimidation by agents of foreign powers. ""It's long past time for the government to deal with this. Australia has already dealt with this. Our other allies have already dealt with this,"" he said. ""I note that on October 28, the FBI charged eight individuals, three of whom were Chinese citizens, for interfering and threatening American citizens through operations that are taking place on American soil.""The motion doesn't spell out any consequences for the government if it allows the 30 days to lapse. But Chong said that would be a harmful precedent given the strong cross-party support the motion received in Parliament.""I expect it to be carried out if the government follows democratic norms and respects the will of Parliament,"" he told CBC News. ""At a time when democracy is under pressure around the world, it's more important than ever that governments respect democratic norms."""

The classes are focused on language, but there is also instruction in martial arts, dancing, choir and yoga.After a few weeks of lockdown, the group started to experiment with activities online using Zoom. ""We tried some cooking classes because it's one of the favourite things that we like to do,"" Mu said, adding that the feedback was positive.CBC News New BrunswickFollowing the success of the online cooking classes, Mu and the group started to move most of the courses online. She said it was still difficult not to be together in person, but the online classes were working, especially for teaching the language.Some courses, like martial arts, couldn't really translate online.The success of the online classes gave Mu and the group the confidence to start preparing for the Chinese New Year gala. They are planning to hold it online this year.This year's theme of the gala is ""We are family"" — a nod to the community staying together during the pandemic.Jenny Zhang, a longtime volunteer with the association, said it is important to make sure there's a show this year, even if it's not on stage.""We put lots of effort, and the people worked together,"" Zhang said. Normally the group would start rehearsing in September for the show that is in January or early February, depending on the Chinese New Year.Instead of spending the fall rehearsing, they are busy recording sessions outdoors while the weather is still nice. On Sunday, about 20 people met at Killarney Lake, on Fredericton's north side, to film the choir singing.""Actually, I feel very confident right now,"" Mu said after spending the morning filming a video with the choir.""We support each other,"" she said, adding that the volunteers are learning how to make the gala online as they go. ""I think we're going to make it — I hope so,"" she said.Mu said the Chinese New Year is too important to the community to risk not having a gala, even if it's different from other years.""It is the most traditional way we will celebrate our Chinese New Year. It's kinda the most important day for the Chinese. We want to keep that tradition."""

He said it's time for Canada and its closest allies to adopt a more aggressive posture.""The democratic world must acknowledge that the approach to China over the last two decades has not worked. In fact, the situation has gotten worse,"" O'Toole told reporters on Parliament Hill.He said the move to normalize relations and admit China to the World Trade Organization has had ""catastrophic impacts for Canadian workers.""""We falsely believed that ignoring the sharp edges of communism would, over time, smooth them out by putting trade ahead of our values.""Conservative MP Michael Chong, the party's foreign affairs critic, will table a motion today to put pressure on the Liberal government to ban Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei from building Canada's 5G network. Most of the country's wireless providers have opted already to work with Sweden-based Ericsson.Huawei's founder has close ties to China's communist leadership and intelligence partners have long warned that the company's technology could be used to spy on Canadians. O'Toole said Huawei's global success is due in part to ""years of industrial espionage"" against the now-defunct Canadian tech giant Nortel.Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Tuesday the government's final decision on Huawei will be based on the recommendations of Canada's intelligence agencies. ""We've worked with our allies and we've consulted broadly,"" he said.The former director of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS), Ward Elcock, has said Huawei and all Chinese technology firms like it pose a significant risk to worldwide intelligence collection.Watch: Bains says the federal government ""will not be bullied or intimidated by any country."":PoliticsThe Conservative motion, if passed, also would compel the Liberal government to develop a comprehensive plan to protect Canada from ""the growing influence of Chinese agents"" on our soil.O'Toole said Canada has tolerated the proliferation of Confucius Institutes — state-backed Chinese language centres — that push state propaganda.O'Toole said Canadian university professors have been bullied into weakening their teachings on human rights abuses for fear of offending mainland Chinese students, while pro-Beijing media outlets have disseminated anti-western narratives.""Canadians of Chinese origin have been threatened by foreign agents in our country. Anti-Hong Kong protests were organized in Canada to bully democracy activists. Uighur students in our universities have been de-platformed and menaced in coordinated actions led by Chinese consulates across our country,"" he said.""And the very values we hold dear, like openness, justice and tolerance, have been weaponized against us.""O'Toole pointed to Australia's foreign interference law as something to emulate here. That country passed legislation in 2018 to toughen penalties on espionage while also requiring individuals or organizations acting in the interests of foreign powers to register and disclose their ties — part of an effort to reduce meddling by China in Australia's politics, universities and media.Under the legislation, it is illegal for a person to knowingly engage in covert conduct or deception on behalf of a ""foreign principal."" The first arrest under this law was made earlier this month when a prominent Chinese-Australian community activist was accused of trying to influence the country's immigration minister.Speaking later in question period, Trudeau said Canada has a ""complex multi-dimensional relationship with China"" and the country deals with Beijing ""with eyes wide open.""""We will remain firm in defending our principles and interests and always will,"" he said, adding that Canada's security agencies have been working with universities and colleges to address new Chinese threats to those institutions.""Canada has among the best security agencies in the world. The folks who work for our agencies work every single day to keep Canadians safe. Not all of it appears in the newspapers. On the contrary, a lot of the work that is done in important situations is never heard about at all,"" he said.Watch: Conservative MP Michael Chong says the federal government is ""paralyzed by indecision"" on Huawei:PoliticsAsked if passing such a motion would further damage already shaky bilateral relations between Canada and China, O'Toole said that while he's concerned about the status of two Canadians held in Chinese prisons, the current government's approach hasn't yielded results.Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor have been held in China for 708 days. ""A weak response by Mr. Trudeau has not led to any progress in the case of the two Michaels,"" O'Toole said. ""A more principled, a stronger approach may make progress.""China has retaliated against countries that have criticized its behaviour through trade action. O'Toole said Canada shouldn't be intimidated by such threats.""Canada should work very closely with our Five Eyes allies ... so that it's difficult for China to use its immense economic size to intimidate smaller economies like Canada,"" O'Toole said, citing the intelligence-sharing alliance between Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the U.S.""We may be a smaller economy in comparison with China but we are a giant when it comes to the rights we hold dear, human rights, the rule of law and the security of our citizens.""O'Toole said Canada must strengthen its relationship with other Asian economies — Canada joined the Trans-Pacific Partnership in 2017 — and bolster trade with India. ""We need to look for new markets,"" he said.The motion comes days after the House of Commons subcommittee on international human rights released a report condemning China for committing genocidal acts against the Uighur Muslim minority. Canada's ambassador to the UN, Bob Rae, said Sunday he would encourage the body's human rights committee to probe the plight of China's Uighur population."

"Quest for the Best: Here's the top ginger beef in Calgary, says restaurant critic | CBC News","The Calgary Eyeopener's restaurant reviewer, Elizabeth Carson, went on a hunt for the best ginger beef in Calgary and the results are in.",2020-12-12T15:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/ginger-beef-food-critic-calgary-1.5838147,"Ordering Chinese food for dinner would not be the same if it didn't come with some saucy ginger beef.Some say it makes the meal, so it's strange to think of a time when the dish didn't exist.And what's interesting is that the popular item didn't come from some far away part of the world — it is believed to have been created in Calgary.It is said that George Wong, a chef from northern China, invented it at the Silver Inn Restaurant on Centre Street North in Calgary in the 1970s.His daughter, Michelle Wong, says that it all started from a stir-fry beef recipe.""Dad was trying to find some sort of recipe that would bring a little bit of the Western cuisine to Chinese cuisine,"" she told the Calgary Eyeopener.""He kind of lightly battered the beef and tried this recipe out and that's how ginger beef was born.""The dish became so popular that it is now available in some form all across Canada.And because of its hometown roots, restaurant reviewer Elizabeth Carson has been on a quest for the best ginger beef the city has to offer.Her judges this week are self-acclaimed ginger beef addicts Michaela Marchand and Danielle La Banc.The panel of judges set off across Calgary and rated the ginger beef at four restaurants.When trying the saucy beef, the judges looked at a variety of features for their critiques.Carson says they were looking at beef-to-batter ratio, spice and sweet level, crunch, stickiness and the presentation.4.

Canada's ties to China's military underscore the weird contradictions in its foreign policy | CBC News,It's been obvious for some time that there is something a little weird about the way Canada approaches its relationship with China — a disconnect brought into sharp relief this week by the news that Global Affairs and the Department of National Defence were not on the same page when it came to military ties and training involving the People’s Liberation Army.,2020-12-12T09:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canada-china-pla-peoples-liberation-army-1.5838658,"It's been obvious for some time that there is something weird about the way Canada approaches its relationship with China — a disconnect brought into sharp relief this week by the news that Global Affairs and the Department of National Defence were not on the same page when it came to military ties and training involving the People's Liberation Army.In some respects, the volcanic online political eruption which followed stories in The Globe and Mail and other media outlets, based on exclusive access to information documents, was predictable, as was the flurry of finger-pointing in the House of Commons on Thursday and Friday.Diplomats were alarmed when Gen. Jonathan Vance, the country's senior military commander, cancelled winter military exercises with the PLA in 2019, fretting that it might aggravate Beijing or make the lives of Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor even worse.It makes for fire-breathing memes, sizzling copy and wonderful political theatre.What's missing, though, is a recognition that Canada's policy toward a rising China has been contradictory and incoherent for almost a decade, maybe more, said Charles Burton, a political scientist at Brock University in St. Catharines, Ont. and a respected China expert at the Macdonald-Laurier Institute.""Cabinets were always split on China, whether it's Liberal or Conservative,"" Burton said, referring to debates more than three decades ago during the government of former prime minister Brian Mulroney.It is more urgent than ever, in the context of an increasingly belligerent and assertive China, to present a united political front, he added.""This is really about the defence of our sovereignty and security on matters over which there is consensus across the political spectrum in Canada,"" he said.Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan, in an attempt at political damage control late this week, made a point of saying that Chinese troops are no longer training for winter warfare at Garrison Petawawa, Ont.He also (rather meekly) noted that the exchange and training program with the PLA was instituted in August 2013 under the Conservatives while defence critic James Bezan, one of the most vocal and fiery opponents this week, was parliamentary secretary of defence.Bezan's retort was along the lines of that was then, this is now.""The defence minister knows full well that the Chinese government back then and the Chinese government today are completely different,"" Bezan said during question period on Thursday.It was a different time, no question.Chinese President Xi Jinping had taken office only a few months before, and the Department of National Defence (DND) tasking order that established the exchange program, obtained by CBC News under access to information, noted that working with the PLA ""complements the Government of Canada led efforts to broaden our bilateral relationship with China.""After years of hectoring and hammering China, the Conservatives — under former prime minister Stephen Harper — had decided that limited engagement was the way to go.And here is where Canada's curious incoherence comes into play.At precisely the moment the former chief of the defence staff, the now-retired general Tom Lawson, was penning the Canadian military's marching orders on closer cooperation with the PLA, the foreign affairs ministry — led at the time by John Baird — was firing off flares about China's unilateral declaration of an air defence zone in the East China Sea.It was a bellwether moment.""The U.S. has indicated deep concern over the establishment of the Chinese ADIZ stating that the U.S. views this development as a destabilizing attempt to alter the status quo in the region and that this move increases the risk of misunderstanding and miscalculations,"" said a Nov. 23, 2013 briefing note to Baird, obtained by CBC News in 2017.""More broadly, the rise of China is reshaping the strategic landscape.""Burton said the rise of President Xi marked the beginning of the new, more aggressive China. The establishment of the air zone — now largely forgotten against a backdrop of fortified artificial islands in the South China Sea, reports of Uyghurs in concentration camps and the haze of tear gas in Hong Kong — marked the first step.So were our politicians and senior leaders paying attention not only to events, but to what other federal departments were saying?According to what former foreign affairs minister (and current finance minister) Chrystia Freeland had to say in question period this week, the answer is yes.""I have long personal experience reporting on authoritarian communist regimes and I am very aware of the threat they pose,"" she said.Here's the question no one seemed to ask this week: why was the military exchange and training program still going on even before hostage diplomacy swept up the two Michaels?National Defence is no stranger to suspicions about China, having spent an enormous amount of time quietly defending itself from cyberattacks purportedly launched by  Beijing or by groups associated with it.The Trump administration has been tightening the screws on China from a diplomatic, security and trade perspective. There has been considerable, growing debate among Western allies — led by the Americans — about the downside of military engagement and co-operation with China, with Five Eyes intelligence partners each exchanging their own warnings — a series of discussions that eventually prompted Canada's current top military commander, Gen. Jonathan Vance, to cancel the winter warfare exercises.And then, of course, there's debate over the telecom giant Huawei and its future in this country.The signs were all there, Burton said — but no one actually woke up to the problem until Kovrig and Spavor were imprisoned. The public has been galvanized, he added, but ""it doesn't seem to have penetrated fully to the senior levels of the political and economic elite.""Burton said that — as weird as it might sound, with everything else that has happened — he believes there are some within the Canadian Establishment who still cling to the notion that if the ""consular cases of Spavor and Kovrig are resolved, we can go back"" to business as usual."

Chinese viewers pan Disney's new Mulan as inauthentic | CBC News,"The remake of Mulan drew decidedly mixed reviews in China after its coronavirus-delayed release in China last week, with thousands panning it online.",2020-09-17T15:37:10.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/chinese-viewers-pan-mulan-1.5727823,"The remake of Mulan struck all the right chords to be a hit in the key Chinese market. Disney cast beloved actor Liu Yifei as Mulan and removed a dragon sidekick popular in the animated original to cater to Chinese tastes.Still, the movie drew decidedly mixed reviews after its coronavirus-delayed release in China last week, with thousands panning it online.The movie was rated 4.9 out of 10 by more than 165,000 people on Douban, a leading website for film, book and music ratings. Negative comments and jokes about the film outnumbered positive reactions on social media.Mulan has earned an estimated 198 million yuan ($39 million Cdn) since its opening last week, and was the second most watched movie in China as of Thursday, according to ticketing platform Maoyan. It scored a higher 7.5 out of 10 on Maoyan, but also with mixed reviews.""Poor artistic level, misunderstanding of Chinese culture lead to the film's failure in China,"" the state-run Global Times newspaper tweeted.Chinese critics, both at home and abroad, said they were disappointed with the film's inaccurate and stereotypical portrayals of Chinese history and the main character, infused with nationalist tropes.Others were not as bothered.""It's fine that different screenwriters make up different stories,"" Zhang Qin, a military veteran, said after watching the film in Beijing last week. ""They can play with imagination and it's a good thing.""IT engineer Zhang Fan also had positive things to say about the film. ""What touched me is the humanity,"" he said.The remake of Disney's popular 1998 animation is based on the ancient tale of Hua Mulan, a young woman who takes her father's place in the army by dressing as a man.The animated version was a global hit but earned just $30 million in China, where viewers found the movie too Americanized, according to reports at the time.The original tale, The Ballad of Mulan, has gone through multiple renditions. Themes such as filial piety and being loyal to the central government have remained as core tenets, which some find outdated and problematic.""It's a very touchy subject in modern China because a lot of people find [filial piety] very constraining, including me,"" said Xiran Jay Zhao, the Chinese Canadian author of an upcoming book about the only female emperor in China. ""It's like a moral shackle for people.""Critics also pointed out inaccurate details such as the use of a southern-style house when Mulan is likely from the north and a depiction of ""qi"" as a magic power that only boys can wield — in Chinese philosophy, it is a force not limited by gender.Some called the makeup and costumes ugly and inauthentic.Zhao said the film comes off more like European fantasy than a Chinese story, and noted that the film's crew was mostly white, including the director, four screenwriters and costume designer.""They didn't really get any Chinese people on the writing staff, and it really showed,"" she said.Jeannette Ng, a Chinese fantasy writer based in the United Kingdom, said the film perpetuates a narrative of China's majority Han people that assimilates and excludes minorities including ethnic Mongolians, Tibetans and Uighurs.""The mainland Chinese people aren't the mainland Chinese viewers from 20 years ago,"" she said of the lukewarm response. ""The culture has moved on.""Her comments mirror the latest in a series of controversies that have hit the film outside mainland China.The movie's final credits thank propaganda departments and a public security bureau in Xinjiang, where part of it was filmed.China has come under widespread criticism for detaining Uighurs and other predominantly Muslim minorities in Xinjiang as part of a campaign to snuff out sometimes-violent struggle against Chinese rule.Earlier, a boycott movement was sparked after Liu, the actor who portrays Mulan, publicly supported Hong Kong police as they battled pro-democracy protesters last year.Hong Kong resident Sarah Chan said she does not plan to see the film, which opened in her city on Thursday.""The main actress ... supports Hong Kong police, so I don't want to watch it,"" Chan said. ""Furthermore, I think they changed the historical background of the story. It's not the same story anymore.""Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian defended Liu last week, calling her a ""Mulan of the modern times.""Disney did not reply to a request for comment."

Chinese ambassador should apologize or be expelled for 'threatening' Canadians in Hong Kong: activist | CBC Radio,"China's ambassador to Canada should apologize or be expelled for remarks he made about the 300,000 Canadians in Hong Kong, says a Canadian living in the semi-autonomous region.",2020-10-21T20:40:26.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/radio/asithappens/as-it-happens-wednesday-edition-1.5771041/chinese-ambassador-should-apologize-or-be-expelled-for-threatening-canadians-in-hong-kong-activist-1.5771042,"Read Story TranscriptChina's ambassador to Canada should apologize or be expelled for remarks he made about the 300,000 Canadians in Hong Kong, says a Canadian living in the semi-autonomous region. Last week, Ambassador Cong Peiwu warned the Canadian government not to grant asylum to Hong Kong residents fleeing China's controversial national security law, which bans secessionist, subversive or terrorist activities, and has been wielded against critics and protesters. China imposed the law on Hong Kong, which is supposed to have legal autonomy under the ""one country, two systems"" agreement.""If the Canadian side really cares about the stability and the prosperity in Hong Kong, and really cares about the good health and safety of those 300,000 Canadian passport holders in Hong Kong, and the large number of Canadian companies operating in Hong Kong … you should support those efforts to fight violent crimes,"" Cong said.Canada's deputy prime minister Chrystia Freeland said the ambassador's remarks were ""not in any way in keeping with the spirit of appropriate diplomatic relations between two countries."" Conservative Leader Erin O'Toole says that if Cong refuses to apologize, Canada should withdraw his diplomatic credentials.Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian defended Cong's remarks, saying Canadian leaders ""did not verify, but also condoned the anti-China comments spreading across the nation and made groundless accusations against China.""Edward Chin agrees with O'Toole. He is a Canadian hedge fund manager who lives and works in Hong Kong, and a longtime activist in the Hong Kong pro-democracy movement. Here is part of his conversation with As It Happens host Carol Off. Mr. Chin, how secure do you feel as a Canadian in Hong Kong right now?I think this [statement from the ambassador] is one of the so-called wolf warrior tactics they have been using over the last couple of years. But it kind of got escalated in the last little while.Do you feel secure since these remarks on the part of the [Chinese] ambassador? Even before this gentlemen's remarks, after the [national security law] came into effect, I don't think anyone would feel secure in Hong Kong because this is exactly one country, one system now. So how can anyone feel secure in Hong Kong?Because last year, every Hong Kong person, more than two million people, came out to fight very hard [against] the extradition bill that finally got retracted. Now, this is 10 times worse. This is the nuclear option that they think of.But this seems to have been in reaction to suggestions that Canada would offer asylum to people from Hong Kong, democracy activists who are feeling threatened by the … national security law since it came into place, and that this has been the way that Hong Kong [has reacted] to Canada's offer of asylum. Does that change things?I think Canada has done the right thing to give asylum to those demonstrators who came out and [fought] for democracy, because they were fighting for their life, basically.We have to go back a few months earlier. Why do people come up and protest? Because the two systems is gone. Now, the Chinese ambassador to Canada, you know, whatever he said is threatening. Threatening. This is outrageous, honestly. I think he should be reprimanded.China's ambassador in Ottawa was … warning against the granting asylum to Hong Kong dissidents, and he said, ""If the Canadian side really cares about the stability and the prosperity in Hong Kong and really cares about the good health and safety of those 300,000 Canadian passport holders in Hong Kong and the large number of Canadian companies operating Hong Kong, you should support those efforts to fight violent crimes."" And, of course, is referring to the national security law. Does that sound like a threat to you?Does it mean that they want to treat the Chinese-Canadians or Caucasian-Canadians in Hong Kong, just like the two Michaels, just to abduct them into China?They could just use any excuse and detain someone.I think that the Trudeau government, [Prime Minister] Justin Trudeau together with Chrystia Freeland, I think they should really have a strong statement saying, you know, like, ""This is a threat."" Because, you know, there are a lot of mainland students studying in Canada.Canada, they don't do the same type of threat. This is something really outrageous, and only like a totalitarian regime would do that, threatening people.Chrystia Freeland has spoken out in Canada. She has said this is not in the spirit of diplomatic relations … but the Opposition is saying that the government should go further, that in fact, they should demand the ambassador either apologize or leave the country, have his credentials pulled. Do you think that Canada should go that far?The opposition party is saying the right thing. Because definitely this Chinese ambassador … should definitely apologize.The Opposition leader, I agree with him. You know, they should do something to show that Canada is not one of the weakest Five Eyes countries. Because it's perceived that way, especially in Hong Kong.You have been an activist. You have been outspoken for years, even before this national security law came into effect, and as you point out, became something where people who speak out against China could be arrested, that free speech has been criminalized.... Are you concerned that they you might be targeted by the regime right now, given what they've said about Canada?Everyone could be targetted. I mean, we as Chinese-Canadians, we are in a very awkward situation now. Ethnically, I'm Chinese, so it is embarrassing to have a Chinese ambassador to Canada saying they will do some harm to Chinese people living in Hong Kong, whether I am Canadian or not. So they're saying they want to do something bad to their own people.I don't dislike China. I think it's a great country with a great civilization. But the CCP, the Chinese Communist Party, the way they treat their own people, is very questionable.And that's why [former Chinese leader] Deng Xiaoping promised the two systems until 2047. But now we are short-changed by 27 years.Can I just ask you, finally, do you think there will be many people in Hong Kong … the activists, will they be seeking asylum? Do you think they will ask to be refugees to Canada?I don't think there will be a massive exodus. But in terms of persecution, yes, definitely. Those people living in Hong Kong, whether they are Hong Kong permanent ID card holders or anyone in Hong Kong now, their situation is the same as if they were in mainland China. There's no difference. No doubt about it.Will you ever leave Hong Kong? Do you think that's something that you might have to do?Besides my investment business in hedge funds and all my other hedges, I'm a current affairs writer, a commentator. I think I want to wait until they put a gunpoint at someone's head; and I think that would be the time that we all should leave.And if they shut down, for instance, Apple Daily or some of the internet radio, or they arrest a lot of full-time political commentators, that's the time I think a lot of people should leave, and then the whole world should talk with the CCP and confront with them in a forceful way.Written by Sheena Goodyear with files from The Associated Press.

Chinese envoy warns Canada against granting asylum to Hong Kong protesters | CBC News,The Chinese ambassador to Canada warned the Trudeau government today not to grant asylum to Hong Kong residents fleeing a widely criticized national security law imposed by Beijing.,2020-10-15T18:12:27.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/china-canada-ambassador-hong-kong-spavor-kovrig-meng-huawei-1.5763677,"The Chinese ambassador to Canada warned the Trudeau government today not to grant asylum to Hong Kong residents fleeing a widely criticized national security law imposed by Beijing.""We strongly urge the Canadian side not (to) grant so-called political asylum to those violent criminals in Hong Kong,"" Ambassador Cong Peiwu said in a video press conference from the Chinese Embassy in Ottawa.He said that would amount to ""interference in China's domestic affairs, and certainly it will embolden those violent criminals.""Hong Kong was supposed to operate under a ""one country, two systems"" deal after Britain handed its former colony over to Beijing in 1997 under an international agreement. But human rights and pro-democracy advocates say Beijing's new national security law is undermining freedom in what is known as the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.""So if the Canadian side really cares about the stability and the prosperity in Hong Kong, and really cares about the good health and safety of those 300,000 Canadian passport holders in Hong Kong, and the large number of Canadian companies operating in Hong Kong SAR, you should support those efforts to fight violent crimes,"" Cong said.Cong also flatly rejected Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's assertion that China is engaging in coercive diplomacy by imprisoning two Canadian men in retaliation for the arrest of a Chinese high-tech executive on an American extradition warrant. Meng Wanzhou is living under house arrest in Vancouver while her case wends through a British Columbia court.In December 2018, China imprisoned Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor and charged them with undermining the country's national security. Cong said they are still undergoing a legal process in China but did not provide further details.He repeated his government's demand that Canada release Meng immediately but insisted her case and his government's prosecution of Kovrig and Spavor are not linked.""We will remain absolutely committed to working with our allies to ensure that China's approach of coercive diplomacy, its arbitrary detention of two Canadian citizens, alongside other citizens of other countries around the world, is not viewed as a successful tactic by them,"" Trudeau said earlier this week as the two countries marked 50 years of relations at one of the lowest points in Canada-China bilateral relations.Cong said Canada's efforts to get other countries to join its fight for Kovrig and Spavor is ""doomed to fail.""The European Union raised concerns about the two Canadians by name in the communique summarizing its recent summit with China.""We oppose any remarks that interfere in our internal affairs. And I would like to point out, there is no coercive diplomacy on the Chinese side,"" Cong said."

"I want my baby to grow up proud of her heritage. But with rising anti-Chinese racism, I'm struggling | CBC Radio",Lisa Xing wants to raise her child with pride in her Chinese heritage in spite of a surge in anti-Chinese racism due to COVID-19.,2020-10-03T09:01:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/radio/docproject/from-afar-1.5710871/i-want-my-baby-to-grow-up-proud-of-her-heritage-but-with-rising-anti-chinese-racism-i-m-struggling-1.5710879,"My parents immigrated to Canada from China in their thirties. I came when I was five. So I thought they would be honoured when I bestowed upon them the responsibility of giving their granddaughter a name. A Chinese name. To my surprise (and dismay), I realized just how much they were against this child having a Chinese name. They said the first name should be easy to pronounce.Finally, after my daughter was born on September 29, 2020, my partner Nathan and I settled on Minmin, pronounced ""Ming Ming"". The first Min means ""fall"", the second Min, ""easygoing"" and ""gentle"". It was my mom's suggestion, after she gave in to my pleas.Not only do I think it's user friendly, it's beautiful written in Chinese as 旻旼. Both words using the same two radicals (parts that form a character), just rearranged differently. The choice of my child's name is just one way I am trying to instill a sense of pride in her Chinese heritage. I want her to embrace it, even though anti-Chinese racism has been on the rise since COVID-19.My partner, Nathan, is white. He grew up on a tobacco farm in southwestern Ontario. Our baby is biracial. Throughout the pregnancy, we often talked about how she would look, how I'll manage to get her to speak Mandarin (as I am just a basic speaker myself), and the responsibility of choosing a name that would inevitably play a role in shaping her identity. But although we went ahead and named her Minmin, the current social and political climate has wedged some fear into my mind. It's not treatment from kids on the playground that worries me. It's the recent resurgence of racism that is different to the kind of intolerance I experienced as a child. Trump calls COVID-19 the ""China virus."" And since the coronavirus outbreak, there has been widespread racism against Chinese people, since the virus originated in Wuhan, China. I hate to say it, but in this context, something as superficial as looking more ""white"" or having an English name could spare my daughter a lot of pain. While I know she could get by easier by blending in, this hate also stirred up a defiance in me that made me want to instill that pride in being Chinese even more, so she can have a bulletproof attitude, as Nathan says, and so that none of it will bother her the way it bothered me. I wasn't always called ""Lisa."" My Chinese name is Yaxi (pronounced Ya-shee). That's what I went by as a child growing up in Hamilton, Ont. Everyone butchered it, intentionally or otherwise. Some called me ""Taxi"" or ""Yucky"". So the summer before high school, my best friend – who also had a difficult-for-North-Americans-to-pronounce name, Yiqing – and I decided to change our names. After fighting with my parents to let me change mine to ""Melanie,"" a cringe-worthy homage to Mel B of the Spice Girls, I finally relented and we went with ""Lisa,"" the English name my dad had chosen for me when I first came to Canada. Yiqing chose ""Myra."" The name change took some getting used to, though ultimately, it made life easier. But some time after university, I started realizing just how unique my Chinese name was: Ya, the last part of my mom's name, and Xi, which means ""dawn."" After my own experiences, and the ensuing struggle with my parents over my daughter's name, I hope Minmin will embrace it. I want her to be defiant and proud and confident. And I hope she won't take as long as I did to get there.  "

Chinese astronauts blast off on historic mission,"China has launched its historic space docking mission, carrying the country's first female astronaut into space.",2012-06-16T00:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/chinese-astronauts-blast-off-on-historic-mission-1.1202532,"China launched its most ambitious space mission yet on Saturday, carrying its first female astronaut and two male colleagues in an attempt to dock with an orbiting module and work on board for more than a week.The Shenzhou 9 capsule lifted off as scheduled at 6:37 p.m. local time (1237 GMT) evening from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center on the edge of the Gobi Desert. All systems functioned normally and, just over 10 minutes later, it opened its solar panels and entered orbit.Female astronaut Liu Yang, 33, and two male crew members — veteran astronaut Jing Haipeng and newcomer Liu Wang — are to dock the spacecraft with a prototype space lab launched last year in a key step toward building a permanent space station.Two of the astronauts will live and work inside the module to test its life-support systems while the third will remain in the capsule to deal with any unexpected emergencies.China is hoping to join the United States and Russia as the only countries to send independently maintained space stations into orbit. It is already one of just three nations to have launched manned spacecraft on their own.Another manned mission to the module is planned for later this year, while possible future missions could include sending a man to the moon.[IMAGEGALLERY galleryid=2572 size=small]The program is a source of enormous national pride for China, reflecting its rapid economic and technological progress and ambition to rank among the world's leading nations.At a sending off ceremony for the astronauts, the ruling Communist Party's No. 2 official, Wu Bangguo, told the crew, ""The country and people await your victorious return.""The module, called Tiangong 1, is only a prototype, and the plan is to replace it with a larger permanent space station due for completion around 2020.That station is to weigh about 60 tons, slightly smaller than NASA's Skylab of the 1970s and about one-sixth the size of the 16-nation International Space Station.China has only limited co-operation in space with other nations and its exclusion from the ISS, largely on objections from the United States, was one of the key spurs for it to pursue an independent space program 20 years ago.China first launched a man into space in 2003 followed by a two-man mission in 2005 and a three-man trip in 2008 that featured the country's first space walk.In November 2011, the unmanned Shenzhou 8 successfully docked twice with Tiangong 1 by remote control.The selection of the first female astronaut is giving the space program an additional publicity boost.""Arranging for women astronauts to fly is not only a must for the development of human spaceflight, but also the expectation of the public,"" space program spokeswoman Wu Ping said. ""This is a landmark event.""Speaking Friday, Liu Yang said: ""We won't let you down. We will work together and successfully complete this mission."""

But, with a new bridge in sight, a group of Chinese-Canadian veterans are calling on the government to come up with a new name representative of the diverse people living across the province.King Wan, the president of Chinese-Canadian Veterans Unit 280 said ""when premier Pattullo was running the province [in 1937], it was a very dark time for ethnic people.""He said the name brings with it a sad and destructive past and reminds Chinese Canadians about a premier who they say wanted to block the Chinese community from making Canada its home and having the right to be franchised and able to vote.""Perhaps we should name that bridge under a different name to honour those who came, I guess, you know, in the last century that have made a lot of contributions to the province,"" Wan said.He said it's time to put history in the past, and while he will not push to change the name of the current bridge, he'd like to see a new name on the new bridge that is set to start construction later this year.""I'm not suggesting it be a Chinese name or whatever .. but maybe consider it being voted on by the citizens in the area,"" Wan said.New Wesminster NDP candidate Jennifer Whiteside, said she's not married to the Pattullo name for the new bridge. ""It would be entirely appropriate to look for a new name that reflects the diversity of the community, a name the community can celebrate. Yeah, I think that would be wonderful,"" Whiteside said.She said she would rely on the independent processes that exist already to address naming of major infrastructure projects, which would take into account the feelings of the community.On the other side of the Pattullo Bridge, Surrey-Whalley Liberal candidate Shaukat Khan said the name change is one he'd also support opening to consultation.""As far as I'm concerned, we should always be engaging with our communities and taking input on all [of] the projects.Both parties are in agreement a name change wouldn't be off the table, but a consultation process would be necessary to decide the correct one.Wan said he'd like to see a vote by community members.""A new bridge, a new beginning, a new era, it will really help strengthen our local population to be more inclusive,"" Wan said.The project for the new bridge is set to start later this year and carry through until 2023. The $1.4-billion project will see a new four-lane bridge built with wider lanes connecting Surrey and New Westminster."

Chinese dairy investor pressed Canada to 'mitigate the risk' of new NAFTA | CBC News,"Executives of the Chinese infant formula manufacturer that’s building a new $332 million plant in Kingston, Ont. contacted Canadian officials to complain about the new NAFTA agreement within days of the agreement being reached — and asked for help in mitigating the harm caused by Canada's concessions.",2020-09-29T08:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/monday-feihe-nafta-atip-1.5739152,"Less than three weeks after talks concluded on the revised North American free trade agreement, executives from a Chinese infant formula manufacturer that had invested $332 million to build a new plant in Kingston, Ont. asked for a sudden meeting with Canadian officials.Zhiwen Yang, the general manager of Canada Royal Milk — the Canadian subsidiary of China Feihe Limited — wrote to then-Agriculture Minister Lawrence MacAulay and the Liberal MP for Kingston and the Islands, Mark Gerretsen, describing how Canada's concessions in the Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement (CUSMA) put his business plans in jeopardy by limiting how much cow's milk formula it can export and dismantling the dairy ingredient pricing system.Yang asked the federal government to ""mitigate the risks to the project."" His three-page letters, dated Oct. 16, 2018, were released to CBC News under the Access to Information Act.A few days later, Feihe International Inc. ""respectfully"" asked the president of the Canadian Food Inspection Agency and another senior government official to meet for 90 minutes on Oct. 29 with Yang and his boss, Feihe International chair Youbin Leng, who was travelling to Canada with his directors of research and regulatory affairs.""The purpose of the meeting is to discuss the regulatory framework in China and explore how we can work together. The expectation is not for a decision to be made, but to begin a conversation,"" said the email from Carey Bidtnes, Canada Royal Milk's human resources manager, who was part of the team that worked on bringing this investment to Canada during her previous employment with the Kingston Economic Development Corporation. Bidtnes said that Canada Royal Milk was working with Health Canada and the CFIA to ""resolve a challenge"" with exporting its formula.The documents reveal that the financial stakes for Feihe were higher by the fall of 2018 than they were in 2017, when CBC News reported on the potential international trade issues triggered by Feihe's plans to export the vast majority of the infant formula it manufactures in Canada back to Chinese consumers.As construction began, the Chinese investment was pegged at $225 million. A year later, the investment was estimated at $332 million and project proponents were predicting it would bring 277 direct full-time jobs to the region once production ramps up. A further 300 construction jobs have been created in the Kingston area and the plant is expected to generate the equivalent of over 1,000 more jobs in its eventual supply chain.Chinese companies have a deeper relationship with China's central government than private sector firms in North America do with their own national governments. Feihe is listed on the Hong Kong stock exchange, but its subsidiary, Canada Royal Milk, is incorporated in Canada.The investment — the largest foreign direct investment in Ontario agriculture in the last decade — was finalized with officials from the Canadian Dairy Commission during a 2016 visit to Canada by Chinese Premier Li Keqiang.American officials were monitoring this Chinese investment. President Donald Trump — and the powerful U.S. farm lobby — regard Canada's supply management system as ""unfair"" because it blocks most American dairy from Canada's domestic market.In the CUSMA, Canada agreed to several concessions that harm its dairy industry — including strict limits, enforced by new export charges, on international exports of infant formula and skim milk.CUSMA's export limit for cow's milk formula is lower than what Feihe originally planned to produce in Kingston, according to a presentation obtained three years ago by CBC News.Newly released government talking points say Canadian negotiators ""were in contact with a number of individuals with direct knowledge of the proposed facility's operations,"" including the Kingston Economic Development Corporation, ""to ensure negotiators had a thorough understanding of the intended operation … with a view to avoiding unintended impacts.""It's the same response CBC News got in 2018 when it asked whether Canada's NAFTA renegotiation team spoke directly to Feihe about its plans before signing off.Another concession Canada agreed to in the CUSMA talks dismantled part of its dairy pricing regime, ending lower ingredient pricing that kept processors competitive. Canada's prices are now based on American rates.When Feihe agreed to invest in Ontario, Canada's lower ingredient price was part of its forecasts.Xinhua, the Chinese news agency, reported that then-foreign affairs minister Chrystia Freeland spoke to Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi to brief him within days of concluding CUSMA negotiations.But if the two ministers discussed the dairy concessions, they apparently didn't resolve the manufacturer's concerns because the documents show that, within days of that conversation, Feihe began its own outreach to the Canadian government.Earlier presentations of Canada Royal Milk's business plans didn't mention producing and exporting skim milk powder for the adult market. But this letter to MacAulay said the company would produce skim powder for export during a ""ramp up"" period of testing the new facility. Canada already has a significant surplus of skim milk powder, left over after meeting Canada's strong demand for butter. Making baby formula at this new plant was supposed to help use up this surplus, not exacerbate it.The global market for skim is crowded and ultra-competitive, with American farmers hostile to any threats. Under the World Trade Organization's Nairobi Agreement, Canada agreed to stop exporting skim milk products as of January 2021.""The export cap is a very serious issue for the operations of the company for 2019 and 2020,"" the letter from general manager Yang to then-minister MacAulay said, ""and we believe it will hinder the growth of the entire industry in the future.""In its correspondence, Feihe asked for assurances that its facility had the support of all levels of government. It also requested ""reasonable quota"" so it could take maximum advantage of the tariff-free exports that would be allowed under the CUSMA, including a ""guarantee that the full annual export quota for infant formula would be assigned to Canada Royal Milk.""Canada is allocating its export quota for skim milk powder based on processors' past production. But for infant formula, export quota was distributed according to planned production — presumably to accommodate the new plant coming online.""Currently, details on which entities have received an allocation for the dairy export thresholds are not public,"" Jean-Sébastien Comeau, a spokesperson for Agriculture Minister Marie-Claude Bibeau, told CBC News.In a question redacted from one document released to CBC News but repeated without redaction in another, Yang also asked the government if it would ""take steps to limit the licensing of new infant formula manufacturing in Canada.""While that appears to be anti-competitive behaviour, no other Canadian dairy processor has shown interest in making infant formula in recent years — which is why Canada pursued the Chinese investment in the first place.On the demise of ingredient pricing, ""it's unclear how this will impact our operations in the medium to long term,"" Yang's letter to MacAulay said.""Our team has already been contacted by U.S. dairy producers who are eager to sell their products to us,"" the letter continues.""What has the government proposed to assist dairy processors to overcome the loss of [ingredient] pricing?""The letter sent to MP Gerretsen repeated the same demands.Although Bibeau announced funding for dairy producers harmed by trade deals with the European Union and Pacific Rim countries in the days leading up to the 2019 federal election, the industry is still waiting for the compensation it was promised when NAFTA was replaced.It's unclear whether Canada Royal Milk would be eligible for compensation but the Chinese investment has qualified for other federal and provincial support programs.If Feihe believes its investment was harmed by Canada's concessions, it could sue for damages under the 2012 Canada–China Foreign Investor Protection Agreement, which was negotiated by the previous Conservative government.""The sued country can opt not to make public anything until an arbitration award,"" Osgoode Hall law professor and investment treaty specialist Gus Van Harten said, noting this agreement is unique in this regard.International Trade Minister Mary Ng's spokesperson Ryan Nearing said ""there has been no dispute launched against Canada under the Canada-China FIPA to date, nor notification of an intention to do so.""In an interview with CBC, MP Gerretsen said he passed on the requests he received from the company to officials at Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada. But he said the only formal encounter he's had with Canada Royal Milk was a tour of the construction site in his riding earlier in 2018.""A number of the issues that were in their letter I believe have been addressed,"" he said.In departmental email, one bureaucrat called Yang's correspondence ""an interesting letter indeed.""Before federal government officials met with the Chinese, two senior officials from Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's office, Brian Clow and Simon Beauchemin, joined an ""urgent briefing"" with MacAulay's office — an ""additional twist,"" another bureaucrat called it.""The Chairman is in Canada in the context of making more investment,"" a senior official said. The request to meet with the president of the CFIA was ""in the context of the application for export,"" he said, ""which may not be the full reality.""Comeau, Bibeau's spokesperson, tells CBC the Kingston facility now has its licence to export from the CFIA.The Canadian Dairy Commission originally hoped an investor like Feihe could build a second facility, perhaps in Western Canada. But now, the government ""is not in discussion with Canada Royal Milk about additional future investments,"" Comeau said.Earlier plans obtained by CBC News suggested Kingston facility would be exporting by now. Bidtnes told CBC News its production lines are complete and it is pleased with the results of its test batches.""Timelines for beginning commercial production have been stretched into the fall due to the impact of COVID-19 on some regulatory processes,"" she said, adding that the company remains ""confident in our business plans and the support we have received from all levels of government."""
Kazakhstan rejects Chinese warning over pneumonia outbreak | CBC News,Kazakhstan's health officials on Friday dismissed a Chinese claim that the Central Asian country is facing an outbreak of pneumonia more deadly than the new coronavirus.,2020-07-10T15:32:20.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/pneumonia-kazakhstan-1.5644849,"Kazakhstan's health officials on Friday dismissed a Chinese claim that the Central Asian country is facing an outbreak of pneumonia more deadly than the new coronavirus.The Kazakh denial follows a notice issued Thursday by the Chinese Embassy that warned its citizens about an outbreak of pneumonia in the ex-Soviet nation with a death rate higher than that from coronavirus-induced pneumonia.""This information doesn't conform to reality,"" Kazakhstan's Health Ministry said in a statement.It said that the country's statistics on pneumonia include patients who tested negative for the coronavirus but had symptoms compatible with the COVID-19 illness.According to official data, the number of pneumonia cases has increased by 55 per cent in the first half of the year, compared with the same period in 2019 — from 63,436 to 98,546.However, Health Minister Alexei Tsoi said at a briefing Thursday, mortality from pneumonia this year fell from last year's levels — from 1,780 deaths in the first half of 2019 to 1,172 in the first half of 2020.The ministry said its tallies of bacterial, fungal and viral pneumonia infections, which also included cases of unclear causes, were in line with World Health Organization guidelines.The energy-rich Central Asian nation quickly introduced regional lockdown and travel restrictions to stem the COVID-19 pandemic, but it has faced a rise in infections after it lifted the restrictions in May.In late June, Kazakh President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev fired the nation's health minister, blaming him for flaws that helped trigger a second wave of contagion.Kazakh authorities have imposed a two-week nationwide lockdown starting Sunday to contain the COVID-19 outbreak.The country so far has registered over 53,000 cases, including 264 deaths.Asked to comment on Kazakhstan's denial of the Chinese Embassy's claim, China's Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian refrained from comment, saying that Beijing hopes to receive more information.""China looks forward to continuing co-operation with Kazakhstan to jointly fight the epidemic and safeguard public health in both countries,"" he said.WATCH | Pneumonia in Kazakhstan likely related to COVID-19: WHOMike Ryan, head of the WHO's emergencies program, told journalists on Friday that the cases in Kazakhstan are on WHO's radar.Given the country's surge in COVID-19 cases in the last seven days, there's a likely explanation, he said.""The upward trajectory of COVID-19 in the country would suggest that many of these cases are in fact undiagnosed cases of COVID-19,"" Ryan said.Ryan said WHO is keeping an open mind and teams will checks for false negative COVID-19 tests and X-ray patterns.Clusters of atypical pneumonia can occur at any time from other causes such as bacteria that present as Legionnaires' disease or influenza."

Taiwan scrambles fighters as Chinese jets again fly near island | CBC News,"Taiwan's air force scrambled jets for a second consecutive day on Saturday as multiple Chinese aircraft approached the island and crossed the sensitive midline of the Taiwan Strait, with the island's government urging Beijing to ""pull back from the edge.""",2020-09-19T09:08:01.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/china-taiwan-fighter-jets-1.5731034,"Taiwan's air force scrambled jets for a second consecutive day on Saturday as multiple Chinese aircraft approached the island and crossed the sensitive midline of the Taiwan Strait, with the island's government urging Beijing to ""pull back from the edge.""Taiwan's defence ministry said 19 Chinese aircraft were involved, one more than in the previous day, with some crossing the Taiwan Strait midline and others flying into Taiwan's air defence identification zone off its southwest coast.It said China, which claims democratic Taiwan as its own territory, sent 12 J-16 fighters, two J-10 fighters, two J-11 fighters, two H-6 bombers and one Y-8 anti-submarine aircraft. According to a map the ministry provided, none got close to mainland Taiwan itself or flew over it.""ROCAF scrambled fighters, and deployed air defence missile system to monitor the activities,"" the ministry said in a tweet, referring to the Republic of China Air Force, the formal name of Taiwan's air force.Taiwan has complained of repeated incidents of Chinese aircraft near the island this year, and has regularly had to scramble its F-16s and other jets to intercept them.China had on Friday announced at a news conference in Beijing about China's UN peacekeeping efforts combat drills near the Taiwan Strait, and denounced what it called collusion between the island and the United States.U.S. Undersecretary for Economic Affairs Keith Krach arrived in Taipei on Thursday for a three-day visit, the most senior State Department official to come to Taiwan in four decades, angering China. He left Saturday afternoon, according to Taiwan's foreign ministry.Taiwan's defence ministry, in a separate statement, said China was carrying out provocative activities, seriously damaging peace and stability.""The defence ministry sternly condemns this, and calls on the mainland authorities to control themselves and pull back from the edge.""China's widely read state-backed tabloid the Global Times, published by the ruling Communist Party's official People's Daily, said in a Saturday editorial that Friday's drills were a rehearsal to take over Taiwan.""The U.S. and Taiwan must not misjudge the situation, or believe the exercise is a bluff. Should they continue to make provocations, a war will inevitably break out,"" it said.Both sides need to resume dialogue to reduce the risk of war, Johnny Chiang, leader of Taiwan's main opposition party the Kuomintang, wrote on his Facebook page.""People who are willing to play a communication role are stigmatized and people who clamour for war are regarded as heroes. Such an atmosphere is definitely not conducive to the peaceful and stable development of the Taiwan Strait,"" said Chiang, whose party traditionally favours close ties with China.Life has continued as normal in Taiwan with no sign of panic. The island has long been accustomed to living with Chinese threats.Taiwan's people have shown no interest in being ruled by autocratic China, re-electing President Tsai Ing-wen in a landslide last year on what was largely a platform of standing up to Beijing.The latest Chinese flights came the same day Taiwan held a memorial service for former president Lee Teng-hui, dubbed ""Mr. Democracy"" for ending autocratic rule in favour of free elections and championing Taiwan's separate identity from China.Lee, who died in July, became Taiwan's first democratically elected president in March 1996 after eight months of intimidating war games and missile tests by China in waters around the island.Those events brought China and Taiwan to the verge of conflict, prompting the United States to send an aircraft carrier task force to the area in a warning to Beijing's government."
Taiwan scrambles air force as multiple Chinese jets buzz island | CBC News,"Taiwan scrambled fighter jets on Friday as multiple Chinese aircraft buzzed the island, including crossing the sensitive mid-line of the Taiwan Strait, in an escalation of tensions the same day a senior U.S. official began meetings in Taipei.",2020-09-18T09:33:37.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/taiwan-china-fighter-jets-1.5729167,"Taiwan scrambled fighter jets on Friday as multiple Chinese aircraft buzzed the island, including crossing the sensitive mid-line of the Taiwan Strait, in an escalation of tensions the same day a senior U.S. official began meetings in Taipei.Earlier on Friday, China's Defence Ministry announced the start of combat drills near the Taiwan Strait, denouncing what it called collusion between the Chinese-claimed island and the United States.U.S. Undersecretary for Economic Affairs Keith Krach arrived in Taipei on Thursday for a three-day visit, the most senior State Department official to come to Taiwan in four decades.Beijing has watched with growing alarm the ever-closer relationship between Taipei and Washington, and has stepped up military exercises near the island, including two days of mass air and sea drills last week.Taiwan's defence ministry said 18 Chinese aircraft were involved on Friday, a far larger number than Taiwan has previously announced for such encounters.""Sep. 18, two H-6 bombers, eight J-16 fighters, four J-10 fighters and four J-11 fighters crossed the midline of the TaiwanStrait and entered Taiwan's southwest ADIZ,"" the ministry said in an English-language statement on Twitter.""ROCAF scrambled fighters, and deployed air defence missile system to monitor the activities,"" it added, referring to Taiwan's air force.The ministry showed a map of the flight paths of the Chinese jets and their crossing of the Taiwan Strait mid-line, which normally combat aircraft from both sides avoid passing through.Taiwan's Liberty Times newspaper said Taiwan air force jets scrambled 17 times on Friday morning over four hours, warning China's air force to stay away.It also showed a picture of missiles being loaded onto an F-16 at the Hualien air base on Taiwan's east coast.In Beijing, Chinese Defence Ministry spokesman Ren Guoqiang said Friday's drills, about which he gave no details, involved the People's Liberation Army's eastern theatre command.""They are a reasonable, necessary action aimed at the current situation in the Taiwan Strait and protecting national sovereignty and territorial integrity,"" Ren said.Taiwan is a purely internal Chinese affair that brooks no foreign interference, he added.""Recently the United States and Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) authorities have stepped up their collusion, frequently creating disturbances,"" Ren said, referring to Taiwan's ruling party.Trying to ""use Taiwan to control China"" or ""rely on foreigners to build oneself up"" is wishful thinking and doomed to be a dead end, he added.""Those who play with fire will get burnt,"" he said.Hu Xijin, editor of China's widely read state-backed Global Times tabloid, wrote on his Weibo microblog that the drills were preparation for an attack on Taiwan should the need arise, and that they were valuable experience, enabling gathering of intelligence about Taiwan's defensive systems.""If the U.S. secretary of state or defence secretary visits Taiwan, People's Liberation Army fighters should fly over Taiwan island, and directly exercise in the skies above it,"" he added.China had threatened to make a ""necessary response"" to Krach's trip, straining already poor ties between Beijing and both Taipei and Washington. Sino-U.S. relations have plummeted ahead of November's U.S. presidential election.Chinese fighter jets briefly crossed the mid-line of the Taiwan Strait last month as the U.S. Health Secretary Alex Azar was in Taipei, and last week China carried out two days of large-scale drills off Taiwan's southwestern coast.The United States, like most countries, only has official ties with China, not Taiwan, though Washington is the island's main arms supplier and most important international backer.This week, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations had lunch with Taiwan's top envoy in New York. China's U.N. mission said it had lodged ""stern representations"" over the meeting."

It has removed the ad and apologized.The original ad starring Boyega, 28, aired last year and was called The London Gent. It features the London-born actor walking around the neighbourhood where he grew up and riding a horse in a park, and it makes reference to his Nigerian heritage in a scene featuring West African attire.""The film celebrated my personal story — showcasing my hometown, including my friends and featuring my family,"" Boyega wrote.Their decision to replace my campaign in China by using my concepts and substituting a local brand ambassador for me, without either my consent or prior notice, was wrong.

He played a leading role as Finn in 2015's Star Wars: The Force Awakens, but he and other nonwhite characters were removed or diminished from a Chinese poster for the movie.In an interview with GQ magazine, Boyega recently said that Black characters have been ""pushed to the side"" in Disney's Star Wars franchise.

The price exceeds a benchmark set only last month for Chinese oil paintings when Danshui by Taiwanese artist Chen Chengbo fetched more than $5 million at a Sotheby's event.Xu Beihong created Slave and Lion during his stay in Berlin during the early 1920s. It depicts the story of Roman slave Androclus, who pulled thorn from a lion's paw. His act of kindness inspires the Roman emperor to free him.The work blends Western form and subject with Chinese line drawing touches.Five months ago, another Xu painting— Silly Old Man Moves a Mountain— sold in Beijing for $4.35 million.Christie's sale of more than 2,000 Chinese works of art and objects from the 20th Century was a goldmine, with buyers and collectors snapping up pieces beyond their estimated bid price.Another major work, Potted Chrysanthemum in a Blue and White Jardiniere by Sanyu, went for $4.25 million.Ken Yeh, the deputy chairman of Christie's Asia, said there's pent-up demand for art from the new wealthy class in Asia, whose bank accounts are brimming with cash from a bullish stock market.""There's just too much money around. People are just eager to buy,"" Yeh said prior to Sunday's bidding.He added thatthe newly-rich see art as a valuable asset.Last week, Hong Kong real estate tycoon Joseph Lau, paid $17.4 million for pop artist Andy Warhol's iconic portrait of China's Mao Zedong.Yeh said at least one out of four buyers at Christie's auctions are Chinese and that number is rising.Christie's estimates Hong Kong is the world's third most important art market after New York and London."

Chinese tabloid blasts Canada over lobster dispute | CBC News,Communist Party media in China rebuked and threatened Nova Scotia lobster shippers this week for expressing concerns over new roadblocks to getting products into China.,2020-06-25T09:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/chinese-state-media-global-times-lobster-dispute-canada-1.5626025,"Communist Party media in China rebuked and threatened Nova Scotia lobster shippers this week for expressing concerns over new roadblocks to getting products into China.The party tabloid Global Times says recent border measures are about food safety after a COVID-19 outbreak was linked to a Beijing food market, ""rather than an excuse to target any specific country.""""It's Canada's choice to export to China, and Canada needs to abide by Chinese regulations, which may be adjusted when necessary in accordance with the COVID-19 situation,"" Bai Ming, a research fellow at the Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Co-operation, told the Global Times on Monday.The tabloid, known for its nationalist tone on international issues, discounted complaints raised by Canadian lobster shippers quoted in CBC News reporting.It also linked the issue to the arrest in Canada and ongoing extradition proceedings against Huawei chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou.""Experts warned that the Canadian side should be fully aware that its attitude in Meng's case is the only roadblock between the two countries,"" it said. ""If the Canadian side does not remove it, a disruption in the lobster trade might be just the tip of the iceberg in bilateral trade, as fraught ties have already undermined confidence in business communities on both sides.""Chinese authorities began random testing of imported food after a COVID-19 outbreak earlier this month was traced to a cutting board used on imported Atlantic salmon at the Xinfadi market in Beijing.Live lobster shipments from Canada, valued at $457 million last year, were particularly vulnerable.Most of that lobster comes from Nova Scotia, which has seen its sales in China soar in recent years.After the inspections started, some Nova Scotia companies cancelled live shipments rather than risk delays of up to 36 hours waiting for test results when the perishable product arrives.Exporters must now also sign a Chinese customs declaration assuming liability if COVID-19 is detected.Obsorne Burke of Victoria Co-op Fisheries in Cape Breton, which ships frozen lobster to China, refused to sign.He's leery of the Chinese legal system and dubious about the risk of the coronavirus, citing public health agencies in Canada and elsewhere that say there is no scientific evidence the virus is transmitted by food or food packaging.""We have to take a stand or push back and say this does not make any scientific sense,"" he said.The Global Times said exporters should get over it.""The newly adopted requirements for coronavirus-free declarations apply to all suppliers across the world and all food products,"" it said in a front page editorial this week, one of two articles devoted to the issue of Canadian lobster shipments.The tabloid hit back at reaction from Canadian lobster exporters quoted by CBC.""A major Chinese salmon importer told the Global Times on Monday that all of its suppliers are co-operative and willing to sign the declaration as they 'want to do business with China,'"" Global Times reported.""The company said, compared with Canada, it prefers to do business with countries like Chile, which has a mature, industrialized industry chain and is also co-operative with and respectful of Chinese regulations.""The question of whether lobster shippers should sign a declaration that assumes some form of liability for COVID-19 in China has split the Nova Scotia lobster industry.Some exporters have agreed to sign the declaration, others have not.The Nova Scotia Seafood Alliance has lawyers from the Atlantic Canadian law firm Cox Palmer reviewing the document and drafting a declaration shippers could send to customers in China that asserts the safety of the product without assuming liability.  The industry group says there is no consensus among members at this point for a unified response.The Global Times article challenged those who have opted not to sign.""Since the Canadian exporters are so confident about their management, why don't they have the courage to sign the declaration,"" Bai asked, noting that Canada ought to understand, ""China has such a regulation only because there is a risk of the virus spreading.""The Trudeau government avoided taking a stand when asked by the Nova Scotia government whether exporters should sign the declaration.Global Affairs Canada said since the customs demand was delivered by Chinese companies ""to the industry from industry,"" the Canadian Food Inspection Agency is leaving it to individual exporters to decide whether they sign.""It's absolutely not acceptable,"" said Chris d'Entremont, a Nova Scotia Conservative Member of Parliament.D'Entremont said the federal government should explain to industry exactly what accepting liability might mean.""We should be understanding through CFIA what exactly the implications are going to be here. To accept a certain liability is one thing on your product, but a liability for the spread of a virus is something completely different. I think this is a humongous overreach by China,"" he said.The Chinese embassy in Ottawa did not respond to a request for comment from CBC News."

Another message was spray painted in front of the building on May 19.The Chinese Consulate General turned over surveillance video captured by closed-circuit TV to police, who have released images of the suspects.The graffiti included the phrase ""China Virus."" There have been reports of increased racism and hate-motivated crimes targeting the Chinese community and people of Asian descent during the coronavirus pandemic.""The pandemic has led to a lot of political debate and strong views, and people are obviously free to hold whatever view they wish,"" said Const. Craig Collins, hate crimes co-ordinator with the Calgary police. ""But when people are targeting others for ill treatment or committing crimes because of those views, we have a duty to get involved.""Police said there has been a slight increase in incidents targeting those groups.""Generally, we have not seen the same spike in hate crimes that some other areas have seen,"" Collins said. ""But we are hearing from the Chinese community that they are concerned about growing hostility, so we are monitoring it closely.""Police said hate-motivated crimes are crimes where the offender was motivated by bias, prejudice or hate based on certain personal characteristics of the victim, like race. Hate as a motivation is considered after a person is found guilty, during sentencing.The consulate said in a statement that it strongly condemns the insult and threat, which it said violate both international and Canadian laws.""The Consulate General encourages the police to solve this case as soon as possible, and take necessary measures to better protect the safety and dignity of the Consulate, its staff and its properties,"" a consulate spokesperson said in an emailed statement."

New poll reveals Chinese-Canadians' experiences with racism | CBC News,A new poll from the Angus Reid Institute and the University of Alberta suggests the majority of people who identify as Chinese-Canadian have experience some type of racism since the pandemic began.,2020-06-22T07:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/new-poll-reveals-chinese-canadians-experiences-with-racism-1.5621261,"A new poll from the non-profit Angus Reid Institute and the University of Alberta suggests a large percentage of people who identify as Chinese-Canadian have experienced some type of racism since the coronavirus pandemic began. Of the more than 500 Canadians of Chinese ethnicity surveyed from across Canada, half reported being called names or insulted as a direct result of COVID-19, and 43 per cent said they had been personally threatened or intimidated. Shachi Kurl, executive director of the Angus Reid Institute, says the poll shines a light on the extent of racism across the country. ""I think the numbers are fairly stark,"" Kurl said.Of those who responded, nearly a third said they had been frequently exposed to racist graffiti or messaging on social media. Also, 61 per cent said they had adjusted their routines ""to avoid run-ins or otherwise unpleasant encounters"" since the pandemic began. The online survey was conducted from June 15-18, 2020 among a representative randomized sample of 516 Canadian adults who self-identify as being ethnically Chinese and are members of Angus Reid Forum or Inclusive Insights. For comparison purposes only, a probability sample of this size would carry a margin of error of plus or minus 4.3 percentage points, 19 times out of 20.For Kurl, one of the most troubling findings of the survey is despite the fact that 88 per cent of respondents agreed that ""being Canadian is an important part of my identity,"" only 13 per cent agreed that others see them as Canadian all the time.""It says to me that you can be in this country for five years or you can be fourth generation but because of the way you look there is still a barrier to being accepted or to be viewed as fully Canadian by others,"" Kurl said.WATCH | Many Asian-Canadians experienced racism during pandemic: surveyThe NationalNearly 80 per cent of the respondents said they felt strongly that Canadians blame people of Chinese ethnicity for COVID-19, and two-thirds said North American news outlets have had a negative effect on Canadian views of people of Chinese ethnicity.Henry Yu, a history professor at the University of British Columbia, says the results of the survey don't come as a surprise at all.Yu commended the Angus Reid Institute for capturing the systemic racism that is often dismissed as an isolated incident.""I think it's vitally important in Canada that we do more collection of this kind of data,"" Yu said. ""How do you know where there's racism if you never actually look for it?""Yu says to date it has been up to victims of racism themselves to track trends through strategies like Project 1907's centralized racism reporting centre to prove that incidents of hate are widespread.Treating incidents of racism and discrimination as isolated incidents bolsters denial and silence about racism in Canada, Yu says, and makes it difficult for those who have experienced it to believe that it's happening to them. The survey was limited to people who identify as being of Chinese ethnicity, but Yu says the same results would likely apply to many Asian-Canadians or anyone else who might be seen as Chinese-Canadian — as was the case with Dakota Holmes, an Indigenous woman who was attacked and told to ""go back to Asia"" when she was out walking her dog in East Vancouver."

Taiwan warns off Chinese fighters that approached island | CBC News,"Taiwan's air force warned off several Chinese fighter jets that briefly entered Taiwan's air defence identification zone to its southwest on Tuesday, the defence ministry said.",2020-06-09T12:46:44.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/taiwan-warns-off-chinese-fighters-that-approached-island-1.5604180,"Taiwan's air force warned off several Chinese fighter jets that briefly entered Taiwan's air defence identification zone to its southwest on Tuesday, the defence ministry said.The Su-30 fighters, some of China's most advanced jets, were given verbal warnings to leave and Taiwanese air force jets ""drove away"" the intruders, the ministry added.Taiwan has complained that China, which claims the democratic island as its own, has stepped up military activities in recent months, menacing Taiwan even as the world deals with the coronavirus pandemic.China says such exercises are nothing unusual.China has never renounced the use of force to bring Taiwan under its control. One of China's most senior generals last month said China would attack if there was no other way of stopping Taiwan from becoming independent.China is deeply suspicious of Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen, whom it accuses of being a separatist bent on declaring formal independence. Tsai says Taiwan is already an independent country called the Republic of China, its official name.The United States has stepped up its military activities near the island too, with semi-regular navy voyages through the narrow Taiwan Strait.A U.S. C-40A, a military version of the Boeing 737, had entered Taiwanese air space with permission, though it did not land at any Taiwanese airports, Taiwan's defence ministry said in a separate statement on Tuesday.The U.S. aircraft took off from Japan's Okinawa island, where there is a major U.S. air base, and flew over northern and western Taiwan on its way to Southeast Asia, Taiwanese media reported.While Washington and Taipei have no formal diplomatic ties, the United States is Taiwan's strongest international supporter and main arms supplier, which is another source of U.S.-China tension."

Retailers hope Chinese New Year sales bring good fortune,Hong Kong is even more of a shopper's paradise this week than usual thanks to sales marking Lunar New Year.,2013-02-11T00:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/retailers-hope-chinese-new-year-sales-bring-good-fortune-1.1314443,"It may be the Year of the Snake but there are 20 adorable panda bears greeting shoppers this week at Hong Kong's ifc mall as they pick up last minute gifts for Lunar New Year.The animals aren't real but the lifelike pandas are still a hit with locals and tourists who pose for photos with the bears.""We try and do things that are relevant to Chinese society and to Hong Kong society and pandas are one of those things,"" said Karim Azar, general manager of retail leasing for the mall's management company.""Pandas are a national treasure for Chinese people,"" he said, adding they are a symbol of friendship and good luck.The panda displays are the main attraction of ifc's Chinese New Year promotion campaign, which also includes gift giveaways, performances and other activities. After Christmas, this is the second biggest time of year for the mall, said Azar.""It's been very busy, a couple of shops have run out of things,"" he said, noting that shoes and watches are big sellers before the new year because it's bad luck to buy them after. Clothing is also popular because of the tradition of wearing new clothes when visiting family over the holiday period that begins on Sunday.Hong Kong, known as a prime shopping destination in Asia, has been even more of a shopper's paradise this week than usual with Lunar New Year sales now in full effect.Major multinational stores that are keen to grow in the Asian market have promotional campaigns specifically targeting the holiday. A Gap store in Hong Kong's Central district is giving away Chinese New Year-themed t-shirts and tote bags with purchases over $65, while across the street at H&M, signs proclaiming ""Chinese New Year Deals"" hang from the ceiling.Further down the street at Marks & Spencer, shoppers are getting 20 per cent off seasonal food. Burberry has been running full-page advertisements in newspapers, and their store windows, decorated in red, are wishing passers-by a happy new year. Starbucks stores, meanwhile, are selling gift envelopes with Chinese New Year designs.Meagan Fitzpatrick has been posted to Hong Kong to bolster CBC's coverage of a dynamic region of the world. Hong Kong is known as an international financial centre, but there is much more to it than that, and it has close connections to Canada. The city of seven million hosts nearly 300,000 Canadians, and about 500,000 people of Hong Kong descent make their home in Canada. Meagan is a senior online writer who covers national news and federal politics in CBC's Ottawa bureau. You can follow her on Twitter @fitzpatrick_m.Apple's Asia division has an online New Year gift guide urging shoppers to ""Take home the perfect gifts,"" referencing the millions of Chinese who travel home to see family over the holiday period. The company held a ""Red Friday"" sale on Jan. 25, offering deals only to its customers in Hong Kong and other Asian countries.Kenneth Chiu left work on Thursday with an iPad mini, courtesy of his boss, and was carrying it under his arm as he walked with a colleague, who also had one under her arm. All employees in their office received one as an end-of-year treat.""Nice boss,"" Chiu said with a big smile. Chiu has already finished his own shopping for Chinese New Year, buying all new basketball clothes for his son, whom he is trying to sway away from playing soccer.This is a peak time of year for multinationals to make gains in their Asian markets, according to Niraj Dawar, a marketing professor at Richard Ivey School of Business at Western University in London, Ont., so they are trying to make the most of the holiday season.""They're doing this because they expect 50 per cent of their growth over the next 10 years to come from the emerging markets and of course China is at the forefront,"" said Dawar, who teaches at Ivey's Hong Kong campus every year.""It pays for them to understand the consumer, what drives the consumer, when are they most likely to spend money … most likely to be susceptible to marketing messages,"" said Dawar.One Chinese New Year tradition is to give money in red envelopes to children and unmarried friends and relatives but the holiday is increasingly becoming a more commercial one, according to Dawar.That's good news for the retail sector in Hong Kong, which has been struggling in the last year. The Hong Kong Retail Management Association called 2012 a ""bumpy"" year. Retail sales slipped from double-digit growth at the start of the year down to 3.9 per cent in July.But there are recent signs of a rebound. Growth in December was up at 8.8 per cent, and the sector is hoping for sustained growth through the holiday period.The ifc mall along Hong Kong's iconic waterfront sees 225,000 people pass through its doors on an average day, and Azar said he's happy with the amount of added traffic this holiday season. Sales figures will be hard to compare to last year since Chinese New Year fell in January in 2012, but he's expecting at least a 20 per cent increase over last February."

Rescue efforts continue after deadly Chinese quake,Stranded tourists and residents struggle to clear roads and cope with power cuts caused by a powerful earthquake that killed at least 19 people and injured 247.,2017-08-09T00:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/china-earthquake-sichuan-1.4239892,"Stranded tourists and residents struggled Wednesday to clear roads and cope with power cuts caused by a powerful earthquake that killed at least 19 people and injured 247.The magnitude 6.5 quake struck a mountainous region near a national park that is one of the country's top tourist attractions. Rescuers dug through rubble with their hands and used detectors to search for signs of life. The Tuesday night quake knocked out power and phone networks, complicating efforts to locate and evacuate survivors.Most of the deaths and injuries were recorded in Zhangzha township, near to Jiuzhaigou or Jiuzhai Valley, a national park known for spectacular waterfalls and karst formations that attracts visitors from China and overseas.Yang Jie, who owns a hostel in Zhangzha, said she was at a hotpot restaurant with friends when the lights went out and everything started shaking at around 9:20 p.m. Tuesday.""People were rushing out, some people were screaming,"" Yang said by phone. ""On our way home, there were rocks falling down from the hills on both sides of the road. We couldn't get through on the phone because there was no signal.""Yang and her friends returned to find large cracks in her hostel and set up tents outside for guests to sleep in.On Wednesday, she said the building was still without power, stores were closed and ""houses around us are [damaged] beyond recognition.""""The whole night, even right now, there has been no one from the government dropping by to tell us what's going on or what to do,"" Yang said. ""There were more than 30 guests at my hostel, I have to start fires to keep them warm. ... We cleared the path and moved rocks away this morning so that my guests could leave by car.""President Xi Jinping called for rapid efforts to respond to the disaster, which struck a quake-prone region bordered by Sichuan and Gansu provinces. The area is on the edge of the Tibetan Plateau and home to many Tibetan and other ethnic minority villages.Among the injured, 40 were listed in serious condition, according to the Aba Tibetan and Qiang Autonomous Prefecture government in Sichuan. At least five of the dead were tourists, China's official Xinhua News Agency said. Hong Kong's immigration department said one of the city's residents was missing in the quake.A Canadian woman suffered a slight head injury and a French citizen was wounded in both legs and needed surgery to remove stone fragments, according to Xinhua. It said Frenchman Maxence Vallon, 18, was staying with his mother and brother at a hotel in Jiuzhaigou.They were seeking shelter outside ""when a big stone fell and hit my brother right in the leg,"" said Romain Vallon, who studies in Beijing.The dead included a performer in an arts group who was buried in the quake and found Wednesday morning. She and others had been performing in Jiuzhaigou when the quake struck. According to the Legal Evening News, they were acting out a scene about a deadly 2008 earthquake that struck nearby and killed nearly 90,000 people. When Tuesday's quake hit, the performers ran off the stage in terror and the audience thought the tremor was part of the show.In footage shown on state broadcaster China Central Television, rescuers picked away rubble from around a body, then stood silently in a row, with helmets off and heads bowed to pay their respects.Other orange-suited rescuers were shown using detectors to search for survivors in the dark of night, carrying a girl to safety and leading other people along a rubble-strewn road.Prelim M6.3 earthquake northern Xinjiang, China Aug-8 23:27 UTC, updates <a href=""https://t.co/gEFJWMbjgZ"">https://t.co/gEFJWMbjgZ</a>The U.S. Geological Survey measured the quake at magnitude 6.5 and said it struck at a depth of just nine kilometres. Shallow earthquakes tend to cause more damage than deeper ones.Xinhua said more than 30,000 tourists visiting Jiuzhaigou were relocated to safer accommodations.On Wednesday morning, another strong earthquake struck far northwestern China, some 2,200 kilometres from Jiuzhaigou, injuring 32 people, two of them seriously, and damaging more than 1,000 houses, Xinhua reported. That quake was measured at 6.3 by the USGS and struck in a sparsely populated area of the Xinjiang region near the Kazakhstan border. "

Chinese lawmakers endorse Hong Kong national security law | CBC News,China's ceremonial legislature overwhelmingly endorsed a national security law for Hong Kong on Thursday that has strained relations with the United States and Britain and triggered protests in the semi-autonomous territory.,2020-05-28T06:49:40.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/china-security-law-hong-kong-1.5587892,"China's ceremonial legislature overwhelmingly endorsed a national security law for Hong Kong on Thursday that has strained relations with the United States and Britain and triggered protests in the semi-autonomous territory.The National People's Congress backed the bill by a vote of 2,878 to one with six abstentions as it wrapped up an annual session that was held under intensive anti-coronavirus controls.The move will ultimately change the territory's mini-constitution, or Basic Law, adding a national security law to be decided later by Chinese leaders. The standing committee of the National People's Congress that handles most legislation will work out its details.Activists in Hong Kong say the law will undermine civil liberties and might be used to suppress political activity.Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam, who came under fire for her handling of protests last year over an extradition bill that was eventually scrapped, said that fear was misplaced. She said the decision from Beijing was welcome because of the difficulty her government faces in passing national security legislation on its own. Lam said in a statement that new laws would ""sanction an extremely small minority of criminals who threaten national security"" and ""not affect the legitimate rights and freedoms enjoyed by Hong Kong residents.""The law and the way it is being enacted prompted U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to announce on Wednesday that Washington will no longer treat Hong Kong as autonomous from Beijing. That sets the stage for the possible withdrawal of the preferential trade and financial status the U.S. accords the former British colony.On Thursday, Canada, Australia, the United Kingdom and the U.S. issued a statement condemning the legislation as a violation of a previous United Nations joint declaration concerning Hong Kong and an action that threatens to undermine the ""one country, two systems"" arrangement under which the territory retained its own Western-style social, legal and political institutions after being handed over from British to Chinese rule in 1997.""Direct imposition of national security legislation on Hong Kong by the Beijing authorities, rather than through Hong Kong's own institutions as provided for under Article 23 of the Basic Law, would curtail the Hong Kong people's liberties, and in doing so, dramatically erode the autonomy and the system that made it so prosperous,"" the statement read.The countries said they were concerned the move ""will exacerbate the existing deep divisions in Hong Kong society; the law does nothing to build mutual understanding and foster reconciliation within Hong Kong.""Joining the U.S. and other countries in expressing concern, Japan's chief cabinet secretary Yoshihide Suga said it was important for Hong Kong to have a ""stable and democratic development.""""We are deeply worried about the National People's Congress this time conducting the vote amid deep concern within the international community and Hong Kong citizens"" Suga said.The measure is designed for ""Hong Kong's long-term prosperity and stability,"" Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said following the closing of the NPC's annual session. Li offered no details about what specific areas the law would cover. At the United Nations, China blocked a United Nations Security Council meeting to discuss the legislation on Wednesday. Ambassador Zhang Jun said on Twitter that Hong Kong matters are ""purely China's internal affairs.""Earlier Thursday, three pro-democracy lawmakers were ejected from Hong Kong's legislative chamber, disrupting the second day of debate on a contentious bill that would criminalize insulting or abusing the Chinese national anthem.The legislature's president, Andrew Leung, suspended the meeting minutes after it began and ejected Eddie Chu for holding up a sarcastic sign about a pro-Beijing lawmaker that read, ""Best Chairperson, Starry Lee.""A second pro-democracy lawmaker was ejected for yelling after the meeting resumed, and then a third after rushing forward with a large plastic bottle in a cloth bag that spilled its brownish contents on the floor in front of the president's raised dais.The third lawmaker, Ted Hui, later described the contents as a rotten plant, and said he wanted Leung to feel and smell the rotting of Hong Kong's civilization and rule of law, and of the ""one country, two systems"" framework that democracy activists feel is under attack by China's ruling Communist Party. The city's pro-democracy opposition sees both the security legislation and the anthem law as assaults on that autonomy, and the U.S. has called on China to back off on the security law."

Canadian-approved N95 mask targeted by Chinese counterfeiters | CBC News,A Chinese-made mask approved by Health Canada is the subject of a counterfeit warning issued by the Centers for Disease Control in the U.S.,2020-05-14T08:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/chinese-masks-counterfeit-pandemic-covid-1.5568246,"A Chinese-made mask approved by Health Canada is the subject of a counterfeit warning issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the U.S.The Associated Press has reported that counterfeit masks, intended to mimic medical-grade N95 masks made by the Shanghai Dasheng company and approved for use in Canada, already have been distributed to front-line medical staff at some U.S. hospitals.And a separate Chinese mask maker also licensed by Health Canada has seen its approval pulled by the Food and Drug Administration in the United States.The Guangdong Golden Leaves Technology Development Co. Ltd. was one of 65 Chinese manufacturers whose authorization to sell in the U.S. was withdrawn following tests by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC).The manufacturer remains approved in Canada, but its product has not been distributed to health care workers here, a spokesperson for Public Services and Procurement Canada told CBC News.Both cases illustrate the difficulties faced by governments in trying to procure reliable masks when a flood of fake, shoddy and deceptively-labelled products is pouring out of China.All masks approved for use in U.S. hospitals must have a Testing and Certification (TC) number issued by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. The CDC has warned that the TC number issued to the Shanghai Dasheng Co. for its masks — TC 84A-4329 — has been misappropriated by other Chinese makers seeking to sell substandard products in the U.S. market.U.S. government agencies like the National Park Service have been warning their workers to watch out for the fake masks.Health Canada approved Shanghai Dasheng's DTC3X N95 masks by interim order on April 27. That interim order process has been used during the pandemic to fast-track approval of medical devices for use in Canada.West Virginia distributed 50,000 fake DTC3X masks to first responders — and kept them in use after the CDC warned the state they might be counterfeit, and after the real Shanghai Dasheng Co. warned that its products were being faked.CBC News has asked Health Canada and Public Services and Procurement Canada about the masks, but has not yet received an answer.Canada was badly burned once already when it bought millions of defective masks from a Montreal-based supplier that uses Chinese manufacturers.The U.S. government had to withdraw dozens of approvals for Chinese manufacturers of medical masks last week after tests showed that many did not meet minimum standards for protecting medical workers.One of those mask manufacturers also had received approval in Canada.Products made by Guangdong Golden Leaves Technology Development Co. Ltd. had been cleared for use in the U.S. under an ""Emergency Use Authorization"" (EUA) issued by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on April 3.The same maker was approved by Health Canada on May 5.But on May 9, the FDA withdrew the company's U.S. licence. That decision followed tests by the CDC that showed many of the Chinese masks permitted under the EUA fell far below the filtration standards guaranteed by their producers.CDC has not published a test of the Guangdong Golden Leaves mask, but appears to have de-listed it as a precaution after other masks approved by the same Emergency Use Authorization tested poorly.While Canada tests masks before approving them for use, the U.S. government chose to grant approvals before testing.Of 11 masks tested by the CDC for which results were published, only four met specifications. The stop-use order relates not only to the seven that failed, but also to dozens of others that have yet to be tested, including the Guangdong Golden Leaves mask.Just 14 of the 80 Chinese mask makers approved in the original order remain cleared for use in the United States today.""While the FDA continues to take action to balance the urgent need of supplies of respirators for health care personnel, we are also doing everything in our authority to ensure health care personnel receive adequate protection,"" the agency said in a statement.The test results just for masks shipped from China's Guangdong province show vast differences in quality.Some of the Chinese manufacturers shipped masks that performed superbly in tests.N95 and KN95 masks are supposed to be able to filter at least 95 per cent of all particles measuring 0.3 microns in diameter. All 10 samples of the KN95 produced by Guangdong Energy Fortress Pharmaceutical Co. passed that test, and four of them performed at 100 per cent filtration.A mask produced by Guangdong Medical Technology Co. produced equally consistent results.But none of the 10 samples of the mask produced by Guangdong Qian Jing Testing Co. filtered more than 76 per cent of particles — a dismal rating.And masks produced by Guangdong Nuokong Medical Technology Co. appeared to be from two very different production runs. Of the 10 samples tested, five produced good filtration rates of between 98 and 99 per cent, but five gave only 24 to 26 per cent protection.The pandemic has inspired many manufacturers in China to jump into the personal protective equipment (PPE) business to take advantage of the scramble among countries around the world to procure supplies.While many of the companies approved by the FDA in the April 4 emergency order were traditional medical supply firms with a history of making such products, the names of some approved companies reveal an origin that has little to do with health or medicine: DongGuan HuaGang Communication Technology Co., Fujian Pageone Garment Co, Ltd., Guangzhou Sunjoy Auto Supplies Co., Yiwu Henghao Household Products Co., Yiwu Yifan Knitting Co., the Zhejiang Shengtai Baby Products Co.None of those non-medical companies appear to have survived the FDA's cull of manufacturers.Nine of the Chinese mask manufacturers that retained their approvals in the U.S. also have been approved in Canada, but none of the masks that failed CDC tests appear on the Canadian approved list.However, on Monday, Health Canada issued a recall of KN95 respirators manufactured by dozens of Chinese companies following CDC tests that found the masks ""failed to meet 95 per cent filtration specifications.""A recall bulletin was sent to companies across Canada authorized to import or distribute supplies for use in hospitals or other health-care institutions, instructing them to ""stop-sale"" of the masks and relabel them for use in non-healthcare settings where 95 per cent filtration isn't necessary.Ottawa said the recall action did ""not implicate KN95 respirators purchased by the Government of Canada and tested by the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC).""Concerns over the quality of PPE and test kits have arisen outside North America as well. Several European countries have had sometimes acrimonious disputes with China over the quality and reliability of shipments.Fast-track approval processes were adopted in many countries to speed up the delivery of supplies, and sometimes that has opened the door to substandard equipment.Both the U.S. and the United Kingdom have reported serious problems with test kits that were granted expedited approval.Canada also has bought defective test kits from China.In some cases, disputes over shoddy Chinese shipments to Europe have led to diplomatic incidents, with Chinese embassies vigorously defending the quality of shipments condemned by local health authorities."
N.L. woman accosted with anti-Chinese racism for 3rd time during pandemic | CBC News,A Chinese woman says she was called a pig and a dog-eater on a popular walking trail in St. John's.,2020-09-07T16:01:56.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/racism-mundy-pond-st-johns-1.5714808,"A PhD student from China says she was called a pig and a dog-eater during a racist confrontation with two teenagers on a popular walking trail in St. John's.Ting-ting Chen managed to snap a picture of the boys running away after accosting her on Friday on the Mundy Pond trail.It's just the latest racist incident Chen has encountered since the COVID-19 pandemic arrived in Newfoundland and Labrador, bringing with it a wave of anti-Chinese sentiment, some of which has been caught on camera.""I have been here two years, and I can hardly imagine I would have suffered from this two years ago before the pandemic,"" Chen told CBC N.L.'s Meg Roberts on Sunday.""I think the pandemic just became [an] impetus for the racism here to be thriving and rise up, and that really saddens my heart.""In a recent video shared with NTV News, well-known brewery owner Dave Fong was accosted by a woman outside his home in the historic Quidi Vidi Village of St. John's. The video shows her screaming at Fong to ""go back to where you came from.""Fong's family has been in Newfoundland and Labrador since the 1890s.He did spend some time in nearby Carbonear as a child, but that doesn't seem to be what the woman was referring to.She's been charged with criminal harassment and has a court date Oct. 5 in St. John's.Chen — who is studying Newfoundland folklore at Memorial University — has been subject to the same vitriol.The first time happened when she was walking downtown and a car rolled past her with the windows down. Someone leaned out and shouted ""Virus!"" at her.The second time, a man shouted at her to ""Go back to China.""The last straw was when the two teenaged boys made squinted eyes at her and spewed lewd nonsense in her direction.""I just tell them this is not right and you should be better taught. Shame on you,"" she said.""Racist ideas have already poisoned our young generations like that. I was astonished.""Chen stressed that the real troublesome minority is not any racial or ethnic group, but the racists themselves.She said her time in Newfoundland has been marked by wonderful hospitality. A local resident invited her to live rent-free with them for two months when she first arrived so she could have a guided introduction to the province. Another friend has invited her to spend Christmas with her family for the last two years.But she said it was time to speak about the ugly side and address it head-on.The first time she experienced racism, it shocked her.The second time, it scared her. She didn't go outside for a month, afraid of what people would say or think about her.The third time, it made her angry.""I don't want to see this small percentage of people destroy the beauty of Newfoundland,"" Chen said. ""I still love Newfoundland for sure, because I know all these haters and racists are only a small percentage, and they don't, and they can't, represent all Newfoundlanders at all.""Read more from CBC Newfoundland and Labrador"

She noted that she was the deputy when she applied for her U.S. visa in 2016.""By the way, my entry visa to the U.S. is valid until 2026. Since I have no desire to visit this country, it looks like I can take the initiative to cancel it,"" Lam said.The sanctions, announced Friday by the U.S. Treasury Department, block all property or other assets that the individuals have within U.S. jurisdiction.Luo Huining, the director of the central government's liaison office in Hong Kong, said being included on the list shows that he has done what he should for the city and his country.""I don't have a penny of assets abroad. Isn't it in vain to impose `sanctions'? Of course, I can also send 100 U.S. dollars to Mr. Trump for freezing,"" he said in a statement on the office's website.Hong Kong Commerce Secretary Edward Yau, who wasn't sanctioned, called the sanctions ""unreasonable and barbarous"" and said they would harm U.S. interests in the city, an Asian financial and shipping hub.Hong Kong has long enjoyed civil liberties not seen in mainland China because it is governed under the ""one country, two systems"" principle, which was been in place since it reverted to Chinese rule in 1997.However, Beijing imposed a national security law on Hong Kong at the end of June, following months of anti-government protests last year.The new law prohibits what Beijing views as secessionist, subversive or terrorist activities or what it sees as foreign intervention in Hong Kong's internal affairs. Police now have sweeping powers to conduct searches without warrants and order internet service providers and platforms to remove messages deemed to be in violation of the legislation.WATCH | Hundreds arrested in first hours of Hong Kong's new security law:CBC NewsCritics see the law as Beijing's boldest move yet to erase the divide between Hong Kong's Western-style system and the mainland's authoritarian way of governing.""The recent imposition of draconian national security legislation on Hong Kong has not only undermined Hong Kong's autonomy, it has also infringed on the rights of people in Hong Kong,"" the U.S. Treasury Department said.The Hong Kong government accused the U.S. of using Hong Kong as a pawn to create trouble in the China-U.S. relationship, calling the sanctions ""blatant and barbaric interference"" in China's internal affairs.It said that while national security is under the purview of the central government in any country, the new law authorizes local authorities in Hong Kong to be its main enforcer and specifies that human rights will be protected.""These legal provisions, coupled with the rule of law and an independent judiciary in Hong Kong, are clearly ignored by relevant U.S. officials who have chosen to make unsubstantiated and sweeping comments to serve their own interest,"" a government statement said.""We will not be intimidated."""

China will make legitimate and necessary reactions,"" the statement said.China maintains consulates in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Chicago and New York in addition to its embassy in Washington.The U.S. has four other consulates in China and an embassy in Beijing, keeping the sides in parity in terms of diplomatic missions.The Chengdu consulate briefly came to prominence when the police chief of the nearby city of Chongqing fled there in 2012, precipitating the downfall of Chongqing's politically ambitious leader Bo Xilai in China's biggest political scandal in decades. It also played host to former vice-president Joe Biden during a visit when the current prospective Democratic Party presidential candidate was accompanied by China's now-leader Xi Jinping.The American flag was taken down at the Chengdu mission at 6:18 a.m. local time, China's state broadcaster CCTV said on its social media account.Police closed off a two- to three-block area around the consulate, cutting off virtually any view of the property including the flag. A few vehicles were allowed through after police checks, and others could be seen moving in the distance.Moving trucks arrived at the U.S. consulate the previous day and left a few hours later. Late Sunday night, flatbed trailers entered the complex. One later emerged carrying a large shipping container and a crane.Before the area was closed, the impending closure of the consulate drew a steady stream of onlookers over the weekend as Chengdu, like Houston, found itself in the limelight of international politics.People stopped to take selfies and photos, jamming a sidewalk busy with shoppers and families with strollers on a sunny day in the city of Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan province. A little boy posed with a small Chinese flag before plainclothes police shooed him away as foreign media cameras zoomed in.Police had shut the street and sidewalk in front of the consulate and set up metal barriers along the sidewalk on the other side of the tree-lined road.Uniformed and plainclothes officers kept watch on both sides of the barriers after scattered incidents following the Chengdu announcement on Friday, including a man who set off firecrackers and hecklers who cursed at foreign media shooting video and photos of the scene.A man who tried to unfurl a large placard late Sunday that he called an open letter to the Chinese government was quickly taken away.Earlier, a bus left the consulate grounds and what appeared to be embassy staff spoke with plainclothes police before retreating back behind the property's solid black gates. It wasn't clear who or what was on the bus.Three medium-size trucks arrived and left a few hours later, and cars with diplomatic plates departed in between.The U.S. alleged that the Houston consulate was a nest of Chinese spies who tried to steal data from facilities in Texas, including the Texas A&M medical system and the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. China said the allegations were ""malicious slander."""

U.S. accuses Chinese hackers of targeting COVID-19 research | CBC News,The U.S. Justice Department is accusing two Chinese hackers of stealing trade secrets from companies around the world and targeting firms developing a vaccine for COVID-19.,2020-07-21T17:10:24.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/us-chinese-hackers-coronavirus-1.5657424,"Hackers working with the Chinese government targeted firms developing vaccines for the coronavirus and stole hundreds of millions of dollars worth of intellectual property and trade secrets from companies across the world, the Justice Department said Tuesday as it announced criminal charges.The indictment does not accuse the two Chinese defendants of actually obtaining the coronavirus research, but it does underscore the extent to which scientific innovation has been a top target for foreign governments and criminal hackers looking to know what American companies are developing during the pandemic. In this case, the hackers researched vulnerabilities in the computer networks of biotech firms and diagnostic companies that were developing vaccines and testing kits and researching antiviral drugs.The charges are the latest in a series of aggressive Trump administration actions targeting China. They come as President Donald Trump, his reelection prospects damaged by the coronavirus outbreak, has blamed China for the pandemic and as administration officials have escalated their denunciations of Beijing, including over alleged efforts to steal intellectual property through hacking.The indictment includes trade secret theft and wire fraud conspiracy charges against the hackers, former classmates at an electrical engineering college who prosecutors say worked together for more than a decade targeting high-tech companies in more than 10 countries.The hackers, identified as Li Xiaoyu and Dong Jiazhi, stole information not only for their personal profit but also research and technology that they knew would be of value to the Chinese government, prosecutors say.Two Chinese Hackers Working with the Ministry of State Security Charged with Global Computer Intrusion Campaign Targeting Intellectual Property and Confidential Business Information, Including COVID-19 Research <a href=""https://t.co/qFWk5BA8Zb"">https://t.co/qFWk5BA8Zb</a> <a href=""https://t.co/pUiaStKbqn"">pic.twitter.com/pUiaStKbqn</a>In some instances, the indictment says, they provided an officer for a Chinese intelligence service with whom they worked email accounts and passwords belonging to clergymen, dissidents and pro-democracy activists who could then be targeted. The officer gave help of his own, providing malicious software after one of the hackers struggled to compromise the mail server of a Burmese human rights group.The two defendants are not in custody, and federal officials conceded Tuesday that they were not likely to step foot in an American courtroom. But the indictment carries important symbolic and deterrence value for the Justice Department, which decided that publicly calling out the behaviour was more worthwhile than waiting for the unlikely scenario in which the defendants would travel to the U.S. and risk arrest.The hacking began more than 10 years ago, with targets including pharmaceutical, solar energy and medical device companies but also political dissidents, activists and clergy in the United States, China and Hong Kong, federal authorities said.The charges were brought as Trump administration officials, including national security adviser Robert O'Brien and Attorney General William Barr, have delivered public warnings about what they say are Chinese government efforts to use hacking to steal trade secrets for Beijing's financial benefit and to covertly influence American policy.The hacking is part of what Assistant Attorney General John Demers, the Justice Department's top national security official, described as a sweeping effort to ""rob, replicate and replace"" strategy for technological development.In addition, he said, ""China is providing a safe haven for criminal hackers who, as in this case, are hacking in part for their own personal gain but willing to help the state — and on call to do so.""The criminal charges are the first from the Justice Department accusing foreign hackers of targeting innovation related to the coronavirus, though U.S. and Western intelligence agencies have warned for months about those efforts.Last week, for instance, authorities in the U.S., Canada and the United Kingdom accused a hacking group with links to Russian intelligence of trying to target research on the disease, which has killed more than 140,000 people in the United States and more than 600,000 worldwide, according to figures compiled by Johns Hopkins University.The indictment describes multiple efforts by the hackers to snoop on companies engaged in coronavirus-related research, though it does not accuse them of success in any theft.Prosecutors say Li in January conducted reconnaissance on the computer network of a Massachusetts biotech firm known to be researching a potential vaccine, and searched for vulnerabilities on the network of a Maryland firm less than a week after the company said it was conducting similar scientific work.Li also probed the networks of a California diagnostics company involved in developing testing kits, and a biotech firm from the same state that was researching antiviral drugs.Hacking of vaccine information slows down research as the institution must scramble not only to fix the breach but also to ensure the data it has accumulated has not been altered, Demers said.""Once someone is in your system, they can not only take the data, they can manipulate the data,"" Demers said. ""We do worry to that extent that there could be a slowdown in the research efforts of that particular institution.""The indictment was returned earlier this month in federal court in the Eastern District of Washington, where the hacking outlined by prosecutors was first discovered at the Department of Energy's Hanford site.""If it can occur there, we all must know that it can occur anywhere,"" U.S. Attorney William Hyslop said of his district.The Chinese Embassy in Washington, D.C., did not directly respond to the indictment but pointed to remarks made last week by the Foreign Ministry spokesperson, who described China as the victim of ""groundless speculations"" but also a country whose scientific prowess means it does not need to ""secure an edge by theft.""Ben Buchanan, a Georgetown University professor and author of ""The Hacker and the State,"" said that though the U.S. has made clear its views on what kinds of economic espionage are permitted and not permitted, it is unclear where it draws the line on espionage related to the coronavirus or what kind of espionage the U.S. might conduct.He said he was not sure that this indictment, without other meaningful consequences, would get China to cease its activities.""The upside of spying in this way is simply too high for many governments to pass up,"" Buchanan said in an email."

"Yellowknife Chinese Association launches website, welcomes members | CBC News","'We’re Chinese,' says founding member Frank Fu. 'We need a voice, we need to tell people that we have our own culture.'",2020-12-08T15:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/yellowknife-chinese-association-1.5832028,"When Frank Fu moved to Yellowknife last October, he was all alone. ""It was very cold and a lot of snow,"" he recalls. Fu had moved to Yellowknife from Beijing under the N.W.T.'s Nominee Program, which invites people willing to invest at least $300,000 in a business to work toward permanent residency. The plan was to set up an apartment and a business, and his wife and two young children would follow. Fu spent his first two weeks in his apartment before venturing out to the grocery store, feeling very ""lonely."" Though he speaks English proficiently, he made his first close friends at a Chinese New Year celebration at the legislative assembly the following February. That's when he began to get the idea to create a formal group to help people like himself. This fall, he helped launch the Yellowknife Chinese Association with 10 board members and 24 members. The goals are to support newcomers, promote Chinese culture and language, and to give back to the community. ""We're Chinese,"" Fu said. ""We need a voice, we need to tell people that we have our own culture."" Fu had spent 20 years working for IBM in China. He now owns the security camera business, Intellibroad, in Yellowknife. He's still working on the association's new website. Angela Law is another founding board member. She moved to Yellowknife from Vancouver in 2002, but is originally from Hong Kong. Law and her family run Yellowknife Tours, the first company dedicated to bringing Chinese tourists to see the aurora. Law said previous generations of Chinese immigrants often had no time to organize societies: they were busy running businesses — often restaurants — working ""day and night."" ""I thought that this is the time because there are so many Chinese investors here,"" Law said.Law and Fu estimate there are around 200 Chinese people in the N.W.T., though both believe more will follow.  ""Language is a big barrier,"" for newcomers, Law said. She wants to help connect new immigrants to those with experience in Canada. The group's website will also share information useful to potential investors, such as the recent story about a lawsuit between a Chinese investor and a Yellowknife-based business partner, which the board has already discussed.""If these people [investors] want to know something about Yellowknife life here, then if they find us, then maybe this is also a channel for them to get someone who is living here and share the experience,"" said Law. The group hopes to mark their first event with a Spring Lantern festival, which they liken to a kind of Chinese Valentine's day, held 15 days after the Chinese lunar New Year. They hope to place red lanterns along Franklin Avenue and, pandemic permitting, hold some kind of event to celebrate. They also hope to launch classes or events for those who want to learn or improve their Chinese language skills. Members from mainland China, Taiwan and Hong Kong are all welcome to join the association. But the most important thing for now may be the social connections. While Fu was planning for his wife and children, ages 10 and three, to move to Yellowknife with him, the novel coronavirus arrived before they did. Fu now expects they won't move here until late in 2021, after the vaccine has been widely disseminated and it's safe to travel.  ""Right now, it's good because I have a lot of friends and I have a business to operate,"" Fu said.""And we have YKCA to work on and it's very exciting, so I'm OK. I'm good here."""
"As angry protests continue over Chinese glass factory, Statford's mayor voices his regrets | CBC News","Stratford Mayor Dan Mathieson says if he could do it over again, he wouldn't have asked Municipal Affairs and Housing Minister Steve Clark for a special order, paving the way for a Chinese company to build a proposed factory on his community's rim.",2020-12-08T09:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/london/stratford-glass-factory-xinyi-1.5831901,"As angry protests continue outside city hall, Stratford Mayor Dan Mathieson is expressing his regret over the decision to ask the province for a special order, clearing legal hurdles for a proposed Chinese-owned glass factory to be built on the community's border. ""Absolutely. Seeing the challenge it has brought to the community, there's some concern around it ... I think it's safe to say we would probably love to rewind and work at this again.""While he regrets the decision, Mathieson told CBC News Monday that he cannot discuss the reasons why it was made, citing confidentiality. ""I'm not at liberty to disclose them because they're covered under a confidentiality agreement, but I can say that council, we're looking at this,"" he said.""I'm sure everyone would have like to have this done differently.""  Mathieson formally asked the province for what's known as a minister's zoning order, or MZO; three times since 2018. The power allows the minister to issue a decree on a piece of land that can't be appealed by community groups or Ontario's Local Planning Appeal Tribunal.Opposition groups have called the tactic ""anti-democratic,"" saying it unfairly circumvents the local decision-making process and was used in an effort to quash opposition to a factory critics worry would potentially pollute the community's air and waterways. The simmering public anger could be seen on display outside city hall each Monday for the past few weeks, with dozens of demonstrators waving placards to express their frustration and opposition to the proposed factory. On Monday, Mathieson acknowledged their frustration but also appealed to their civility, asking those who oppose the project to take on a more respectful tone in disagreeing with the decisions he's made. ""I appreciate that people are angry. I would ask them if they're frustrated to clearly articulate their opinion in a thoughtful way and be respectful. Making accusations, raising insults never helps a process move forward.""Get Concerned Stratford, one of two opposition groups formed to oppose the factory coming to town, has retained the services of David Donnelly, the Toronto environmental lawyer who helped a similar group stop Xinyi Canada from bringing a similar proposal to the township of Guelph-Eramosa. ""Once the citizens [of Guelph-Eramosa] had their say and all the evidence had put before council, council voted to reject the project and that's what I hope will happen here.""""Stratford is world-renown for its theatre, its art and its beautiful setting. Stratford is not world renown for its heavy manufacturing and probably never should be.""Donnelly said what really vexes people is the lack of clear information about the factory, not only from public officials, but from Xinyi Canada itself. He argues the company has been deliberately vague about the amount of pollution the factory would produce, saying his best guess based on what's available from the company is the facility would quadruple the city's green house gas (GHG) emissions.""This is information that we've had to glean off the Xinyi website based on a similar sized plant located elsewhere,"" he said.""To make float glass, you have to heat it up to an incredible temperature and basically float it on molten steel. So the energy required to heat up the thing that actually tempers the glass.""""So that's our estimate, four times Stratford's emissions, but Xinyi has not actually come out and told anyone what those GHG emissions will be.""""That, to me, in relation to Stratford's declaration of a climate emergency, that's disqualifying on its face."" Donnelly wrote a letter to Stratford city council on December 3, outlining his clients' reasons why council should vote down the proposal.While questions over the proposed factory mount, the public may be able to get a chance to have some of those questions answered in a public forum soon. A representative from Xinyi Canada is scheduled to answer questions in an open forum with Stratford city council on December 14. "

Chinese sample return mission to the moon harkens back to 1960s lunar race | CBC Radio,Bob McDonald's blog: Robot mission will return first moon rocks since 1976,2020-11-27T19:50:56.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/radio/quirks/chinese-sample-return-mission-to-the-moon-harkens-back-to-1960s-lunar-race-1.5817888,"A Chinese robotic probe called Chang'e 5 is on its way to the moon where it will land, scoop up samples and return them to Earth. This is the first robotic sample return mission since Russian efforts in the 1960s. Those were an effort to make their mark on the lunar surface after their manned moon program failed.When Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin made their historic landing on the moon in July 1969, a secret Russian robotic probe called Luna 15 was there at the same time. It was an attempt to grab a sample of lunar soil and return it to Earth before the American astronauts got back. The Russians had lost the race to put humans on the moon, but were trying to grab a 'first' and master the moon robotically.Unfortunately, Luna 15 crashed during it's landing attempt and the opportunity for a propaganda coup was lost. However, their Luna 16 mission did successfully return about 100 grams of lunar soil a year later and two other sample return missions succeeded in following years, with the last one, Luna 24, in 1976 — two years after the Apollo program had ended. While these robotic sample return missions did not deliver as much lunar material as the Apollo astronauts, they were considerably cheaper and part of a long history of both Russian and American robotic lunar exploration involving dozens of impactors, orbiters, landers and rovers. In a way, we're in another moon race right now that echoes the race of fifty years ago — except this time it seems the robots might be in the lead. China is using robotic landers to explore the moon, and, if all goes well, Chang'e 5 will bring back several kilograms of moon rocks. In the meantime, the U.S. is struggling to develop a far more expensive effort, relying on huge (and much delayed) rockets that will carry humans to the moon with their Artemis program. It once again brings up the question of whether humans or robots are best suited to space exploration. We debated this on a special edition of Quirks & Quarks last year.Human missions are much more expensive, and historically they are much more politically driven than robotic exploration. The decision by the Kennedy administration in 1961 to send humans to the moon was part of the Cold War competition between the U.S. and Soviet Union to prove technical superiority over one another. The current Artemis program has also been politically influenced. Originally the plan was to first build a space station called Gateway in orbit around the moon. Once it was completed, astronauts would be sent down to the surface some time later this decade. When the Trump administration came to power, the landing was pushed forward to 2024, which would have been the last year of President Trump's second term in office. The Biden administration has not said whether it will keep to that tight schedule.NASA's giant new moon rocket, the Space Launch System (SLS) is slated to make its first flight next year. In the meantime three private companies — SpaceX, Blue Origin and Dynetics — have been contracted to develop lunar landers that would ride on their own rockets. But the pace of development in these programs makes NASA's current 2024 moon landing deadline pretty ambitious.Meanwhile, China is continuing its robotic program beyond the moon with the Tianwen 1 mission currently on its way to Mars. The spacecraft includes an orbiter and a lander, which will make China the third country to make a soft landing on Mars after Russia and the U.S. This is not a sample return mission, but it is not unreasonable to think that China could apply similar technology it is using on the moon to return samples from Mars in the future.Robots have always boldly gone where no one has gone before, exploring every planet in the solar system, as well as dwarf planets, moons, asteroids and comets. They conduct the initial reconnaissance of other worlds, survey the lay of the land and choose the best landing sites for humans who follow.  A whole fleet of robots are currently flying around the solar system. Two others are on their way to Mars with the United Arab Emirates' Hope mission and NASA's Perseverance lander scheduled to arrive in February.Beyond Mars, the Japanese Hayabusa2 and American, OSIRIS-REx spacecraft are bringing home samples they collected from asteroids. NASA is planning future missions to visit Europa, a moon of Jupiter and Titan, a mysterious moon of Saturn, the only moon with a thick atmosphere and liquid methane lakes on its surface.There is no doubt it will be a dramatic moment when the next human feet step out onto lunar soil again. Human exploration of space captures the imagination of the public, provides role models for young people and tests the limits of technical, physical and psychological endurance. But humans have not gone very far. The last mission to the moon was in 1972. It will still stretch the limits of our technology to get back there almost half a century later, Meanwhile, the true explorers of space, our silent mechanical servants, will continue their more far-reaching journeys to literally reach out and touch other worlds."
"McCallum says he tried to improve conditions for Kovrig, Spavor in Chinese prison | CBC News",One of Canada's most controversial ex-ambassadors to China says he repeatedly tried to improve the living conditions of Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor after their imprisonment in the People's Republic almost two years ago.,2020-11-25T01:09:05.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/chong-champagne-china-committee-1.5815179,"One of Canada's most controversial ex-ambassadors to China says he repeatedly tried to improve the living conditions of Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor after their imprisonment in the People's Republic almost two years ago. John McCallum also said Tuesday he regrets speaking about the October 2019 Canadian election in a meeting with Chinese officials in the months leading up to it. McCallum, the former Liberal cabinet minister who was fired as Canada's envoy to China in January 2019, was testifying at the special House of Commons committee on Canada-China relations. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau fired McCallum after he made a series of public comments that broke with the government's line following the arrests of Kovrig and Spavor. The two men were arrested nine days after Canada's arrest of Chinese high-tech scion Meng Wanzhou in December 2018 on a U.S. extradition warrant in what is widely viewed as retaliation by China. McCallum said that's when everything changed in Canada's relations with China. ""From that moment onwards, the top priority of the government and of myself as ambassador was to secure the release of the two Michaels,"" said McCallum, noting that he has been one of the few people to visit them in prison. ""On more than one occasion, I tried to convince the Chinese that if they were unable to release Kovrig and Spavor they should at least improve their living conditions. Sadly, as you all know, Canadian efforts in this area have so far been unsuccessful."" The committee has been examining Canada's relations with China, which have plummeted to an all-time low since December 2018.Earlier Tuesday, Conservative MP Michael Chong urged Foreign Affairs Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne to adopt a more consistent approach to getting tough with China. The Conservative foreign affairs critic told Champagne during a House of Commons committee meeting Tuesday that the government needs to show Canadians how it will deal with growing Chinese intimidation of Canadians within Canada. Chong said it is inconsistent for the government to be talking tougher on China, while Canada's current ambassador, Dominic Barton, is making speeches about the need to broaden trade with the People's Republic. ""I think it needs to be a lot clearer, a lot more consistent if Canada is going to have a clear, consistent voice with respect to China on the world stage,"" said Chong. Chong sponsored a motion that won approval in the Commons last week that calls on the government to decide within 30 days whether to allow China's Huawei Technologies to supply equipment for its next generation 5G internet network. Meng is a chief executive of Huawei. Champagne replied that Canada has taken a smart and firm approach with China lately that includes speaking out against its ill treatment of pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong and of ethnic Muslim Uighurs. ""Whether it comes to the Uighurs or whether it comes to Hong Kong, I've outlined places where we're going to challenge China, places where we're going to, for example, coexist with China,"" Champagne said."

What an Australian-style push against Chinese interference might look like | CBC News,"A motion brought by CPC foreign affairs critic Michael Chong, which passed Parliament last week, gives the government 30 days to come up with a plan — like Australia's — to fight foreign (Chinese) interference and influence campaigns. What might that look like and will it come to pass?",2020-11-24T09:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/china-canada-australia-espionage-1.5813364,"Some Australians see the country's new powers to stop foreign interference as an overdue shift from complacency to vigilance, while others have warned of the dangers of a McCarthyite moral panic.But all can agree that Australia's approach to foreign meddling in its politics, universities and public debate has changed a great deal in recent years.Last week, the Canadian House of Commons voted 179-146 for this country to adopt a plan similar to Australia's to counter meddling by the People's Republic of China.Experts in Canada and Australia suggest that such a change would set Canada on a much more aggressive path in countering China's inroads into this country's institutions.Conservative foreign affairs critic Michael Chong's motion requires the government to ""develop a robust plan, as Australia has done, to combat China's growing foreign operations here in Canada and its increasing intimidation of Canadians living in Canada, and table it within 30 days of the adoption of this motion.""Chong's motion received the support of most opposition members of the House, along with Liberals Wayne Easter, Nathaniel Erskine-Smith, John McKay and Jennifer O'Connell.Chong chose Australia as a model for Canada because of a package of laws passed in 2018 in the wake of a series of revelations that brought the issue of foreign interference and espionage to the fore.Sam Dastyari was an up-and-coming Labor Party senator when the year 2018 began. By the end of it he had admitted to soliciting thousands of dollars from businesses affiliated with the Chinese Communist Party. Thousands of Australians signed petitions demanding he face charges of treason.Australian media reports on Dastyari suggested he was a good investment for China. He not only supported Beijing's claims to the South China Sea — in opposition to the official position of his Labor Party — he also worked to prevent a meeting between his party leader and a Hong Kong pro-democracy activist.Dominique Dalla-Pozza teaches at the Centre for Military and Security Law at the Australian National University in Canberra (which itself allegedly has been a target of a massive Chinese intelligence operation). She said that for the past few years, the Australian Security Intelligence Organization (the ASIO — Australia's equivalent of Canada's CSIS) has been sounding the alarm about unprecedented levels of foreign intrusion.""ASIO said there were more foreign spies and their proxies operating in Australia than at the height of the Cold War,"" Dalla-Pozza said.In Canada, CSIS has been trying for years to draw Canadians' attention to foreign interference in everything from universities to municipal governments. Then-director Dick Fadden went public with such a warning in 2010. But Canada has seen no real legislative or organizational response.In Australia, by contrast, those warnings led the Turnbull government to introduce a new Espionage and Foreign Interference Act. Australia's laws don't single out China, the country's largest trading partner. When he introduced the bill in Parliament, then-PM Malcolm Turnbull was careful to cite other precedents, such as Russian meddling in the U.S. and French elections of 2016 and 2017. But there's no doubt in Australia about which foreign government is seen as the most active meddler. Over the last couple of months, Australia has raided the apartments of four Chinese journalists and revoked the visas of two Chinese academics.Dalla-Pozza said the law defines foreign interference as ""conduct that is engaged in concert with a foreign principal or a person that is acting on behalf of a foreign principal"" where ""the person engaging in the conduct is reckless as to whether it will influence government processes, or in other ways influence a democratic political right or duty.""Conduct has to be covert or involve deception, or involve a person making a threat to cause serious harm, or involve a person making a threat with menaces.""The new law produced its first arrest of a suspect two weeks ago: Di Sanh Duong, a prominent member of pro-Beijing Chinese-Australian organizations.The Turnbull government also brought in laws banning foreigners from donating to Australian politicians, placed new requirements on telecommunications companies to block foreign interference, and created a registry of critical infrastructure assets to provide more transparency on who really owns what in the country.And ""there are other mechanisms being developed in Australia that don't depend on the law,"" such as a new national coordinator, a public information campaign and a hotline, said Dalla-Pozza.""The act prescribes in a more focused way what is foreign interference, what is espionage, what is treason,"" said Patrick Walsh, who teaches at the Australian Graduate School for Policing and Security.Walsh said one of the most significant aspects of the law is that it allows Australia to fight back outside the courts.""The key is operational disruption of foreign interference, not just to collect information, but to disrupt it,"" he said.""In 2019 the PM established the Counter Foreign Interference Task Force, which is an interdepartmental task force to discover, track and disrupt foreign interference. And there was $8.7 million given to this task force.""The resources Australia devotes to this effort are not only centralized under a national coordinator, but are also far greater in terms of trained investigators than those available to the Government of Canada.Thirty days seems like a short time to design a full overhaul of Canada's approach to foreign interference, but Chong said Canada has a duty to protect people within its borders from harassment and intimidation by agents of foreign powers. ""It's long past time for the government to deal with this. Australia has already dealt with this. Our other allies have already dealt with this,"" he said. ""I note that on October 28, the FBI charged eight individuals, three of whom were Chinese citizens, for interfering and threatening American citizens through operations that are taking place on American soil.""The motion doesn't spell out any consequences for the government if it allows the 30 days to lapse. But Chong said that would be a harmful precedent given the strong cross-party support the motion received in Parliament.""I expect it to be carried out if the government follows democratic norms and respects the will of Parliament,"" he told CBC News. ""At a time when democracy is under pressure around the world, it's more important than ever that governments respect democratic norms."""

"As Conservatives call for crackdown, O'Toole calls Chinese influence a grave 'threat' to Canada | CBC News","Conservative Leader Erin O'Toole said today Canada must crack down on the growing influence of the Chinese communist regime, adding there's ""no greater threat to Canada's interests than the rise of China"" in global affairs.",2020-11-17T16:56:43.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/otoole-china-greatest-threat-1.5804972,"Conservative Leader Erin O'Toole said today Canada must crack down on the growing influence of the Chinese communist regime, adding there's ""no greater threat to Canada's interests than the rise of China"" in global affairs.O'Toole said the western world has tolerated China's human rights abuses, intellectual property theft and manipulative trade practices for decades in order to gain access to the country's burgeoning economy. He said it's time for Canada and its closest allies to adopt a more aggressive posture.""The democratic world must acknowledge that the approach to China over the last two decades has not worked. In fact, the situation has gotten worse,"" O'Toole told reporters on Parliament Hill.He said the move to normalize relations and admit China to the World Trade Organization has had ""catastrophic impacts for Canadian workers.""""We falsely believed that ignoring the sharp edges of communism would, over time, smooth them out by putting trade ahead of our values.""Conservative MP Michael Chong, the party's foreign affairs critic, will table a motion today to put pressure on the Liberal government to ban Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei from building Canada's 5G network. Most of the country's wireless providers have opted already to work with Sweden-based Ericsson.Huawei's founder has close ties to China's communist leadership and intelligence partners have long warned that the company's technology could be used to spy on Canadians. O'Toole said Huawei's global success is due in part to ""years of industrial espionage"" against the now-defunct Canadian tech giant Nortel.Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Tuesday the government's final decision on Huawei will be based on the recommendations of Canada's intelligence agencies. ""We've worked with our allies and we've consulted broadly,"" he said.The former director of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS), Ward Elcock, has said Huawei and all Chinese technology firms like it pose a significant risk to worldwide intelligence collection.Watch: Bains says the federal government ""will not be bullied or intimidated by any country."":PoliticsThe Conservative motion, if passed, also would compel the Liberal government to develop a comprehensive plan to protect Canada from ""the growing influence of Chinese agents"" on our soil.O'Toole said Canada has tolerated the proliferation of Confucius Institutes — state-backed Chinese language centres — that push state propaganda.O'Toole said Canadian university professors have been bullied into weakening their teachings on human rights abuses for fear of offending mainland Chinese students, while pro-Beijing media outlets have disseminated anti-western narratives.""Canadians of Chinese origin have been threatened by foreign agents in our country. Anti-Hong Kong protests were organized in Canada to bully democracy activists. Uighur students in our universities have been de-platformed and menaced in coordinated actions led by Chinese consulates across our country,"" he said.""And the very values we hold dear, like openness, justice and tolerance, have been weaponized against us.""O'Toole pointed to Australia's foreign interference law as something to emulate here. That country passed legislation in 2018 to toughen penalties on espionage while also requiring individuals or organizations acting in the interests of foreign powers to register and disclose their ties — part of an effort to reduce meddling by China in Australia's politics, universities and media.Under the legislation, it is illegal for a person to knowingly engage in covert conduct or deception on behalf of a ""foreign principal."" The first arrest under this law was made earlier this month when a prominent Chinese-Australian community activist was accused of trying to influence the country's immigration minister.Speaking later in question period, Trudeau said Canada has a ""complex multi-dimensional relationship with China"" and the country deals with Beijing ""with eyes wide open.""""We will remain firm in defending our principles and interests and always will,"" he said, adding that Canada's security agencies have been working with universities and colleges to address new Chinese threats to those institutions.""Canada has among the best security agencies in the world. The folks who work for our agencies work every single day to keep Canadians safe. Not all of it appears in the newspapers. On the contrary, a lot of the work that is done in important situations is never heard about at all,"" he said.Watch: Conservative MP Michael Chong says the federal government is ""paralyzed by indecision"" on Huawei:PoliticsAsked if passing such a motion would further damage already shaky bilateral relations between Canada and China, O'Toole said that while he's concerned about the status of two Canadians held in Chinese prisons, the current government's approach hasn't yielded results.Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor have been held in China for 708 days. ""A weak response by Mr. Trudeau has not led to any progress in the case of the two Michaels,"" O'Toole said. ""A more principled, a stronger approach may make progress.""China has retaliated against countries that have criticized its behaviour through trade action. O'Toole said Canada shouldn't be intimidated by such threats.""Canada should work very closely with our Five Eyes allies ... so that it's difficult for China to use its immense economic size to intimidate smaller economies like Canada,"" O'Toole said, citing the intelligence-sharing alliance between Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the U.S.""We may be a smaller economy in comparison with China but we are a giant when it comes to the rights we hold dear, human rights, the rule of law and the security of our citizens.""O'Toole said Canada must strengthen its relationship with other Asian economies — Canada joined the Trans-Pacific Partnership in 2017 — and bolster trade with India. ""We need to look for new markets,"" he said.The motion comes days after the House of Commons subcommittee on international human rights released a report condemning China for committing genocidal acts against the Uighur Muslim minority. Canada's ambassador to the UN, Bob Rae, said Sunday he would encourage the body's human rights committee to probe the plight of China's Uighur population."

Canada's ties to China's military underscore the weird contradictions in its foreign policy | CBC News,It's been obvious for some time that there is something a little weird about the way Canada approaches its relationship with China — a disconnect brought into sharp relief this week by the news that Global Affairs and the Department of National Defence were not on the same page when it came to military ties and training involving the People’s Liberation Army.,2020-12-12T09:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canada-china-pla-peoples-liberation-army-1.5838658,"It's been obvious for some time that there is something weird about the way Canada approaches its relationship with China — a disconnect brought into sharp relief this week by the news that Global Affairs and the Department of National Defence were not on the same page when it came to military ties and training involving the People's Liberation Army.In some respects, the volcanic online political eruption which followed stories in The Globe and Mail and other media outlets, based on exclusive access to information documents, was predictable, as was the flurry of finger-pointing in the House of Commons on Thursday and Friday.Diplomats were alarmed when Gen. Jonathan Vance, the country's senior military commander, cancelled winter military exercises with the PLA in 2019, fretting that it might aggravate Beijing or make the lives of Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor even worse.It makes for fire-breathing memes, sizzling copy and wonderful political theatre.What's missing, though, is a recognition that Canada's policy toward a rising China has been contradictory and incoherent for almost a decade, maybe more, said Charles Burton, a political scientist at Brock University in St. Catharines, Ont. and a respected China expert at the Macdonald-Laurier Institute.""Cabinets were always split on China, whether it's Liberal or Conservative,"" Burton said, referring to debates more than three decades ago during the government of former prime minister Brian Mulroney.It is more urgent than ever, in the context of an increasingly belligerent and assertive China, to present a united political front, he added.""This is really about the defence of our sovereignty and security on matters over which there is consensus across the political spectrum in Canada,"" he said.Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan, in an attempt at political damage control late this week, made a point of saying that Chinese troops are no longer training for winter warfare at Garrison Petawawa, Ont.He also (rather meekly) noted that the exchange and training program with the PLA was instituted in August 2013 under the Conservatives while defence critic James Bezan, one of the most vocal and fiery opponents this week, was parliamentary secretary of defence.Bezan's retort was along the lines of that was then, this is now.""The defence minister knows full well that the Chinese government back then and the Chinese government today are completely different,"" Bezan said during question period on Thursday.It was a different time, no question.Chinese President Xi Jinping had taken office only a few months before, and the Department of National Defence (DND) tasking order that established the exchange program, obtained by CBC News under access to information, noted that working with the PLA ""complements the Government of Canada led efforts to broaden our bilateral relationship with China.""After years of hectoring and hammering China, the Conservatives — under former prime minister Stephen Harper — had decided that limited engagement was the way to go.And here is where Canada's curious incoherence comes into play.At precisely the moment the former chief of the defence staff, the now-retired general Tom Lawson, was penning the Canadian military's marching orders on closer cooperation with the PLA, the foreign affairs ministry — led at the time by John Baird — was firing off flares about China's unilateral declaration of an air defence zone in the East China Sea.It was a bellwether moment.""The U.S. has indicated deep concern over the establishment of the Chinese ADIZ stating that the U.S. views this development as a destabilizing attempt to alter the status quo in the region and that this move increases the risk of misunderstanding and miscalculations,"" said a Nov. 23, 2013 briefing note to Baird, obtained by CBC News in 2017.""More broadly, the rise of China is reshaping the strategic landscape.""Burton said the rise of President Xi marked the beginning of the new, more aggressive China. The establishment of the air zone — now largely forgotten against a backdrop of fortified artificial islands in the South China Sea, reports of Uyghurs in concentration camps and the haze of tear gas in Hong Kong — marked the first step.So were our politicians and senior leaders paying attention not only to events, but to what other federal departments were saying?According to what former foreign affairs minister (and current finance minister) Chrystia Freeland had to say in question period this week, the answer is yes.""I have long personal experience reporting on authoritarian communist regimes and I am very aware of the threat they pose,"" she said.Here's the question no one seemed to ask this week: why was the military exchange and training program still going on even before hostage diplomacy swept up the two Michaels?National Defence is no stranger to suspicions about China, having spent an enormous amount of time quietly defending itself from cyberattacks purportedly launched by  Beijing or by groups associated with it.The Trump administration has been tightening the screws on China from a diplomatic, security and trade perspective. There has been considerable, growing debate among Western allies — led by the Americans — about the downside of military engagement and co-operation with China, with Five Eyes intelligence partners each exchanging their own warnings — a series of discussions that eventually prompted Canada's current top military commander, Gen. Jonathan Vance, to cancel the winter warfare exercises.And then, of course, there's debate over the telecom giant Huawei and its future in this country.The signs were all there, Burton said — but no one actually woke up to the problem until Kovrig and Spavor were imprisoned. The public has been galvanized, he added, but ""it doesn't seem to have penetrated fully to the senior levels of the political and economic elite.""Burton said that — as weird as it might sound, with everything else that has happened — he believes there are some within the Canadian Establishment who still cling to the notion that if the ""consular cases of Spavor and Kovrig are resolved, we can go back"" to business as usual."

China imposed the law on Hong Kong, which is supposed to have legal autonomy under the ""one country, two systems"" agreement.""If the Canadian side really cares about the stability and the prosperity in Hong Kong, and really cares about the good health and safety of those 300,000 Canadian passport holders in Hong Kong, and the large number of Canadian companies operating in Hong Kong … you should support those efforts to fight violent crimes,"" Cong said.Canada's deputy prime minister Chrystia Freeland said the ambassador's remarks were ""not in any way in keeping with the spirit of appropriate diplomatic relations between two countries."" Conservative Leader Erin O'Toole says that if Cong refuses to apologize, Canada should withdraw his diplomatic credentials.Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian defended Cong's remarks, saying Canadian leaders ""did not verify, but also condoned the anti-China comments spreading across the nation and made groundless accusations against China.""Edward Chin agrees with O'Toole. He is a Canadian hedge fund manager who lives and works in Hong Kong, and a longtime activist in the Hong Kong pro-democracy movement. Here is part of his conversation with As It Happens host Carol Off. Mr. Chin, how secure do you feel as a Canadian in Hong Kong right now?I think this [statement from the ambassador] is one of the so-called wolf warrior tactics they have been using over the last couple of years. But it kind of got escalated in the last little while.Do you feel secure since these remarks on the part of the [Chinese] ambassador? Even before this gentlemen's remarks, after the [national security law] came into effect, I don't think anyone would feel secure in Hong Kong because this is exactly one country, one system now. So how can anyone feel secure in Hong Kong?Because last year, every Hong Kong person, more than two million people, came out to fight very hard [against] the extradition bill that finally got retracted. Now, this is 10 times worse. This is the nuclear option that they think of.But this seems to have been in reaction to suggestions that Canada would offer asylum to people from Hong Kong, democracy activists who are feeling threatened by the … national security law since it came into place, and that this has been the way that Hong Kong [has reacted] to Canada's offer of asylum. Does that change things?I think Canada has done the right thing to give asylum to those demonstrators who came out and [fought] for democracy, because they were fighting for their life, basically.We have to go back a few months earlier. Why do people come up and protest? Because the two systems is gone. Now, the Chinese ambassador to Canada, you know, whatever he said is threatening. Threatening. This is outrageous, honestly. I think he should be reprimanded.China's ambassador in Ottawa was … warning against the granting asylum to Hong Kong dissidents, and he said, ""If the Canadian side really cares about the stability and the prosperity in Hong Kong and really cares about the good health and safety of those 300,000 Canadian passport holders in Hong Kong and the large number of Canadian companies operating Hong Kong, you should support those efforts to fight violent crimes."" And, of course, is referring to the national security law. Does that sound like a threat to you?Does it mean that they want to treat the Chinese-Canadians or Caucasian-Canadians in Hong Kong, just like the two Michaels, just to abduct them into China?They could just use any excuse and detain someone.I think that the Trudeau government, [Prime Minister] Justin Trudeau together with Chrystia Freeland, I think they should really have a strong statement saying, you know, like, ""This is a threat."" Because, you know, there are a lot of mainland students studying in Canada.Canada, they don't do the same type of threat. This is something really outrageous, and only like a totalitarian regime would do that, threatening people.Chrystia Freeland has spoken out in Canada. She has said this is not in the spirit of diplomatic relations … but the Opposition is saying that the government should go further, that in fact, they should demand the ambassador either apologize or leave the country, have his credentials pulled. Do you think that Canada should go that far?The opposition party is saying the right thing. Because definitely this Chinese ambassador … should definitely apologize.The Opposition leader, I agree with him. You know, they should do something to show that Canada is not one of the weakest Five Eyes countries. Because it's perceived that way, especially in Hong Kong.You have been an activist. You have been outspoken for years, even before this national security law came into effect, and as you point out, became something where people who speak out against China could be arrested, that free speech has been criminalized.... Are you concerned that they you might be targeted by the regime right now, given what they've said about Canada?Everyone could be targetted. I mean, we as Chinese-Canadians, we are in a very awkward situation now. Ethnically, I'm Chinese, so it is embarrassing to have a Chinese ambassador to Canada saying they will do some harm to Chinese people living in Hong Kong, whether I am Canadian or not. So they're saying they want to do something bad to their own people.I don't dislike China. I think it's a great country with a great civilization. But the CCP, the Chinese Communist Party, the way they treat their own people, is very questionable.And that's why [former Chinese leader] Deng Xiaoping promised the two systems until 2047. But now we are short-changed by 27 years.Can I just ask you, finally, do you think there will be many people in Hong Kong … the activists, will they be seeking asylum? Do you think they will ask to be refugees to Canada?I don't think there will be a massive exodus. But in terms of persecution, yes, definitely. Those people living in Hong Kong, whether they are Hong Kong permanent ID card holders or anyone in Hong Kong now, their situation is the same as if they were in mainland China. There's no difference. No doubt about it.Will you ever leave Hong Kong? Do you think that's something that you might have to do?Besides my investment business in hedge funds and all my other hedges, I'm a current affairs writer, a commentator. I think I want to wait until they put a gunpoint at someone's head; and I think that would be the time that we all should leave.And if they shut down, for instance, Apple Daily or some of the internet radio, or they arrest a lot of full-time political commentators, that's the time I think a lot of people should leave, and then the whole world should talk with the CCP and confront with them in a forceful way.Written by Sheena Goodyear with files from The Associated Press.

Chinese envoy warns Canada against granting asylum to Hong Kong protesters | CBC News,The Chinese ambassador to Canada warned the Trudeau government today not to grant asylum to Hong Kong residents fleeing a widely criticized national security law imposed by Beijing.,2020-10-15T18:12:27.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/china-canada-ambassador-hong-kong-spavor-kovrig-meng-huawei-1.5763677,"The Chinese ambassador to Canada warned the Trudeau government today not to grant asylum to Hong Kong residents fleeing a widely criticized national security law imposed by Beijing.""We strongly urge the Canadian side not (to) grant so-called political asylum to those violent criminals in Hong Kong,"" Ambassador Cong Peiwu said in a video press conference from the Chinese Embassy in Ottawa.He said that would amount to ""interference in China's domestic affairs, and certainly it will embolden those violent criminals.""Hong Kong was supposed to operate under a ""one country, two systems"" deal after Britain handed its former colony over to Beijing in 1997 under an international agreement. But human rights and pro-democracy advocates say Beijing's new national security law is undermining freedom in what is known as the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.""So if the Canadian side really cares about the stability and the prosperity in Hong Kong, and really cares about the good health and safety of those 300,000 Canadian passport holders in Hong Kong, and the large number of Canadian companies operating in Hong Kong SAR, you should support those efforts to fight violent crimes,"" Cong said.Cong also flatly rejected Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's assertion that China is engaging in coercive diplomacy by imprisoning two Canadian men in retaliation for the arrest of a Chinese high-tech executive on an American extradition warrant. Meng Wanzhou is living under house arrest in Vancouver while her case wends through a British Columbia court.In December 2018, China imprisoned Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor and charged them with undermining the country's national security. Cong said they are still undergoing a legal process in China but did not provide further details.He repeated his government's demand that Canada release Meng immediately but insisted her case and his government's prosecution of Kovrig and Spavor are not linked.""We will remain absolutely committed to working with our allies to ensure that China's approach of coercive diplomacy, its arbitrary detention of two Canadian citizens, alongside other citizens of other countries around the world, is not viewed as a successful tactic by them,"" Trudeau said earlier this week as the two countries marked 50 years of relations at one of the lowest points in Canada-China bilateral relations.Cong said Canada's efforts to get other countries to join its fight for Kovrig and Spavor is ""doomed to fail.""The European Union raised concerns about the two Canadians by name in the communique summarizing its recent summit with China.""We oppose any remarks that interfere in our internal affairs. And I would like to point out, there is no coercive diplomacy on the Chinese side,"" Cong said."

"Yellowknife Chinese Association launches website, welcomes members | CBC News","'We’re Chinese,' says founding member Frank Fu. 'We need a voice, we need to tell people that we have our own culture.'",2020-12-08T15:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/yellowknife-chinese-association-1.5832028,"When Frank Fu moved to Yellowknife last October, he was all alone. ""It was very cold and a lot of snow,"" he recalls. Fu had moved to Yellowknife from Beijing under the N.W.T.'s Nominee Program, which invites people willing to invest at least $300,000 in a business to work toward permanent residency. The plan was to set up an apartment and a business, and his wife and two young children would follow. Fu spent his first two weeks in his apartment before venturing out to the grocery store, feeling very ""lonely."" Though he speaks English proficiently, he made his first close friends at a Chinese New Year celebration at the legislative assembly the following February. That's when he began to get the idea to create a formal group to help people like himself. This fall, he helped launch the Yellowknife Chinese Association with 10 board members and 24 members. The goals are to support newcomers, promote Chinese culture and language, and to give back to the community. ""We're Chinese,"" Fu said. ""We need a voice, we need to tell people that we have our own culture."" Fu had spent 20 years working for IBM in China. He now owns the security camera business, Intellibroad, in Yellowknife. He's still working on the association's new website. Angela Law is another founding board member. She moved to Yellowknife from Vancouver in 2002, but is originally from Hong Kong. Law and her family run Yellowknife Tours, the first company dedicated to bringing Chinese tourists to see the aurora. Law said previous generations of Chinese immigrants often had no time to organize societies: they were busy running businesses — often restaurants — working ""day and night."" ""I thought that this is the time because there are so many Chinese investors here,"" Law said.Law and Fu estimate there are around 200 Chinese people in the N.W.T., though both believe more will follow.  ""Language is a big barrier,"" for newcomers, Law said. She wants to help connect new immigrants to those with experience in Canada. The group's website will also share information useful to potential investors, such as the recent story about a lawsuit between a Chinese investor and a Yellowknife-based business partner, which the board has already discussed.""If these people [investors] want to know something about Yellowknife life here, then if they find us, then maybe this is also a channel for them to get someone who is living here and share the experience,"" said Law. The group hopes to mark their first event with a Spring Lantern festival, which they liken to a kind of Chinese Valentine's day, held 15 days after the Chinese lunar New Year. They hope to place red lanterns along Franklin Avenue and, pandemic permitting, hold some kind of event to celebrate. They also hope to launch classes or events for those who want to learn or improve their Chinese language skills. Members from mainland China, Taiwan and Hong Kong are all welcome to join the association. But the most important thing for now may be the social connections. While Fu was planning for his wife and children, ages 10 and three, to move to Yellowknife with him, the novel coronavirus arrived before they did. Fu now expects they won't move here until late in 2021, after the vaccine has been widely disseminated and it's safe to travel.  ""Right now, it's good because I have a lot of friends and I have a business to operate,"" Fu said.""And we have YKCA to work on and it's very exciting, so I'm OK. I'm good here."""
"As angry protests continue over Chinese glass factory, Statford's mayor voices his regrets | CBC News","Stratford Mayor Dan Mathieson says if he could do it over again, he wouldn't have asked Municipal Affairs and Housing Minister Steve Clark for a special order, paving the way for a Chinese company to build a proposed factory on his community's rim.",2020-12-08T09:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/london/stratford-glass-factory-xinyi-1.5831901,"As angry protests continue outside city hall, Stratford Mayor Dan Mathieson is expressing his regret over the decision to ask the province for a special order, clearing legal hurdles for a proposed Chinese-owned glass factory to be built on the community's border. ""Absolutely. Seeing the challenge it has brought to the community, there's some concern around it ... I think it's safe to say we would probably love to rewind and work at this again.""While he regrets the decision, Mathieson told CBC News Monday that he cannot discuss the reasons why it was made, citing confidentiality. ""I'm not at liberty to disclose them because they're covered under a confidentiality agreement, but I can say that council, we're looking at this,"" he said.""I'm sure everyone would have like to have this done differently.""  Mathieson formally asked the province for what's known as a minister's zoning order, or MZO; three times since 2018. The power allows the minister to issue a decree on a piece of land that can't be appealed by community groups or Ontario's Local Planning Appeal Tribunal.Opposition groups have called the tactic ""anti-democratic,"" saying it unfairly circumvents the local decision-making process and was used in an effort to quash opposition to a factory critics worry would potentially pollute the community's air and waterways. The simmering public anger could be seen on display outside city hall each Monday for the past few weeks, with dozens of demonstrators waving placards to express their frustration and opposition to the proposed factory. On Monday, Mathieson acknowledged their frustration but also appealed to their civility, asking those who oppose the project to take on a more respectful tone in disagreeing with the decisions he's made. ""I appreciate that people are angry. I would ask them if they're frustrated to clearly articulate their opinion in a thoughtful way and be respectful. Making accusations, raising insults never helps a process move forward.""Get Concerned Stratford, one of two opposition groups formed to oppose the factory coming to town, has retained the services of David Donnelly, the Toronto environmental lawyer who helped a similar group stop Xinyi Canada from bringing a similar proposal to the township of Guelph-Eramosa. ""Once the citizens [of Guelph-Eramosa] had their say and all the evidence had put before council, council voted to reject the project and that's what I hope will happen here.""""Stratford is world-renown for its theatre, its art and its beautiful setting. Stratford is not world renown for its heavy manufacturing and probably never should be.""Donnelly said what really vexes people is the lack of clear information about the factory, not only from public officials, but from Xinyi Canada itself. He argues the company has been deliberately vague about the amount of pollution the factory would produce, saying his best guess based on what's available from the company is the facility would quadruple the city's green house gas (GHG) emissions.""This is information that we've had to glean off the Xinyi website based on a similar sized plant located elsewhere,"" he said.""To make float glass, you have to heat it up to an incredible temperature and basically float it on molten steel. So the energy required to heat up the thing that actually tempers the glass.""""So that's our estimate, four times Stratford's emissions, but Xinyi has not actually come out and told anyone what those GHG emissions will be.""""That, to me, in relation to Stratford's declaration of a climate emergency, that's disqualifying on its face."" Donnelly wrote a letter to Stratford city council on December 3, outlining his clients' reasons why council should vote down the proposal.While questions over the proposed factory mount, the public may be able to get a chance to have some of those questions answered in a public forum soon. A representative from Xinyi Canada is scheduled to answer questions in an open forum with Stratford city council on December 14. "
Chinese spacecraft has fresh moon rock samples to return to Earth | CBC News,"China said Thursday its latest lunar probe has finished taking samples of the moon's surface and sealed them within the spacecraft for return to Earth, the first time such a mission has been attempted by any country in more than 40 years.",2020-12-03T13:48:11.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/moon-samples-1.5826500,"China said Thursday its latest lunar probe has finished taking samples of the moon's surface and sealed them within the spacecraft for return to Earth, the first time such a mission has been attempted by any country in more than 40 years.The Chang'e 5, the third Chinese probe to land on the moon, is the latest in a series of increasingly ambitious missions for Beijing's space program, which also has a probe en route to Mars carrying a robot rover.The Chang'e 5 touched down Tuesday on the Sea of Storms on the moon's near side, on a mission to return lunar rocks to Earth for the first time since 1976.The probe ""has completed sampling on the moon, and the samples have been sealed within the spacecraft,"" the China National Space Administration said in a statement.Plans call for the upper stage of the probe known as the ascender to be launched back into lunar orbit to transfer the samples to a capsule for return to Earth. The timing of its return was not immediately clear and the lander can last up to one moon day, or 14 Earth days, before falling temperatures would make it inoperable.Chang'e is equipped to both scoop samples from the surface and drill two metres to retrieve materials that could provide clues into the history of the moon, Earth other planets and space features.WATCH | An animation shows how Chang'e 5 was to land on the moon and collect samples:WorldWhile retrieving samples is its main task, the lander is also equipped to extensively photograph the area surrounding its landing site, map conditions below the surface with ground-penetrating radar and analyze the lunar soil for minerals and water content.Chang'e 5's return module is supposed to touch down around the middle of December on the grasslands of Inner Mongolia, where China's crewed Shenzhou spacecraft have made their returns since China first put a person in space in 2003, becoming only the third country do so after Russia and the United States.Chang'e 5 has revived talk of China one day sending a crewed mission to the moon and possibly building a scientific base there, although no timeline has been proposed for such projects.China also launched Its first temporary orbiting laboratory in 2011 and a second in 2016. Plans call for a permanent space station after 2022, possibly to be serviced by a reusable space plane.While China is boosting co-operation with the European Space Agency and others, interactions with NASA are severely limited by concerns over the secretive nature and close military links of the Chinese program."

Chinese sample return mission to the moon harkens back to 1960s lunar race | CBC Radio,Bob McDonald's blog: Robot mission will return first moon rocks since 1976,2020-11-27T19:50:56.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/radio/quirks/chinese-sample-return-mission-to-the-moon-harkens-back-to-1960s-lunar-race-1.5817888,"A Chinese robotic probe called Chang'e 5 is on its way to the moon where it will land, scoop up samples and return them to Earth. This is the first robotic sample return mission since Russian efforts in the 1960s. Those were an effort to make their mark on the lunar surface after their manned moon program failed.When Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin made their historic landing on the moon in July 1969, a secret Russian robotic probe called Luna 15 was there at the same time. It was an attempt to grab a sample of lunar soil and return it to Earth before the American astronauts got back. The Russians had lost the race to put humans on the moon, but were trying to grab a 'first' and master the moon robotically.Unfortunately, Luna 15 crashed during it's landing attempt and the opportunity for a propaganda coup was lost. However, their Luna 16 mission did successfully return about 100 grams of lunar soil a year later and two other sample return missions succeeded in following years, with the last one, Luna 24, in 1976 — two years after the Apollo program had ended. While these robotic sample return missions did not deliver as much lunar material as the Apollo astronauts, they were considerably cheaper and part of a long history of both Russian and American robotic lunar exploration involving dozens of impactors, orbiters, landers and rovers. In a way, we're in another moon race right now that echoes the race of fifty years ago — except this time it seems the robots might be in the lead. China is using robotic landers to explore the moon, and, if all goes well, Chang'e 5 will bring back several kilograms of moon rocks. In the meantime, the U.S. is struggling to develop a far more expensive effort, relying on huge (and much delayed) rockets that will carry humans to the moon with their Artemis program. It once again brings up the question of whether humans or robots are best suited to space exploration. We debated this on a special edition of Quirks & Quarks last year.Human missions are much more expensive, and historically they are much more politically driven than robotic exploration. The decision by the Kennedy administration in 1961 to send humans to the moon was part of the Cold War competition between the U.S. and Soviet Union to prove technical superiority over one another. The current Artemis program has also been politically influenced. Originally the plan was to first build a space station called Gateway in orbit around the moon. Once it was completed, astronauts would be sent down to the surface some time later this decade. When the Trump administration came to power, the landing was pushed forward to 2024, which would have been the last year of President Trump's second term in office. The Biden administration has not said whether it will keep to that tight schedule.NASA's giant new moon rocket, the Space Launch System (SLS) is slated to make its first flight next year. In the meantime three private companies — SpaceX, Blue Origin and Dynetics — have been contracted to develop lunar landers that would ride on their own rockets. But the pace of development in these programs makes NASA's current 2024 moon landing deadline pretty ambitious.Meanwhile, China is continuing its robotic program beyond the moon with the Tianwen 1 mission currently on its way to Mars. The spacecraft includes an orbiter and a lander, which will make China the third country to make a soft landing on Mars after Russia and the U.S. This is not a sample return mission, but it is not unreasonable to think that China could apply similar technology it is using on the moon to return samples from Mars in the future.Robots have always boldly gone where no one has gone before, exploring every planet in the solar system, as well as dwarf planets, moons, asteroids and comets. They conduct the initial reconnaissance of other worlds, survey the lay of the land and choose the best landing sites for humans who follow.  A whole fleet of robots are currently flying around the solar system. Two others are on their way to Mars with the United Arab Emirates' Hope mission and NASA's Perseverance lander scheduled to arrive in February.Beyond Mars, the Japanese Hayabusa2 and American, OSIRIS-REx spacecraft are bringing home samples they collected from asteroids. NASA is planning future missions to visit Europa, a moon of Jupiter and Titan, a mysterious moon of Saturn, the only moon with a thick atmosphere and liquid methane lakes on its surface.There is no doubt it will be a dramatic moment when the next human feet step out onto lunar soil again. Human exploration of space captures the imagination of the public, provides role models for young people and tests the limits of technical, physical and psychological endurance. But humans have not gone very far. The last mission to the moon was in 1972. It will still stretch the limits of our technology to get back there almost half a century later, Meanwhile, the true explorers of space, our silent mechanical servants, will continue their more far-reaching journeys to literally reach out and touch other worlds."
"McCallum says he tried to improve conditions for Kovrig, Spavor in Chinese prison | CBC News",One of Canada's most controversial ex-ambassadors to China says he repeatedly tried to improve the living conditions of Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor after their imprisonment in the People's Republic almost two years ago.,2020-11-25T01:09:05.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/chong-champagne-china-committee-1.5815179,"One of Canada's most controversial ex-ambassadors to China says he repeatedly tried to improve the living conditions of Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor after their imprisonment in the People's Republic almost two years ago. John McCallum also said Tuesday he regrets speaking about the October 2019 Canadian election in a meeting with Chinese officials in the months leading up to it. McCallum, the former Liberal cabinet minister who was fired as Canada's envoy to China in January 2019, was testifying at the special House of Commons committee on Canada-China relations. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau fired McCallum after he made a series of public comments that broke with the government's line following the arrests of Kovrig and Spavor. The two men were arrested nine days after Canada's arrest of Chinese high-tech scion Meng Wanzhou in December 2018 on a U.S. extradition warrant in what is widely viewed as retaliation by China. McCallum said that's when everything changed in Canada's relations with China. ""From that moment onwards, the top priority of the government and of myself as ambassador was to secure the release of the two Michaels,"" said McCallum, noting that he has been one of the few people to visit them in prison. ""On more than one occasion, I tried to convince the Chinese that if they were unable to release Kovrig and Spavor they should at least improve their living conditions. Sadly, as you all know, Canadian efforts in this area have so far been unsuccessful."" The committee has been examining Canada's relations with China, which have plummeted to an all-time low since December 2018.Earlier Tuesday, Conservative MP Michael Chong urged Foreign Affairs Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne to adopt a more consistent approach to getting tough with China. The Conservative foreign affairs critic told Champagne during a House of Commons committee meeting Tuesday that the government needs to show Canadians how it will deal with growing Chinese intimidation of Canadians within Canada. Chong said it is inconsistent for the government to be talking tougher on China, while Canada's current ambassador, Dominic Barton, is making speeches about the need to broaden trade with the People's Republic. ""I think it needs to be a lot clearer, a lot more consistent if Canada is going to have a clear, consistent voice with respect to China on the world stage,"" said Chong. Chong sponsored a motion that won approval in the Commons last week that calls on the government to decide within 30 days whether to allow China's Huawei Technologies to supply equipment for its next generation 5G internet network. Meng is a chief executive of Huawei. Champagne replied that Canada has taken a smart and firm approach with China lately that includes speaking out against its ill treatment of pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong and of ethnic Muslim Uighurs. ""Whether it comes to the Uighurs or whether it comes to Hong Kong, I've outlined places where we're going to challenge China, places where we're going to, for example, coexist with China,"" Champagne said."

What an Australian-style push against Chinese interference might look like | CBC News,"A motion brought by CPC foreign affairs critic Michael Chong, which passed Parliament last week, gives the government 30 days to come up with a plan — like Australia's — to fight foreign (Chinese) interference and influence campaigns. What might that look like and will it come to pass?",2020-11-24T09:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/china-canada-australia-espionage-1.5813364,"Some Australians see the country's new powers to stop foreign interference as an overdue shift from complacency to vigilance, while others have warned of the dangers of a McCarthyite moral panic.But all can agree that Australia's approach to foreign meddling in its politics, universities and public debate has changed a great deal in recent years.Last week, the Canadian House of Commons voted 179-146 for this country to adopt a plan similar to Australia's to counter meddling by the People's Republic of China.Experts in Canada and Australia suggest that such a change would set Canada on a much more aggressive path in countering China's inroads into this country's institutions.Conservative foreign affairs critic Michael Chong's motion requires the government to ""develop a robust plan, as Australia has done, to combat China's growing foreign operations here in Canada and its increasing intimidation of Canadians living in Canada, and table it within 30 days of the adoption of this motion.""Chong's motion received the support of most opposition members of the House, along with Liberals Wayne Easter, Nathaniel Erskine-Smith, John McKay and Jennifer O'Connell.Chong chose Australia as a model for Canada because of a package of laws passed in 2018 in the wake of a series of revelations that brought the issue of foreign interference and espionage to the fore.Sam Dastyari was an up-and-coming Labor Party senator when the year 2018 began. By the end of it he had admitted to soliciting thousands of dollars from businesses affiliated with the Chinese Communist Party. Thousands of Australians signed petitions demanding he face charges of treason.Australian media reports on Dastyari suggested he was a good investment for China. He not only supported Beijing's claims to the South China Sea — in opposition to the official position of his Labor Party — he also worked to prevent a meeting between his party leader and a Hong Kong pro-democracy activist.Dominique Dalla-Pozza teaches at the Centre for Military and Security Law at the Australian National University in Canberra (which itself allegedly has been a target of a massive Chinese intelligence operation). She said that for the past few years, the Australian Security Intelligence Organization (the ASIO — Australia's equivalent of Canada's CSIS) has been sounding the alarm about unprecedented levels of foreign intrusion.""ASIO said there were more foreign spies and their proxies operating in Australia than at the height of the Cold War,"" Dalla-Pozza said.In Canada, CSIS has been trying for years to draw Canadians' attention to foreign interference in everything from universities to municipal governments. Then-director Dick Fadden went public with such a warning in 2010. But Canada has seen no real legislative or organizational response.In Australia, by contrast, those warnings led the Turnbull government to introduce a new Espionage and Foreign Interference Act. Australia's laws don't single out China, the country's largest trading partner. When he introduced the bill in Parliament, then-PM Malcolm Turnbull was careful to cite other precedents, such as Russian meddling in the U.S. and French elections of 2016 and 2017. But there's no doubt in Australia about which foreign government is seen as the most active meddler. Over the last couple of months, Australia has raided the apartments of four Chinese journalists and revoked the visas of two Chinese academics.Dalla-Pozza said the law defines foreign interference as ""conduct that is engaged in concert with a foreign principal or a person that is acting on behalf of a foreign principal"" where ""the person engaging in the conduct is reckless as to whether it will influence government processes, or in other ways influence a democratic political right or duty.""Conduct has to be covert or involve deception, or involve a person making a threat to cause serious harm, or involve a person making a threat with menaces.""The new law produced its first arrest of a suspect two weeks ago: Di Sanh Duong, a prominent member of pro-Beijing Chinese-Australian organizations.The Turnbull government also brought in laws banning foreigners from donating to Australian politicians, placed new requirements on telecommunications companies to block foreign interference, and created a registry of critical infrastructure assets to provide more transparency on who really owns what in the country.And ""there are other mechanisms being developed in Australia that don't depend on the law,"" such as a new national coordinator, a public information campaign and a hotline, said Dalla-Pozza.""The act prescribes in a more focused way what is foreign interference, what is espionage, what is treason,"" said Patrick Walsh, who teaches at the Australian Graduate School for Policing and Security.Walsh said one of the most significant aspects of the law is that it allows Australia to fight back outside the courts.""The key is operational disruption of foreign interference, not just to collect information, but to disrupt it,"" he said.""In 2019 the PM established the Counter Foreign Interference Task Force, which is an interdepartmental task force to discover, track and disrupt foreign interference. And there was $8.7 million given to this task force.""The resources Australia devotes to this effort are not only centralized under a national coordinator, but are also far greater in terms of trained investigators than those available to the Government of Canada.Thirty days seems like a short time to design a full overhaul of Canada's approach to foreign interference, but Chong said Canada has a duty to protect people within its borders from harassment and intimidation by agents of foreign powers. ""It's long past time for the government to deal with this. Australia has already dealt with this. Our other allies have already dealt with this,"" he said. ""I note that on October 28, the FBI charged eight individuals, three of whom were Chinese citizens, for interfering and threatening American citizens through operations that are taking place on American soil.""The motion doesn't spell out any consequences for the government if it allows the 30 days to lapse. But Chong said that would be a harmful precedent given the strong cross-party support the motion received in Parliament.""I expect it to be carried out if the government follows democratic norms and respects the will of Parliament,"" he told CBC News.

The classes are focused on language, but there is also instruction in martial arts, dancing, choir and yoga.After a few weeks of lockdown, the group started to experiment with activities online using Zoom. ""We tried some cooking classes because it's one of the favourite things that we like to do,"" Mu said, adding that the feedback was positive.CBC News New BrunswickFollowing the success of the online cooking classes, Mu and the group started to move most of the courses online. She said it was still difficult not to be together in person, but the online classes were working, especially for teaching the language.Some courses, like martial arts, couldn't really translate online.The success of the online classes gave Mu and the group the confidence to start preparing for the Chinese New Year gala. They are planning to hold it online this year.This year's theme of the gala is ""We are family"" — a nod to the community staying together during the pandemic.Jenny Zhang, a longtime volunteer with the association, said it is important to make sure there's a show this year, even if it's not on stage.""We put lots of effort, and the people worked together,"" Zhang said. Normally the group would start rehearsing in September for the show that is in January or early February, depending on the Chinese New Year.Instead of spending the fall rehearsing, they are busy recording sessions outdoors while the weather is still nice. On Sunday, about 20 people met at Killarney Lake, on Fredericton's north side, to film the choir singing.""Actually, I feel very confident right now,"" Mu said after spending the morning filming a video with the choir.""We support each other,"" she said, adding that the volunteers are learning how to make the gala online as they go. ""I think we're going to make it — I hope so,"" she said.Mu said the Chinese New Year is too important to the community to risk not having a gala, even if it's different from other years.""It is the most traditional way we will celebrate our Chinese New Year. It's kinda the most important day for the Chinese. We want to keep that tradition."""

He said it's time for Canada and its closest allies to adopt a more aggressive posture.""The democratic world must acknowledge that the approach to China over the last two decades has not worked. In fact, the situation has gotten worse,"" O'Toole told reporters on Parliament Hill.He said the move to normalize relations and admit China to the World Trade Organization has had ""catastrophic impacts for Canadian workers.""""We falsely believed that ignoring the sharp edges of communism would, over time, smooth them out by putting trade ahead of our values.""Conservative MP Michael Chong, the party's foreign affairs critic, will table a motion today to put pressure on the Liberal government to ban Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei from building Canada's 5G network. Most of the country's wireless providers have opted already to work with Sweden-based Ericsson.Huawei's founder has close ties to China's communist leadership and intelligence partners have long warned that the company's technology could be used to spy on Canadians. O'Toole said Huawei's global success is due in part to ""years of industrial espionage"" against the now-defunct Canadian tech giant Nortel.Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Tuesday the government's final decision on Huawei will be based on the recommendations of Canada's intelligence agencies. ""We've worked with our allies and we've consulted broadly,"" he said.The former director of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS), Ward Elcock, has said Huawei and all Chinese technology firms like it pose a significant risk to worldwide intelligence collection.Watch: Bains says the federal government ""will not be bullied or intimidated by any country."":PoliticsThe Conservative motion, if passed, also would compel the Liberal government to develop a comprehensive plan to protect Canada from ""the growing influence of Chinese agents"" on our soil.O'Toole said Canada has tolerated the proliferation of Confucius Institutes — state-backed Chinese language centres — that push state propaganda.O'Toole said Canadian university professors have been bullied into weakening their teachings on human rights abuses for fear of offending mainland Chinese students, while pro-Beijing media outlets have disseminated anti-western narratives.""Canadians of Chinese origin have been threatened by foreign agents in our country. Anti-Hong Kong protests were organized in Canada to bully democracy activists. Uighur students in our universities have been de-platformed and menaced in coordinated actions led by Chinese consulates across our country,"" he said.""And the very values we hold dear, like openness, justice and tolerance, have been weaponized against us.""O'Toole pointed to Australia's foreign interference law as something to emulate here. That country passed legislation in 2018 to toughen penalties on espionage while also requiring individuals or organizations acting in the interests of foreign powers to register and disclose their ties — part of an effort to reduce meddling by China in Australia's politics, universities and media.Under the legislation, it is illegal for a person to knowingly engage in covert conduct or deception on behalf of a ""foreign principal."" The first arrest under this law was made earlier this month when a prominent Chinese-Australian community activist was accused of trying to influence the country's immigration minister.Speaking later in question period, Trudeau said Canada has a ""complex multi-dimensional relationship with China"" and the country deals with Beijing ""with eyes wide open.""""We will remain firm in defending our principles and interests and always will,"" he said, adding that Canada's security agencies have been working with universities and colleges to address new Chinese threats to those institutions.""Canada has among the best security agencies in the world. The folks who work for our agencies work every single day to keep Canadians safe. Not all of it appears in the newspapers. On the contrary, a lot of the work that is done in important situations is never heard about at all,"" he said.Watch: Conservative MP Michael Chong says the federal government is ""paralyzed by indecision"" on Huawei:PoliticsAsked if passing such a motion would further damage already shaky bilateral relations between Canada and China, O'Toole said that while he's concerned about the status of two Canadians held in Chinese prisons, the current government's approach hasn't yielded results.Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor have been held in China for 708 days. ""A weak response by Mr. Trudeau has not led to any progress in the case of the two Michaels,"" O'Toole said. ""A more principled, a stronger approach may make progress.""China has retaliated against countries that have criticized its behaviour through trade action. O'Toole said Canada shouldn't be intimidated by such threats.""Canada should work very closely with our Five Eyes allies ... so that it's difficult for China to use its immense economic size to intimidate smaller economies like Canada,"" O'Toole said, citing the intelligence-sharing alliance between Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the U.S.""We may be a smaller economy in comparison with China but we are a giant when it comes to the rights we hold dear, human rights, the rule of law and the security of our citizens.""O'Toole said Canada must strengthen its relationship with other Asian economies — Canada joined the Trans-Pacific Partnership in 2017 — and bolster trade with India. ""We need to look for new markets,"" he said.The motion comes days after the House of Commons subcommittee on international human rights released a report condemning China for committing genocidal acts against the Uighur Muslim minority. Canada's ambassador to the UN, Bob Rae, said Sunday he would encourage the body's human rights committee to probe the plight of China's Uighur population."

Canada's ties to China's military underscore the weird contradictions in its foreign policy | CBC News,It's been obvious for some time that there is something a little weird about the way Canada approaches its relationship with China — a disconnect brought into sharp relief this week by the news that Global Affairs and the Department of National Defence were not on the same page when it came to military ties and training involving the People’s Liberation Army.,2020-12-12T09:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canada-china-pla-peoples-liberation-army-1.5838658,"It's been obvious for some time that there is something weird about the way Canada approaches its relationship with China — a disconnect brought into sharp relief this week by the news that Global Affairs and the Department of National Defence were not on the same page when it came to military ties and training involving the People's Liberation Army.In some respects, the volcanic online political eruption which followed stories in The Globe and Mail and other media outlets, based on exclusive access to information documents, was predictable, as was the flurry of finger-pointing in the House of Commons on Thursday and Friday.Diplomats were alarmed when Gen. Jonathan Vance, the country's senior military commander, cancelled winter military exercises with the PLA in 2019, fretting that it might aggravate Beijing or make the lives of Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor even worse.It makes for fire-breathing memes, sizzling copy and wonderful political theatre.What's missing, though, is a recognition that Canada's policy toward a rising China has been contradictory and incoherent for almost a decade, maybe more, said Charles Burton, a political scientist at Brock University in St. Catharines, Ont. and a respected China expert at the Macdonald-Laurier Institute.""Cabinets were always split on China, whether it's Liberal or Conservative,"" Burton said, referring to debates more than three decades ago during the government of former prime minister Brian Mulroney.It is more urgent than ever, in the context of an increasingly belligerent and assertive China, to present a united political front, he added.""This is really about the defence of our sovereignty and security on matters over which there is consensus across the political spectrum in Canada,"" he said.Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan, in an attempt at political damage control late this week, made a point of saying that Chinese troops are no longer training for winter warfare at Garrison Petawawa, Ont.He also (rather meekly) noted that the exchange and training program with the PLA was instituted in August 2013 under the Conservatives while defence critic James Bezan, one of the most vocal and fiery opponents this week, was parliamentary secretary of defence.Bezan's retort was along the lines of that was then, this is now.""The defence minister knows full well that the Chinese government back then and the Chinese government today are completely different,"" Bezan said during question period on Thursday.It was a different time, no question.Chinese President Xi Jinping had taken office only a few months before, and the Department of National Defence (DND) tasking order that established the exchange program, obtained by CBC News under access to information, noted that working with the PLA ""complements the Government of Canada led efforts to broaden our bilateral relationship with China.""After years of hectoring and hammering China, the Conservatives — under former prime minister Stephen Harper — had decided that limited engagement was the way to go.And here is where Canada's curious incoherence comes into play.At precisely the moment the former chief of the defence staff, the now-retired general Tom Lawson, was penning the Canadian military's marching orders on closer cooperation with the PLA, the foreign affairs ministry — led at the time by John Baird — was firing off flares about China's unilateral declaration of an air defence zone in the East China Sea.It was a bellwether moment.""The U.S. has indicated deep concern over the establishment of the Chinese ADIZ stating that the U.S. views this development as a destabilizing attempt to alter the status quo in the region and that this move increases the risk of misunderstanding and miscalculations,"" said a Nov. 23, 2013 briefing note to Baird, obtained by CBC News in 2017.""More broadly, the rise of China is reshaping the strategic landscape.""Burton said the rise of President Xi marked the beginning of the new, more aggressive China. The establishment of the air zone — now largely forgotten against a backdrop of fortified artificial islands in the South China Sea, reports of Uyghurs in concentration camps and the haze of tear gas in Hong Kong — marked the first step.So were our politicians and senior leaders paying attention not only to events, but to what other federal departments were saying?According to what former foreign affairs minister (and current finance minister) Chrystia Freeland had to say in question period this week, the answer is yes.""I have long personal experience reporting on authoritarian communist regimes and I am very aware of the threat they pose,"" she said.Here's the question no one seemed to ask this week: why was the military exchange and training program still going on even before hostage diplomacy swept up the two Michaels?National Defence is no stranger to suspicions about China, having spent an enormous amount of time quietly defending itself from cyberattacks purportedly launched by  Beijing or by groups associated with it.The Trump administration has been tightening the screws on China from a diplomatic, security and trade perspective. There has been considerable, growing debate among Western allies — led by the Americans — about the downside of military engagement and co-operation with China, with Five Eyes intelligence partners each exchanging their own warnings — a series of discussions that eventually prompted Canada's current top military commander, Gen. Jonathan Vance, to cancel the winter warfare exercises.And then, of course, there's debate over the telecom giant Huawei and its future in this country.The signs were all there, Burton said — but no one actually woke up to the problem until Kovrig and Spavor were imprisoned. The public has been galvanized, he added, but ""it doesn't seem to have penetrated fully to the senior levels of the political and economic elite.""Burton said that — as weird as it might sound, with everything else that has happened — he believes there are some within the Canadian Establishment who still cling to the notion that if the ""consular cases of Spavor and Kovrig are resolved, we can go back"" to business as usual."

Chinese viewers pan Disney's new Mulan as inauthentic | CBC News,"The remake of Mulan drew decidedly mixed reviews in China after its coronavirus-delayed release in China last week, with thousands panning it online.",2020-09-17T15:37:10.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/chinese-viewers-pan-mulan-1.5727823,"The remake of Mulan struck all the right chords to be a hit in the key Chinese market. Disney cast beloved actor Liu Yifei as Mulan and removed a dragon sidekick popular in the animated original to cater to Chinese tastes.Still, the movie drew decidedly mixed reviews after its coronavirus-delayed release in China last week, with thousands panning it online.The movie was rated 4.9 out of 10 by more than 165,000 people on Douban, a leading website for film, book and music ratings. Negative comments and jokes about the film outnumbered positive reactions on social media.Mulan has earned an estimated 198 million yuan ($39 million Cdn) since its opening last week, and was the second most watched movie in China as of Thursday, according to ticketing platform Maoyan. It scored a higher 7.5 out of 10 on Maoyan, but also with mixed reviews.""Poor artistic level, misunderstanding of Chinese culture lead to the film's failure in China,"" the state-run Global Times newspaper tweeted.Chinese critics, both at home and abroad, said they were disappointed with the film's inaccurate and stereotypical portrayals of Chinese history and the main character, infused with nationalist tropes.Others were not as bothered.""It's fine that different screenwriters make up different stories,"" Zhang Qin, a military veteran, said after watching the film in Beijing last week. ""They can play with imagination and it's a good thing.""IT engineer Zhang Fan also had positive things to say about the film. ""What touched me is the humanity,"" he said.The remake of Disney's popular 1998 animation is based on the ancient tale of Hua Mulan, a young woman who takes her father's place in the army by dressing as a man.The animated version was a global hit but earned just $30 million in China, where viewers found the movie too Americanized, according to reports at the time.The original tale, The Ballad of Mulan, has gone through multiple renditions. Themes such as filial piety and being loyal to the central government have remained as core tenets, which some find outdated and problematic.""It's a very touchy subject in modern China because a lot of people find [filial piety] very constraining, including me,"" said Xiran Jay Zhao, the Chinese Canadian author of an upcoming book about the only female emperor in China. ""It's like a moral shackle for people.""Critics also pointed out inaccurate details such as the use of a southern-style house when Mulan is likely from the north and a depiction of ""qi"" as a magic power that only boys can wield — in Chinese philosophy, it is a force not limited by gender.Some called the makeup and costumes ugly and inauthentic.Zhao said the film comes off more like European fantasy than a Chinese story, and noted that the film's crew was mostly white, including the director, four screenwriters and costume designer.""They didn't really get any Chinese people on the writing staff, and it really showed,"" she said.Jeannette Ng, a Chinese fantasy writer based in the United Kingdom, said the film perpetuates a narrative of China's majority Han people that assimilates and excludes minorities including ethnic Mongolians, Tibetans and Uighurs.""The mainland Chinese people aren't the mainland Chinese viewers from 20 years ago,"" she said of the lukewarm response. ""The culture has moved on.""Her comments mirror the latest in a series of controversies that have hit the film outside mainland China.The movie's final credits thank propaganda departments and a public security bureau in Xinjiang, where part of it was filmed.China has come under widespread criticism for detaining Uighurs and other predominantly Muslim minorities in Xinjiang as part of a campaign to snuff out sometimes-violent struggle against Chinese rule.Earlier, a boycott movement was sparked after Liu, the actor who portrays Mulan, publicly supported Hong Kong police as they battled pro-democracy protesters last year.Hong Kong resident Sarah Chan said she does not plan to see the film, which opened in her city on Thursday.""The main actress ... supports Hong Kong police, so I don't want to watch it,"" Chan said. ""Furthermore, I think they changed the historical background of the story. It's not the same story anymore.""Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian defended Liu last week, calling her a ""Mulan of the modern times.""Disney did not reply to a request for comment."

China imposed the law on Hong Kong, which is supposed to have legal autonomy under the ""one country, two systems"" agreement.""If the Canadian side really cares about the stability and the prosperity in Hong Kong, and really cares about the good health and safety of those 300,000 Canadian passport holders in Hong Kong, and the large number of Canadian companies operating in Hong Kong … you should support those efforts to fight violent crimes,"" Cong said.Canada's deputy prime minister Chrystia Freeland said the ambassador's remarks were ""not in any way in keeping with the spirit of appropriate diplomatic relations between two countries."" Conservative Leader Erin O'Toole says that if Cong refuses to apologize, Canada should withdraw his diplomatic credentials.Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian defended Cong's remarks, saying Canadian leaders ""did not verify, but also condoned the anti-China comments spreading across the nation and made groundless accusations against China.""Edward Chin agrees with O'Toole. He is a Canadian hedge fund manager who lives and works in Hong Kong, and a longtime activist in the Hong Kong pro-democracy movement. Here is part of his conversation with As It Happens host Carol Off. Mr. Chin, how secure do you feel as a Canadian in Hong Kong right now?I think this [statement from the ambassador] is one of the so-called wolf warrior tactics they have been using over the last couple of years. But it kind of got escalated in the last little while.Do you feel secure since these remarks on the part of the [Chinese] ambassador? Even before this gentlemen's remarks, after the [national security law] came into effect, I don't think anyone would feel secure in Hong Kong because this is exactly one country, one system now. So how can anyone feel secure in Hong Kong?Because last year, every Hong Kong person, more than two million people, came out to fight very hard [against] the extradition bill that finally got retracted. Now, this is 10 times worse. This is the nuclear option that they think of.But this seems to have been in reaction to suggestions that Canada would offer asylum to people from Hong Kong, democracy activists who are feeling threatened by the … national security law since it came into place, and that this has been the way that Hong Kong [has reacted] to Canada's offer of asylum. Does that change things?I think Canada has done the right thing to give asylum to those demonstrators who came out and [fought] for democracy, because they were fighting for their life, basically.We have to go back a few months earlier. Why do people come up and protest? Because the two systems is gone. Now, the Chinese ambassador to Canada, you know, whatever he said is threatening. Threatening. This is outrageous, honestly. I think he should be reprimanded.China's ambassador in Ottawa was … warning against the granting asylum to Hong Kong dissidents, and he said, ""If the Canadian side really cares about the stability and the prosperity in Hong Kong and really cares about the good health and safety of those 300,000 Canadian passport holders in Hong Kong and the large number of Canadian companies operating Hong Kong, you should support those efforts to fight violent crimes."" And, of course, is referring to the national security law. Does that sound like a threat to you?Does it mean that they want to treat the Chinese-Canadians or Caucasian-Canadians in Hong Kong, just like the two Michaels, just to abduct them into China?They could just use any excuse and detain someone.I think that the Trudeau government, [Prime Minister] Justin Trudeau together with Chrystia Freeland, I think they should really have a strong statement saying, you know, like, ""This is a threat."" Because, you know, there are a lot of mainland students studying in Canada.Canada, they don't do the same type of threat. This is something really outrageous, and only like a totalitarian regime would do that, threatening people.Chrystia Freeland has spoken out in Canada. She has said this is not in the spirit of diplomatic relations … but the Opposition is saying that the government should go further, that in fact, they should demand the ambassador either apologize or leave the country, have his credentials pulled. Do you think that Canada should go that far?The opposition party is saying the right thing. Because definitely this Chinese ambassador … should definitely apologize.The Opposition leader, I agree with him. You know, they should do something to show that Canada is not one of the weakest Five Eyes countries. Because it's perceived that way, especially in Hong Kong.You have been an activist. You have been outspoken for years, even before this national security law came into effect, and as you point out, became something where people who speak out against China could be arrested, that free speech has been criminalized.... Are you concerned that they you might be targeted by the regime right now, given what they've said about Canada?Everyone could be targetted. I mean, we as Chinese-Canadians, we are in a very awkward situation now. Ethnically, I'm Chinese, so it is embarrassing to have a Chinese ambassador to Canada saying they will do some harm to Chinese people living in Hong Kong, whether I am Canadian or not. So they're saying they want to do something bad to their own people.I don't dislike China. I think it's a great country with a great civilization. But the CCP, the Chinese Communist Party, the way they treat their own people, is very questionable.And that's why [former Chinese leader] Deng Xiaoping promised the two systems until 2047. But now we are short-changed by 27 years.Can I just ask you, finally, do you think there will be many people in Hong Kong … the activists, will they be seeking asylum? Do you think they will ask to be refugees to Canada?I don't think there will be a massive exodus. But in terms of persecution, yes, definitely. Those people living in Hong Kong, whether they are Hong Kong permanent ID card holders or anyone in Hong Kong now, their situation is the same as if they were in mainland China. There's no difference. No doubt about it.Will you ever leave Hong Kong? Do you think that's something that you might have to do?Besides my investment business in hedge funds and all my other hedges, I'm a current affairs writer, a commentator. I think I want to wait until they put a gunpoint at someone's head; and I think that would be the time that we all should leave.And if they shut down, for instance, Apple Daily or some of the internet radio, or they arrest a lot of full-time political commentators, that's the time I think a lot of people should leave, and then the whole world should talk with the CCP and confront with them in a forceful way.Written by Sheena Goodyear with files from The Associated Press.

But human rights and pro-democracy advocates say Beijing's new national security law is undermining freedom in what is known as the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.""So if the Canadian side really cares about the stability and the prosperity in Hong Kong, and really cares about the good health and safety of those 300,000 Canadian passport holders in Hong Kong, and the large number of Canadian companies operating in Hong Kong SAR, you should support those efforts to fight violent crimes,"" Cong said.Cong also flatly rejected Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's assertion that China is engaging in coercive diplomacy by imprisoning two Canadian men in retaliation for the arrest of a Chinese high-tech executive on an American extradition warrant. Meng Wanzhou is living under house arrest in Vancouver while her case wends through a British Columbia court.In December 2018, China imprisoned Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor and charged them with undermining the country's national security. Cong said they are still undergoing a legal process in China but did not provide further details.He repeated his government's demand that Canada release Meng immediately but insisted her case and his government's prosecution of Kovrig and Spavor are not linked.""We will remain absolutely committed to working with our allies to ensure that China's approach of coercive diplomacy, its arbitrary detention of two Canadian citizens, alongside other citizens of other countries around the world, is not viewed as a successful tactic by them,"" Trudeau said earlier this week as the two countries marked 50 years of relations at one of the lowest points in Canada-China bilateral relations.Cong said Canada's efforts to get other countries to join its fight for Kovrig and Spavor is ""doomed to fail.""The European Union raised concerns about the two Canadians by name in the communique summarizing its recent summit with China.""We oppose any remarks that interfere in our internal affairs. And I would like to point out, there is no coercive diplomacy on the Chinese side,"" Cong said."

"I want my baby to grow up proud of her heritage. But with rising anti-Chinese racism, I'm struggling | CBC Radio",Lisa Xing wants to raise her child with pride in her Chinese heritage in spite of a surge in anti-Chinese racism due to COVID-19.,2020-10-03T09:01:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/radio/docproject/from-afar-1.5710871/i-want-my-baby-to-grow-up-proud-of-her-heritage-but-with-rising-anti-chinese-racism-i-m-struggling-1.5710879,"My parents immigrated to Canada from China in their thirties. I came when I was five. So I thought they would be honoured when I bestowed upon them the responsibility of giving their granddaughter a name. A Chinese name. To my surprise (and dismay), I realized just how much they were against this child having a Chinese name. They said the first name should be easy to pronounce.Finally, after my daughter was born on September 29, 2020, my partner Nathan and I settled on Minmin, pronounced ""Ming Ming"". The first Min means ""fall"", the second Min, ""easygoing"" and ""gentle"". It was my mom's suggestion, after she gave in to my pleas.Not only do I think it's user friendly, it's beautiful written in Chinese as 旻旼. Both words using the same two radicals (parts that form a character), just rearranged differently. The choice of my child's name is just one way I am trying to instill a sense of pride in her Chinese heritage. I want her to embrace it, even though anti-Chinese racism has been on the rise since COVID-19.My partner, Nathan, is white. He grew up on a tobacco farm in southwestern Ontario. Our baby is biracial. Throughout the pregnancy, we often talked about how she would look, how I'll manage to get her to speak Mandarin (as I am just a basic speaker myself), and the responsibility of choosing a name that would inevitably play a role in shaping her identity. But although we went ahead and named her Minmin, the current social and political climate has wedged some fear into my mind. It's not treatment from kids on the playground that worries me. It's the recent resurgence of racism that is different to the kind of intolerance I experienced as a child. Trump calls COVID-19 the ""China virus."" And since the coronavirus outbreak, there has been widespread racism against Chinese people, since the virus originated in Wuhan, China. I hate to say it, but in this context, something as superficial as looking more ""white"" or having an English name could spare my daughter a lot of pain. While I know she could get by easier by blending in, this hate also stirred up a defiance in me that made me want to instill that pride in being Chinese even more, so she can have a bulletproof attitude, as Nathan says, and so that none of it will bother her the way it bothered me. I wasn't always called ""Lisa."" My Chinese name is Yaxi (pronounced Ya-shee). That's what I went by as a child growing up in Hamilton, Ont. Everyone butchered it, intentionally or otherwise. Some called me ""Taxi"" or ""Yucky"". So the summer before high school, my best friend – who also had a difficult-for-North-Americans-to-pronounce name, Yiqing – and I decided to change our names. After fighting with my parents to let me change mine to ""Melanie,"" a cringe-worthy homage to Mel B of the Spice Girls, I finally relented and we went with ""Lisa,"" the English name my dad had chosen for me when I first came to Canada. Yiqing chose ""Myra."" The name change took some getting used to, though ultimately, it made life easier. But some time after university, I started realizing just how unique my Chinese name was: Ya, the last part of my mom's name, and Xi, which means ""dawn."" After my own experiences, and the ensuing struggle with my parents over my daughter's name, I hope Minmin will embrace it. I want her to be defiant and proud and confident. And I hope she won't take as long as I did to get there.  "

But, with a new bridge in sight, a group of Chinese-Canadian veterans are calling on the government to come up with a new name representative of the diverse people living across the province.King Wan, the president of Chinese-Canadian Veterans Unit 280 said ""when premier Pattullo was running the province [in 1937], it was a very dark time for ethnic people.""He said the name brings with it a sad and destructive past and reminds Chinese Canadians about a premier who they say wanted to block the Chinese community from making Canada its home and having the right to be franchised and able to vote.""Perhaps we should name that bridge under a different name to honour those who came, I guess, you know, in the last century that have made a lot of contributions to the province,"" Wan said.He said it's time to put history in the past, and while he will not push to change the name of the current bridge, he'd like to see a new name on the new bridge that is set to start construction later this year.""I'm not suggesting it be a Chinese name or whatever .. but maybe consider it being voted on by the citizens in the area,"" Wan said.New Wesminster NDP candidate Jennifer Whiteside, said she's not married to the Pattullo name for the new bridge. ""It would be entirely appropriate to look for a new name that reflects the diversity of the community, a name the community can celebrate. Yeah, I think that would be wonderful,"" Whiteside said.She said she would rely on the independent processes that exist already to address naming of major infrastructure projects, which would take into account the feelings of the community.On the other side of the Pattullo Bridge, Surrey-Whalley Liberal candidate Shaukat Khan said the name change is one he'd also support opening to consultation.""As far as I'm concerned, we should always be engaging with our communities and taking input on all [of] the projects.Both parties are in agreement a name change wouldn't be off the table, but a consultation process would be necessary to decide the correct one.Wan said he'd like to see a vote by community members.""A new bridge, a new beginning, a new era, it will really help strengthen our local population to be more inclusive,"" Wan said.The project for the new bridge is set to start later this year and carry through until 2023. The $1.4-billion project will see a new four-lane bridge built with wider lanes connecting Surrey and New Westminster."

Druh Farrell, who brought the motion forward after requests from the Chinese community.""And the fact that the park and parkade are directly across the corner … is frankly an affront to the neighbourhood of Chinatown.""As a lawyer for the Anti-Chinese League, he petitioned city commissioners to prohibit Chinese Canadians from establishing the current location of Chinatown, claiming that Chinese residents would lower the property values.He instead pushed to segregate Chinese Calgarians as you would ""an isolated hospital.""The motion also requests the mayor write the Calgary Board of Education to encourage the board to change the name of James Short Memorial School.""This year Calgary Chinatown is celebrating its 110-year anniversary. Renaming the park and the parkade ... is the right approach,"" reads a letter signed by Grace Su, Terry Wong and other members of the Chinatown Business Improvement Area.""Through research, documentation and recording this blight of history in the form of a permanent plaque is appropriate as this will ensure the history will not be forgotten and not be repeated. The selection of a new name through community engagement will allow the culture and contributions of Calgary's Chinese society to be honoured and revered respectfully.""The Calgary Community Chinatown Association also wrote in support of the motion. A new name will be chosen with community input, with particular consideration of names recognizing historical Chinese Canadian contributions to Calgary.The motion passed 14-1, with the sole vote against, Coun. Diane Colley-Urquhart, voicing that she doesn't want the city to ""fall into cancel culture."" Colley-Urquhart brought up a motion arising to revise the city's naming policy, to avoid names that are ""divisive in nature"" in future, and to develop a process to reevaluate requests to change current names, in consultation with the city's anti-racism committee once that committee is operational. In 2017, Calgary voted to rename Langevin Bridge as Reconciliation Bridge, replacing the name of one of the architects of the infamous residential school system. "

Hong Kong police arrest at least 60 after pro-democracy protest on Chinese holiday | CBC News,Hong Kong police arrested at least 60 people on suspicion of unauthorized assembly on China's National Day holiday Thursday after crowds gathered on the streets of a popular shopping district chanting pro-democracy slogans.,2020-10-01T15:58:48.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/hong-kong-police-arrest-protest-china-holiday-1.5745990,"Hong Kong police arrested at least 60 people on suspicion of unauthorized assembly on China's National Day holiday Thursday after crowds gathered on the streets of a popular shopping district chanting pro-democracy slogans.Those arrested included two district councillors, police said in a statement posted on Facebook. They said the people were arrested after they ignored repeated warnings asking them to disperse.Online calls urged people to join protests, and crowds turned up at Hong Kong's Causeway Bay shopping district, some people chanting ""Disband the police"" and ""Liberate Hong Kong, Revolution of our time,"" a popular pro-democracy slogan that has been banned by the Hong Kong government for alleged secessionist sentiments.A heavy police presence outnumbered the protesters at the scene.WATCH | Dozens arrested in Hong Kong after anti-government protest:WorldNational Day, which celebrates the founding of the People's Republic of China, has become a day of protest in Hong Kong by those who oppose Beijing's increasing control over the semi-autonomous region. Large-scale protests are forbidden because of physical distancing restrictions due to the coronavirus.In the afternoon, police cordoned off some areas in the district and searched people on the streets. On several occasions, they unfurled warning banners that urged protesters to disperse, saying they were participating in an illegal assembly.Protests against the Hong Kong and mainland Chinese governments swelled last year, and Beijing clamped down on expressions of anti-government sentiment in the city with a new national security law that took effect June 30.The law outlaws subversive, secessionist and terrorist activity, as well as collusion with foreign powers to interfere in the city's internal affairs. The U.S. and Britain accuse China of infringing on the city's freedoms, and the U.S. has imposed sanctions on government officials in Hong Kong and China over the law.At a National Day reception, Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam said ""stability has been restored to society while national security has been safeguarded"" under the new law.Lam also accused some foreign governments of holding ""double standards"" and levelling unjustified accusations against the authorities who implement the new law."
Chinese dairy investor pressed Canada to 'mitigate the risk' of new NAFTA | CBC News,"Executives of the Chinese infant formula manufacturer that’s building a new $332 million plant in Kingston, Ont. contacted Canadian officials to complain about the new NAFTA agreement within days of the agreement being reached — and asked for help in mitigating the harm caused by Canada's concessions.",2020-09-29T08:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/monday-feihe-nafta-atip-1.5739152,"Less than three weeks after talks concluded on the revised North American free trade agreement, executives from a Chinese infant formula manufacturer that had invested $332 million to build a new plant in Kingston, Ont. asked for a sudden meeting with Canadian officials.Zhiwen Yang, the general manager of Canada Royal Milk — the Canadian subsidiary of China Feihe Limited — wrote to then-Agriculture Minister Lawrence MacAulay and the Liberal MP for Kingston and the Islands, Mark Gerretsen, describing how Canada's concessions in the Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement (CUSMA) put his business plans in jeopardy by limiting how much cow's milk formula it can export and dismantling the dairy ingredient pricing system.Yang asked the federal government to ""mitigate the risks to the project."" His three-page letters, dated Oct. 16, 2018, were released to CBC News under the Access to Information Act.A few days later, Feihe International Inc. ""respectfully"" asked the president of the Canadian Food Inspection Agency and another senior government official to meet for 90 minutes on Oct. 29 with Yang and his boss, Feihe International chair Youbin Leng, who was travelling to Canada with his directors of research and regulatory affairs.""The purpose of the meeting is to discuss the regulatory framework in China and explore how we can work together. The expectation is not for a decision to be made, but to begin a conversation,"" said the email from Carey Bidtnes, Canada Royal Milk's human resources manager, who was part of the team that worked on bringing this investment to Canada during her previous employment with the Kingston Economic Development Corporation. Bidtnes said that Canada Royal Milk was working with Health Canada and the CFIA to ""resolve a challenge"" with exporting its formula.The documents reveal that the financial stakes for Feihe were higher by the fall of 2018 than they were in 2017, when CBC News reported on the potential international trade issues triggered by Feihe's plans to export the vast majority of the infant formula it manufactures in Canada back to Chinese consumers.As construction began, the Chinese investment was pegged at $225 million. A year later, the investment was estimated at $332 million and project proponents were predicting it would bring 277 direct full-time jobs to the region once production ramps up. A further 300 construction jobs have been created in the Kingston area and the plant is expected to generate the equivalent of over 1,000 more jobs in its eventual supply chain.Chinese companies have a deeper relationship with China's central government than private sector firms in North America do with their own national governments. Feihe is listed on the Hong Kong stock exchange, but its subsidiary, Canada Royal Milk, is incorporated in Canada.The investment — the largest foreign direct investment in Ontario agriculture in the last decade — was finalized with officials from the Canadian Dairy Commission during a 2016 visit to Canada by Chinese Premier Li Keqiang.American officials were monitoring this Chinese investment. President Donald Trump — and the powerful U.S. farm lobby — regard Canada's supply management system as ""unfair"" because it blocks most American dairy from Canada's domestic market.In the CUSMA, Canada agreed to several concessions that harm its dairy industry — including strict limits, enforced by new export charges, on international exports of infant formula and skim milk.CUSMA's export limit for cow's milk formula is lower than what Feihe originally planned to produce in Kingston, according to a presentation obtained three years ago by CBC News.Newly released government talking points say Canadian negotiators ""were in contact with a number of individuals with direct knowledge of the proposed facility's operations,"" including the Kingston Economic Development Corporation, ""to ensure negotiators had a thorough understanding of the intended operation … with a view to avoiding unintended impacts.""It's the same response CBC News got in 2018 when it asked whether Canada's NAFTA renegotiation team spoke directly to Feihe about its plans before signing off.Another concession Canada agreed to in the CUSMA talks dismantled part of its dairy pricing regime, ending lower ingredient pricing that kept processors competitive. Canada's prices are now based on American rates.When Feihe agreed to invest in Ontario, Canada's lower ingredient price was part of its forecasts.Xinhua, the Chinese news agency, reported that then-foreign affairs minister Chrystia Freeland spoke to Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi to brief him within days of concluding CUSMA negotiations.But if the two ministers discussed the dairy concessions, they apparently didn't resolve the manufacturer's concerns because the documents show that, within days of that conversation, Feihe began its own outreach to the Canadian government.Earlier presentations of Canada Royal Milk's business plans didn't mention producing and exporting skim milk powder for the adult market. But this letter to MacAulay said the company would produce skim powder for export during a ""ramp up"" period of testing the new facility. Canada already has a significant surplus of skim milk powder, left over after meeting Canada's strong demand for butter. Making baby formula at this new plant was supposed to help use up this surplus, not exacerbate it.The global market for skim is crowded and ultra-competitive, with American farmers hostile to any threats. Under the World Trade Organization's Nairobi Agreement, Canada agreed to stop exporting skim milk products as of January 2021.""The export cap is a very serious issue for the operations of the company for 2019 and 2020,"" the letter from general manager Yang to then-minister MacAulay said, ""and we believe it will hinder the growth of the entire industry in the future.""In its correspondence, Feihe asked for assurances that its facility had the support of all levels of government. It also requested ""reasonable quota"" so it could take maximum advantage of the tariff-free exports that would be allowed under the CUSMA, including a ""guarantee that the full annual export quota for infant formula would be assigned to Canada Royal Milk.""Canada is allocating its export quota for skim milk powder based on processors' past production. But for infant formula, export quota was distributed according to planned production — presumably to accommodate the new plant coming online.""Currently, details on which entities have received an allocation for the dairy export thresholds are not public,"" Jean-Sébastien Comeau, a spokesperson for Agriculture Minister Marie-Claude Bibeau, told CBC News.In a question redacted from one document released to CBC News but repeated without redaction in another, Yang also asked the government if it would ""take steps to limit the licensing of new infant formula manufacturing in Canada.""While that appears to be anti-competitive behaviour, no other Canadian dairy processor has shown interest in making infant formula in recent years — which is why Canada pursued the Chinese investment in the first place.On the demise of ingredient pricing, ""it's unclear how this will impact our operations in the medium to long term,"" Yang's letter to MacAulay said.""Our team has already been contacted by U.S. dairy producers who are eager to sell their products to us,"" the letter continues.""What has the government proposed to assist dairy processors to overcome the loss of [ingredient] pricing?""The letter sent to MP Gerretsen repeated the same demands.Although Bibeau announced funding for dairy producers harmed by trade deals with the European Union and Pacific Rim countries in the days leading up to the 2019 federal election, the industry is still waiting for the compensation it was promised when NAFTA was replaced.It's unclear whether Canada Royal Milk would be eligible for compensation but the Chinese investment has qualified for other federal and provincial support programs.If Feihe believes its investment was harmed by Canada's concessions, it could sue for damages under the 2012 Canada–China Foreign Investor Protection Agreement, which was negotiated by the previous Conservative government.""The sued country can opt not to make public anything until an arbitration award,"" Osgoode Hall law professor and investment treaty specialist Gus Van Harten said, noting this agreement is unique in this regard.International Trade Minister Mary Ng's spokesperson Ryan Nearing said ""there has been no dispute launched against Canada under the Canada-China FIPA to date, nor notification of an intention to do so.""In an interview with CBC, MP Gerretsen said he passed on the requests he received from the company to officials at Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada. But he said the only formal encounter he's had with Canada Royal Milk was a tour of the construction site in his riding earlier in 2018.""A number of the issues that were in their letter I believe have been addressed,"" he said.In departmental email, one bureaucrat called Yang's correspondence ""an interesting letter indeed.""Before federal government officials met with the Chinese, two senior officials from Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's office, Brian Clow and Simon Beauchemin, joined an ""urgent briefing"" with MacAulay's office — an ""additional twist,"" another bureaucrat called it.""The Chairman is in Canada in the context of making more investment,"" a senior official said. The request to meet with the president of the CFIA was ""in the context of the application for export,"" he said, ""which may not be the full reality.""Comeau, Bibeau's spokesperson, tells CBC the Kingston facility now has its licence to export from the CFIA.The Canadian Dairy Commission originally hoped an investor like Feihe could build a second facility, perhaps in Western Canada. But now, the government ""is not in discussion with Canada Royal Milk about additional future investments,"" Comeau said.Earlier plans obtained by CBC News suggested Kingston facility would be exporting by now. Bidtnes told CBC News its production lines are complete and it is pleased with the results of its test batches.""Timelines for beginning commercial production have been stretched into the fall due to the impact of COVID-19 on some regulatory processes,"" she said, adding that the company remains ""confident in our business plans and the support we have received from all levels of government."""

Kazakhstan rejects Chinese warning over pneumonia outbreak | CBC News,Kazakhstan's health officials on Friday dismissed a Chinese claim that the Central Asian country is facing an outbreak of pneumonia more deadly than the new coronavirus.,2020-07-10T15:32:20.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/pneumonia-kazakhstan-1.5644849,"Kazakhstan's health officials on Friday dismissed a Chinese claim that the Central Asian country is facing an outbreak of pneumonia more deadly than the new coronavirus.The Kazakh denial follows a notice issued Thursday by the Chinese Embassy that warned its citizens about an outbreak of pneumonia in the ex-Soviet nation with a death rate higher than that from coronavirus-induced pneumonia.""This information doesn't conform to reality,"" Kazakhstan's Health Ministry said in a statement.It said that the country's statistics on pneumonia include patients who tested negative for the coronavirus but had symptoms compatible with the COVID-19 illness.According to official data, the number of pneumonia cases has increased by 55 per cent in the first half of the year, compared with the same period in 2019 — from 63,436 to 98,546.However, Health Minister Alexei Tsoi said at a briefing Thursday, mortality from pneumonia this year fell from last year's levels — from 1,780 deaths in the first half of 2019 to 1,172 in the first half of 2020.The ministry said its tallies of bacterial, fungal and viral pneumonia infections, which also included cases of unclear causes, were in line with World Health Organization guidelines.The energy-rich Central Asian nation quickly introduced regional lockdown and travel restrictions to stem the COVID-19 pandemic, but it has faced a rise in infections after it lifted the restrictions in May.In late June, Kazakh President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev fired the nation's health minister, blaming him for flaws that helped trigger a second wave of contagion.Kazakh authorities have imposed a two-week nationwide lockdown starting Sunday to contain the COVID-19 outbreak.The country so far has registered over 53,000 cases, including 264 deaths.Asked to comment on Kazakhstan's denial of the Chinese Embassy's claim, China's Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian refrained from comment, saying that Beijing hopes to receive more information.""China looks forward to continuing co-operation with Kazakhstan to jointly fight the epidemic and safeguard public health in both countries,"" he said.WATCH | Pneumonia in Kazakhstan likely related to COVID-19: WHOMike Ryan, head of the WHO's emergencies program, told journalists on Friday that the cases in Kazakhstan are on WHO's radar.Given the country's surge in COVID-19 cases in the last seven days, there's a likely explanation, he said.""The upward trajectory of COVID-19 in the country would suggest that many of these cases are in fact undiagnosed cases of COVID-19,"" Ryan said.Ryan said WHO is keeping an open mind and teams will checks for false negative COVID-19 tests and X-ray patterns.Clusters of atypical pneumonia can occur at any time from other causes such as bacteria that present as Legionnaires' disease or influenza."

Taiwan scrambles fighters as Chinese jets again fly near island | CBC News,"Taiwan's air force scrambled jets for a second consecutive day on Saturday as multiple Chinese aircraft approached the island and crossed the sensitive midline of the Taiwan Strait, with the island's government urging Beijing to ""pull back from the edge.""",2020-09-19T09:08:01.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/china-taiwan-fighter-jets-1.5731034,"Taiwan's air force scrambled jets for a second consecutive day on Saturday as multiple Chinese aircraft approached the island and crossed the sensitive midline of the Taiwan Strait, with the island's government urging Beijing to ""pull back from the edge.""Taiwan's defence ministry said 19 Chinese aircraft were involved, one more than in the previous day, with some crossing the Taiwan Strait midline and others flying into Taiwan's air defence identification zone off its southwest coast.It said China, which claims democratic Taiwan as its own territory, sent 12 J-16 fighters, two J-10 fighters, two J-11 fighters, two H-6 bombers and one Y-8 anti-submarine aircraft. According to a map the ministry provided, none got close to mainland Taiwan itself or flew over it.""ROCAF scrambled fighters, and deployed air defence missile system to monitor the activities,"" the ministry said in a tweet, referring to the Republic of China Air Force, the formal name of Taiwan's air force.Taiwan has complained of repeated incidents of Chinese aircraft near the island this year, and has regularly had to scramble its F-16s and other jets to intercept them.China had on Friday announced at a news conference in Beijing about China's UN peacekeeping efforts combat drills near the Taiwan Strait, and denounced what it called collusion between the island and the United States.U.S. Undersecretary for Economic Affairs Keith Krach arrived in Taipei on Thursday for a three-day visit, the most senior State Department official to come to Taiwan in four decades, angering China. He left Saturday afternoon, according to Taiwan's foreign ministry.Taiwan's defence ministry, in a separate statement, said China was carrying out provocative activities, seriously damaging peace and stability.""The defence ministry sternly condemns this, and calls on the mainland authorities to control themselves and pull back from the edge.""China's widely read state-backed tabloid the Global Times, published by the ruling Communist Party's official People's Daily, said in a Saturday editorial that Friday's drills were a rehearsal to take over Taiwan.""The U.S. and Taiwan must not misjudge the situation, or believe the exercise is a bluff. Should they continue to make provocations, a war will inevitably break out,"" it said.Both sides need to resume dialogue to reduce the risk of war, Johnny Chiang, leader of Taiwan's main opposition party the Kuomintang, wrote on his Facebook page.""People who are willing to play a communication role are stigmatized and people who clamour for war are regarded as heroes. Such an atmosphere is definitely not conducive to the peaceful and stable development of the Taiwan Strait,"" said Chiang, whose party traditionally favours close ties with China.Life has continued as normal in Taiwan with no sign of panic. The island has long been accustomed to living with Chinese threats.Taiwan's people have shown no interest in being ruled by autocratic China, re-electing President Tsai Ing-wen in a landslide last year on what was largely a platform of standing up to Beijing.The latest Chinese flights came the same day Taiwan held a memorial service for former president Lee Teng-hui, dubbed ""Mr. Democracy"" for ending autocratic rule in favour of free elections and championing Taiwan's separate identity from China.Lee, who died in July, became Taiwan's first democratically elected president in March 1996 after eight months of intimidating war games and missile tests by China in waters around the island.Those events brought China and Taiwan to the verge of conflict, prompting the United States to send an aircraft carrier task force to the area in a warning to Beijing's government."

Sino-U.S. relations have plummeted ahead of November's U.S. presidential election.Chinese fighter jets briefly crossed the mid-line of the Taiwan Strait last month as the U.S. Health Secretary Alex Azar was in Taipei, and last week China carried out two days of large-scale drills off Taiwan's southwestern coast.The United States, like most countries, only has official ties with China, not Taiwan, though Washington is the island's main arms supplier and most important international backer.This week, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations had lunch with Taiwan's top envoy in New York. China's U.N. mission said it had lodged ""stern representations"" over the meeting."

The price exceeds a benchmark set only last month for Chinese oil paintings when Danshui by Taiwanese artist Chen Chengbo fetched more than $5 million at a Sotheby's event.Xu Beihong created Slave and Lion during his stay in Berlin during the early 1920s. It depicts the story of Roman slave Androclus, who pulled thorn from a lion's paw. His act of kindness inspires the Roman emperor to free him.The work blends Western form and subject with Chinese line drawing touches.Five months ago, another Xu painting— Silly Old Man Moves a Mountain— sold in Beijing for $4.35 million.Christie's sale of more than 2,000 Chinese works of art and objects from the 20th Century was a goldmine, with buyers and collectors snapping up pieces beyond their estimated bid price.Another major work, Potted Chrysanthemum in a Blue and White Jardiniere by Sanyu, went for $4.25 million.Ken Yeh, the deputy chairman of Christie's Asia, said there's pent-up demand for art from the new wealthy class in Asia, whose bank accounts are brimming with cash from a bullish stock market.""There's just too much money around. People are just eager to buy,"" Yeh said prior to Sunday's bidding.He added thatthe newly-rich see art as a valuable asset.Last week, Hong Kong real estate tycoon Joseph Lau, paid $17.4 million for pop artist Andy Warhol's iconic portrait of China's Mao Zedong.Yeh said at least one out of four buyers at Christie's auctions are Chinese and that number is rising.Christie's estimates Hong Kong is the world's third most important art market after New York and London."

Chinese tabloid blasts Canada over lobster dispute | CBC News,Communist Party media in China rebuked and threatened Nova Scotia lobster shippers this week for expressing concerns over new roadblocks to getting products into China.,2020-06-25T09:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/chinese-state-media-global-times-lobster-dispute-canada-1.5626025,"Communist Party media in China rebuked and threatened Nova Scotia lobster shippers this week for expressing concerns over new roadblocks to getting products into China.The party tabloid Global Times says recent border measures are about food safety after a COVID-19 outbreak was linked to a Beijing food market, ""rather than an excuse to target any specific country.""""It's Canada's choice to export to China, and Canada needs to abide by Chinese regulations, which may be adjusted when necessary in accordance with the COVID-19 situation,"" Bai Ming, a research fellow at the Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Co-operation, told the Global Times on Monday.The tabloid, known for its nationalist tone on international issues, discounted complaints raised by Canadian lobster shippers quoted in CBC News reporting.It also linked the issue to the arrest in Canada and ongoing extradition proceedings against Huawei chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou.""Experts warned that the Canadian side should be fully aware that its attitude in Meng's case is the only roadblock between the two countries,"" it said. ""If the Canadian side does not remove it, a disruption in the lobster trade might be just the tip of the iceberg in bilateral trade, as fraught ties have already undermined confidence in business communities on both sides.""Chinese authorities began random testing of imported food after a COVID-19 outbreak earlier this month was traced to a cutting board used on imported Atlantic salmon at the Xinfadi market in Beijing.Live lobster shipments from Canada, valued at $457 million last year, were particularly vulnerable.Most of that lobster comes from Nova Scotia, which has seen its sales in China soar in recent years.After the inspections started, some Nova Scotia companies cancelled live shipments rather than risk delays of up to 36 hours waiting for test results when the perishable product arrives.Exporters must now also sign a Chinese customs declaration assuming liability if COVID-19 is detected.Obsorne Burke of Victoria Co-op Fisheries in Cape Breton, which ships frozen lobster to China, refused to sign.He's leery of the Chinese legal system and dubious about the risk of the coronavirus, citing public health agencies in Canada and elsewhere that say there is no scientific evidence the virus is transmitted by food or food packaging.""We have to take a stand or push back and say this does not make any scientific sense,"" he said.The Global Times said exporters should get over it.""The newly adopted requirements for coronavirus-free declarations apply to all suppliers across the world and all food products,"" it said in a front page editorial this week, one of two articles devoted to the issue of Canadian lobster shipments.The tabloid hit back at reaction from Canadian lobster exporters quoted by CBC.""A major Chinese salmon importer told the Global Times on Monday that all of its suppliers are co-operative and willing to sign the declaration as they 'want to do business with China,'"" Global Times reported.""The company said, compared with Canada, it prefers to do business with countries like Chile, which has a mature, industrialized industry chain and is also co-operative with and respectful of Chinese regulations.""The question of whether lobster shippers should sign a declaration that assumes some form of liability for COVID-19 in China has split the Nova Scotia lobster industry.Some exporters have agreed to sign the declaration, others have not.The Nova Scotia Seafood Alliance has lawyers from the Atlantic Canadian law firm Cox Palmer reviewing the document and drafting a declaration shippers could send to customers in China that asserts the safety of the product without assuming liability.  The industry group says there is no consensus among members at this point for a unified response.The Global Times article challenged those who have opted not to sign.""Since the Canadian exporters are so confident about their management, why don't they have the courage to sign the declaration,"" Bai asked, noting that Canada ought to understand, ""China has such a regulation only because there is a risk of the virus spreading.""The Trudeau government avoided taking a stand when asked by the Nova Scotia government whether exporters should sign the declaration.Global Affairs Canada said since the customs demand was delivered by Chinese companies ""to the industry from industry,"" the Canadian Food Inspection Agency is leaving it to individual exporters to decide whether they sign.""It's absolutely not acceptable,"" said Chris d'Entremont, a Nova Scotia Conservative Member of Parliament.D'Entremont said the federal government should explain to industry exactly what accepting liability might mean.""We should be understanding through CFIA what exactly the implications are going to be here. To accept a certain liability is one thing on your product, but a liability for the spread of a virus is something completely different. I think this is a humongous overreach by China,"" he said.The Chinese embassy in Ottawa did not respond to a request for comment from CBC News."

Another message was spray painted in front of the building on May 19.The Chinese Consulate General turned over surveillance video captured by closed-circuit TV to police, who have released images of the suspects.The graffiti included the phrase ""China Virus."" There have been reports of increased racism and hate-motivated crimes targeting the Chinese community and people of Asian descent during the coronavirus pandemic.""The pandemic has led to a lot of political debate and strong views, and people are obviously free to hold whatever view they wish,"" said Const. Craig Collins, hate crimes co-ordinator with the Calgary police. ""But when people are targeting others for ill treatment or committing crimes because of those views, we have a duty to get involved.""Police said there has been a slight increase in incidents targeting those groups.""Generally, we have not seen the same spike in hate crimes that some other areas have seen,"" Collins said. ""But we are hearing from the Chinese community that they are concerned about growing hostility, so we are monitoring it closely.""Police said hate-motivated crimes are crimes where the offender was motivated by bias, prejudice or hate based on certain personal characteristics of the victim, like race. Hate as a motivation is considered after a person is found guilty, during sentencing.The consulate said in a statement that it strongly condemns the insult and threat, which it said violate both international and Canadian laws.""The Consulate General encourages the police to solve this case as soon as possible, and take necessary measures to better protect the safety and dignity of the Consulate, its staff and its properties,"" a consulate spokesperson said in an emailed statement."
