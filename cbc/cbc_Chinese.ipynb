      "It's been obvious for some time that there is something a little weird about the way Canada approaches its relationship with China — a disconnect brought into sharp relief this week by the news that Global Affairs and the Department of National Defence were not on the same page when it came to military ties and training involving the People’s Liberation Army.\n",

      "It's been obvious for some time that there is something weird about the way Canada approaches its relationship with China — a disconnect brought into sharp relief this week by the news that Global Affairs and the Department of National Defence were not on the same page when it came to military ties and training involving the People's Liberation Army.In some respects, the volcanic online political eruption which followed stories in The Globe and Mail and other media outlets, based on exclusive access to information documents, was predictable, as was the flurry of finger-pointing in the House of Commons on Thursday and Friday.Diplomats were alarmed when Gen. Jonathan Vance, the country's senior military commander, cancelled winter military exercises with the PLA in 2019, fretting that it might aggravate Beijing or make the lives of Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor even worse.It makes for fire-breathing memes, sizzling copy and wonderful political theatre.What's missing, though, is a recognition that Canada's policy toward a rising China has been contradictory and incoherent for almost a decade, maybe more, said Charles Burton, a political scientist at Brock University in St. Catharines, Ont. and a respected China expert at the Macdonald-Laurier Institute.\"Cabinets were always split on China, whether it's Liberal or Conservative,\" Burton said, referring to debates more than three decades ago during the government of former prime minister Brian Mulroney.It is more urgent than ever, in the context of an increasingly belligerent and assertive China, to present a united political front, he added.\"This is really about the defence of our sovereignty and security on matters over which there is consensus across the political spectrum in Canada,\" he said.Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan, in an attempt at political damage control late this week, made a point of saying that Chinese troops are no longer training for winter warfare at Garrison Petawawa, Ont.He also (rather meekly) noted that the exchange and training program with the PLA was instituted in August 2013 under the Conservatives while defence critic James Bezan, one of the most vocal and fiery opponents this week, was parliamentary secretary of defence.Bezan's retort was along the lines of that was then, this is now.\"The defence minister knows full well that the Chinese government back then and the Chinese government today are completely different,\" Bezan said during question period on Thursday.It was a different time, no question.Chinese President Xi Jinping had taken office only a few months before, and the Department of National Defence (DND) tasking order that established the exchange program, obtained by CBC News under access to information, noted that working with the PLA \"complements the Government of Canada led efforts to broaden our bilateral relationship with China.\"After years of hectoring and hammering China, the Conservatives — under former prime minister Stephen Harper — had decided that limited engagement was the way to go.And here is where Canada's curious incoherence comes into play.At precisely the moment the former chief of the defence staff, the now-retired general Tom Lawson, was penning the Canadian military's marching orders on closer cooperation with the PLA, the foreign affairs ministry — led at the time by John Baird — was firing off flares about China's unilateral declaration of an air defence zone in the East China Sea.It was a bellwether moment.\"The U.S. has indicated deep concern over the establishment of the Chinese ADIZ stating that the U.S. views this development as a destabilizing attempt to alter the status quo in the region and that this move increases the risk of misunderstanding and miscalculations,\" said a Nov. 23, 2013 briefing note to Baird, obtained by CBC News in 2017.\"More broadly, the rise of China is reshaping the strategic landscape.\"Burton said the rise of President Xi marked the beginning of the new, more aggressive China. The establishment of the air zone — now largely forgotten against a backdrop of fortified artificial islands in the South China Sea, reports of Uyghurs in concentration camps and the haze of tear gas in Hong Kong — marked the first step.So were our politicians and senior leaders paying attention not only to events, but to what other federal departments were saying?According to what former foreign affairs minister (and current finance minister) Chrystia Freeland had to say in question period this week, the answer is yes.\"I have long personal experience reporting on authoritarian communist regimes and I am very aware of the threat they pose,\" she said.Here's the question no one seemed to ask this week: why was the military exchange and training program still going on even before hostage diplomacy swept up the two Michaels?National Defence is no stranger to suspicions about China, having spent an enormous amount of time quietly defending itself from cyberattacks purportedly launched by  Beijing or by groups associated with it.The Trump administration has been tightening the screws on China from a diplomatic, security and trade perspective. There has been considerable, growing debate among Western allies — led by the Americans — about the downside of military engagement and co-operation with China, with Five Eyes intelligence partners each exchanging their own warnings — a series of discussions that eventually prompted Canada's current top military commander, Gen. Jonathan Vance, to cancel the winter warfare exercises.And then, of course, there's debate over the telecom giant Huawei and its future in this country.The signs were all there, Burton said — but no one actually woke up to the problem until Kovrig and Spavor were imprisoned. The public has been galvanized, he added, but \"it doesn't seem to have penetrated fully to the senior levels of the political and economic elite.\"Burton said that — as weird as it might sound, with everything else that has happened — he believes there are some within the Canadian Establishment who still cling to the notion that if the \"consular cases of Spavor and Kovrig are resolved, we can go back\" to business as usual.\n",

      "The federal government awarded a $371-million contract to secure personal protective equipment — one of the largest medical supply deals in its history — to a small company headquartered in a house in suburban Ottawa that had no apparent prior experience in PPE procurement.\n",

      "This story is part of The Big Spend, a CBC News investigation examining the unprecedented $240 billion the federal government handed out during the first eight months of the pandemic.The federal government awarded a $371-million contract to secure personal protective equipment — one of the largest medical supply deals in its history — to a small company headquartered in a house in suburban Ottawa that had no apparent prior experience in PPE procurement.Proline Advantage Inc.'s tender submission was one of more than 26,000 received by the government through its BuyandSell.gc.ca portal after it put out a call to suppliers last March for help procuring PPE.Of those thousands of submissions, a number of lucrative contracts went to low-profile companies that pivoted to the PPE market, seeing opportunity in the mad dash to secure supplies in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic.In the case of Proline Advantage Inc., the government says the company delivered the goods and fulfilled the obligations of its contract by August, coincidentally the same month Proline's PPE procurement website went live.The company's headquarters is owned by its two directors, Mike Caron and Chantal Beauchamp. Caron is also listed as a partner in a nutritional supplement company called Max Q and is the founder and director of Portions Master, a company that sells supplements and a product called the Skinny Plate. Available on Amazon, the Skinny Plate is a plastic dish with dividers designed to help limit portion sizes.Caron declined the CBC's request for an interview, providing an emailed statement instead.\"Our company is experienced in supply chain management and has a proud track record of sourcing products of various types from around the world,\" Caron wrote.\"Like many firms, we were able to quickly pivot our business, and leverage our international sourcing expertise to answer the government's call and address the immediate and pressing need to provide PPE to front-line medical professionals.\"In total, the federal government has spent just over $6.1 billion on what it describes as \"a broad range of equipment and supplies from domestic and international suppliers to combat COVID-19,\" not including vaccines.As of Oct. 15, gowns were the biggest-ticket item on the list — accounting for 29 per cent of the overall amount, at nearly $1.8 billion.Proline Advantage Inc.'s contract of $371,318,000 accounted for almost 21 per cent of that.In addition to gowns, Proline's contract included about $17.5 million for other protective clothing such as shoe and boot covers, and disposable overalls.WATCH | The 'Wild West' early days of the scramble for PPE:The NationalThe size of the contract, and the fact it's at the top of the list posted by Public Services and Procurement Canada, has drawn media attention and raised some eyebrows among Conservative MPs and some supply chain experts.\"The largest medical supply contract in Canadian history was given to Proline Advantage for medical gowns,\" Conservative MP Pierre Paul-Hus said in a meeting of the government operations committee last month. \"I want to know whether or not this company is well established in the medical field.\"\"This company is a small business and ensured that their gowns were made available as soon as possible by renting the largest plane in the world until all of their gowns were delivered,\" responded Anita Anand, minister of public services and procurement.\"This company stepped up at the beginning of the crisis when this country had no gowns, gloves, masks and the like. We need to respect the ability of small and large businesses across this country to step up for Canadians.\"Anand's deputy minister, Bill Matthews, pointed out that the company had \"a history of importing medical goods into Canada.\"In all, 26 contracts were awarded to 23 different suppliers for more than 132 million medical gowns.In some cases, finding out more about the companies involved is a challenge.MuFactor Ltd., for example, received a contract worth $257 million, also to procure gowns. The company is registered in Alberta, with its headquarters listed as a house in northwest Calgary. Searches of import databases show MuFactor has a history of importing furniture. Very little other information is available about the company — no contact information online, no email, no phone number.CBC News has asked the government about the status of the MuFactor contract and is awaiting its response.\"What I've seen in my work over the last eight months … there's been a lot of opportunistic organizations, distributors that don't have any experience in procuring health care, PPE and equipment, that have kind of popped up,\" said Fraser Johnson, an expert on supply chain management at Western University's Ivey Business School.\"From a procurement standpoint, if you're going to write contracts for several billions of dollars, and in these cases, tens of millions of dollars, you want to make sure that you know what the background of the company is.\"That vetting process should assess whether a company is financially stable; what expertise it brings to the table; and the cost and quality of the products it can buy and how quickly it can deliver, he said.In a statement to CBC News, Public Services and Procurement Canada says potential suppliers were required to provide manufacturers' test results and certifications, and the Public Health Agency of Canada was responsible for validating those documents. Financial capability assessments were also performed, and delivery schedules were validated and confirmed, the statement says.Delivery of the PPE is validated and quality assurance tests are performed on site by the Public Health Agency of Canada, the government says.The speed and sheer size of the PPE procurement was in response to a desperate need in the early stages of the pandemic.\"There was concern we didn't have sufficient domestic supply,\" said Dr. Sandy Buchman, who was head of the Canadian Medical Association when the COVID-19 crisis began last spring.\"For example, I was told locally by the leadership in a Toronto hospital that they were concerned that they had a two-day supply of PPE at the beginning of the pandemic. So, obviously, things were very thin at the time.\"There was a sense from government that they were scrambling to find PPE wherever they could.\"Established PPE suppliers watched newcomers pour into the market.\"There were literally tens of thousands of new entrants,\" said David Welsh, CEO of Edmonton-based Primed Medical Products, a company with 25 years of experience procuring and manufacturing a range of PPE.Ottawa has spent $240B fighting COVID-19 in just 8 months. A CBC investigation follows the moneyWelsh, whose company was awarded $93 million in government PPE contracts, says Ottawa did an excellent job of securing enormous amounts of PPE at a time when it was in huge demand around the world.\"But, yes, it was the Wild West. Decisions had to be made more quickly than normal. And the level of due diligence had to be shortened,\" he said.Necessarily so, say some experts, because of the fast-moving, highly volatile situation at the time.\"This was akin to a war footing here, given the severity of the event,\" said Vikas Mehrotra, a business professor at the University of Alberta.Mehrotra said the government had to act quickly because other countries would be chasing the same PPE supplies and there was concern the world would be cut off from PPE manufacturers, most of which are based in China.\"The purpose was to make sure that in case we get shut off from the global supply chain, we still have our own equipment to deal with the crisis,\" said Mehrotra.In that sense, he said, the $6-billion government PPE procurement operation was an overwhelming success, regardless of who filled the orders.\n",

      "As Canadians sour on China, an ambassador changes his tone | CBC News\n",
      "Dominic Barton, Canada's ambassador to China, made his first appearance at the China committee this week since before the pandemic hit Canada. He was noticeably less forgiving of Beijing and less bullish on business opportunities than last time — perhaps reflecting a turn against China in public opinion.\n",

      "Today marks two years since the two Michaels were detained by China.It's also been ten long pandemic months since Canada's ambassador to Beijing, Dominic Barton, made his previous appearance before the Commons subcommittee on Canada-China relations. Tuesday's second round of that hearing showed how much the mood around China has changed during 2020. Barton appeared conscious of the need to make some repairs to the impression he left in February, when his testimony drew unusually direct criticism from former diplomats with experience working in China.Back then, Barton suggested that it was incumbent upon Canadians to recognize that \"China values unity and the needs of society at large, rather than freedom of individual choice ... we just have to understand that.\"Former diplomat and China expert Charles Burton told the subcommittee that Barton's words parroted Communist Party propaganda asserting that Chinese culture is inherently averse to liberty and democracy — when in fact the aversion comes from Xi Jinping's Politburo.Watch: Trudeau says government will examine all options to bring Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig.:Politics NewsIn his Tuesday appearance, however, Barton opened with remarks on \"our efforts to promote rights and freedoms in China.\"\"We are concerned by the decline of civil and political rights in China,\" he told MPs.Barton began his appearance with a lengthy description of a recent visit to the Tibet Autonomous Region, which he toured in a party of foreign diplomats. It was one of two closely-supervised Tibetan tours put on for mostly western diplomats this year, a sign that the Communist Party — bravado notwithstanding — still cares about what western countries say regarding its human rights record.It may also have been an attempt to switch foreign attention to Tibet from the even more problematic neighbouring region of Xinjiang, where China's heavy-handed persecution of the Muslim Uighur people is opening new fronts for confrontation with the West.Barton said that he had consulted with pro-Tibet groups and academics in Canada before accepting the trip, which he said he undertook partly to show Tibetans the world was still concerned about their plight.In addition to discussing what he'd seen on the tour — which took in a school, a monastery and greenhouses — Barton also talked about the motives of the Communist Party in allowing the trip. He said he understood that \"what I saw was not the complete picture on any issue\" and described one effort to escape his minders — when he left his hotel at 5 a.m. for an unaccompanied stroll through the streets of Lhasa.Barton once famously described himself as \"a bull on China\" and his entire pre-diplomatic career was built on viewing China primarily as a business opportunity.During his last committee appearance, Barton told members he \"would love to talk more about promoting trade and investment. I probably should shut up and move on, but I'm very excited by the opportunity we have on many fronts.\"This time, he took his own advice and left out the economic boosterism — suggesting that the ambassador had not only learned to read the room but perhaps understood how the ground had shifted under him.\"Countries all around the world are evolving their approach to China,\" he told the subcommittee Tuesday night. That's certainly true in Europe, where both public attitudes and government approaches to China have become considerably tougher over the course of 2020. Shachi Kurl of the Angus Reid Institute said Barton's changed tone also reflects new realities at home.\"This isn't just about Canada and Ambassador Barton aligning with the Western consensus,\" she told CBC's Power and Politics. \"It really is about aligning with the Canadian consensus, because for several years we have seen a deterioration, and then a deterioration, and then a further deterioration in Canadian views of the Beijing regime.\"Opinion polls do show a crashing decline in China's standing in Canadian public opinion, reaching what Kurl calls \"an all-time low\" as 2020 draws to a close.\"You now find among the Canadian population a bloody-mindedness that says, 'You know what? This is not OK,'\" she said. \"This is about more than the human rights situation, this is about more than events in Hong Kong. What has really viscerally affected Canadians is the kidnapping of the two Michaels.\"Obviously, the detention of Kovrig and Spavor was always intended by Beijing to be a pressure tactic — not a play for hearts and minds. But it hasn't worked as a pressure tactic and has instead backfired disastrously upon China's public image.Would the CCP judge the strategy wise in hindsight, or consider it a failure? Either way, the need to save face makes it hard for the Communist Party — famously averse to backing down on anything — to alter its course now.During his committee appearance, Barton praised the two Canadians for their resilience, which he said was an inspiration to him.Barton was eager to mend fences when asked about another Canadian detainee: Huseyin Celil, a Uighur rights activist from Burlington, Ont. who was snatched on behalf of Chinese authorities while visiting Uzbekistan 14 years ago, whisked across the border and given a life sentence.When asked about the case in February, Barton said he had not been able to visit Celil because Celil was not a Canadian citizen. Once again, he was echoing a view espoused by the government of China, which has refused to recognize the fact that Celil has been a Canadian citizen since 2001. Foreign Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne was forced to correct the record in the House of Commons a few days after Barton's misstatement.Two former ambassadors to China condemned Barton's mischaracterization of Celil. \"China doesn't get to determine who is or becomes a Canadian citizen,\" said David Mulroney, who represented Canada in Beijing from 2009 to 2012.This time, Barton described the steps he had taken to reach out to the Celil family in the wake of that embarrassing incident.There is still no sign of progress in Celil's case, however. His detention differs from that of Kovrig and Spavor in that Celil was not seized as a bargaining chip to pressure Canada, and his case predates the Huawei dispute.Instead, Celil's detention intersects with another issue that has raised tensions between China and Canada — one that also came up in one of the tenser moments in this week's meeting between Barton and MPs.Conservative MP Garnett Genuis pressed Barton to make a clear statement on China's suppression of its Uighur minority, who are concentrated in the far western Xinjiang region.He read out the recent words of the Trudeau government's newish ambassador to the UN, Bob Rae, who told CBC News \"there's no question that there's aspects of what the Chinese are doing that fits into the definition of genocide in the genocide convention.\" Did Barton agree with that statement? The ambassador refused to be pinned down, saying that while the situation was \"very, very concerning,\" more reports from the area were needed.Rights activists are particularly suspicious of Barton on this file because the company he headed, McKinsey, earned a reputation for indifference to Uighur suffering while eagerly promoting the Chinese government's economic plans for their homeland.The company defended itself but faced harsh criticism — even from the traditional business press.\"I think we need to see the reports,\" Barton said. \"I haven't talked to Ambassador Rae about the particular evidence he has on that side.\"\"We need to have independent people on the ground who can go wherever they want\" in Xinjiang in order to determine what's happening, he added. Genuis was skeptical. \"We'd love to get access,\" he said. \"I think there's realities in terms of whether that's ever going to be given.\"\"Is Mr. Rae's statement consistent with the government's policy, or is yours?\" Genuis asked.Barton minimized the gap between the two, arguing that Rae was also seeking more investigation. A noticeable difference remained, however, in how the two men described the situation.\n",

      "The United Arab Emirates said Wednesday a Chinese coronavirus vaccine tested in the federation of sheikdoms is 86 per cent effective, in a statement that provided few details but marked the first public release of information on the efficacy of the shot.The announcement brought yet another shot into the worldwide race for a vaccine to end the pandemic, a scientific effort that has seen China and Russia compete with Western firms for an effective inoculation. While questions remain about the Sinopharm shot, already at least one country outside China plans to roll it out in a mass-vaccination campaign.The U.A.E., home to Dubai and Abu Dhabi, conducted a trial beginning in September of the vaccine by Chinese state-owned pharmaceutical giant Sinopharm involving 31,000 volunteers from 125 nations. Volunteers between 18 and 60 years old received two doses of the vaccine over 28 days.The U.A.E.'s Health and Prevention Ministry announced the results via a statement on the state-run WAM news agency, saying it has \"reviewed Sinopharm CNBG's interim analysis of the Phase III trials.\"\"The analysis shows no serious safety concerns,\" the statement said, without detailing whether any participant suffered side effects.It wasn't immediately clear if the announced results included only those taking part in the testing in the UAE or if they also include results from China and elsewhere. The statement described the vaccine as receiving \"official registration\" without elaborating on what that meant.Emirati officials and Sinopharm did not respond to questions from The Associated Press.However, calls Wednesday to SEHA, the Abu Dhabi health authority, included an option for individuals to schedule an appointment to receive a \"COVID-19 vaccine.\" The centre was swamped with calls following the announcement on the vaccine's efficacy.The Sinopharm vaccine has been approved for emergency use in a few countries and the company is still conducting late-stage clinical trials in 10 countries. Morocco is gearing up for an ambitious COVID-19 vaccination program, aiming to vaccinate 80 per cent of its adults in an operation starting this month that's relying initially on the Sinopharm vaccine.Sinopharm's shot relies on a tested technology, using a killed virus to deliver the vaccine, similar to how polio immunizations are made. Leading Western competitors, like the shot made by Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech, use newer, less-proven technology to target the coronavirus's spike protein using RNA. The United Kingdom already has begun vaccinating people with the Pfizer shot.WATCH | Inside the scramble to mass produce a COVID-19 vaccine:The NationalTop officials in the UAE, including Dubai's ruler, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, have publicly received the shots as part of the vaccine testing.Already, Pfizer reports its shot as being 95 per cent effective, while another RNA candidate from Moderna appears to be 94.5 per cent effective. Results suggest a third vaccine from Oxford University and AstraZeneca is safe and about 70 per cent effective, but questions remain about how well it may help protect those over 55.In transport, Pfizer says its vaccine must be stored in a freezer at –80 C to –60 C or in a thermal container at –90 C to –60 C. The Moderna vaccine must remain at a temperature of –20 C.The Sinopharm vaccine is believed to be able to travel at a temperature of 2 C to 8 C, a major draw for areas of the world where nearly three billion people live without stable electricity and refrigeration. In November, the Communist Party secretary for Sinopharm said almost one million people in China had received its vaccine.Since the pandemic began, the UAE has detected over 178,000 cases of the virus, with 160,000 recoveries and nearly 600 deaths. Its aggressive testing policy has seen over 17 million tests conducted in a country home to just over nine million people.\n",

      "Droves of Venezuelans blaming President Nicolas Maduro for their country's collapse voiced their frustrations Saturday in a creative protest rivalling recent elections they boycotted as fraudulent.In the so-called \"people's consultation,\" U.S.-backed opposition leader Juan Guaido urged Venezuelans at home and around the world to register their ire through cellphone apps. Others visited makeshift polling stations in cities across Venezuela and in other Latin American Nations, the U.S. and Europe.\"Hope has been mobilized in Venezuela,\" Guaido said shortly before the results were announced. \"We must underscore a heroic people who mobilized throughout the country and the world in defence of their rights.\"Opposition leaders reported that nearly 6.5 million people responded to the survey. The Associated Press could not independently verify the validity of the figures, and even some opposition election experts questioned the number.The opposition's report said more than 3.2 million participated in person within Venezuela and nearly 850,000 visited centres outside the country, while more than 2.5 million sent in their responses digitally.The survey asked whether people want to end Maduro's rule and hold fresh presidential and legislative elections, and also seek even greater pressure from international allies to make it happen.Though the event had no legal force, opposition leaders said the survey would unify the foes of Maduro. That includes the five million Venezuelans who have fled the nation's hyperinflation and lack of basic services such as reliable running water, electricity and gasoline, they said.Mirla De Lorenzo, a bank employee, visited a center in her Caracas neighborhood to participate, saying she would take any opportunity to express herself if there was any chance it could bring international attention to Venezuela's plight and trigger an end to Maduro's rule.\"We're definitely tired of this situation that's brought us nothing but poverty,\" she said, adding that her daughter moved to Spain and her sister migrated to Chile, among relatives who have fled the crisis.\"You can't compete with deceitful people, with people who use force, with people who have weapons,\" she said. \"There is no way.\"The consultation came days after Maduro's ruling socialist party declared victory in congressional elections that Guaido's coalition boycotted, arguing the vote was a fraud. Canada, the U.S. and the European Union are among the nations and regional bodies that rejected the elections as undemocratic.Guaido, acting as the National Assembly's leader, proclaimed himself interim president in early 2019, arguing that Maduro was an illegitimate leader because his most popular challengers were barred from running in the presidential election the previous year.Guaido quickly won broad support at home among energized supporters who flooded the streets as well as the backing of leaders in dozens of nations, including the U.S. The Trump administration took the lead, imposing sanctions on Maduro, dozens of his political allies and the state-run oil firm PDVSA. The U.S. Justice Department also unveiled an indictment of Maduro charging him with being a \"narcoterrorist,\" and offered a $15 million USreward for his arrest.Nearly two years later, however, Maduro remains in power with control of the military and international allies including Iran, Russia, China, Turkey and Cuba.On Jan. 5, the term of the current opposition-dominated National Assembly ends and Maduro's political allies take over the last governmental body not controlled by the president's socialist party. Guaido and his political allies vow to continue fighting.Risa Grais-Targow, a Venezuela analyst for the Eurasia Group, said that in addition to seeking to unite Venezuelans who don't like Maduro, the symbolic referendum was meant to send a message to international supporters.\"They've organized a process for their foreign partners from the U.S. to the European Union and regional governments,\" Grais-Targow said. \"So they can continue to back him even when he's no longer in control of the National Assembly.\"The U.S. ambassador for Venezuela, James Story, praised the opposition's survey from Colombia's capital, where he has worked since the U.S. and Venezuela broke diplomatic relations and the U.S. closed its embassy in Caracas.\"We're proud to see the people of Venezuela in the street voting for their right to democracy, justice, liberty,\" Story tweeted. \"Their voices have been heard. Democracy must return to Venezuela.\"Support among Venezuelans for the opposition has waned amid growing frustrations over Maduro remaining in power.Maduro's popularity is even lower. Just 31 per cent of Venezuela's voters cast ballots in the Dec. 5 congressional elections — less than half the turnout for the 2015 legislative elections.Maduro's ruling party staged a celebration in the historic centre of Caracas on Saturday to mark the victories of their National Assembly candidates, including Maduro's wife and son. Politicians gave speeches condemning the domestic opposition and U.S. policy interference in Venezuela. Salsa music played and people danced.A political talk show on state television Saturday night featured a segment mocking the referendum by showing cellphone videos said to have been recorded by people who drove by survey centers in cities across the nation.\"There's nobody, absolutely nobody,\" one unidentified driver says. \"Look there's four people standing around talking nonsense.\"\n",

Not once,\" Wong said.He noted that China currently hosted no fewer that two dozen North Korea representatives connected to Pyongyang's weapons of mass destruction programs or banks.He accused China of \"seeking to undo the UN sanctions regime they themselves voted for in 2006, in 2009, in 2013, in 2016, and in 2017.\"\"They are seeking to revive trade links and revenue transfers to the North, thereby ensuring Chinese reach into the North's economy,\" he said.China insists it abides by UN sanctions requirements on North Korea, although it has also expressed hope, along with Russia, that an easing of those conditions could help break the deadlock in nuclear talks between Washington and Pyongyang.\n",

      "Another test event for the 2022 Beijing Olympics was called off Saturday, when bobsleigh and skeleton officials cancelled plans to have a training week and World Cup race on a newly built track to end this year's sliding season.The decision comes just days after luge officials also cancelled that sport's season-ending World Cup and training week on the track built in Yanqing.The reason, in both cases, was the same: ongoing concerns about international travel during the coronavirus pandemic, which originated in China about a year ago.In a letter sent to national federations Saturday, IBSF secretary general Heike Groesswang said several weeks of conversations were held about how to move forward with the training week and World Cup \"under the challenging circumstances the COVID-19 pandemic causes to all of us.\"The new schedule calls for a bobsled training week in early October and a skeleton training week later in October. That means many nations will likely have to choose some semblance of their 2021-22 national teams by the end of this season, since most of the world's tracks won't be iced and operating before those training weeks in China are held.\"A replacement for the World Cup in March 2021 will be announced next week,\" Groesswang said.USA Bobsled and Skeleton and USA Luge are sitting out the pre-Christmas portions of the World Cup schedules in those sports, as are several other nations, because of concerns about international travel and other pandemic-related issues.In a women's World Cup bobsleigh race in Latvia on Saturday, only six sleds finished the two runs. That was believed to be the smallest World Cup field since women began competing on the circuit.It's been tradition for at least the last five Olympic cycles for a World Cup event to be held on that track that will host the games the following winter, and those races have been critical in terms of teams collecting data and formulating an Olympic strategy.But not having the training weeks and World Cups in China could raise the possibility of some nations, the U.S. included, not competing internationally at all this season.\n",

      "2 years after Meng Wanzhou's arrest, fate of 2 detained Canadians, China relationship hang in balance | CBC News\n",
      "Two years after the arrest of Meng Wanzhou, the wife of Michael Kovrig, one of two Canadians detained in China, says she believes an end to the Huawei executive's extradition case would open the path to the detained men's liberation. But that end is still likely years away.\n",
      "2020-12-01T09:00:00.000Z\n",
      "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/meng-wanzhou-arrest-anniversary-michaels-1.5822546\n",
      "On a sweltering day last August, Michael Kovrig's wife sat in the back of a Vancouver courtroom, listening as lawyers for Meng Wanzhou and Canada's attorney general plotted out the coming months of the Huawei executive's extradition proceedings.It wasn't the first time Vina Nadjibulla had attended one of Meng's court dates.Her presence in B.C. Supreme Court represents a kind of collision of worlds: the slow drip of the legal process to determine if Meng should be extradited to the United States to face trial on charges of fraud and conspiracy on the one hand, and the urgent need for action on behalf of two Canadians whose fates appear tied to Meng's on the other.Kovrig, a former diplomat, and entrepreneur Michael Spavor were detained by Chinese authorities nine days after Meng's arrest at Vancouver International Airport on Dec. 1, 2018.They have  been charged with spying in a case most observers believe is simple retaliation for Canada's arrest of Huawei's chief financial officer at the request of the U.S.Nadjibulla is separated from Kovrig but remains his most vocal advocate. As the second anniversary of Meng's arrest rolls around, she says it has become impossible to detach Meng's situation from that of the two Michaels, as the men are known.\"I have been following Meng's extradition case very closely because it is inextricably linked to Michael's unjust detention in China,\" Nadjibulla told CBC News.\"I believe that an end to her extradition case, by one means or another, would open up the path to Michael's liberation as well.\"It's been two years since Meng stepped off a Cathay Pacific flight from Hong Kong onto a jetway, where she was intercepted by Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) officers and her phones were bagged as RCMP officers watched unobserved from a short distance away.Police had obtained a provisional warrant for Meng's arrest the day before at the request of the U.S. Department of Justice.The 48-year-old is charged with lying to an HSBC banker in Hong Kong in August 2013 about Huawei's control of a subsidiary that is accused of violating U.S. economic sanctions against Iran.Prosecutors claim that by relying on Meng's alleged lies to continue a financial relationship with Huawei, HSBC was placed at risk of loss and prosecution.Meng has denied the accusations against her.\"Ms. Meng is staying patient and positive,\" said Alykhan Velshi, vice-president of corporate affairs at Huawei Canada. \"It can be trying at times because she knows the charges against her are false. She believes that she's a pawn in a global game of chess.\"But right from the start, she's always expressed faith in Canada's system of justice.\"Meng is the daughter of Huawei's billionaire founder, Ren Zhengfei.Her arrest came as the United States was beginning a campaign to exclude Huawei from being part of the country's next generation of wireless technology — known as 5G. The U.S., one of five countries belonging to the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing network, has labelled the telecommunications giant a security threat and called on its allies to follow suit.Other members of the Five Eyes network — the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand — have all blocked the use of Huawei's technology, while Canada has still not decided if Huawei can be part of its 5G grid.Yves Tiberghien, a political science professor at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, said Meng's arrest has highlighted questions over the future of wireless technology, as well as the trade battle between the U.S. and China, which has its roots in concerns over intellectual property theft.But he said the case also speaks to the Americans' use of sanctions law and its financial system to pressure rivals, as well as China's hard-line tactics and lack of respect for human rights — as seen in the country's targeting of Canadian exports and the imprisonment of Kovrig and Spavor.\"This is at the intersection of all those fault lines,\" Tiberghien said.\"For Canadians, the No. 1 story is the two Michaels, and so there is a lot of frustration in Canada, and the plight of the two Michaels is a prism to understand a much more aggressive China.\"The case also promises to test Canada's extradition law as Meng's legal team painstakingly exposes every element of the case to scrutiny — beginning with the moments that immediately followed her first steps on Canadian soil.CBSA officers questioned Meng for almost three hours before they handed her over to the RCMP. Her lawyers claim the two agencies conspired with the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation to have customs officers question her without a lawyer, in violation of her rights.The officers who were involved in the arrest have been on the witness stand in recent weeks, giving testimony that the defence is hoping can be used to bolster an argument to have the case tossed out next spring for alleged abuse of process.RCMP officers have testified that they deferred to CBSA jurisdiction as \"gatekeepers\" to Canada, and the border officers claimed that legitimate concerns about Meng as a potential national security threat warranted the beginning of an admissibility exam.But working against the Crown, a CBSA officer gave the RCMP a piece of paper on which he wrote the passcodes to her phones, allegedly by mistake. And an RCMP staff sergeant whom the defence accuses of sending the serial numbers belonging to Meng's electronic devices to the FBI is refusing to testify.All have denied any wrongdoing or collusion. Their testimony, originally scheduled to last two weeks, has expanded to at least four, likely pushing other dates in the extradition proceedings further into 2021.It's hard to know whether the evidence points to conspiracy, business as usual or a sloppiness that fits somewhere in the middle.Associate Chief Justice Heather Holmes has remarked on the huge amount of detail that has emerged from the testimony so far, asking the defence and the Crown to ready submissions on what it all means as she prepares to wade through it.The defence also plans to argue that U.S. President Donald Trump is using Meng as a bargaining chip in trade with China and that the United States deliberately misled Canada into the extradition proceedings by omitting key facts that undermined the strength of the case.Gary Botting, a Vancouver-based legal expert and author on extradition law, said he doesn't expect those arguments will ultimately be substantive enough to derail the proceedings. He agrees with high-profile supporters of the two Michaels — such as former Liberal justice minister Allan Rock and former Supreme Court of Canada justice Louise Arbour — who say there is nothing stopping Justice Minister David Lametti from intervening to end the case.The Liberal government has repeatedly stated that the rule of law has to play out in court before Lametti can weigh in, but over the summer, Rock, Arbour and others sought a legal opinion from Toronto lawyer Brian Greenspan, who said Lametti has the ability to act at any time.Botting said he thinks he should. The facts of the case are weak, he said, and he's troubled by Canada being pulled into a request involving a Chinese national, a British bank and a lie that allegedly happened in Hong Kong.\"I think it's significant in the sense that it's very clear that the minister of justice has complete control over who is sent over to a foreign country upon a request for extradition,\" Botting said.\"He can say no at any point.\"Prime Minister Justin Trudeau recently congratulated U.S. president-elect Joe Biden on his victory in last month's election. He also brought up the issue of the two Michaels, but there's no indication of what a new U.S. administration might mean for the proceedings.Nadjibulla said she'll continue to attend Meng's court proceedings, which began last fall, if she can. And wait.\"Given the complexities of this extradition request and absent an intervention by the U.S. or Canadian authorities, the legal process is likely to take years,\" she said.Meng has been living under a form of house arrest since her release on $10 million bail, a little more than a week after she was arrested.She is required to wear a GPS monitoring bracelet on her ankle and is trailed by around-the-clock security, whom she pays to ensure she doesn't travel beyond court-ordered boundaries that stop short of the ferry terminals and airport.It's a far cry from the conditions Kovrig and Spavor have endured since they were first detained in China. Kovrig has spent months in solitary confinement. The COVID-19 pandemic also meant both men were cut off from consular visits last January.They were only recently allowed two virtual visits with the Canadian ambassador.China has provided no evidence of the claims against them. They've also been given no idea of when they might face a trial.Unlike Meng, though, the outcome — if it comes to that — is in little doubt.Experts say China has a 99.9 per cent conviction rate.\n",

      "Foreign Affairs Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne warned Monday that tough talk about China could hurt efforts to gain the release of two arbitrarily detained Canadians.Testifying before the House of Commons Canada-China relations committee, Champagne urged MPs to keep the fate of Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig in mind when they spout off about the perils and perfidy of China's Communist regime.\"I know, Mr. Chair, that some like to talk tough on China,\" Champagne told the committee.\"To those who are seduced by this one-dimensional view, I say this: while it is easy to be tough, let's continue to be smart. Let's not fall into the temptation of tough and irresponsible rhetoric that will generate no tangible result for Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, our farmers and entrepreneurs, and human rights victims and advocates.\"The two Michaels, as they've come to be known, have been imprisoned in China for almost two years in retaliation for Canada's arrest of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou on an extradition request from the United States.Canadian farmers, fishers and exporters have also been hurt by retaliatory measures taken by China in the wake of Meng's arrest.Champagne's plea came a week after the House of Commons passed a Conservative motion calling on the government to decide by Dec. 18 whether to allow Huawei to be involved in development of Canada's next generation 5G wireless network.The motion, passed with the support of all opposition parties over the objections of the government, also called on the government to unveil within 30 days a robust plan to deal with growing intimidation by China of Canadians within Canada's borders.The motion is not binding and Champagne told the committee that government action on both fronts will be guided by national security requirements, not by arbitrary deadlines.Since taking over the helm of the Conservatives last August, Erin O'Toole has made standing up to China a central pillar of his pitch to Canadian voters.The Conservative leader has accused Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's Liberal government of being \"willing to look past the Chinese government's numerous human rights abuses, flagrant trade abuses and security issues because the potential to sell into the massive Chinese market was so lucrative.\"\"Trudeau's approach to China has failed, and it's weakened our standing in the world. We must stand up for our citizens who have been detained as bargaining chips in an extradition case, even if it leads to more reprisals from Beijing,\" O'Toole argued in an op-ed in the National Post in September.O'Toole has called for an \"eyes wide open\" approach to relations with China. But Champagne contended that's precisely the approach his government is taking.He argued that Canada's policy toward China has evolved as China itself has evolved, increasingly flouting the international rules-based order, violating the human rights of Uighurs in Xinjiang province and democracy protesters in Hong Kong, and engaging in \"coercive diplomacy\" to get its way.\"The China of 2020 is not the China of 2015 or even the China of 2018,\" Champagne said.\"We see a country and a leadership increasingly prepared to throw its weight around to advance its interests.\"Champagne said the government has adopted a new framework for dealing with China. He described it as a three-pronged approach in which there will be areas, such as human rights abuses, where Canada needs to challenge China.In other areas, such as trade matters, he said Canada needs to compete with China, and still other areas where Canada needs to co-operate with China, such as the fight against climate change.China's more aggressive posture is not just a challenge for Canada, he argued. Countries around the world are grappling with it.Champagne said the best antidote is for all liberal democracies to band together to speak with one voice to pressure China to change its ways — just as Canada has rallied other countries to speak out against the detention of Kovrig and Spavor.\n",

      "http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/china-moon-mission-1.5813803\n",
      "China launched an ambitious mission on Tuesday to bring back rocks and debris from the moon's surface for the first time in more than 40 years — an undertaking that could boost human understanding of the moon and of the solar system more generally.Chang'e 5 — named for the Chinese moon goddess — is the country's boldest lunar mission yet. If successful, it would be a major advance for China's space program, and some experts say it could pave the way for bringing samples back from Mars or even a crewed lunar mission.The four modules of the Chang'e 5 spacecraft blasted off at just after 4:30 a.m. Tuesday (3:30 p.m. ET Monday) atop a massive Long March-5Y rocket from the Wenchang launch centre along the coast of the southern island province of Hainan.Minutes after liftoff, the spacecraft separated from the rocket's first and second stages and slipped into Earth-moon transfer orbit. About an hour later, Chang'e 5 opened its solar panels to provide its independent power source.Spacecraft typically take three days to reach the moon.The launch was carried live by national broadcaster CCTV which then switched to computer animation to show its progress into outer space.The mission's key task is to drill 2 metres beneath the moon's surface and scoop up about 2 kilograms of rocks and other debris to be brought back to Earth, according to NASA. That would offer the first opportunity for scientists to study newly obtained lunar material since the American and Russian missions of the 1960s and 1970s.With Chang’e 5, China has launched an effort to join the U.S. &amp; the former Soviet Union in obtaining lunar samples. We hope China shares its data with the global scientific community to enhance our understanding of the Moon like our Apollo missions did &amp; the Artemis program will. <a href=\"https://t.co/mPjG4FE0qQ\">pic.twitter.com/mPjG4FE0qQ</a>The Chang'e 5 lander's time on the moon is scheduled to be short and sweet. It can only stay one lunar daytime, or about 14 Earth days, because it lacks the radioisotope heating units to withstand the moon's freezing nights.The lander will dig for materials with its drill and robotic arm and transfer them to what's called an ascender, which will lift off from the moon and dock with the service capsule. The materials will then be moved to the return capsule to be hauled back to Earth.The technical complexity of Chang'e 5, with its four components, makes it \"remarkable in many ways,\" said Joan Johnson-Freese, a space expert at the U.S. Naval War College.\"China is showing itself capable of developing and successfully carrying out sustained high-tech programs, important for regional influence and potentially global partnerships,\" she said.In particular, the ability to collect samples from space is growing in value, said Jonathan McDowell, an astronomer at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. Other countries planning to retrieve material from asteroids or even Mars may look to China's experience, he said.While the mission is \"indeed challenging,\" McDowell said China has already landed twice on the moon with its Chang'e 3 and Chang'e 4 missions, and showed with a 2014 Chang'e 5 test mission that it can navigate back to Earth, re-enter and land a capsule. All that's left is to show it can collect samples and take off again from the moon.\"As a result of this, I'm pretty optimistic that China can pull this off,\" he said.The mission is among China's boldest since it first put a man in space in 2003, becoming only the third nation to do so after the U.S. and Russia.Oh! Cheeky shot of the return capsule <a href=\"https://t.co/pymZvYTltG\">pic.twitter.com/pymZvYTltG</a>Chang'e 5 and future lunar missions aim to \"provide better technical support for future scientific and exploration activities,\" Pei Zhaoyu, mission spokesperson and deputy director of the Chinese National Space Administration's Lunar Exploration and Space Engineering Center told reporters at a Monday briefing.\"Scientific needs and technical and economic conditions\" would determine whether China decides to send a crewed mission to the moon, said Pei, whose comments were embargoed until after the launch. \"I think future exploration activities on the moon are most likely to be carried out in a human-machine combination.\"While many of China's crewed spaceflight achievements, including building an experimental space station and conducting a spacewalk, reproduce those of other countries from years past, the CNSA is now moving into new territory.Chang'e 4 — which made the first soft landing on the moon's relatively unexplored far side almost two years ago — is currently collecting full measurements of radiation exposure from the lunar surface, information vital for any country that plans to send astronauts to the moon.China in July became one of three countries to have launched a mission to Mars, in China's case an orbiter and a rover that will search for signs of water on the Red Planet. The CNSA says the spacecraft Tianwen 1 is on course to arrive at Mars around February.China has increasingly engaged with foreign countries on missions, and the European Space Agency will be providing important ground station information for Chang'e 5.U.S. law, however, still prevents most collaborations with NASA, excluding China from partnering with the International Space Station. That has prompted China to start work on its own space station and launch its own programs that have put it in a steady competition with Japan and India, among Asian nations seeking to notch new achievements in space.China's space program has progressed cautiously, with relatively few setbacks in recent years. The rocket being used for the current launch failed on a previous launch attempt, but has since performed without a glitch, including launching Chang'e 4.\"China works very incrementally, developing building blocks for long-term use for a variety of missions,\" Freese-Johnson said. China's one-party authoritarian system also allows for \"prolonged political will that is often difficult in democracies,\" she said.While the U.S. has followed China's successes closely, it's unlikely to expand cooperation with China in space amid political suspicions, a sharpening military rivalry and accusations of Chinese theft of technology, experts say.\"A change in U.S. policy regarding space cooperation is unlikely to get much government attention in the near future,\" Johnson-Freese said.\n",

      "China on Friday became one of the last major countries to congratulate U.S. president-elect Joe Biden.China, along with Russia, avoided joining the throng that congratulated Biden last weekend after he and vice-presidential running mate Kamala Harris secured enough electoral college votes to unseat President Donald Trump.\"We respect the choice of the American people,\" said a foreign ministry spokesperson, Wang Wenbin. \"We congratulate Mr. Biden and Ms. Harris.\"Wang gave no reason for the delay but said, \"the result will be confirmed according to U.S. laws and procedures.\"U.S.-Chinese relations have plunged to their lowest level in decades amid a tariff war over Beijing's technology ambitions and trade surplus, accusations of spying, and tension over human rights, the coronavirus pandemic, Hong Kong and control of the South China Sea.Trump labelled China a security threat and imposed export curbs and other sanctions on Chinese companies. On Thursday, he stepped up those sanctions by issuing an order that bars Americans from investing in securities issued by companies U.S. officials say are owned or controlled by the Chinese military.Forecasters had said even if he lost his re-election bid, Trump was likely to try to increase pressure on Beijing before he leaves office on Jan. 20.Political analysts expect Biden to try to resume co-operation with Beijing on climate change, North Korea, Iran and the coronavirus. However, economists and political analysts expect few big changes due to widespread frustration with Beijing's trade and human rights record, as well as accusations of spying and technology theft.\"A tough stance on China has broad support across the U.S. political spectrum,\" Louis Kuijs of Oxford Economics said in a report this week. \"Biden's own pronouncements and policy program suggest he will continue to try to maintain the U.S. technological lead and to attract manufacturing activity.\"Some forecasters suggest the change from Trump — who rejected multilateral alliances — to Biden might increase pressure on China if Washington forms a coalition with other developed countries to push for policy changes.China has tried to recruit Germany, France, South Korea and other governments as allies against Washington but all have refused. They criticized Trump's trade tactics of surprise tariff hikes, which also were used against allies, but echoed U.S. complaints that China is violating its free-trade commitments.Some Chinese trade experts have suggested Beijing might try to renegotiate the Phase 1 agreement signed in January as a first step toward ending the trade war. It calls for China to increase purchases of U.S. goods in exchange for postponing further tariff hikes. But that came before the coronavirus derailed global trade, leaving China behind on meeting its commitments.Renegotiation might fit a \"more strategic, longer-term orientation\" expected from a Biden administration, but he \"cannot be seen to be 'soft' on China\" after the \"hard rhetoric\" of the campaign, Kuijs said.Chinese leaders were quieter during this year's election than in the 2016 presidential race, when they favoured Trump over former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. They disliked her for carrying out then-President Barack Obama's foreign policy, which included pressuring Beijing on human rights. Trump's public image of business success resonated with the Chinese public.Trump shook up China's leaders by hiking tariffs on Chinese products in 2018 over complaints Beijing steals or pressures companies to hand over technology.The White House has lobbied allies to exclude telecom equipment giant Huawei Technologies Ltd., China's first global tech brand, from next-generation telecom networks on security grounds. Huawei's access to American components and technology was cut off over the past year, threatening to cripple its global sales.Trump is also trying to bar Chinese social media companies from the United States, citing fears they might gather too much personal information about Americans. The White House is pressing video service TikTok to sell its U.S. operation and is trying to block companies from dealing with WeChat, the popular Chinese message service.Trump has not been vocal on the subject of human rights, rarely mentioning the plight of Hong Kong democracy activists or the detained Uighurs in Xinjiang, though members of his administration such as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have taken up that role.Former U.S. national security adviser John Bolton even alleged in his recent book that Trump expressed his support to Chinese President Xi Jinping over the building of camps to detain the Muslim minority Uighurs, though Trump angrily denied that claim.Despite the contentious issues, Trump spoke favourably of his personal relationship with Xi for over three years, dialling back such talk as the coronavirus pandemic, first noticed in China, spread throughout the U.S.All of the G7 nations and the majority of G20 countries have now congratulated the U.S. president-elect. Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, on friendly terms with Trump, has been an exception, though on Friday his vice-president Hamilton Mourao said that Biden's victory in the election was \"becoming more and more irreversible.\"Mexico's President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has been cautious, saying he wants to wait until U.S. states certified election results in the coming weeks before congratulating a winner.The Kremlin said on Monday it would wait for the official results of the election before commenting on its outcome, but Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov was at least contemplating a change in administration, telling reporters on Thursday he thought U.S. foreign policy under Biden would be similar to that seen under Obama, especially on Iran and climate change.\n",
