Canada's ties to China's military underscore the weird contradictions in its foreign policy | CBC News,It's been obvious for some time that there is something a little weird about the way Canada approaches its relationship with China — a disconnect brought into sharp relief this week by the news that Global Affairs and the Department of National Defence were not on the same page when it came to military ties and training involving the People’s Liberation Army.,2020-12-12T09:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canada-china-pla-peoples-liberation-army-1.5838658,"It's been obvious for some time that there is something weird about the way Canada approaches its relationship with China — a disconnect brought into sharp relief this week by the news that Global Affairs and the Department of National Defence were not on the same page when it came to military ties and training involving the People's Liberation Army.In some respects, the volcanic online political eruption which followed stories in The Globe and Mail and other media outlets, based on exclusive access to information documents, was predictable, as was the flurry of finger-pointing in the House of Commons on Thursday and Friday.Diplomats were alarmed when Gen. Jonathan Vance, the country's senior military commander, cancelled winter military exercises with the PLA in 2019, fretting that it might aggravate Beijing or make the lives of Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor even worse.It makes for fire-breathing memes, sizzling copy and wonderful political theatre.What's missing, though, is a recognition that Canada's policy toward a rising China has been contradictory and incoherent for almost a decade, maybe more, said Charles Burton, a political scientist at Brock University in St. Catharines, Ont. and a respected China expert at the Macdonald-Laurier Institute.""Cabinets were always split on China, whether it's Liberal or Conservative,"" Burton said, referring to debates more than three decades ago during the government of former prime minister Brian Mulroney.It is more urgent than ever, in the context of an increasingly belligerent and assertive China, to present a united political front, he added.""This is really about the defence of our sovereignty and security on matters over which there is consensus across the political spectrum in Canada,"" he said.Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan, in an attempt at political damage control late this week, made a point of saying that Chinese troops are no longer training for winter warfare at Garrison Petawawa, Ont.He also (rather meekly) noted that the exchange and training program with the PLA was instituted in August 2013 under the Conservatives while defence critic James Bezan, one of the most vocal and fiery opponents this week, was parliamentary secretary of defence.Bezan's retort was along the lines of that was then, this is now.""The defence minister knows full well that the Chinese government back then and the Chinese government today are completely different,"" Bezan said during question period on Thursday.It was a different time, no question.Chinese President Xi Jinping had taken office only a few months before, and the Department of National Defence (DND) tasking order that established the exchange program, obtained by CBC News under access to information, noted that working with the PLA ""complements the Government of Canada led efforts to broaden our bilateral relationship with China.""After years of hectoring and hammering China, the Conservatives — under former prime minister Stephen Harper — had decided that limited engagement was the way to go.And here is where Canada's curious incoherence comes into play.At precisely the moment the former chief of the defence staff, the now-retired general Tom Lawson, was penning the Canadian military's marching orders on closer cooperation with the PLA, the foreign affairs ministry — led at the time by John Baird — was firing off flares about China's unilateral declaration of an air defence zone in the East China Sea.It was a bellwether moment.""The U.S. has indicated deep concern over the establishment of the Chinese ADIZ stating that the U.S. views this development as a destabilizing attempt to alter the status quo in the region and that this move increases the risk of misunderstanding and miscalculations,"" said a Nov. 23, 2013 briefing note to Baird, obtained by CBC News in 2017.""More broadly, the rise of China is reshaping the strategic landscape.""Burton said the rise of President Xi marked the beginning of the new, more aggressive China. The establishment of the air zone — now largely forgotten against a backdrop of fortified artificial islands in the South China Sea, reports of Uyghurs in concentration camps and the haze of tear gas in Hong Kong — marked the first step.So were our politicians and senior leaders paying attention not only to events, but to what other federal departments were saying?According to what former foreign affairs minister (and current finance minister) Chrystia Freeland had to say in question period this week, the answer is yes.""I have long personal experience reporting on authoritarian communist regimes and I am very aware of the threat they pose,"" she said.Here's the question no one seemed to ask this week: why was the military exchange and training program still going on even before hostage diplomacy swept up the two Michaels?National Defence is no stranger to suspicions about China, having spent an enormous amount of time quietly defending itself from cyberattacks purportedly launched by  Beijing or by groups associated with it.The Trump administration has been tightening the screws on China from a diplomatic, security and trade perspective. There has been considerable, growing debate among Western allies — led by the Americans — about the downside of military engagement and co-operation with China, with Five Eyes intelligence partners each exchanging their own warnings — a series of discussions that eventually prompted Canada's current top military commander, Gen. Jonathan Vance, to cancel the winter warfare exercises.And then, of course, there's debate over the telecom giant Huawei and its future in this country.The signs were all there, Burton said — but no one actually woke up to the problem until Kovrig and Spavor were imprisoned. The public has been galvanized, he added, but ""it doesn't seem to have penetrated fully to the senior levels of the political and economic elite.""Burton said that — as weird as it might sound, with everything else that has happened — he believes there are some within the Canadian Establishment who still cling to the notion that if the ""consular cases of Spavor and Kovrig are resolved, we can go back"" to business as usual."

"As Canadians sour on China, an ambassador changes his tone | CBC News","Dominic Barton, Canada's ambassador to China, made his first appearance at the China committee this week since before the pandemic hit Canada. He was noticeably less forgiving of Beijing and less bullish on business opportunities than last time — perhaps reflecting a turn against China in public opinion.",2020-12-10T09:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/china-kovrig-spavor-dominic-barton-1.5835036,"Today marks two years since the two Michaels were detained by China.It's also been ten long pandemic months since Canada's ambassador to Beijing, Dominic Barton, made his previous appearance before the Commons subcommittee on Canada-China relations. Tuesday's second round of that hearing showed how much the mood around China has changed during 2020. Barton appeared conscious of the need to make some repairs to the impression he left in February, when his testimony drew unusually direct criticism from former diplomats with experience working in China.Back then, Barton suggested that it was incumbent upon Canadians to recognize that ""China values unity and the needs of society at large, rather than freedom of individual choice ... we just have to understand that.""Former diplomat and China expert Charles Burton told the subcommittee that Barton's words parroted Communist Party propaganda asserting that Chinese culture is inherently averse to liberty and democracy — when in fact the aversion comes from Xi Jinping's Politburo.Watch: Trudeau says government will examine all options to bring Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig.:Politics NewsIn his Tuesday appearance, however, Barton opened with remarks on ""our efforts to promote rights and freedoms in China.""""We are concerned by the decline of civil and political rights in China,"" he told MPs.Barton began his appearance with a lengthy description of a recent visit to the Tibet Autonomous Region, which he toured in a party of foreign diplomats. It was one of two closely-supervised Tibetan tours put on for mostly western diplomats this year, a sign that the Communist Party — bravado notwithstanding — still cares about what western countries say regarding its human rights record.It may also have been an attempt to switch foreign attention to Tibet from the even more problematic neighbouring region of Xinjiang, where China's heavy-handed persecution of the Muslim Uighur people is opening new fronts for confrontation with the West.Barton said that he had consulted with pro-Tibet groups and academics in Canada before accepting the trip, which he said he undertook partly to show Tibetans the world was still concerned about their plight.In addition to discussing what he'd seen on the tour — which took in a school, a monastery and greenhouses — Barton also talked about the motives of the Communist Party in allowing the trip. He said he understood that ""what I saw was not the complete picture on any issue"" and described one effort to escape his minders — when he left his hotel at 5 a.m. for an unaccompanied stroll through the streets of Lhasa.Barton once famously described himself as ""a bull on China"" and his entire pre-diplomatic career was built on viewing China primarily as a business opportunity.During his last committee appearance, Barton told members he ""would love to talk more about promoting trade and investment. I probably should shut up and move on, but I'm very excited by the opportunity we have on many fronts.""This time, he took his own advice and left out the economic boosterism — suggesting that the ambassador had not only learned to read the room but perhaps understood how the ground had shifted under him.""Countries all around the world are evolving their approach to China,"" he told the subcommittee Tuesday night. That's certainly true in Europe, where both public attitudes and government approaches to China have become considerably tougher over the course of 2020. Shachi Kurl of the Angus Reid Institute said Barton's changed tone also reflects new realities at home.""This isn't just about Canada and Ambassador Barton aligning with the Western consensus,"" she told CBC's Power and Politics. ""It really is about aligning with the Canadian consensus, because for several years we have seen a deterioration, and then a deterioration, and then a further deterioration in Canadian views of the Beijing regime.""Opinion polls do show a crashing decline in China's standing in Canadian public opinion, reaching what Kurl calls ""an all-time low"" as 2020 draws to a close.""You now find among the Canadian population a bloody-mindedness that says, 'You know what? This is not OK,'"" she said. ""This is about more than the human rights situation, this is about more than events in Hong Kong. What has really viscerally affected Canadians is the kidnapping of the two Michaels.""Obviously, the detention of Kovrig and Spavor was always intended by Beijing to be a pressure tactic — not a play for hearts and minds. But it hasn't worked as a pressure tactic and has instead backfired disastrously upon China's public image.Would the CCP judge the strategy wise in hindsight, or consider it a failure? Either way, the need to save face makes it hard for the Communist Party — famously averse to backing down on anything — to alter its course now.During his committee appearance, Barton praised the two Canadians for their resilience, which he said was an inspiration to him.Barton was eager to mend fences when asked about another Canadian detainee: Huseyin Celil, a Uighur rights activist from Burlington, Ont. who was snatched on behalf of Chinese authorities while visiting Uzbekistan 14 years ago, whisked across the border and given a life sentence.When asked about the case in February, Barton said he had not been able to visit Celil because Celil was not a Canadian citizen. Once again, he was echoing a view espoused by the government of China, which has refused to recognize the fact that Celil has been a Canadian citizen since 2001. Foreign Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne was forced to correct the record in the House of Commons a few days after Barton's misstatement.Two former ambassadors to China condemned Barton's mischaracterization of Celil. ""China doesn't get to determine who is or becomes a Canadian citizen,"" said David Mulroney, who represented Canada in Beijing from 2009 to 2012.This time, Barton described the steps he had taken to reach out to the Celil family in the wake of that embarrassing incident.There is still no sign of progress in Celil's case, however. His detention differs from that of Kovrig and Spavor in that Celil was not seized as a bargaining chip to pressure Canada, and his case predates the Huawei dispute.Instead, Celil's detention intersects with another issue that has raised tensions between China and Canada — one that also came up in one of the tenser moments in this week's meeting between Barton and MPs.Conservative MP Garnett Genuis pressed Barton to make a clear statement on China's suppression of its Uighur minority, who are concentrated in the far western Xinjiang region.He read out the recent words of the Trudeau government's newish ambassador to the UN, Bob Rae, who told CBC News ""there's no question that there's aspects of what the Chinese are doing that fits into the definition of genocide in the genocide convention."" Did Barton agree with that statement? The ambassador refused to be pinned down, saying that while the situation was ""very, very concerning,"" more reports from the area were needed.Rights activists are particularly suspicious of Barton on this file because the company he headed, McKinsey, earned a reputation for indifference to Uighur suffering while eagerly promoting the Chinese government's economic plans for their homeland.The company defended itself but faced harsh criticism — even from the traditional business press.""I think we need to see the reports,"" Barton said. ""I haven't talked to Ambassador Rae about the particular evidence he has on that side.""""We need to have independent people on the ground who can go wherever they want"" in Xinjiang in order to determine what's happening, he added. Genuis was skeptical. ""We'd love to get access,"" he said. ""I think there's realities in terms of whether that's ever going to be given.""""Is Mr. Rae's statement consistent with the government's policy, or is yours?"" Genuis asked.Barton minimized the gap between the two, arguing that Rae was also seeking more investigation. A noticeable difference remained, however, in how the two men described the situation."

"China's Sinopharm vaccine 86% effective, say United Arab Emirates officials | CBC News","The United Arab Emirates said Wednesday a Chinese coronavirus vaccine tested in the federation of sheikdoms is 86 per cent effective, in a statement that provided few details but marked the first public release of information on the efficacy of the shot.",2020-12-09T11:57:30.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/vaccine-sinopharm-uae-1.5833823,"The United Arab Emirates said Wednesday a Chinese coronavirus vaccine tested in the federation of sheikdoms is 86 per cent effective, in a statement that provided few details but marked the first public release of information on the efficacy of the shot.The announcement brought yet another shot into the worldwide race for a vaccine to end the pandemic, a scientific effort that has seen China and Russia compete with Western firms for an effective inoculation. While questions remain about the Sinopharm shot, already at least one country outside China plans to roll it out in a mass-vaccination campaign.The U.A.E., home to Dubai and Abu Dhabi, conducted a trial beginning in September of the vaccine by Chinese state-owned pharmaceutical giant Sinopharm involving 31,000 volunteers from 125 nations. Volunteers between 18 and 60 years old received two doses of the vaccine over 28 days.The U.A.E.'s Health and Prevention Ministry announced the results via a statement on the state-run WAM news agency, saying it has ""reviewed Sinopharm CNBG's interim analysis of the Phase III trials.""""The analysis shows no serious safety concerns,"" the statement said, without detailing whether any participant suffered side effects.It wasn't immediately clear if the announced results included only those taking part in the testing in the UAE or if they also include results from China and elsewhere. The statement described the vaccine as receiving ""official registration"" without elaborating on what that meant.Emirati officials and Sinopharm did not respond to questions from The Associated Press.However, calls Wednesday to SEHA, the Abu Dhabi health authority, included an option for individuals to schedule an appointment to receive a ""COVID-19 vaccine."" The centre was swamped with calls following the announcement on the vaccine's efficacy.The Sinopharm vaccine has been approved for emergency use in a few countries and the company is still conducting late-stage clinical trials in 10 countries. Morocco is gearing up for an ambitious COVID-19 vaccination program, aiming to vaccinate 80 per cent of its adults in an operation starting this month that's relying initially on the Sinopharm vaccine.Sinopharm's shot relies on a tested technology, using a killed virus to deliver the vaccine, similar to how polio immunizations are made. Leading Western competitors, like the shot made by Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech, use newer, less-proven technology to target the coronavirus's spike protein using RNA. The United Kingdom already has begun vaccinating people with the Pfizer shot.WATCH | Inside the scramble to mass produce a COVID-19 vaccine:The NationalTop officials in the UAE, including Dubai's ruler, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, have publicly received the shots as part of the vaccine testing.Already, Pfizer reports its shot as being 95 per cent effective, while another RNA candidate from Moderna appears to be 94.5 per cent effective. Results suggest a third vaccine from Oxford University and AstraZeneca is safe and about 70 per cent effective, but questions remain about how well it may help protect those over 55.In transport, Pfizer says its vaccine must be stored in a freezer at –80 C to –60 C or in a thermal container at –90 C to –60 C. The Moderna vaccine must remain at a temperature of –20 C.The Sinopharm vaccine is believed to be able to travel at a temperature of 2 C to 8 C, a major draw for areas of the world where nearly three billion people live without stable electricity and refrigeration. In November, the Communist Party secretary for Sinopharm said almost one million people in China had received its vaccine.Since the pandemic began, the UAE has detected over 178,000 cases of the virus, with 160,000 recoveries and nearly 600 deaths. Its aggressive testing policy has seen over 17 million tests conducted in a country home to just over nine million people."

Venezuelan opposition claims large turnout in anti-Maduro protest | CBC News,Droves of Venezuelans blaming President Nicolas Maduro for their country's collapse voiced their frustrations Saturday in a creative protest rivalling recent elections they boycotted as fraudulent.,2020-12-13T04:15:45.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/venezuela-opposition-maduro-protest-1.5839520,"Droves of Venezuelans blaming President Nicolas Maduro for their country's collapse voiced their frustrations Saturday in a creative protest rivalling recent elections they boycotted as fraudulent.In the so-called ""people's consultation,"" U.S.-backed opposition leader Juan Guaido urged Venezuelans at home and around the world to register their ire through cellphone apps. Others visited makeshift polling stations in cities across Venezuela and in other Latin American Nations, the U.S. and Europe.""Hope has been mobilized in Venezuela,"" Guaido said shortly before the results were announced. ""We must underscore a heroic people who mobilized throughout the country and the world in defence of their rights.""Opposition leaders reported that nearly 6.5 million people responded to the survey. The Associated Press could not independently verify the validity of the figures, and even some opposition election experts questioned the number.The opposition's report said more than 3.2 million participated in person within Venezuela and nearly 850,000 visited centres outside the country, while more than 2.5 million sent in their responses digitally.The survey asked whether people want to end Maduro's rule and hold fresh presidential and legislative elections, and also seek even greater pressure from international allies to make it happen.Though the event had no legal force, opposition leaders said the survey would unify the foes of Maduro. That includes the five million Venezuelans who have fled the nation's hyperinflation and lack of basic services such as reliable running water, electricity and gasoline, they said.Mirla De Lorenzo, a bank employee, visited a center in her Caracas neighborhood to participate, saying she would take any opportunity to express herself if there was any chance it could bring international attention to Venezuela's plight and trigger an end to Maduro's rule.""We're definitely tired of this situation that's brought us nothing but poverty,"" she said, adding that her daughter moved to Spain and her sister migrated to Chile, among relatives who have fled the crisis.""You can't compete with deceitful people, with people who use force, with people who have weapons,"" she said. ""There is no way.""The consultation came days after Maduro's ruling socialist party declared victory in congressional elections that Guaido's coalition boycotted, arguing the vote was a fraud. Canada, the U.S. and the European Union are among the nations and regional bodies that rejected the elections as undemocratic.Guaido, acting as the National Assembly's leader, proclaimed himself interim president in early 2019, arguing that Maduro was an illegitimate leader because his most popular challengers were barred from running in the presidential election the previous year.Guaido quickly won broad support at home among energized supporters who flooded the streets as well as the backing of leaders in dozens of nations, including the U.S. The Trump administration took the lead, imposing sanctions on Maduro, dozens of his political allies and the state-run oil firm PDVSA. The U.S. Justice Department also unveiled an indictment of Maduro charging him with being a ""narcoterrorist,"" and offered a $15 million USreward for his arrest.Nearly two years later, however, Maduro remains in power with control of the military and international allies including Iran, Russia, China, Turkey and Cuba.On Jan. 5, the term of the current opposition-dominated National Assembly ends and Maduro's political allies take over the last governmental body not controlled by the president's socialist party. Guaido and his political allies vow to continue fighting.Risa Grais-Targow, a Venezuela analyst for the Eurasia Group, said that in addition to seeking to unite Venezuelans who don't like Maduro, the symbolic referendum was meant to send a message to international supporters.""They've organized a process for their foreign partners from the U.S. to the European Union and regional governments,"" Grais-Targow said. ""So they can continue to back him even when he's no longer in control of the National Assembly.""The U.S. ambassador for Venezuela, James Story, praised the opposition's survey from Colombia's capital, where he has worked since the U.S. and Venezuela broke diplomatic relations and the U.S. closed its embassy in Caracas.""We're proud to see the people of Venezuela in the street voting for their right to democracy, justice, liberty,"" Story tweeted. ""Their voices have been heard. Democracy must return to Venezuela.""Support among Venezuelans for the opposition has waned amid growing frustrations over Maduro remaining in power.Maduro's popularity is even lower. Just 31 per cent of Venezuela's voters cast ballots in the Dec. 5 congressional elections — less than half the turnout for the 2015 legislative elections.Maduro's ruling party staged a celebration in the historic centre of Caracas on Saturday to mark the victories of their National Assembly candidates, including Maduro's wife and son. Politicians gave speeches condemning the domestic opposition and U.S. policy interference in Venezuela. Salsa music played and people danced.A political talk show on state television Saturday night featured a segment mocking the referendum by showing cellphone videos said to have been recorded by people who drove by survey centers in cities across the nation.""There's nobody, absolutely nobody,"" one unidentified driver says. ""Look there's four people standing around talking nonsense."""

That means many nations will likely have to choose some semblance of their 2021-22 national teams by the end of this season, since most of the world's tracks won't be iced and operating before those training weeks in China are held.""A replacement for the World Cup in March 2021 will be announced next week,"" Groesswang said.USA Bobsled and Skeleton and USA Luge are sitting out the pre-Christmas portions of the World Cup schedules in those sports, as are several other nations, because of concerns about international travel and other pandemic-related issues.In a women's World Cup bobsleigh race in Latvia on Saturday, only six sleds finished the two runs. That was believed to be the smallest World Cup field since women began competing on the circuit.It's been tradition for at least the last five Olympic cycles for a World Cup event to be held on that track that will host the games the following winter, and those races have been critical in terms of teams collecting data and formulating an Olympic strategy.But not having the training weeks and World Cups in China could raise the possibility of some nations, the U.S. included, not competing internationally at all this season."

"2 years after Meng Wanzhou's arrest, fate of 2 detained Canadians, China relationship hang in balance | CBC News","Two years after the arrest of Meng Wanzhou, the wife of Michael Kovrig, one of two Canadians detained in China, says she believes an end to the Huawei executive's extradition case would open the path to the detained men's liberation. But that end is still likely years away.",2020-12-01T09:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/meng-wanzhou-arrest-anniversary-michaels-1.5822546,"On a sweltering day last August, Michael Kovrig's wife sat in the back of a Vancouver courtroom, listening as lawyers for Meng Wanzhou and Canada's attorney general plotted out the coming months of the Huawei executive's extradition proceedings.It wasn't the first time Vina Nadjibulla had attended one of Meng's court dates.Her presence in B.C. Supreme Court represents a kind of collision of worlds: the slow drip of the legal process to determine if Meng should be extradited to the United States to face trial on charges of fraud and conspiracy on the one hand, and the urgent need for action on behalf of two Canadians whose fates appear tied to Meng's on the other.Kovrig, a former diplomat, and entrepreneur Michael Spavor were detained by Chinese authorities nine days after Meng's arrest at Vancouver International Airport on Dec. 1, 2018.They have  been charged with spying in a case most observers believe is simple retaliation for Canada's arrest of Huawei's chief financial officer at the request of the U.S.Nadjibulla is separated from Kovrig but remains his most vocal advocate. As the second anniversary of Meng's arrest rolls around, she says it has become impossible to detach Meng's situation from that of the two Michaels, as the men are known.""I have been following Meng's extradition case very closely because it is inextricably linked to Michael's unjust detention in China,"" Nadjibulla told CBC News.""I believe that an end to her extradition case, by one means or another, would open up the path to Michael's liberation as well.""It's been two years since Meng stepped off a Cathay Pacific flight from Hong Kong onto a jetway, where she was intercepted by Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) officers and her phones were bagged as RCMP officers watched unobserved from a short distance away.Police had obtained a provisional warrant for Meng's arrest the day before at the request of the U.S. Department of Justice.The 48-year-old is charged with lying to an HSBC banker in Hong Kong in August 2013 about Huawei's control of a subsidiary that is accused of violating U.S. economic sanctions against Iran.Prosecutors claim that by relying on Meng's alleged lies to continue a financial relationship with Huawei, HSBC was placed at risk of loss and prosecution.Meng has denied the accusations against her.""Ms. Meng is staying patient and positive,"" said Alykhan Velshi, vice-president of corporate affairs at Huawei Canada. ""It can be trying at times because she knows the charges against her are false. She believes that she's a pawn in a global game of chess.""But right from the start, she's always expressed faith in Canada's system of justice.""Meng is the daughter of Huawei's billionaire founder, Ren Zhengfei.Her arrest came as the United States was beginning a campaign to exclude Huawei from being part of the country's next generation of wireless technology — known as 5G. The U.S., one of five countries belonging to the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing network, has labelled the telecommunications giant a security threat and called on its allies to follow suit.Other members of the Five Eyes network — the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand — have all blocked the use of Huawei's technology, while Canada has still not decided if Huawei can be part of its 5G grid.Yves Tiberghien, a political science professor at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, said Meng's arrest has highlighted questions over the future of wireless technology, as well as the trade battle between the U.S. and China, which has its roots in concerns over intellectual property theft.But he said the case also speaks to the Americans' use of sanctions law and its financial system to pressure rivals, as well as China's hard-line tactics and lack of respect for human rights — as seen in the country's targeting of Canadian exports and the imprisonment of Kovrig and Spavor.""This is at the intersection of all those fault lines,"" Tiberghien said.""For Canadians, the No. 1 story is the two Michaels, and so there is a lot of frustration in Canada, and the plight of the two Michaels is a prism to understand a much more aggressive China.""The case also promises to test Canada's extradition law as Meng's legal team painstakingly exposes every element of the case to scrutiny — beginning with the moments that immediately followed her first steps on Canadian soil.CBSA officers questioned Meng for almost three hours before they handed her over to the RCMP. Her lawyers claim the two agencies conspired with the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation to have customs officers question her without a lawyer, in violation of her rights.The officers who were involved in the arrest have been on the witness stand in recent weeks, giving testimony that the defence is hoping can be used to bolster an argument to have the case tossed out next spring for alleged abuse of process.RCMP officers have testified that they deferred to CBSA jurisdiction as ""gatekeepers"" to Canada, and the border officers claimed that legitimate concerns about Meng as a potential national security threat warranted the beginning of an admissibility exam.But working against the Crown, a CBSA officer gave the RCMP a piece of paper on which he wrote the passcodes to her phones, allegedly by mistake. And an RCMP staff sergeant whom the defence accuses of sending the serial numbers belonging to Meng's electronic devices to the FBI is refusing to testify.All have denied any wrongdoing or collusion. Their testimony, originally scheduled to last two weeks, has expanded to at least four, likely pushing other dates in the extradition proceedings further into 2021.It's hard to know whether the evidence points to conspiracy, business as usual or a sloppiness that fits somewhere in the middle.Associate Chief Justice Heather Holmes has remarked on the huge amount of detail that has emerged from the testimony so far, asking the defence and the Crown to ready submissions on what it all means as she prepares to wade through it.The defence also plans to argue that U.S. President Donald Trump is using Meng as a bargaining chip in trade with China and that the United States deliberately misled Canada into the extradition proceedings by omitting key facts that undermined the strength of the case.Gary Botting, a Vancouver-based legal expert and author on extradition law, said he doesn't expect those arguments will ultimately be substantive enough to derail the proceedings. He agrees with high-profile supporters of the two Michaels — such as former Liberal justice minister Allan Rock and former Supreme Court of Canada justice Louise Arbour — who say there is nothing stopping Justice Minister David Lametti from intervening to end the case.The Liberal government has repeatedly stated that the rule of law has to play out in court before Lametti can weigh in, but over the summer, Rock, Arbour and others sought a legal opinion from Toronto lawyer Brian Greenspan, who said Lametti has the ability to act at any time.Botting said he thinks he should. The facts of the case are weak, he said, and he's troubled by Canada being pulled into a request involving a Chinese national, a British bank and a lie that allegedly happened in Hong Kong.""I think it's significant in the sense that it's very clear that the minister of justice has complete control over who is sent over to a foreign country upon a request for extradition,"" Botting said.""He can say no at any point.""Prime Minister Justin Trudeau recently congratulated U.S. president-elect Joe Biden on his victory in last month's election. He also brought up the issue of the two Michaels, but there's no indication of what a new U.S. administration might mean for the proceedings.Nadjibulla said she'll continue to attend Meng's court proceedings, which began last fall, if she can. And wait.""Given the complexities of this extradition request and absent an intervention by the U.S. or Canadian authorities, the legal process is likely to take years,"" she said.Meng has been living under a form of house arrest since her release on $10 million bail, a little more than a week after she was arrested.She is required to wear a GPS monitoring bracelet on her ankle and is trailed by around-the-clock security, whom she pays to ensure she doesn't travel beyond court-ordered boundaries that stop short of the ferry terminals and airport.It's a far cry from the conditions Kovrig and Spavor have endured since they were first detained in China. Kovrig has spent months in solitary confinement. The COVID-19 pandemic also meant both men were cut off from consular visits last January.They were only recently allowed two virtual visits with the Canadian ambassador.China has provided no evidence of the claims against them. They've also been given no idea of when they might face a trial.Unlike Meng, though, the outcome — if it comes to that — is in little doubt.Experts say China has a 99.9 per cent conviction rate."
"Champagne warns tough talk on China could hurt efforts to free Kovrig, Spavor | CBC News",Foreign Affairs Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne is warning that tough talk about China could hurt efforts to gain the release of two arbitrarily detained Canadians.,2020-11-24T13:40:45.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/champagne-china-committee-1.5813826,"Foreign Affairs Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne warned Monday that tough talk about China could hurt efforts to gain the release of two arbitrarily detained Canadians.Testifying before the House of Commons Canada-China relations committee, Champagne urged MPs to keep the fate of Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig in mind when they spout off about the perils and perfidy of China's Communist regime.""I know, Mr. Chair, that some like to talk tough on China,"" Champagne told the committee.""To those who are seduced by this one-dimensional view, I say this: while it is easy to be tough, let's continue to be smart. Let's not fall into the temptation of tough and irresponsible rhetoric that will generate no tangible result for Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, our farmers and entrepreneurs, and human rights victims and advocates.""The two Michaels, as they've come to be known, have been imprisoned in China for almost two years in retaliation for Canada's arrest of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou on an extradition request from the United States.Canadian farmers, fishers and exporters have also been hurt by retaliatory measures taken by China in the wake of Meng's arrest.Champagne's plea came a week after the House of Commons passed a Conservative motion calling on the government to decide by Dec. 18 whether to allow Huawei to be involved in development of Canada's next generation 5G wireless network.The motion, passed with the support of all opposition parties over the objections of the government, also called on the government to unveil within 30 days a robust plan to deal with growing intimidation by China of Canadians within Canada's borders.The motion is not binding and Champagne told the committee that government action on both fronts will be guided by national security requirements, not by arbitrary deadlines.Since taking over the helm of the Conservatives last August, Erin O'Toole has made standing up to China a central pillar of his pitch to Canadian voters.The Conservative leader has accused Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's Liberal government of being ""willing to look past the Chinese government's numerous human rights abuses, flagrant trade abuses and security issues because the potential to sell into the massive Chinese market was so lucrative.""""Trudeau's approach to China has failed, and it's weakened our standing in the world. We must stand up for our citizens who have been detained as bargaining chips in an extradition case, even if it leads to more reprisals from Beijing,"" O'Toole argued in an op-ed in the National Post in September.O'Toole has called for an ""eyes wide open"" approach to relations with China. But Champagne contended that's precisely the approach his government is taking.He argued that Canada's policy toward China has evolved as China itself has evolved, increasingly flouting the international rules-based order, violating the human rights of Uighurs in Xinjiang province and democracy protesters in Hong Kong, and engaging in ""coercive diplomacy"" to get its way.""The China of 2020 is not the China of 2015 or even the China of 2018,"" Champagne said.""We see a country and a leadership increasingly prepared to throw its weight around to advance its interests.""Champagne said the government has adopted a new framework for dealing with China. He described it as a three-pronged approach in which there will be areas, such as human rights abuses, where Canada needs to challenge China.In other areas, such as trade matters, he said Canada needs to compete with China, and still other areas where Canada needs to co-operate with China, such as the fight against climate change.China's more aggressive posture is not just a challenge for Canada, he argued. Countries around the world are grappling with it.Champagne said the best antidote is for all liberal democracies to band together to speak with one voice to pressure China to change its ways — just as Canada has rallied other countries to speak out against the detention of Kovrig and Spavor."
China blasts off on mission to collect moon rocks | CBC News,China launched an ambitious mission on Tuesday to bring back rocks and debris from the moon's surface for the first time in more than 40 years — an undertaking that could boost human understanding of the moon and of the solar system more generally.,2020-11-24T12:44:10.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/china-moon-mission-1.5813803,"China launched an ambitious mission on Tuesday to bring back rocks and debris from the moon's surface for the first time in more than 40 years — an undertaking that could boost human understanding of the moon and of the solar system more generally.Chang'e 5 — named for the Chinese moon goddess — is the country's boldest lunar mission yet. If successful, it would be a major advance for China's space program, and some experts say it could pave the way for bringing samples back from Mars or even a crewed lunar mission.The four modules of the Chang'e 5 spacecraft blasted off at just after 4:30 a.m. Tuesday (3:30 p.m. ET Monday) atop a massive Long March-5Y rocket from the Wenchang launch centre along the coast of the southern island province of Hainan.Minutes after liftoff, the spacecraft separated from the rocket's first and second stages and slipped into Earth-moon transfer orbit. About an hour later, Chang'e 5 opened its solar panels to provide its independent power source.Spacecraft typically take three days to reach the moon.The launch was carried live by national broadcaster CCTV which then switched to computer animation to show its progress into outer space.The mission's key task is to drill 2 metres beneath the moon's surface and scoop up about 2 kilograms of rocks and other debris to be brought back to Earth, according to NASA. That would offer the first opportunity for scientists to study newly obtained lunar material since the American and Russian missions of the 1960s and 1970s.With Chang’e 5, China has launched an effort to join the U.S. &amp; the former Soviet Union in obtaining lunar samples. We hope China shares its data with the global scientific community to enhance our understanding of the Moon like our Apollo missions did &amp; the Artemis program will. <a href=""https://t.co/mPjG4FE0qQ"">pic.twitter.com/mPjG4FE0qQ</a>The Chang'e 5 lander's time on the moon is scheduled to be short and sweet. It can only stay one lunar daytime, or about 14 Earth days, because it lacks the radioisotope heating units to withstand the moon's freezing nights.The lander will dig for materials with its drill and robotic arm and transfer them to what's called an ascender, which will lift off from the moon and dock with the service capsule. The materials will then be moved to the return capsule to be hauled back to Earth.The technical complexity of Chang'e 5, with its four components, makes it ""remarkable in many ways,"" said Joan Johnson-Freese, a space expert at the U.S. Naval War College.""China is showing itself capable of developing and successfully carrying out sustained high-tech programs, important for regional influence and potentially global partnerships,"" she said.In particular, the ability to collect samples from space is growing in value, said Jonathan McDowell, an astronomer at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. Other countries planning to retrieve material from asteroids or even Mars may look to China's experience, he said.While the mission is ""indeed challenging,"" McDowell said China has already landed twice on the moon with its Chang'e 3 and Chang'e 4 missions, and showed with a 2014 Chang'e 5 test mission that it can navigate back to Earth, re-enter and land a capsule. All that's left is to show it can collect samples and take off again from the moon.""As a result of this, I'm pretty optimistic that China can pull this off,"" he said.The mission is among China's boldest since it first put a man in space in 2003, becoming only the third nation to do so after the U.S. and Russia.Oh! Cheeky shot of the return capsule <a href=""https://t.co/pymZvYTltG"">pic.twitter.com/pymZvYTltG</a>Chang'e 5 and future lunar missions aim to ""provide better technical support for future scientific and exploration activities,"" Pei Zhaoyu, mission spokesperson and deputy director of the Chinese National Space Administration's Lunar Exploration and Space Engineering Center told reporters at a Monday briefing.""Scientific needs and technical and economic conditions"" would determine whether China decides to send a crewed mission to the moon, said Pei, whose comments were embargoed until after the launch. ""I think future exploration activities on the moon are most likely to be carried out in a human-machine combination.""While many of China's crewed spaceflight achievements, including building an experimental space station and conducting a spacewalk, reproduce those of other countries from years past, the CNSA is now moving into new territory.Chang'e 4 — which made the first soft landing on the moon's relatively unexplored far side almost two years ago — is currently collecting full measurements of radiation exposure from the lunar surface, information vital for any country that plans to send astronauts to the moon.China in July became one of three countries to have launched a mission to Mars, in China's case an orbiter and a rover that will search for signs of water on the Red Planet. The CNSA says the spacecraft Tianwen 1 is on course to arrive at Mars around February.China has increasingly engaged with foreign countries on missions, and the European Space Agency will be providing important ground station information for Chang'e 5.U.S. law, however, still prevents most collaborations with NASA, excluding China from partnering with the International Space Station. That has prompted China to start work on its own space station and launch its own programs that have put it in a steady competition with Japan and India, among Asian nations seeking to notch new achievements in space.China's space program has progressed cautiously, with relatively few setbacks in recent years. The rocket being used for the current launch failed on a previous launch attempt, but has since performed without a glitch, including launching Chang'e 4.""China works very incrementally, developing building blocks for long-term use for a variety of missions,"" Freese-Johnson said. China's one-party authoritarian system also allows for ""prolonged political will that is often difficult in democracies,"" she said.While the U.S. has followed China's successes closely, it's unlikely to expand cooperation with China in space amid political suspicions, a sharpening military rivalry and accusations of Chinese theft of technology, experts say.""A change in U.S. policy regarding space cooperation is unlikely to get much government attention in the near future,"" Johnson-Freese said."

China congratulates Biden on U.S. election win | CBC News,China on Friday became one of the last major countries to congratulate U.S. president-elect Joe Biden.,2020-11-13T15:24:54.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/china-biden-us-election-1.5800598,"China on Friday became one of the last major countries to congratulate U.S. president-elect Joe Biden.China, along with Russia, avoided joining the throng that congratulated Biden last weekend after he and vice-presidential running mate Kamala Harris secured enough electoral college votes to unseat President Donald Trump.""We respect the choice of the American people,"" said a foreign ministry spokesperson, Wang Wenbin. ""We congratulate Mr. Biden and Ms. Harris.""Wang gave no reason for the delay but said, ""the result will be confirmed according to U.S. laws and procedures.""U.S.-Chinese relations have plunged to their lowest level in decades amid a tariff war over Beijing's technology ambitions and trade surplus, accusations of spying, and tension over human rights, the coronavirus pandemic, Hong Kong and control of the South China Sea.Trump labelled China a security threat and imposed export curbs and other sanctions on Chinese companies. On Thursday, he stepped up those sanctions by issuing an order that bars Americans from investing in securities issued by companies U.S. officials say are owned or controlled by the Chinese military.Forecasters had said even if he lost his re-election bid, Trump was likely to try to increase pressure on Beijing before he leaves office on Jan. 20.Political analysts expect Biden to try to resume co-operation with Beijing on climate change, North Korea, Iran and the coronavirus. However, economists and political analysts expect few big changes due to widespread frustration with Beijing's trade and human rights record, as well as accusations of spying and technology theft.""A tough stance on China has broad support across the U.S. political spectrum,"" Louis Kuijs of Oxford Economics said in a report this week. ""Biden's own pronouncements and policy program suggest he will continue to try to maintain the U.S. technological lead and to attract manufacturing activity.""Some forecasters suggest the change from Trump — who rejected multilateral alliances — to Biden might increase pressure on China if Washington forms a coalition with other developed countries to push for policy changes.China has tried to recruit Germany, France, South Korea and other governments as allies against Washington but all have refused. They criticized Trump's trade tactics of surprise tariff hikes, which also were used against allies, but echoed U.S. complaints that China is violating its free-trade commitments.Some Chinese trade experts have suggested Beijing might try to renegotiate the Phase 1 agreement signed in January as a first step toward ending the trade war. It calls for China to increase purchases of U.S. goods in exchange for postponing further tariff hikes. But that came before the coronavirus derailed global trade, leaving China behind on meeting its commitments.Renegotiation might fit a ""more strategic, longer-term orientation"" expected from a Biden administration, but he ""cannot be seen to be 'soft' on China"" after the ""hard rhetoric"" of the campaign, Kuijs said.Chinese leaders were quieter during this year's election than in the 2016 presidential race, when they favoured Trump over former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. They disliked her for carrying out then-President Barack Obama's foreign policy, which included pressuring Beijing on human rights. Trump's public image of business success resonated with the Chinese public.Trump shook up China's leaders by hiking tariffs on Chinese products in 2018 over complaints Beijing steals or pressures companies to hand over technology.The White House has lobbied allies to exclude telecom equipment giant Huawei Technologies Ltd., China's first global tech brand, from next-generation telecom networks on security grounds. Huawei's access to American components and technology was cut off over the past year, threatening to cripple its global sales.Trump is also trying to bar Chinese social media companies from the United States, citing fears they might gather too much personal information about Americans. The White House is pressing video service TikTok to sell its U.S. operation and is trying to block companies from dealing with WeChat, the popular Chinese message service.Trump has not been vocal on the subject of human rights, rarely mentioning the plight of Hong Kong democracy activists or the detained Uighurs in Xinjiang, though members of his administration such as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have taken up that role.Former U.S. national security adviser John Bolton even alleged in his recent book that Trump expressed his support to Chinese President Xi Jinping over the building of camps to detain the Muslim minority Uighurs, though Trump angrily denied that claim.Despite the contentious issues, Trump spoke favourably of his personal relationship with Xi for over three years, dialling back such talk as the coronavirus pandemic, first noticed in China, spread throughout the U.S.All of the G7 nations and the majority of G20 countries have now congratulated the U.S. president-elect. Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, on friendly terms with Trump, has been an exception, though on Friday his vice-president Hamilton Mourao said that Biden's victory in the election was ""becoming more and more irreversible.""Mexico's President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has been cautious, saying he wants to wait until U.S. states certified election results in the coming weeks before congratulating a winner.The Kremlin said on Monday it would wait for the official results of the election before commenting on its outcome, but Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov was at least contemplating a change in administration, telling reporters on Thursday he thought U.S. foreign policy under Biden would be similar to that seen under Obama, especially on Iran and climate change."

Canada-China relations frayed at 50,"“This is something which we shall never forget.” Those were just some of the strong words Canada’s new ambassador to the UN, Bob Rae, shared last week in reference to China’s treatment of Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor. The two Canadians have been detained in Chinese prison for well over 600 days, and just last weekend received their first consular visit since January. On a week that also marks 50 years since Trudeau Sr. established diplomatic ties with the country, Rosie and Elamin wonder: what might Canada-China relations look like from here on in?

Bob Rae calls on UN to investigate evidence of genocide against China's Uighur minority | CBC News,Canada’s ambassador to the United Nations says he’s called on the organization’s Human Rights Council to investigate whether China’s persecution of Uighurs in Xinjiang province should be considered an act of genocide.,2020-11-15T18:59:38.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/bob-rae-genocide-investigation-uighur-minority-1.5802920,"Canada's ambassador to the United Nations says he's called on the organization's Human Rights Council to investigate whether China's persecution of Uighurs in Xinjiang province should be considered an act of genocide.""There's no question that there's aspects of what the Chinese are doing that fits into the definition of genocide in the genocide convention,"" Bob Rae told CBC Chief Political Correspondent Rosemary Barton. ""But that then requires you to go through a process of gathering information and of making sure that we've got the evidence that would support that kind of an allegation.""Last month, a House of Commons subcommittee tabled a report concluding that China's treatment of the mostly Muslim minority — including mass detentions in concentration camps, forced labour and population control measures such as forced sterilization — meets the definition of genocide.The Chinese foreign ministry lashed out at the report's findings, calling it ""full of lies and disinformation"" and warned parliamentarians to ""avoid doing any further damage to China-Canada relations.""Arif Virani, the parliamentary secretary to Canada's justice minister and attorney general, has told the Commons that ""it is genocide that appears to be taking place today in China.""Foreign Affairs Minister François-Philippe Champagne previously said he is ""deeply disturbed"" by the committee's report, but did not say whether Ottawa would impose sanctions on Chinese officials responsible for mistreatment of Uighurs living in Xinjiang province.Rae, who previously served as Canada's special envoy to Myanmar, said Canada cannot turn a blind eye to the plight facing China's Uighur population. ""But as I've learned in my work on the Rohingya, there's a big difference between information and evidence. And what we have to do now is see how we can gather evidence in order to carry out further steps, according to the genocide convention,"" he said in an interview on Rosemary Barton Live.China continued its backlash efforts on Monday, with Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian calling Rae's genocide comments ""ignorant."" He went on to suggest Canada's population growth rates better suit the definition of a country committing genocide.""It seems that it is not the Uighurs who are persecuted but rather the people of Canada, am I right? You can see how ridiculous the ambassador's statement is,"" Zhao told a media briefing in Beijing.""A piece of advice for him: do some homework before crafting a publicity stunt, so as not to make a fool of himself.""Canada joined 38 other United Nations member countries last month in calling on China ""to allow immediate, meaningful and unfettered access to Xinjiang for independent observers,"" including the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights and her office.""We are gravely concerned about the human rights situation in Xinjiang,"" read the joint declaration to the UN General Assembly's Third Committee. ""We call on China to respect human rights, particularly the rights of persons belonging to religious and ethnic minorities.""A number of activist groups have already urged the agency's Human Rights Council to probe potential human rights violations and to implement commitments on genocide prevention. As for efforts to secure the release of detained Canadians Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, Rae said it's an issue many are seized with resolving.""It's not simply about doing what we have to do with the UN to draw attention to it. It's also about doing the work in Beijing and in Washington and Ottawa and everywhere else to make sure that we can get these two people released.""Kovrig and Spavor were detained in China in December 2018, days after Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou was arrested in Vancouver at the request of U.S. authorities, who allege she violated U.S. sanctions on doing business with Iran.During a meeting of the UN General Assembly last month, Rae had harsh words for his Chinese counterpart over comments that Canada was bullying China.""When you say to a country of 35 million people that we are somehow bullying a nation of over a billion — one of the great superpowers of the world — and they have chosen to treat these two Canadian citizens in this way, this is something which we shall never forget,"" Rae said.""If you think that insulting us or insulting my country or insulting anyone is going to help in resolving this situation, you are sadly mistaken,"" he added.Reflecting on that meeting, Rae told Barton that he was attempting to make a case to other General Assembly members that the ""practice of arbitrary detention...is frankly disgraceful.""Rae succeeded Marc-André Blanchard as Canada's Permanent Representative to the UN in New York in August, assuming the role during the final months of the U.S presidential election.In an interview on Rosemary Barton Live last week, Foreign Affairs Minister François-Philippe Champagne said he hoped to work with president-elect Joe Biden and other leaders to ""rebuild"" relationships with multilateral organizations like the UN and the World Health Organization.""I think there's going to be more engagement on the multilateral front...for example, on the environment,"" Rae said, citing Biden's promise to rejoin the Paris Agreement.Rae said he also expects to see improved engagement on other issues, including tackling the COVID-19 pandemic and renewed support for the WHO.""I think on a whole range of those fronts, things will be better. There's still lots of disruptive forces...but having one less is a good thing."""

Central Grand Restaurant — 295-1623 Centre St. N.Carson says she thinks the spice in this ginger beef tasted like cinnamon, which she wasn't a big fan of.However, she says the dish did have a solid batter-to-beef ratio.3.

Kam Han Szechuan House — 2318 Spiller Rd.

Silver Inn Restaurant — 2702 Centre St. N.Carson says the original ginger beef spot is still the best in her books.She says their dish was not too sweet and had superb beef-to-batter ratio.""You can see the beef and it is tender with a fabulous crunchy batter,"" she said.She says it came with a deep red hued chili oil sauce, which had a fantastic depth of flavour and a perfect heat kick.""You gotta make your way to this mecca to get the real thing. It will be a revelation.""Do you have favourite ginger beef that isn't on the list?

The acid test: Western diplomats ponder the problem of dealing with a more aggressive China | CBC News,"International affairs experts are fond of saying that China's weakness as a superpower is that it lacks friends. But for China's geopolitical foes and rivals, alliances are only as strong as the political will behind them.",2020-11-21T09:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/china-pompeo-coons-halifax-forum-1.5811099,"It was an ominous beginning to an ominous conversation about how western democracies should face the growing authoritarian reflexes of China on the world stage.One of the marquee panels at the Halifax International Security Forum, held virtually this year, began on Friday with a grainy, grey video of an elephant being chased and eventually overpowered by a pride of lions.It was a stark visual metaphor for Beijing's relative isolation as a world power — the fact that China is a powerful nation with few allies, while western democracies are overwhelming when they act in concert.There was, however, a palpable sense of dismay among some of the panellists when the conversation turned to whether the international community is a pride of lions or a collection of kittens.Emily Lau, a former democratic legislator in Hong Kong, delivered a sobering warning that China's expanded political and security crackdown in the former British-administered territory is an acid test of western strength and resolve.""We are sort of disappearing before the world's eyes,"" Lau said via video conference from Hong Kong. ""What is disappearing? Our freedom. Our personal safety. The rule of law.""Appealing to Beijing for fairness and respect ""doesn't get us anywhere,"" she added.A year ago at the same forum, Lau accepted the John McCain Prize for Leadership in Public Service. She and democratic activist Figo Chan represented the people of Hong Kong in accepting the award after months of street protests and violence that drew global attention.Lau said she hopes like-minded countries, with core values of freedom and democracy, can work together to ""convince China to be reasonable.""Under an international agreement signed with Britain in the late 1990s, Beijing guaranteed Hong Kong's system of government, including its political and economic freedom, for half a century. The recent introduction of new security legislation and an ongoing political crackdown violate the spirit, if not the letter, of that agreement, said Lau.""The way China treats Hong Kong will be very indicative to the whole world of how China will behave,"" she said. ""If China cannot keep the promise, then how can China act as a responsible, respectable member of the international community?""There has been a lot of international attention focused on Hong Kong during the past year, but Lau said things have only gotten worse over that time — with the rooting out of opposition members in the city's legislature, the imposition of the national security law and the postponement of elections.U.S. Democratic Senator Chris Coons — whose name is being mentioned a lot as Washington insiders handicap various candidates for the secretary of state post in the incoming administration of president-elect Joe Biden — said one of the first priorities for the new government will be to reinvigorate alliances.It may take a lot more than that, though.Liam Fox, Britain's former defence secretary, said western democracies are suffering through a crisis of confidence — doubts which have allowed authoritarian regimes to rise and fill the space in the developing world.""If we don't believe what we stand for is better, if we don't believe in the rule of law, democracy, freedom, why should anyone else listen to us?"" Fox said. ""I believe we have to reassert a belief in our core values.""With tangled supply chains that wrap around the globe, the business of standing up to China is not solely a political responsibility, said the Trump administration's top diplomat.""Governments need to do their part,"" said U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in recorded remarks. He noted that countries which have stood up to China have paid a price for it.He acknowledged that Canada had ""done a good job"" but went on to say the corporate sector, which makes an enormous amount of money in China, ""has a moral responsibility to think through the activities their companies are engaged in, and whether that is in their own host country's best national security interest.""Pompeo made no reference to Canada's detention of Meng Wanzhou, the Chinese telecom executive, nor to the imprisonment of Canadians Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor."

China's economy accelerates as virus recovery gains strength | CBC News,China's shaky economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic is gaining strength as consumers return to shopping malls and auto dealerships while the United States and Europe endure painful contractions.,2020-10-19T10:24:23.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/china-economy-1.5767499,"China's shaky economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic is gaining strength as consumers return to shopping malls and auto dealerships while the United States and Europe endure painful contractions.Growth in the world's second-largest economy accelerated to 4.9 per cent over a year earlier in the three months ending in September, up from the previous quarter's 3.2 per cent, official data showed Monday. Retail spending rebounded to above pre-virus levels for the first time and factory output rose, boosted by demand for exports of masks and other medical supplies.China is the only major economy that is expected to grow this year while activity in the United States, Europe and Japan shrinks.The recovery is ""broadening out and becoming less reliant"" on government stimulus, Julian Evans-Pritchard of Capital Economics said in a report. He said growth is ""still accelerating"" heading into the present quarter.Most Asian stock markets rose on the news of increased activity in China, the biggest trading partner for all of its neighbours. Japan's Nikkei 225 index added 1.1 per cent while Hong Kong's Hang Seng climbed 0.9 per cent. Markets in South Korea and Australia also rose.China's benchmark Shanghai Composite Index lost 0.7 per cent on expectations the relatively strong data will reduce the likelihood of additional stimulus that might boost share prices.China, where the pandemic began in December, became the first major economy to return to growth after the ruling Communist Party declared the disease under control in March and began reopening factories, shops and offices.The economy contracted by 6.8 per cent in the first quarter, its worst performance since at least the mid-1960s, before rebounding.The economy ""continued the steady recovery,"" the National Bureau of Statistics said in a report. However, it warned, ""the international environment is still complicated and severe."" It said China faces great pressure to prevent a resurgence of the virus.Authorities have lifted curbs on travel and business but visitors to government and other public buildings still are checked for the virus's telltale fever. Travellers arriving from abroad must be quarantined for two weeks.Last week, more than 10 million people were tested for the virus in the eastern port of Qingdao after 12 cases were found there. That broke a two-month streak with no virus transmissions reported within China.Industrial production rose 5.8 per cent over the same quarter last year, a marked improvement over the first half's 1.3 per cent contraction. Chinese exporters are taking market share from foreign competitors that still are hampered by anti-virus controls.Retail sales rose 0.9 per cent over a year earlier. That was up from a 7.2 per cent contraction in the first half as consumers, already anxious about a slowing economy and a tariff war with Washington, put off buying. Online commerce rose 15.3 per cent.In a sign demand is accelerating, sales in September rose 3.3 per cent.""China's recovery in private consumption is gathering momentum,"" said Stephen Innes of AxiCorp in a report.Economists say China is likely to recover faster than other major economies due to the ruling party's decision to impose the most intensive anti-disease measures in history. Those temporarily cut off most access to cities with a total of 60 million people.The International Monetary Fund is forecasting China's economic growth at 1.8 per cent this year while the U.S. economy is expected to shrink by 4.3 per cent. The IMF expects a 9.8 per cent contraction in France, 6 per cent in Germany and 5.3 per cent in Japan.Private sector analysts say as much as 30 per cent of China's urban workforce, or up to 130 million people, may have lost their jobs at least temporarily. They say as many as 25 million jobs might be lost for good this year."

Canada's ties to China's military underscore the weird contradictions in its foreign policy | CBC News,It's been obvious for some time that there is something a little weird about the way Canada approaches its relationship with China — a disconnect brought into sharp relief this week by the news that Global Affairs and the Department of National Defence were not on the same page when it came to military ties and training involving the People’s Liberation Army.,2020-12-12T09:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canada-china-pla-peoples-liberation-army-1.5838658,"It's been obvious for some time that there is something weird about the way Canada approaches its relationship with China — a disconnect brought into sharp relief this week by the news that Global Affairs and the Department of National Defence were not on the same page when it came to military ties and training involving the People's Liberation Army.In some respects, the volcanic online political eruption which followed stories in The Globe and Mail and other media outlets, based on exclusive access to information documents, was predictable, as was the flurry of finger-pointing in the House of Commons on Thursday and Friday.Diplomats were alarmed when Gen. Jonathan Vance, the country's senior military commander, cancelled winter military exercises with the PLA in 2019, fretting that it might aggravate Beijing or make the lives of Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor even worse.It makes for fire-breathing memes, sizzling copy and wonderful political theatre.What's missing, though, is a recognition that Canada's policy toward a rising China has been contradictory and incoherent for almost a decade, maybe more, said Charles Burton, a political scientist at Brock University in St. Catharines, Ont. and a respected China expert at the Macdonald-Laurier Institute.""Cabinets were always split on China, whether it's Liberal or Conservative,"" Burton said, referring to debates more than three decades ago during the government of former prime minister Brian Mulroney.It is more urgent than ever, in the context of an increasingly belligerent and assertive China, to present a united political front, he added.""This is really about the defence of our sovereignty and security on matters over which there is consensus across the political spectrum in Canada,"" he said.Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan, in an attempt at political damage control late this week, made a point of saying that Chinese troops are no longer training for winter warfare at Garrison Petawawa, Ont.He also (rather meekly) noted that the exchange and training program with the PLA was instituted in August 2013 under the Conservatives while defence critic James Bezan, one of the most vocal and fiery opponents this week, was parliamentary secretary of defence.Bezan's retort was along the lines of that was then, this is now.""The defence minister knows full well that the Chinese government back then and the Chinese government today are completely different,"" Bezan said during question period on Thursday.It was a different time, no question.Chinese President Xi Jinping had taken office only a few months before, and the Department of National Defence (DND) tasking order that established the exchange program, obtained by CBC News under access to information, noted that working with the PLA ""complements the Government of Canada led efforts to broaden our bilateral relationship with China.""After years of hectoring and hammering China, the Conservatives — under former prime minister Stephen Harper — had decided that limited engagement was the way to go.And here is where Canada's curious incoherence comes into play.At precisely the moment the former chief of the defence staff, the now-retired general Tom Lawson, was penning the Canadian military's marching orders on closer cooperation with the PLA, the foreign affairs ministry — led at the time by John Baird — was firing off flares about China's unilateral declaration of an air defence zone in the East China Sea.It was a bellwether moment.""The U.S. has indicated deep concern over the establishment of the Chinese ADIZ stating that the U.S. views this development as a destabilizing attempt to alter the status quo in the region and that this move increases the risk of misunderstanding and miscalculations,"" said a Nov. 23, 2013 briefing note to Baird, obtained by CBC News in 2017.""More broadly, the rise of China is reshaping the strategic landscape.""Burton said the rise of President Xi marked the beginning of the new, more aggressive China. The establishment of the air zone — now largely forgotten against a backdrop of fortified artificial islands in the South China Sea, reports of Uyghurs in concentration camps and the haze of tear gas in Hong Kong — marked the first step.So were our politicians and senior leaders paying attention not only to events, but to what other federal departments were saying?According to what former foreign affairs minister (and current finance minister) Chrystia Freeland had to say in question period this week, the answer is yes.""I have long personal experience reporting on authoritarian communist regimes and I am very aware of the threat they pose,"" she said.Here's the question no one seemed to ask this week: why was the military exchange and training program still going on even before hostage diplomacy swept up the two Michaels?National Defence is no stranger to suspicions about China, having spent an enormous amount of time quietly defending itself from cyberattacks purportedly launched by  Beijing or by groups associated with it.The Trump administration has been tightening the screws on China from a diplomatic, security and trade perspective. There has been considerable, growing debate among Western allies — led by the Americans — about the downside of military engagement and co-operation with China, with Five Eyes intelligence partners each exchanging their own warnings — a series of discussions that eventually prompted Canada's current top military commander, Gen. Jonathan Vance, to cancel the winter warfare exercises.And then, of course, there's debate over the telecom giant Huawei and its future in this country.The signs were all there, Burton said — but no one actually woke up to the problem until Kovrig and Spavor were imprisoned. The public has been galvanized, he added, but ""it doesn't seem to have penetrated fully to the senior levels of the political and economic elite.""Burton said that — as weird as it might sound, with everything else that has happened — he believes there are some within the Canadian Establishment who still cling to the notion that if the ""consular cases of Spavor and Kovrig are resolved, we can go back"" to business as usual."

"As Canadians sour on China, an ambassador changes his tone | CBC News","Dominic Barton, Canada's ambassador to China, made his first appearance at the China committee this week since before the pandemic hit Canada. He was noticeably less forgiving of Beijing and less bullish on business opportunities than last time — perhaps reflecting a turn against China in public opinion.",2020-12-10T09:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/china-kovrig-spavor-dominic-barton-1.5835036,"Today marks two years since the two Michaels were detained by China.It's also been ten long pandemic months since Canada's ambassador to Beijing, Dominic Barton, made his previous appearance before the Commons subcommittee on Canada-China relations. Tuesday's second round of that hearing showed how much the mood around China has changed during 2020. Barton appeared conscious of the need to make some repairs to the impression he left in February, when his testimony drew unusually direct criticism from former diplomats with experience working in China.Back then, Barton suggested that it was incumbent upon Canadians to recognize that ""China values unity and the needs of society at large, rather than freedom of individual choice ... we just have to understand that.""Former diplomat and China expert Charles Burton told the subcommittee that Barton's words parroted Communist Party propaganda asserting that Chinese culture is inherently averse to liberty and democracy — when in fact the aversion comes from Xi Jinping's Politburo.Watch: Trudeau says government will examine all options to bring Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig.:Politics NewsIn his Tuesday appearance, however, Barton opened with remarks on ""our efforts to promote rights and freedoms in China.""""We are concerned by the decline of civil and political rights in China,"" he told MPs.Barton began his appearance with a lengthy description of a recent visit to the Tibet Autonomous Region, which he toured in a party of foreign diplomats. It was one of two closely-supervised Tibetan tours put on for mostly western diplomats this year, a sign that the Communist Party — bravado notwithstanding — still cares about what western countries say regarding its human rights record.It may also have been an attempt to switch foreign attention to Tibet from the even more problematic neighbouring region of Xinjiang, where China's heavy-handed persecution of the Muslim Uighur people is opening new fronts for confrontation with the West.Barton said that he had consulted with pro-Tibet groups and academics in Canada before accepting the trip, which he said he undertook partly to show Tibetans the world was still concerned about their plight.In addition to discussing what he'd seen on the tour — which took in a school, a monastery and greenhouses — Barton also talked about the motives of the Communist Party in allowing the trip. He said he understood that ""what I saw was not the complete picture on any issue"" and described one effort to escape his minders — when he left his hotel at 5 a.m. for an unaccompanied stroll through the streets of Lhasa.Barton once famously described himself as ""a bull on China"" and his entire pre-diplomatic career was built on viewing China primarily as a business opportunity.During his last committee appearance, Barton told members he ""would love to talk more about promoting trade and investment. I probably should shut up and move on, but I'm very excited by the opportunity we have on many fronts.""This time, he took his own advice and left out the economic boosterism — suggesting that the ambassador had not only learned to read the room but perhaps understood how the ground had shifted under him.""Countries all around the world are evolving their approach to China,"" he told the subcommittee Tuesday night. That's certainly true in Europe, where both public attitudes and government approaches to China have become considerably tougher over the course of 2020. Shachi Kurl of the Angus Reid Institute said Barton's changed tone also reflects new realities at home.""This isn't just about Canada and Ambassador Barton aligning with the Western consensus,"" she told CBC's Power and Politics. ""It really is about aligning with the Canadian consensus, because for several years we have seen a deterioration, and then a deterioration, and then a further deterioration in Canadian views of the Beijing regime.""Opinion polls do show a crashing decline in China's standing in Canadian public opinion, reaching what Kurl calls ""an all-time low"" as 2020 draws to a close.""You now find among the Canadian population a bloody-mindedness that says, 'You know what? This is not OK,'"" she said. ""This is about more than the human rights situation, this is about more than events in Hong Kong. What has really viscerally affected Canadians is the kidnapping of the two Michaels.""Obviously, the detention of Kovrig and Spavor was always intended by Beijing to be a pressure tactic — not a play for hearts and minds. But it hasn't worked as a pressure tactic and has instead backfired disastrously upon China's public image.Would the CCP judge the strategy wise in hindsight, or consider it a failure? Either way, the need to save face makes it hard for the Communist Party — famously averse to backing down on anything — to alter its course now.During his committee appearance, Barton praised the two Canadians for their resilience, which he said was an inspiration to him.Barton was eager to mend fences when asked about another Canadian detainee: Huseyin Celil, a Uighur rights activist from Burlington, Ont. who was snatched on behalf of Chinese authorities while visiting Uzbekistan 14 years ago, whisked across the border and given a life sentence.When asked about the case in February, Barton said he had not been able to visit Celil because Celil was not a Canadian citizen. Once again, he was echoing a view espoused by the government of China, which has refused to recognize the fact that Celil has been a Canadian citizen since 2001. Foreign Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne was forced to correct the record in the House of Commons a few days after Barton's misstatement.Two former ambassadors to China condemned Barton's mischaracterization of Celil. ""China doesn't get to determine who is or becomes a Canadian citizen,"" said David Mulroney, who represented Canada in Beijing from 2009 to 2012.This time, Barton described the steps he had taken to reach out to the Celil family in the wake of that embarrassing incident.There is still no sign of progress in Celil's case, however. His detention differs from that of Kovrig and Spavor in that Celil was not seized as a bargaining chip to pressure Canada, and his case predates the Huawei dispute.Instead, Celil's detention intersects with another issue that has raised tensions between China and Canada — one that also came up in one of the tenser moments in this week's meeting between Barton and MPs.Conservative MP Garnett Genuis pressed Barton to make a clear statement on China's suppression of its Uighur minority, who are concentrated in the far western Xinjiang region.He read out the recent words of the Trudeau government's newish ambassador to the UN, Bob Rae, who told CBC News ""there's no question that there's aspects of what the Chinese are doing that fits into the definition of genocide in the genocide convention."" Did Barton agree with that statement? The ambassador refused to be pinned down, saying that while the situation was ""very, very concerning,"" more reports from the area were needed.Rights activists are particularly suspicious of Barton on this file because the company he headed, McKinsey, earned a reputation for indifference to Uighur suffering while eagerly promoting the Chinese government's economic plans for their homeland.The company defended itself but faced harsh criticism — even from the traditional business press.""I think we need to see the reports,"" Barton said. ""I haven't talked to Ambassador Rae about the particular evidence he has on that side.""""We need to have independent people on the ground who can go wherever they want"" in Xinjiang in order to determine what's happening, he added. Genuis was skeptical. ""We'd love to get access,"" he said. ""I think there's realities in terms of whether that's ever going to be given.""""Is Mr. Rae's statement consistent with the government's policy, or is yours?"" Genuis asked.Barton minimized the gap between the two, arguing that Rae was also seeking more investigation. A noticeable difference remained, however, in how the two men described the situation."

"China's Sinopharm vaccine 86% effective, say United Arab Emirates officials | CBC News","The United Arab Emirates said Wednesday a Chinese coronavirus vaccine tested in the federation of sheikdoms is 86 per cent effective, in a statement that provided few details but marked the first public release of information on the efficacy of the shot.",2020-12-09T11:57:30.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/vaccine-sinopharm-uae-1.5833823,"The United Arab Emirates said Wednesday a Chinese coronavirus vaccine tested in the federation of sheikdoms is 86 per cent effective, in a statement that provided few details but marked the first public release of information on the efficacy of the shot.The announcement brought yet another shot into the worldwide race for a vaccine to end the pandemic, a scientific effort that has seen China and Russia compete with Western firms for an effective inoculation. While questions remain about the Sinopharm shot, already at least one country outside China plans to roll it out in a mass-vaccination campaign.The U.A.E., home to Dubai and Abu Dhabi, conducted a trial beginning in September of the vaccine by Chinese state-owned pharmaceutical giant Sinopharm involving 31,000 volunteers from 125 nations. Volunteers between 18 and 60 years old received two doses of the vaccine over 28 days.The U.A.E.'s Health and Prevention Ministry announced the results via a statement on the state-run WAM news agency, saying it has ""reviewed Sinopharm CNBG's interim analysis of the Phase III trials.""""The analysis shows no serious safety concerns,"" the statement said, without detailing whether any participant suffered side effects.It wasn't immediately clear if the announced results included only those taking part in the testing in the UAE or if they also include results from China and elsewhere. The statement described the vaccine as receiving ""official registration"" without elaborating on what that meant.Emirati officials and Sinopharm did not respond to questions from The Associated Press.However, calls Wednesday to SEHA, the Abu Dhabi health authority, included an option for individuals to schedule an appointment to receive a ""COVID-19 vaccine."" The centre was swamped with calls following the announcement on the vaccine's efficacy.The Sinopharm vaccine has been approved for emergency use in a few countries and the company is still conducting late-stage clinical trials in 10 countries. Morocco is gearing up for an ambitious COVID-19 vaccination program, aiming to vaccinate 80 per cent of its adults in an operation starting this month that's relying initially on the Sinopharm vaccine.Sinopharm's shot relies on a tested technology, using a killed virus to deliver the vaccine, similar to how polio immunizations are made. Leading Western competitors, like the shot made by Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech, use newer, less-proven technology to target the coronavirus's spike protein using RNA. The United Kingdom already has begun vaccinating people with the Pfizer shot.WATCH | Inside the scramble to mass produce a COVID-19 vaccine:The NationalTop officials in the UAE, including Dubai's ruler, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, have publicly received the shots as part of the vaccine testing.Already, Pfizer reports its shot as being 95 per cent effective, while another RNA candidate from Moderna appears to be 94.5 per cent effective. Results suggest a third vaccine from Oxford University and AstraZeneca is safe and about 70 per cent effective, but questions remain about how well it may help protect those over 55.In transport, Pfizer says its vaccine must be stored in a freezer at –80 C to –60 C or in a thermal container at –90 C to –60 C. The Moderna vaccine must remain at a temperature of –20 C.The Sinopharm vaccine is believed to be able to travel at a temperature of 2 C to 8 C, a major draw for areas of the world where nearly three billion people live without stable electricity and refrigeration. In November, the Communist Party secretary for Sinopharm said almost one million people in China had received its vaccine.Since the pandemic began, the UAE has detected over 178,000 cases of the virus, with 160,000 recoveries and nearly 600 deaths. Its aggressive testing policy has seen over 17 million tests conducted in a country home to just over nine million people."

Venezuelan opposition claims large turnout in anti-Maduro protest | CBC News,Droves of Venezuelans blaming President Nicolas Maduro for their country's collapse voiced their frustrations Saturday in a creative protest rivalling recent elections they boycotted as fraudulent.,2020-12-13T04:15:45.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/venezuela-opposition-maduro-protest-1.5839520,"Droves of Venezuelans blaming President Nicolas Maduro for their country's collapse voiced their frustrations Saturday in a creative protest rivalling recent elections they boycotted as fraudulent.In the so-called ""people's consultation,"" U.S.-backed opposition leader Juan Guaido urged Venezuelans at home and around the world to register their ire through cellphone apps. Others visited makeshift polling stations in cities across Venezuela and in other Latin American Nations, the U.S. and Europe.""Hope has been mobilized in Venezuela,"" Guaido said shortly before the results were announced. ""We must underscore a heroic people who mobilized throughout the country and the world in defence of their rights.""Opposition leaders reported that nearly 6.5 million people responded to the survey. The Associated Press could not independently verify the validity of the figures, and even some opposition election experts questioned the number.The opposition's report said more than 3.2 million participated in person within Venezuela and nearly 850,000 visited centres outside the country, while more than 2.5 million sent in their responses digitally.The survey asked whether people want to end Maduro's rule and hold fresh presidential and legislative elections, and also seek even greater pressure from international allies to make it happen.Though the event had no legal force, opposition leaders said the survey would unify the foes of Maduro. That includes the five million Venezuelans who have fled the nation's hyperinflation and lack of basic services such as reliable running water, electricity and gasoline, they said.Mirla De Lorenzo, a bank employee, visited a center in her Caracas neighborhood to participate, saying she would take any opportunity to express herself if there was any chance it could bring international attention to Venezuela's plight and trigger an end to Maduro's rule.""We're definitely tired of this situation that's brought us nothing but poverty,"" she said, adding that her daughter moved to Spain and her sister migrated to Chile, among relatives who have fled the crisis.""You can't compete with deceitful people, with people who use force, with people who have weapons,"" she said. ""There is no way.""The consultation came days after Maduro's ruling socialist party declared victory in congressional elections that Guaido's coalition boycotted, arguing the vote was a fraud. Canada, the U.S. and the European Union are among the nations and regional bodies that rejected the elections as undemocratic.Guaido, acting as the National Assembly's leader, proclaimed himself interim president in early 2019, arguing that Maduro was an illegitimate leader because his most popular challengers were barred from running in the presidential election the previous year.Guaido quickly won broad support at home among energized supporters who flooded the streets as well as the backing of leaders in dozens of nations, including the U.S. The Trump administration took the lead, imposing sanctions on Maduro, dozens of his political allies and the state-run oil firm PDVSA. The U.S. Justice Department also unveiled an indictment of Maduro charging him with being a ""narcoterrorist,"" and offered a $15 million USreward for his arrest.Nearly two years later, however, Maduro remains in power with control of the military and international allies including Iran, Russia, China, Turkey and Cuba.On Jan. 5, the term of the current opposition-dominated National Assembly ends and Maduro's political allies take over the last governmental body not controlled by the president's socialist party. Guaido and his political allies vow to continue fighting.Risa Grais-Targow, a Venezuela analyst for the Eurasia Group, said that in addition to seeking to unite Venezuelans who don't like Maduro, the symbolic referendum was meant to send a message to international supporters.""They've organized a process for their foreign partners from the U.S. to the European Union and regional governments,"" Grais-Targow said. ""So they can continue to back him even when he's no longer in control of the National Assembly.""The U.S. ambassador for Venezuela, James Story, praised the opposition's survey from Colombia's capital, where he has worked since the U.S. and Venezuela broke diplomatic relations and the U.S. closed its embassy in Caracas.""We're proud to see the people of Venezuela in the street voting for their right to democracy, justice, liberty,"" Story tweeted. ""Their voices have been heard. Democracy must return to Venezuela.""Support among Venezuelans for the opposition has waned amid growing frustrations over Maduro remaining in power.Maduro's popularity is even lower. Just 31 per cent of Venezuela's voters cast ballots in the Dec. 5 congressional elections — less than half the turnout for the 2015 legislative elections.Maduro's ruling party staged a celebration in the historic centre of Caracas on Saturday to mark the victories of their National Assembly candidates, including Maduro's wife and son. Politicians gave speeches condemning the domestic opposition and U.S. policy interference in Venezuela. Salsa music played and people danced.A political talk show on state television Saturday night featured a segment mocking the referendum by showing cellphone videos said to have been recorded by people who drove by survey centers in cities across the nation.""There's nobody, absolutely nobody,"" one unidentified driver says. ""Look there's four people standing around talking nonsense."""

That means many nations will likely have to choose some semblance of their 2021-22 national teams by the end of this season, since most of the world's tracks won't be iced and operating before those training weeks in China are held.""A replacement for the World Cup in March 2021 will be announced next week,"" Groesswang said.USA Bobsled and Skeleton and USA Luge are sitting out the pre-Christmas portions of the World Cup schedules in those sports, as are several other nations, because of concerns about international travel and other pandemic-related issues.In a women's World Cup bobsleigh race in Latvia on Saturday, only six sleds finished the two runs. That was believed to be the smallest World Cup field since women began competing on the circuit.It's been tradition for at least the last five Olympic cycles for a World Cup event to be held on that track that will host the games the following winter, and those races have been critical in terms of teams collecting data and formulating an Olympic strategy.But not having the training weeks and World Cups in China could raise the possibility of some nations, the U.S. included, not competing internationally at all this season."

As the second anniversary of Meng's arrest rolls around, she says it has become impossible to detach Meng's situation from that of the two Michaels, as the men are known.""I have been following Meng's extradition case very closely because it is inextricably linked to Michael's unjust detention in China,"" Nadjibulla told CBC News.""I believe that an end to her extradition case, by one means or another, would open up the path to Michael's liberation as well.""It's been two years since Meng stepped off a Cathay Pacific flight from Hong Kong onto a jetway, where she was intercepted by Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) officers and her phones were bagged as RCMP officers watched unobserved from a short distance away.Police had obtained a provisional warrant for Meng's arrest the day before at the request of the U.S. Department of Justice.The 48-year-old is charged with lying to an HSBC banker in Hong Kong in August 2013 about Huawei's control of a subsidiary that is accused of violating U.S. economic sanctions against Iran.Prosecutors claim that by relying on Meng's alleged lies to continue a financial relationship with Huawei, HSBC was placed at risk of loss and prosecution.Meng has denied the accusations against her.""Ms. Meng is staying patient and positive,"" said Alykhan Velshi, vice-president of corporate affairs at Huawei Canada. ""It can be trying at times because she knows the charges against her are false. She believes that she's a pawn in a global game of chess.""But right from the start, she's always expressed faith in Canada's system of justice.""Meng is the daughter of Huawei's billionaire founder, Ren Zhengfei.Her arrest came as the United States was beginning a campaign to exclude Huawei from being part of the country's next generation of wireless technology — known as 5G. The U.S., one of five countries belonging to the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing network, has labelled the telecommunications giant a security threat and called on its allies to follow suit.Other members of the Five Eyes network — the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand — have all blocked the use of Huawei's technology, while Canada has still not decided if Huawei can be part of its 5G grid.Yves Tiberghien, a political science professor at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, said Meng's arrest has highlighted questions over the future of wireless technology, as well as the trade battle between the U.S. and China, which has its roots in concerns over intellectual property theft.But he said the case also speaks to the Americans' use of sanctions law and its financial system to pressure rivals, as well as China's hard-line tactics and lack of respect for human rights — as seen in the country's targeting of Canadian exports and the imprisonment of Kovrig and Spavor.""This is at the intersection of all those fault lines,"" Tiberghien said.""For Canadians, the No. 1 story is the two Michaels, and so there is a lot of frustration in Canada, and the plight of the two Michaels is a prism to understand a much more aggressive China.""The case also promises to test Canada's extradition law as Meng's legal team painstakingly exposes every element of the case to scrutiny — beginning with the moments that immediately followed her first steps on Canadian soil.CBSA officers questioned Meng for almost three hours before they handed her over to the RCMP. Her lawyers claim the two agencies conspired with the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation to have customs officers question her without a lawyer, in violation of her rights.The officers who were involved in the arrest have been on the witness stand in recent weeks, giving testimony that the defence is hoping can be used to bolster an argument to have the case tossed out next spring for alleged abuse of process.RCMP officers have testified that they deferred to CBSA jurisdiction as ""gatekeepers"" to Canada, and the border officers claimed that legitimate concerns about Meng as a potential national security threat warranted the beginning of an admissibility exam.But working against the Crown, a CBSA officer gave the RCMP a piece of paper on which he wrote the passcodes to her phones, allegedly by mistake. And an RCMP staff sergeant whom the defence accuses of sending the serial numbers belonging to Meng's electronic devices to the FBI is refusing to testify.All have denied any wrongdoing or collusion. Their testimony, originally scheduled to last two weeks, has expanded to at least four, likely pushing other dates in the extradition proceedings further into 2021.It's hard to know whether the evidence points to conspiracy, business as usual or a sloppiness that fits somewhere in the middle.Associate Chief Justice Heather Holmes has remarked on the huge amount of detail that has emerged from the testimony so far, asking the defence and the Crown to ready submissions on what it all means as she prepares to wade through it.The defence also plans to argue that U.S. President Donald Trump is using Meng as a bargaining chip in trade with China and that the United States deliberately misled Canada into the extradition proceedings by omitting key facts that undermined the strength of the case.Gary Botting, a Vancouver-based legal expert and author on extradition law, said he doesn't expect those arguments will ultimately be substantive enough to derail the proceedings. He agrees with high-profile supporters of the two Michaels — such as former Liberal justice minister Allan Rock and former Supreme Court of Canada justice Louise Arbour — who say there is nothing stopping Justice Minister David Lametti from intervening to end the case.The Liberal government has repeatedly stated that the rule of law has to play out in court before Lametti can weigh in, but over the summer, Rock, Arbour and others sought a legal opinion from Toronto lawyer Brian Greenspan, who said Lametti has the ability to act at any time.Botting said he thinks he should. The facts of the case are weak, he said, and he's troubled by Canada being pulled into a request involving a Chinese national, a British bank and a lie that allegedly happened in Hong Kong.""I think it's significant in the sense that it's very clear that the minister of justice has complete control over who is sent over to a foreign country upon a request for extradition,"" Botting said.""He can say no at any point.""Prime Minister Justin Trudeau recently congratulated U.S. president-elect Joe Biden on his victory in last month's election. He also brought up the issue of the two Michaels, but there's no indication of what a new U.S. administration might mean for the proceedings.Nadjibulla said she'll continue to attend Meng's court proceedings, which began last fall, if she can. And wait.""Given the complexities of this extradition request and absent an intervention by the U.S. or Canadian authorities, the legal process is likely to take years,"" she said.Meng has been living under a form of house arrest since her release on $10 million bail, a little more than a week after she was arrested.She is required to wear a GPS monitoring bracelet on her ankle and is trailed by around-the-clock security, whom she pays to ensure she doesn't travel beyond court-ordered boundaries that stop short of the ferry terminals and airport.It's a far cry from the conditions Kovrig and Spavor have endured since they were first detained in China. Kovrig has spent months in solitary confinement. The COVID-19 pandemic also meant both men were cut off from consular visits last January.They were only recently allowed two virtual visits with the Canadian ambassador.China has provided no evidence of the claims against them. They've also been given no idea of when they might face a trial.Unlike Meng, though, the outcome — if it comes to that — is in little doubt.Experts say China has a 99.9 per cent conviction rate."
"Champagne warns tough talk on China could hurt efforts to free Kovrig, Spavor | CBC News",Foreign Affairs Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne is warning that tough talk about China could hurt efforts to gain the release of two arbitrarily detained Canadians.,2020-11-24T13:40:45.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/champagne-china-committee-1.5813826,"Foreign Affairs Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne warned Monday that tough talk about China could hurt efforts to gain the release of two arbitrarily detained Canadians.Testifying before the House of Commons Canada-China relations committee, Champagne urged MPs to keep the fate of Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig in mind when they spout off about the perils and perfidy of China's Communist regime.""I know, Mr. Chair, that some like to talk tough on China,"" Champagne told the committee.""To those who are seduced by this one-dimensional view, I say this: while it is easy to be tough, let's continue to be smart. Let's not fall into the temptation of tough and irresponsible rhetoric that will generate no tangible result for Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, our farmers and entrepreneurs, and human rights victims and advocates.""The two Michaels, as they've come to be known, have been imprisoned in China for almost two years in retaliation for Canada's arrest of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou on an extradition request from the United States.Canadian farmers, fishers and exporters have also been hurt by retaliatory measures taken by China in the wake of Meng's arrest.Champagne's plea came a week after the House of Commons passed a Conservative motion calling on the government to decide by Dec. 18 whether to allow Huawei to be involved in development of Canada's next generation 5G wireless network.The motion, passed with the support of all opposition parties over the objections of the government, also called on the government to unveil within 30 days a robust plan to deal with growing intimidation by China of Canadians within Canada's borders.The motion is not binding and Champagne told the committee that government action on both fronts will be guided by national security requirements, not by arbitrary deadlines.Since taking over the helm of the Conservatives last August, Erin O'Toole has made standing up to China a central pillar of his pitch to Canadian voters.The Conservative leader has accused Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's Liberal government of being ""willing to look past the Chinese government's numerous human rights abuses, flagrant trade abuses and security issues because the potential to sell into the massive Chinese market was so lucrative.""""Trudeau's approach to China has failed, and it's weakened our standing in the world. We must stand up for our citizens who have been detained as bargaining chips in an extradition case, even if it leads to more reprisals from Beijing,"" O'Toole argued in an op-ed in the National Post in September.O'Toole has called for an ""eyes wide open"" approach to relations with China. But Champagne contended that's precisely the approach his government is taking.He argued that Canada's policy toward China has evolved as China itself has evolved, increasingly flouting the international rules-based order, violating the human rights of Uighurs in Xinjiang province and democracy protesters in Hong Kong, and engaging in ""coercive diplomacy"" to get its way.""The China of 2020 is not the China of 2015 or even the China of 2018,"" Champagne said.""We see a country and a leadership increasingly prepared to throw its weight around to advance its interests.""Champagne said the government has adopted a new framework for dealing with China. He described it as a three-pronged approach in which there will be areas, such as human rights abuses, where Canada needs to challenge China.In other areas, such as trade matters, he said Canada needs to compete with China, and still other areas where Canada needs to co-operate with China, such as the fight against climate change.China's more aggressive posture is not just a challenge for Canada, he argued. Countries around the world are grappling with it.Champagne said the best antidote is for all liberal democracies to band together to speak with one voice to pressure China to change its ways — just as Canada has rallied other countries to speak out against the detention of Kovrig and Spavor."
China blasts off on mission to collect moon rocks | CBC News,China launched an ambitious mission on Tuesday to bring back rocks and debris from the moon's surface for the first time in more than 40 years — an undertaking that could boost human understanding of the moon and of the solar system more generally.,2020-11-24T12:44:10.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/china-moon-mission-1.5813803,"China launched an ambitious mission on Tuesday to bring back rocks and debris from the moon's surface for the first time in more than 40 years — an undertaking that could boost human understanding of the moon and of the solar system more generally.Chang'e 5 — named for the Chinese moon goddess — is the country's boldest lunar mission yet. If successful, it would be a major advance for China's space program, and some experts say it could pave the way for bringing samples back from Mars or even a crewed lunar mission.The four modules of the Chang'e 5 spacecraft blasted off at just after 4:30 a.m. Tuesday (3:30 p.m. ET Monday) atop a massive Long March-5Y rocket from the Wenchang launch centre along the coast of the southern island province of Hainan.Minutes after liftoff, the spacecraft separated from the rocket's first and second stages and slipped into Earth-moon transfer orbit. About an hour later, Chang'e 5 opened its solar panels to provide its independent power source.Spacecraft typically take three days to reach the moon.The launch was carried live by national broadcaster CCTV which then switched to computer animation to show its progress into outer space.The mission's key task is to drill 2 metres beneath the moon's surface and scoop up about 2 kilograms of rocks and other debris to be brought back to Earth, according to NASA. That would offer the first opportunity for scientists to study newly obtained lunar material since the American and Russian missions of the 1960s and 1970s.With Chang’e 5, China has launched an effort to join the U.S. &amp; the former Soviet Union in obtaining lunar samples. We hope China shares its data with the global scientific community to enhance our understanding of the Moon like our Apollo missions did &amp; the Artemis program will. <a href=""https://t.co/mPjG4FE0qQ"">pic.twitter.com/mPjG4FE0qQ</a>The Chang'e 5 lander's time on the moon is scheduled to be short and sweet. It can only stay one lunar daytime, or about 14 Earth days, because it lacks the radioisotope heating units to withstand the moon's freezing nights.The lander will dig for materials with its drill and robotic arm and transfer them to what's called an ascender, which will lift off from the moon and dock with the service capsule. The materials will then be moved to the return capsule to be hauled back to Earth.The technical complexity of Chang'e 5, with its four components, makes it ""remarkable in many ways,"" said Joan Johnson-Freese, a space expert at the U.S. Naval War College.""China is showing itself capable of developing and successfully carrying out sustained high-tech programs, important for regional influence and potentially global partnerships,"" she said.In particular, the ability to collect samples from space is growing in value, said Jonathan McDowell, an astronomer at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. Other countries planning to retrieve material from asteroids or even Mars may look to China's experience, he said.While the mission is ""indeed challenging,"" McDowell said China has already landed twice on the moon with its Chang'e 3 and Chang'e 4 missions, and showed with a 2014 Chang'e 5 test mission that it can navigate back to Earth, re-enter and land a capsule. All that's left is to show it can collect samples and take off again from the moon.""As a result of this, I'm pretty optimistic that China can pull this off,"" he said.The mission is among China's boldest since it first put a man in space in 2003, becoming only the third nation to do so after the U.S. and Russia.Oh! Cheeky shot of the return capsule <a href=""https://t.co/pymZvYTltG"">pic.twitter.com/pymZvYTltG</a>Chang'e 5 and future lunar missions aim to ""provide better technical support for future scientific and exploration activities,"" Pei Zhaoyu, mission spokesperson and deputy director of the Chinese National Space Administration's Lunar Exploration and Space Engineering Center told reporters at a Monday briefing.""Scientific needs and technical and economic conditions"" would determine whether China decides to send a crewed mission to the moon, said Pei, whose comments were embargoed until after the launch. ""I think future exploration activities on the moon are most likely to be carried out in a human-machine combination.""While many of China's crewed spaceflight achievements, including building an experimental space station and conducting a spacewalk, reproduce those of other countries from years past, the CNSA is now moving into new territory.Chang'e 4 — which made the first soft landing on the moon's relatively unexplored far side almost two years ago — is currently collecting full measurements of radiation exposure from the lunar surface, information vital for any country that plans to send astronauts to the moon.China in July became one of three countries to have launched a mission to Mars, in China's case an orbiter and a rover that will search for signs of water on the Red Planet. The CNSA says the spacecraft Tianwen 1 is on course to arrive at Mars around February.China has increasingly engaged with foreign countries on missions, and the European Space Agency will be providing important ground station information for Chang'e 5.U.S. law, however, still prevents most collaborations with NASA, excluding China from partnering with the International Space Station. That has prompted China to start work on its own space station and launch its own programs that have put it in a steady competition with Japan and India, among Asian nations seeking to notch new achievements in space.China's space program has progressed cautiously, with relatively few setbacks in recent years. The rocket being used for the current launch failed on a previous launch attempt, but has since performed without a glitch, including launching Chang'e 4.""China works very incrementally, developing building blocks for long-term use for a variety of missions,"" Freese-Johnson said. China's one-party authoritarian system also allows for ""prolonged political will that is often difficult in democracies,"" she said.While the U.S. has followed China's successes closely, it's unlikely to expand cooperation with China in space amid political suspicions, a sharpening military rivalry and accusations of Chinese theft of technology, experts say.""A change in U.S. policy regarding space cooperation is unlikely to get much government attention in the near future,"" Johnson-Freese said."

China congratulates Biden on U.S. election win | CBC News,China on Friday became one of the last major countries to congratulate U.S. president-elect Joe Biden.,2020-11-13T15:24:54.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/china-biden-us-election-1.5800598,"China on Friday became one of the last major countries to congratulate U.S. president-elect Joe Biden.China, along with Russia, avoided joining the throng that congratulated Biden last weekend after he and vice-presidential running mate Kamala Harris secured enough electoral college votes to unseat President Donald Trump.""We respect the choice of the American people,"" said a foreign ministry spokesperson, Wang Wenbin. ""We congratulate Mr. Biden and Ms. Harris.""Wang gave no reason for the delay but said, ""the result will be confirmed according to U.S. laws and procedures.""U.S.-Chinese relations have plunged to their lowest level in decades amid a tariff war over Beijing's technology ambitions and trade surplus, accusations of spying, and tension over human rights, the coronavirus pandemic, Hong Kong and control of the South China Sea.Trump labelled China a security threat and imposed export curbs and other sanctions on Chinese companies. On Thursday, he stepped up those sanctions by issuing an order that bars Americans from investing in securities issued by companies U.S. officials say are owned or controlled by the Chinese military.Forecasters had said even if he lost his re-election bid, Trump was likely to try to increase pressure on Beijing before he leaves office on Jan. 20.Political analysts expect Biden to try to resume co-operation with Beijing on climate change, North Korea, Iran and the coronavirus. However, economists and political analysts expect few big changes due to widespread frustration with Beijing's trade and human rights record, as well as accusations of spying and technology theft.""A tough stance on China has broad support across the U.S. political spectrum,"" Louis Kuijs of Oxford Economics said in a report this week. ""Biden's own pronouncements and policy program suggest he will continue to try to maintain the U.S. technological lead and to attract manufacturing activity.""Some forecasters suggest the change from Trump — who rejected multilateral alliances — to Biden might increase pressure on China if Washington forms a coalition with other developed countries to push for policy changes.China has tried to recruit Germany, France, South Korea and other governments as allies against Washington but all have refused. They criticized Trump's trade tactics of surprise tariff hikes, which also were used against allies, but echoed U.S. complaints that China is violating its free-trade commitments.Some Chinese trade experts have suggested Beijing might try to renegotiate the Phase 1 agreement signed in January as a first step toward ending the trade war. It calls for China to increase purchases of U.S. goods in exchange for postponing further tariff hikes. But that came before the coronavirus derailed global trade, leaving China behind on meeting its commitments.Renegotiation might fit a ""more strategic, longer-term orientation"" expected from a Biden administration, but he ""cannot be seen to be 'soft' on China"" after the ""hard rhetoric"" of the campaign, Kuijs said.Chinese leaders were quieter during this year's election than in the 2016 presidential race, when they favoured Trump over former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. They disliked her for carrying out then-President Barack Obama's foreign policy, which included pressuring Beijing on human rights. Trump's public image of business success resonated with the Chinese public.Trump shook up China's leaders by hiking tariffs on Chinese products in 2018 over complaints Beijing steals or pressures companies to hand over technology.The White House has lobbied allies to exclude telecom equipment giant Huawei Technologies Ltd., China's first global tech brand, from next-generation telecom networks on security grounds. Huawei's access to American components and technology was cut off over the past year, threatening to cripple its global sales.Trump is also trying to bar Chinese social media companies from the United States, citing fears they might gather too much personal information about Americans. The White House is pressing video service TikTok to sell its U.S. operation and is trying to block companies from dealing with WeChat, the popular Chinese message service.Trump has not been vocal on the subject of human rights, rarely mentioning the plight of Hong Kong democracy activists or the detained Uighurs in Xinjiang, though members of his administration such as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have taken up that role.Former U.S. national security adviser John Bolton even alleged in his recent book that Trump expressed his support to Chinese President Xi Jinping over the building of camps to detain the Muslim minority Uighurs, though Trump angrily denied that claim.Despite the contentious issues, Trump spoke favourably of his personal relationship with Xi for over three years, dialling back such talk as the coronavirus pandemic, first noticed in China, spread throughout the U.S.All of the G7 nations and the majority of G20 countries have now congratulated the U.S. president-elect. Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, on friendly terms with Trump, has been an exception, though on Friday his vice-president Hamilton Mourao said that Biden's victory in the election was ""becoming more and more irreversible.""Mexico's President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has been cautious, saying he wants to wait until U.S. states certified election results in the coming weeks before congratulating a winner.The Kremlin said on Monday it would wait for the official results of the election before commenting on its outcome, but Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov was at least contemplating a change in administration, telling reporters on Thursday he thought U.S. foreign policy under Biden would be similar to that seen under Obama, especially on Iran and climate change."

But for China's geopolitical foes and rivals, alliances are only as strong as the political will behind them.",2020-11-21T09:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/china-pompeo-coons-halifax-forum-1.5811099,"It was an ominous beginning to an ominous conversation about how western democracies should face the growing authoritarian reflexes of China on the world stage.One of the marquee panels at the Halifax International Security Forum, held virtually this year, began on Friday with a grainy, grey video of an elephant being chased and eventually overpowered by a pride of lions.It was a stark visual metaphor for Beijing's relative isolation as a world power — the fact that China is a powerful nation with few allies, while western democracies are overwhelming when they act in concert.There was, however, a palpable sense of dismay among some of the panellists when the conversation turned to whether the international community is a pride of lions or a collection of kittens.Emily Lau, a former democratic legislator in Hong Kong, delivered a sobering warning that China's expanded political and security crackdown in the former British-administered territory is an acid test of western strength and resolve.""We are sort of disappearing before the world's eyes,"" Lau said via video conference from Hong Kong. ""What is disappearing? Our freedom. Our personal safety. The rule of law.""Appealing to Beijing for fairness and respect ""doesn't get us anywhere,"" she added.A year ago at the same forum, Lau accepted the John McCain Prize for Leadership in Public Service. She and democratic activist Figo Chan represented the people of Hong Kong in accepting the award after months of street protests and violence that drew global attention.Lau said she hopes like-minded countries, with core values of freedom and democracy, can work together to ""convince China to be reasonable.""Under an international agreement signed with Britain in the late 1990s, Beijing guaranteed Hong Kong's system of government, including its political and economic freedom, for half a century. The recent introduction of new security legislation and an ongoing political crackdown violate the spirit, if not the letter, of that agreement, said Lau.""The way China treats Hong Kong will be very indicative to the whole world of how China will behave,"" she said. ""If China cannot keep the promise, then how can China act as a responsible, respectable member of the international community?""There has been a lot of international attention focused on Hong Kong during the past year, but Lau said things have only gotten worse over that time — with the rooting out of opposition members in the city's legislature, the imposition of the national security law and the postponement of elections.U.S. Democratic Senator Chris Coons — whose name is being mentioned a lot as Washington insiders handicap various candidates for the secretary of state post in the incoming administration of president-elect Joe Biden — said one of the first priorities for the new government will be to reinvigorate alliances.It may take a lot more than that, though.Liam Fox, Britain's former defence secretary, said western democracies are suffering through a crisis of confidence — doubts which have allowed authoritarian regimes to rise and fill the space in the developing world.""If we don't believe what we stand for is better, if we don't believe in the rule of law, democracy, freedom, why should anyone else listen to us?"" Fox said. ""I believe we have to reassert a belief in our core values.""With tangled supply chains that wrap around the globe, the business of standing up to China is not solely a political responsibility, said the Trump administration's top diplomat.""Governments need to do their part,"" said U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in recorded remarks. He noted that countries which have stood up to China have paid a price for it.He acknowledged that Canada had ""done a good job"" but went on to say the corporate sector, which makes an enormous amount of money in China, ""has a moral responsibility to think through the activities their companies are engaged in, and whether that is in their own host country's best national security interest.""Pompeo made no reference to Canada's detention of Meng Wanzhou, the Chinese telecom executive, nor to the imprisonment of Canadians Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor."

China's economy accelerates as virus recovery gains strength | CBC News,China's shaky economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic is gaining strength as consumers return to shopping malls and auto dealerships while the United States and Europe endure painful contractions.,2020-10-19T10:24:23.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/china-economy-1.5767499,"China's shaky economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic is gaining strength as consumers return to shopping malls and auto dealerships while the United States and Europe endure painful contractions.Growth in the world's second-largest economy accelerated to 4.9 per cent over a year earlier in the three months ending in September, up from the previous quarter's 3.2 per cent, official data showed Monday. Retail spending rebounded to above pre-virus levels for the first time and factory output rose, boosted by demand for exports of masks and other medical supplies.China is the only major economy that is expected to grow this year while activity in the United States, Europe and Japan shrinks.The recovery is ""broadening out and becoming less reliant"" on government stimulus, Julian Evans-Pritchard of Capital Economics said in a report. He said growth is ""still accelerating"" heading into the present quarter.Most Asian stock markets rose on the news of increased activity in China, the biggest trading partner for all of its neighbours. Japan's Nikkei 225 index added 1.1 per cent while Hong Kong's Hang Seng climbed 0.9 per cent. Markets in South Korea and Australia also rose.China's benchmark Shanghai Composite Index lost 0.7 per cent on expectations the relatively strong data will reduce the likelihood of additional stimulus that might boost share prices.China, where the pandemic began in December, became the first major economy to return to growth after the ruling Communist Party declared the disease under control in March and began reopening factories, shops and offices.The economy contracted by 6.8 per cent in the first quarter, its worst performance since at least the mid-1960s, before rebounding.The economy ""continued the steady recovery,"" the National Bureau of Statistics said in a report. However, it warned, ""the international environment is still complicated and severe."" It said China faces great pressure to prevent a resurgence of the virus.Authorities have lifted curbs on travel and business but visitors to government and other public buildings still are checked for the virus's telltale fever. Travellers arriving from abroad must be quarantined for two weeks.Last week, more than 10 million people were tested for the virus in the eastern port of Qingdao after 12 cases were found there. That broke a two-month streak with no virus transmissions reported within China.Industrial production rose 5.8 per cent over the same quarter last year, a marked improvement over the first half's 1.3 per cent contraction. Chinese exporters are taking market share from foreign competitors that still are hampered by anti-virus controls.Retail sales rose 0.9 per cent over a year earlier. That was up from a 7.2 per cent contraction in the first half as consumers, already anxious about a slowing economy and a tariff war with Washington, put off buying. Online commerce rose 15.3 per cent.In a sign demand is accelerating, sales in September rose 3.3 per cent.""China's recovery in private consumption is gathering momentum,"" said Stephen Innes of AxiCorp in a report.Economists say China is likely to recover faster than other major economies due to the ruling party's decision to impose the most intensive anti-disease measures in history. Those temporarily cut off most access to cities with a total of 60 million people.The International Monetary Fund is forecasting China's economic growth at 1.8 per cent this year while the U.S. economy is expected to shrink by 4.3 per cent. The IMF expects a 9.8 per cent contraction in France, 6 per cent in Germany and 5.3 per cent in Japan.Private sector analysts say as much as 30 per cent of China's urban workforce, or up to 130 million people, may have lost their jobs at least temporarily. They say as many as 25 million jobs might be lost for good this year."

Sanofi and GSK delay COVID-19 vaccine after insufficient response in older adults | CBC News,Drugmakers GlaxoSmithKline and Sanofi said Friday that their potential COVID-19 vaccine won't be ready until late next year because they need to improve the shot's effectiveness in older people.,2020-12-11T13:56:50.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/sanofi-gsk-vaccine-covid19-trial-1.5837249,"Drugmakers GlaxoSmithKline and Sanofi said Friday that their potential COVID-19 vaccine won't be ready until late next year because they need to improve the shot's effectiveness in older people.The companies said early trials showed the vaccine produced an ""insufficient"" immune response in people over 60 because it didn't contain enough of the material that triggers the production of disease-fighting antibodies. They said they plan to reformulate the vaccine and do more testing, which is likely to delay approval to the fourth quarter of 2021 from the middle of the year.""The results of the study are not as we hoped,"" Roger Connor, president of London-based GSK Vaccines, said in a statement.The delay is a setback for plans to vaccinate large numbers of people around the world amid a pandemic that has already taken more than 1.5 million lives. GSK and Sanofi plan to produce up to 1 billion doses of their COVID-19 vaccine annually, and they have signed agreements to supply millions of doses to the U.S., European Union, Canada and developing countries.The difficulties underscore the challenges scientists face as they race to develop COVID-19 vaccines, condensing a process that usually takes years into a matter of months. Researchers in Australia said Friday they were abandoning their own vaccine candidate because it produced false positive results to HIV tests.Public health experts say several vaccines will be needed to end the pandemic, because of the challenges in rapidly producing and distributing enough doses to vaccinate billions of people.Dr. Penny Ward, a visiting professor in pharmaceutical medicine at King's College London, said the setback is even more significant because Sanofi is a leading producer of flu vaccines and has large-scale manufacturing capacity.The delay ""will impact their ability to (make) the millions of doses that have been pre-ordered because they have to sort out this dose-response effect question,"" she said. ""Very unfortunate, I would say.""WATCH |  Health officials hope to reassure those reluctant to get COVID-19 vaccine:The NationalA vaccine produced by U.S. drugmaker Pfizer and German partner BioNTech has been authorized for widespread use in the U.K. and a handful of other countries, including Canada.  A U.S. government advisory panel on Thursday endorsed use of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, putting the country one step away from launching its own mass vaccination program.Sanofi and GSK confirmed that volunteers in their study received less of the vaccine than intended because of incorrect readings produced by two of the commercial compounds used to test the amount of active ingredient in each dose. The lower dose was enough to produce a good immune response in younger people, but the response was much weaker in those over 60, they said.The manufacturing problem was first reported by Stat, a website that focuses on health and medical news.GSK and Sanofi said their research to date makes them confident the vaccine will ultimately be successful.In adults 18 to 49, the vaccine produced an immune response comparable to patients who had recovered from COVID-19, the companies said, citing results from the early stage trials.In addition, GSK and Sanofi have now tested a reformulated version of the vaccine on non-human primates. Those tests showed that the vaccine protected against lung damage and reduced the amount of virus in the nose and lungs in two to four days.The companies plan to start a new early-stage trial of the vaccine in February. That study will compare the immune response in volunteers who get the Sanofi-GSK vaccine with the response in others who receive an already approved vaccine. If those results are positive, they plan to start a large-scale trial to prove the vaccine's safety and effectiveness in the second quarter.""We have identified the path forward and remain confident and committed to bringing a safe and efficacious COVID-19 vaccine,"" said Thomas Triomphe, head of Sanofi's vaccine unit.""No single pharma company can make it alone,"" he added. ""The world needs more than one vaccine to fight the pandemic.""Meanwhile, researchers at the University of Queensland and Australian biopharmaceutical company CSL said Friday that they would not move forward with their own vaccine candidate because a protein in the shot triggered false positive results for HIV. Followup tests confirmed that no HIV was present, the researchers said.The vaccine had proven safe and produced a ""robust response"" to COVID-19 during Phase 1 trials, researchers said in a statement. While it would have been possible to re-engineer the vaccine to avoid the problem with false positives, this would have taken too much time in the midst of the pandemic, they said.""Doing so would set back development by another 12 or so months, and while this is a tough decision to take, the urgent need for a vaccine has to be everyone's priority,"" said Professor Paul Young, co-leader of the project."

Sanofi and GSK delay COVID-19 vaccine after insufficient response in older adults | CBC News,Drugmakers GlaxoSmithKline and Sanofi said Friday that their potential COVID-19 vaccine won't be ready until late next year because they need to improve the shot's effectiveness in older people.,2020-12-11T13:56:50.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/sanofi-gsk-vaccine-covid19-trial-1.5837249,"Drugmakers GlaxoSmithKline and Sanofi said Friday that their potential COVID-19 vaccine won't be ready until late next year because they need to improve the shot's effectiveness in older people.The companies said early trials showed the vaccine produced an ""insufficient"" immune response in people over 60 because it didn't contain enough of the material that triggers the production of disease-fighting antibodies. They said they plan to reformulate the vaccine and do more testing, which is likely to delay approval to the fourth quarter of 2021 from the middle of the year.""The results of the study are not as we hoped,"" Roger Connor, president of London-based GSK Vaccines, said in a statement.The delay is a setback for plans to vaccinate large numbers of people around the world amid a pandemic that has already taken more than 1.5 million lives. GSK and Sanofi plan to produce up to 1 billion doses of their COVID-19 vaccine annually, and they have signed agreements to supply millions of doses to the U.S., European Union, Canada and developing countries.The difficulties underscore the challenges scientists face as they race to develop COVID-19 vaccines, condensing a process that usually takes years into a matter of months. Researchers in Australia said Friday they were abandoning their own vaccine candidate because it produced false positive results to HIV tests.Public health experts say several vaccines will be needed to end the pandemic, because of the challenges in rapidly producing and distributing enough doses to vaccinate billions of people.Dr. Penny Ward, a visiting professor in pharmaceutical medicine at King's College London, said the setback is even more significant because Sanofi is a leading producer of flu vaccines and has large-scale manufacturing capacity.The delay ""will impact their ability to (make) the millions of doses that have been pre-ordered because they have to sort out this dose-response effect question,"" she said. ""Very unfortunate, I would say.""WATCH |  Health officials hope to reassure those reluctant to get COVID-19 vaccine:The NationalA vaccine produced by U.S. drugmaker Pfizer and German partner BioNTech has been authorized for widespread use in the U.K. and a handful of other countries, including Canada.  A U.S. government advisory panel on Thursday endorsed use of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, putting the country one step away from launching its own mass vaccination program.Sanofi and GSK confirmed that volunteers in their study received less of the vaccine than intended because of incorrect readings produced by two of the commercial compounds used to test the amount of active ingredient in each dose. The lower dose was enough to produce a good immune response in younger people, but the response was much weaker in those over 60, they said.The manufacturing problem was first reported by Stat, a website that focuses on health and medical news.GSK and Sanofi said their research to date makes them confident the vaccine will ultimately be successful.In adults 18 to 49, the vaccine produced an immune response comparable to patients who had recovered from COVID-19, the companies said, citing results from the early stage trials.In addition, GSK and Sanofi have now tested a reformulated version of the vaccine on non-human primates. Those tests showed that the vaccine protected against lung damage and reduced the amount of virus in the nose and lungs in two to four days.The companies plan to start a new early-stage trial of the vaccine in February. That study will compare the immune response in volunteers who get the Sanofi-GSK vaccine with the response in others who receive an already approved vaccine. If those results are positive, they plan to start a large-scale trial to prove the vaccine's safety and effectiveness in the second quarter.""We have identified the path forward and remain confident and committed to bringing a safe and efficacious COVID-19 vaccine,"" said Thomas Triomphe, head of Sanofi's vaccine unit.""No single pharma company can make it alone,"" he added. ""The world needs more than one vaccine to fight the pandemic.""Meanwhile, researchers at the University of Queensland and Australian biopharmaceutical company CSL said Friday that they would not move forward with their own vaccine candidate because a protein in the shot triggered false positive results for HIV. Followup tests confirmed that no HIV was present, the researchers said.The vaccine had proven safe and produced a ""robust response"" to COVID-19 during Phase 1 trials, researchers said in a statement. While it would have been possible to re-engineer the vaccine to avoid the problem with false positives, this would have taken too much time in the midst of the pandemic, they said.""Doing so would set back development by another 12 or so months, and while this is a tough decision to take, the urgent need for a vaccine has to be everyone's priority,"" said Professor Paul Young, co-leader of the project."

"China angered by U.S. arms sales to Taiwan, threatens sanctions | CBC News","China threatened on Thursday to retaliate against the latest U.S. arms sale to Taiwan, as the island welcomed the weapons package but said it was not looking to get into an arms race with Beijing.",2020-10-22T12:27:25.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/china-response-us-arms-taiwan-1.5772252,"China threatened on Thursday to retaliate against the latest U.S. arms sale to Chinese-claimed Taiwan, as the island welcomed the weapons package but said it was not looking to get into an arms race with Beijing.The Trump administration has ramped up support for Taiwan through arms sales and visits by senior U.S officials, adding to tensions between Beijing and Washington, already heightened by disagreements over the South China Sea, Hong Kong, human rights and trade.Beijing has applied increasing pressure on democratically ruled Taiwan to accept China's sovereignty, including by flying fighter jets across the sensitive mid-line of the Taiwan Strait, which normally serves as an unofficial buffer.Beijing considers Taiwan a wayward province it has vowed to reunite with the mainland, by force if necessary. Washington considers it an important democratic outpost and is required by law to provide it with the means to defend itself.Responding to the U.S. approval of a potential $1.8 billion US arms sale to Taiwan, China's Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said during a daily news briefing that such sales should stop.The sales ""seriously interfere with China's internal affairs, seriously damage China's sovereignty and security interests, send a seriously wrong signal to Taiwan independence forces and severely damage China-U.S. relations and peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait,"" he said.""China will make a legitimate and necessary response according to how the situation develops,"" Zhao added.He did not give details, but China has sanctioned U.S. companies in the past for selling weapons to Taiwan, though it is unclear what form they have taken.In Taipei, Taiwan Defence Minister Yen De-fa thanked the United States and said the weapons were to help Taiwan improve their defensive capabilities to deal with the ""enemy threat and new situation.""""This includes a credible combat capability and asymmetric warfare capabilities to strengthen our determination to defend ourselves,"" he added.""This shows the importance attached by the United States to security in the Indo-Pacific and Taiwan Strait. We will continue to consolidate our security partnership with the United States.""Yen said they were not looking for confrontation.""We will not engage in an arms race with the Chinese Communists. We will put forward requirements and build fully in accordance with the strategic concept of heavy deterrence, defending our position and defensive needs.""Taiwan's armed forces are dwarfed by China's, which are expanding their capability with new weapons like aircraft carriers and stealth fighters.Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen has made defence modernization a priority in the face of a rising Chinese threat, particularly ""asymmetric warfare"" capabilities, which refers to making any Chinese attack difficult and costly, for example with smart mines and portable missiles.Like most countries, Washington has no formal diplomatic ties with Taipei, though it is its strongest global backer. The U.S. has been pushing Taiwan to modernize its military so it can become a ""porcupine"" — that is, hard for China to attack.Among other weapons systems, Wednesday's formal notifications to Congress by the State Department were for 11 truck-based rocket launchers made by Lockheed Martin called a High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS), for an estimated cost of $436.1 million.The notifications also covered 135 AGM-84H Standoff Land Attack Missile Expanded Response (SLAM-ER) Missiles and related equipment made by Boeing for an estimated $1.008 billion, and six MS-110 Recce external sensor pods made by Collins Aerospace for jets, at an estimated cost of $367.2 million.Further congressional notifications are expected to follow, including drones made by General Atomics and land-based Harpoon anti-ship missiles made by Boeing to serve as coastal defence cruise missiles.The U.S. administration has stepped up pressure on Beijing in the run-up to the Nov. 3 U.S. presidential election, in which President Donald Trump has made a tough approach to China a key foreign policy theme.Last week, the U.S. national security adviser, Robert O'Brien, said that while China probably was not ready to invade Taiwan for now, the island needed to ""fortify itself"" against a future attack or any bid to isolate it through non-military means, such as an embargo.Taiwan has been testing new surface-to-surface missiles, which its media says have the ability to strike deep inside China, potentially giving the island the ability to attack far-off Chinese air bases and command centres."

China lodges complaint with Canada over Trudeau's 'coercive diplomacy' remarks | CBC News,China said on Wednesday it has lodged solemn representations with Canada on media reports that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had criticized China over its measures in Hong Kong and Xinjiang.,2020-10-14T12:14:34.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/china-trudeau-50-anniversary-1.5761470,"China said Wednesday it has lodged solemn representations with Canada in response to media reports of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau criticizing China over its measures in Hong Kong and Xinjiang.During a news conference on Tuesday, Trudeau attacked Beijing's human rights record while marking the 50th anniversary of Canada's diplomatic ties with China.""We will continue to work with China for advancing Canadian interests and Canadian producers. At the same time, we will remain absolutely committed to working with our allies to ensure that China's approach of coercive diplomacy, its arbitrary detention of two Canadian citizens, alongside other citizens of other countries around the world, is not viewed as a successful tactic by them,"" he said.""It has put a significant strain on Canada-China relations and we will continue to highlight our concern for the Canadians detained, our concern for the protection of human rights in places like Hong Kong, in Xinjiang province with the Uighurs.""Zhao Lijian, a spokesperson for the Chinese foreign ministry, said the Canadian government had shown hypocrisy and weakness.Canada is continuing to press China to release Canadians Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor. Both men were detained in China in December 2018 following Canada's arrest of Meng Wanzhou, a senior executive with the Chinese telecom giant Huawei. Meng is also the daughter of the company's founder.Canadian police detained Meng in Vancouver on a U.S. extradition request nine days before Kovrig and Spavor were arrested. The U.S. is seeking Meng's extradition on fraud charges and her extradition case is before the Canadian courts. Her arrest severely damaged relations between China and Canada.One month after Kovrig and Spavor were arrested, China sentenced Canadian Robert Lloyd Schellenberg to death in a sudden retrial. Schellenberg already had been sentenced to a 15-year jail term for drug smuggling.All three moves were widely seen as punishment for Canada's arrest of Meng Wanzhou.Today, Canadian Ambassador to China Dominic Barton was granted virtual consular access to Schellenberg; because of the provisions in the Privacy Act, the government disclosed no further information.Podcast - Sanctioned: The Arrest of a Telecom GiantSchellenberg was first detained on Dec. 2, 2014. Canadian officials were granted regular consular access to him until January 22, 2020.""I continue to call for the immediate release of Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, and for clemency for Robert Schellenberg, as we do for all Canadians facing the death penalty,"" said Foreign Affairs Minister François-Philippe Champagne in a statement."

Beijing erupts at Canada after parliamentary committee says China's Uighur policy amounts to 'genocide' | CBC News,China’s foreign ministry is lashing out at Canada after a House of Commons subcommittee concluded that the state's mistreatment of Uighurs living in Xinjiang province is tantamount to genocide.,2020-10-22T18:10:41.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/parliamentary-committee-uighur-genocide-1.5772757,"China's foreign ministry is lashing out at Canada after a House of Commons subcommittee concluded that the state's mistreatment of Uighurs living in Xinjiang province amounts to a policy of genocide.The committee's report, tabled Wednesday, says that China's persecution of this Muslim minority — through mass detentions in concentration camps, forced labour, state surveillance and population control measures — is a clear violation of human rights and is meant to ""eradicate Uighur culture and religion.""The committee said that it agrees with the experts who say China's campaign against the Uighurs meets the definition of genocide set out in the 1948 Genocide Convention.Zhao Lijian, a spokesperson for the Chinese foreign ministry, said today that this ""so-called genocide"" is ""a rumour and a farce fabricated by some anti-Chinese forces to slander China.""""Its groundless statement is full of lies and disinformation,"" he said of the committee's report, warning parliamentarians to ""avoid doing any further damage to China-Canada relations.""This is blatant interference in China's internal affairs and reflects those Canadian individuals' ignorance and prejudice. China firmly deplores and rejects that.""The subcommittee on international human rights, chaired by Liberal MP Peter Fonseca, heard from witnesses who survived the concentration camps China has built to suppress Muslims living in this oil-rich northwestern province.Committee witnesses described ""deplorable"" conditions where they were psychologically, physically and sexually abused and subjected to forced assimilation and indoctrination into the dominant Chinese culture.Asked about the camps, Zhao insisted they are ""vocational training and education centres"" where religious ""extremists"" were educated in the ""national common spoken and written language, legal knowledge, vocational skills and de-radicalization.""""The aim is to eliminate the root cause of terrorism and extremism,"" he said.The Commons committee also concluded that Chinese communist officials have forcibly sterilized Uighur women and girls and pushed abortions and intrauterine contraceptive devices (IUDs) on hundreds of thousands in a systematic attempt ""to persecute and possibly eradicate Uighurs.""Uighurs make up less than one per cent of the population in a country where Mandarin-speaking ethnic Chinese people — the Han — constitute the overwhelming majority.While the Turkic-speaking Uighurs are just a small ethnic subset, Chinese government documents obtained by the committee show that approximately 80 per cent of all new IUD placements in China took place in Xinjiang.Birth rates continue to plummet across the region, falling nearly 24 per cent last year alone — compared to a drop of just 4.2 per cent nationwide — according to statistics compiled by researcher Adrian Zenz in a report published by the U.S.-based Jamestown Foundation. The population control measures are backed by mass detention, both as a threat and as a punishment for failure to comply.  Witnesses also told committee members about a ""poverty reduction"" measure implemented by Beijing that forced Uighurs into camps to perform slave labour, making products that were to be sold in Canada and other western nations. A recent report titled ""Uighurs for sale"" by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute found that thousands of Muslims have been used as forced labour in factories that supply companies like BMW, Nike and Huawei, among others.The Chinese government has facilitated the mass transfer of Uighur and other ethnic minority citizens from Xinjiang to factories across the country.Under constant state surveillance through closed-circuit television cameras and mobile tracking devices, Uighur survivors have said they lived in constant fear.They told committee members that Uighur expatriates are subjected to harassment and intimidation by the Chinese regime — even in Canada.""The subcommittee unequivocally condemns the persecution of Uighur and other Turkic Muslims in Xinjiang by the government of China,"" the committee's report reads. ""The subcommittee is persuaded that the actions of the Chinese Communist Party constitute genocide.""The committee said these control tactics are designed to suppress the Uighurs because they ""desire more autonomy or independence from China,"" and the communists consider them a ""threat"" to economic development and prosperity.The committee is recommending the federal government condemn China's abuse of Uighurs, work with allies to secure unfettered access to Xinjiang for international observers to prevent further abuse, recognize that China's actions constitute genocide and impose sanctions on implicated officials through Canada's so-called Magnitsky law.That law allows the government to impose sanctions and freeze assets owned by foreign nationals and prohibit financial transactions by known human rights abusers.The law is informally named after Russian tax adviser Sergei Magnitsky, who was tortured and died in a Moscow prison after documenting fraud in Russia.""Canada needs to take immediate action and live up to the values it espouses at home and abroad,"" says the report. ""Canada must act now to address China's aggression against Uighurs and other Turkic Muslims.""In a statement, Foreign Affairs Minister François-Philippe Champagne said he is ""deeply disturbed"" by the troubling reports documented by the subcommittee.He said he raised the issue of Uighur abuse with Michelle Bachelet, the UN commissioner for human rights, during a recent meeting in Switzerland.Earlier this month, Canada and 37 allies also expressed ""grave concerns"" about the situation in Xinjiang at the UN, he said.Champagne said the government would back a plan to send impartial advisers into the region to document the plight of the Uighurs.""Canada takes the allegations of genocide very seriously. We will continue ... with our allies to push for these to be investigated through an international independent body,"" he said.Champagne did not address a question about whether Canada would pursue Magnitsky sanctions like those slapped on Russian and Venezuelan officials in recent years.This parliamentary report is the latest attempt by some MPs and senators to put pressure on the government to take a tougher stand against China.In June, more than a dozen senators — including several appointed by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau — urged the federal government to impose sanctions on Chinese officials for ""gross violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms.""Citing China's detention of Uighur Muslims, its crackdown on democratic rights in Hong Kong, its decades-long repression of Tibet and its imprisonment of Canadians Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig, the senators described the regime in Beijing as the ""biggest threat to mankind and a danger to international security.""That letter was followed by a call from 68 MPs and senators for Canada to levy sanctions on top Chinese officials."

He said Kovrig and Spavor were ""suspected of engaging in activities that endanger China's national security.""Despite its disavowals of any connection, Beijing has repeatedly tied the detentions to the arrest of Meng Wanzhou, Huawei's chief financial officer and the daughter of the company's founder.

""A direct in-person visit should have already taken place a long time ago with appropriate social distancing.""Kovrig and Spavor have been in prison in China since December 2018 in what is widely seen as retaliation for Canada arresting Chinese high-tech executive Meng Wanzhou on an American extradition warrant.Dominic Barton, Canada's ambassador to China, had internet-based visits with Spavor on Friday and Kovrig on Saturday.It was the first contact Canadian diplomats have had with the two men since in-person visits in mid-January.Kovrig's wife, Vina Nadjibulla, told CBC News that her husband was ""greatly relieved to receive news from the outside world"" after ten months spent in isolation with no consular access.""He was particularly heartened by reassurances regarding the health of everyone in the family and the ongoing efforts to secure his freedom. He was astonished to learn about the details of the COVID-19 pandemic and remarked that it all sounded like some 'zombie apocalypse movie,'"" her statement read.""We are extremely proud that despite his long confinement, Michael's spirit, determination — and even his sense of humour — remain unbroken. This is definitely something we can be grateful for this Thanksgiving weekend. And of course, our focus remains on doing everything possible to bring Michael home. We are deeply grateful for the support and solidarity of all Canadians.""The Chinese government has said it can't allow in-person visits to prisons because of concerns around COVID-19. The federal government has been pushing China since the spring for an alternative form of access in order to check on the welfare of the two men.""There was absolutely no reason that virtual access couldn't have been offered by China even during the height of the pandemic, and no justification for denying in-person visits after China emerged from lockdown during the summer,"" said David Mulroney, a former Canadian ambassador to China.""This is simply more cruel treatment by China, with the expectation that we will be grateful even for even a half-hearted effort on their part. We shouldn't fall into that trap.""Foreign Affairs Minister François-Philippe Champagne pressed for virtual access in his own in-person meeting with his Chinese counterpart, Wang Yi, when the two crossed paths in Rome in August.Up until January, Canadian diplomats had been able to visit the two men approximately once a month.Chong reiterated past Conservative criticism of the government's handling of relations with China, saying its approach has lacked coherence, and that Canada should impose targeted sanctions on the people responsible for the imprisonment of the two men.But Chong said he is seeing signs of the government taking a firmer stand against China recently with tougher rhetoric this past week from Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan and Bob Rae, Canada's ambassador to the United Nations.""I think the Liberal government's finally responding to the pressure that the Conservatives have been putting on them,"" said Chong.Sajjan accused China of engaging in ""hostage diplomacy"" in an online panel discussion, while Rae ripped into his Chinese counterpart in a meeting of the UN General Assembly on Friday for saying that Canada was bullying the People's Republic.Rae said Meng was living under ""house arrest"" while Spavor and Kovrig ""have been living in terrible conditions, without consular access, without any humane treatment whatsoever.""""This is something which we shall never forget,"" Rae added. ""If you think that insulting us or insulting my country or insulting anyone is going to help in resolving the situation, you're sadly mistaken.""Champagne, too, has ramped up his public criticism of China's human rights record on a number of issues: Beijing's crackdown on dissent in Hong Kong and the forced detention Uighur Muslims in the country's Xinjiang province.In a recent interview prior to the virtual visits with Kovrig and Spavor, Champagne said Canada would continue to push back against Beijing by working with allies.""We need to act together, and we need to be strong together to face what we have seen, a coercive type of diplomacy by China,"" the minister said.Champagne said it was significant that the case of the ""two Michaels"" was raised in China's recent summit with the European Union, including in its final communique.Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also thanked U.S. President Donald Trump for America's ""ongoing support"" in the effort to free Kovrig and Spavor during a Saturday phone call.A source with knowledge of the call who spoke confidentially to CBC News said there has been engagement between Canada and the U.S. in recent weeks on the push to get the pair released.According to the source, Kirsten Hillman, Canada's ambassador to the U.S., has raised the matter with the White House and has spoken to U.S. national security adviser Robert O'Brien. "

The foreword was written by Laureen Harper, wife of Prime Minister Stephen Harper, and she personally handed out copies to school children during a visit to China in February.There are currently 20,000 copies of the Mandarin edition of Anne for sale in China but Sherry Huang, CEO of Anne in China on P.E.I., has set her sight on multiplying those numbers significantly.""We're hoping to make Anne popular in China, same like in Japan, we're hoping maybe even more popular,"" said Huang.Huang hopes to do that by hooking into a foundation that donates books to rural libraries in China.""They are trying to cover all the rural part of China to always provide them a very good book, and we believe Anne of Green Gables should be on that list,"" said Huang.""If we gave one book to each library we're looking at 200,000 to cover all of them so, wow, it's a big project.""Huang said she is still planning how and when to get the books out to all those libraries. Kate MacDonald Butler, Montgomery's granddaughter and representative of her heirs, is thrilled by the project.""Well the plan is pretty exciting, and I have given my blessing to the project,"" she said.Tourism associations on P.E.I. and the province's Department of Innovation are excited by the project too, hoping interest in the book will lead to the same kind of interest in visiting Anne's land in China that the province has seen from Japan."

Canada's ties to China's military underscore the weird contradictions in its foreign policy | CBC News,It's been obvious for some time that there is something a little weird about the way Canada approaches its relationship with China — a disconnect brought into sharp relief this week by the news that Global Affairs and the Department of National Defence were not on the same page when it came to military ties and training involving the People’s Liberation Army.,2020-12-12T09:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canada-china-pla-peoples-liberation-army-1.5838658,"It's been obvious for some time that there is something weird about the way Canada approaches its relationship with China — a disconnect brought into sharp relief this week by the news that Global Affairs and the Department of National Defence were not on the same page when it came to military ties and training involving the People's Liberation Army.In some respects, the volcanic online political eruption which followed stories in The Globe and Mail and other media outlets, based on exclusive access to information documents, was predictable, as was the flurry of finger-pointing in the House of Commons on Thursday and Friday.Diplomats were alarmed when Gen. Jonathan Vance, the country's senior military commander, cancelled winter military exercises with the PLA in 2019, fretting that it might aggravate Beijing or make the lives of Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor even worse.It makes for fire-breathing memes, sizzling copy and wonderful political theatre.What's missing, though, is a recognition that Canada's policy toward a rising China has been contradictory and incoherent for almost a decade, maybe more, said Charles Burton, a political scientist at Brock University in St. Catharines, Ont. and a respected China expert at the Macdonald-Laurier Institute.""Cabinets were always split on China, whether it's Liberal or Conservative,"" Burton said, referring to debates more than three decades ago during the government of former prime minister Brian Mulroney.It is more urgent than ever, in the context of an increasingly belligerent and assertive China, to present a united political front, he added.""This is really about the defence of our sovereignty and security on matters over which there is consensus across the political spectrum in Canada,"" he said.Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan, in an attempt at political damage control late this week, made a point of saying that Chinese troops are no longer training for winter warfare at Garrison Petawawa, Ont.He also (rather meekly) noted that the exchange and training program with the PLA was instituted in August 2013 under the Conservatives while defence critic James Bezan, one of the most vocal and fiery opponents this week, was parliamentary secretary of defence.Bezan's retort was along the lines of that was then, this is now.""The defence minister knows full well that the Chinese government back then and the Chinese government today are completely different,"" Bezan said during question period on Thursday.It was a different time, no question.Chinese President Xi Jinping had taken office only a few months before, and the Department of National Defence (DND) tasking order that established the exchange program, obtained by CBC News under access to information, noted that working with the PLA ""complements the Government of Canada led efforts to broaden our bilateral relationship with China.""After years of hectoring and hammering China, the Conservatives — under former prime minister Stephen Harper — had decided that limited engagement was the way to go.And here is where Canada's curious incoherence comes into play.At precisely the moment the former chief of the defence staff, the now-retired general Tom Lawson, was penning the Canadian military's marching orders on closer cooperation with the PLA, the foreign affairs ministry — led at the time by John Baird — was firing off flares about China's unilateral declaration of an air defence zone in the East China Sea.It was a bellwether moment.""The U.S. has indicated deep concern over the establishment of the Chinese ADIZ stating that the U.S. views this development as a destabilizing attempt to alter the status quo in the region and that this move increases the risk of misunderstanding and miscalculations,"" said a Nov. 23, 2013 briefing note to Baird, obtained by CBC News in 2017.""More broadly, the rise of China is reshaping the strategic landscape.""Burton said the rise of President Xi marked the beginning of the new, more aggressive China. The establishment of the air zone — now largely forgotten against a backdrop of fortified artificial islands in the South China Sea, reports of Uyghurs in concentration camps and the haze of tear gas in Hong Kong — marked the first step.So were our politicians and senior leaders paying attention not only to events, but to what other federal departments were saying?According to what former foreign affairs minister (and current finance minister) Chrystia Freeland had to say in question period this week, the answer is yes.""I have long personal experience reporting on authoritarian communist regimes and I am very aware of the threat they pose,"" she said.Here's the question no one seemed to ask this week: why was the military exchange and training program still going on even before hostage diplomacy swept up the two Michaels?National Defence is no stranger to suspicions about China, having spent an enormous amount of time quietly defending itself from cyberattacks purportedly launched by  Beijing or by groups associated with it.The Trump administration has been tightening the screws on China from a diplomatic, security and trade perspective. There has been considerable, growing debate among Western allies — led by the Americans — about the downside of military engagement and co-operation with China, with Five Eyes intelligence partners each exchanging their own warnings — a series of discussions that eventually prompted Canada's current top military commander, Gen. Jonathan Vance, to cancel the winter warfare exercises.And then, of course, there's debate over the telecom giant Huawei and its future in this country.The signs were all there, Burton said — but no one actually woke up to the problem until Kovrig and Spavor were imprisoned. The public has been galvanized, he added, but ""it doesn't seem to have penetrated fully to the senior levels of the political and economic elite.""Burton said that — as weird as it might sound, with everything else that has happened — he believes there are some within the Canadian Establishment who still cling to the notion that if the ""consular cases of Spavor and Kovrig are resolved, we can go back"" to business as usual."
"In Ottawa's rush to buy PPE, companies with little or no experience got some of the biggest contracts | CBC News",The federal government awarded a $371-million contract to secure personal protective equipment — one of the largest medical supply deals in its history — to a small company headquartered in a house in suburban Ottawa that had no apparent prior experience in PPE procurement.,2020-12-13T09:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/ppe-covid-coronavirus-personal-protective-equipment-politics-1.5831340,"This story is part of The Big Spend, a CBC News investigation examining the unprecedented $240 billion the federal government handed out during the first eight months of the pandemic.The federal government awarded a $371-million contract to secure personal protective equipment — one of the largest medical supply deals in its history — to a small company headquartered in a house in suburban Ottawa that had no apparent prior experience in PPE procurement.Proline Advantage Inc.'s tender submission was one of more than 26,000 received by the government through its BuyandSell.gc.ca portal after it put out a call to suppliers last March for help procuring PPE.Of those thousands of submissions, a number of lucrative contracts went to low-profile companies that pivoted to the PPE market, seeing opportunity in the mad dash to secure supplies in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic.In the case of Proline Advantage Inc., the government says the company delivered the goods and fulfilled the obligations of its contract by August, coincidentally the same month Proline's PPE procurement website went live.The company's headquarters is owned by its two directors, Mike Caron and Chantal Beauchamp. Caron is also listed as a partner in a nutritional supplement company called Max Q and is the founder and director of Portions Master, a company that sells supplements and a product called the Skinny Plate. Available on Amazon, the Skinny Plate is a plastic dish with dividers designed to help limit portion sizes.Caron declined the CBC's request for an interview, providing an emailed statement instead.""Our company is experienced in supply chain management and has a proud track record of sourcing products of various types from around the world,"" Caron wrote.""Like many firms, we were able to quickly pivot our business, and leverage our international sourcing expertise to answer the government's call and address the immediate and pressing need to provide PPE to front-line medical professionals.""In total, the federal government has spent just over $6.1 billion on what it describes as ""a broad range of equipment and supplies from domestic and international suppliers to combat COVID-19,"" not including vaccines.As of Oct. 15, gowns were the biggest-ticket item on the list — accounting for 29 per cent of the overall amount, at nearly $1.8 billion.Proline Advantage Inc.'s contract of $371,318,000 accounted for almost 21 per cent of that.In addition to gowns, Proline's contract included about $17.5 million for other protective clothing such as shoe and boot covers, and disposable overalls.WATCH | The 'Wild West' early days of the scramble for PPE:The NationalThe size of the contract, and the fact it's at the top of the list posted by Public Services and Procurement Canada, has drawn media attention and raised some eyebrows among Conservative MPs and some supply chain experts.""The largest medical supply contract in Canadian history was given to Proline Advantage for medical gowns,"" Conservative MP Pierre Paul-Hus said in a meeting of the government operations committee last month. ""I want to know whether or not this company is well established in the medical field.""""This company is a small business and ensured that their gowns were made available as soon as possible by renting the largest plane in the world until all of their gowns were delivered,"" responded Anita Anand, minister of public services and procurement.""This company stepped up at the beginning of the crisis when this country had no gowns, gloves, masks and the like. We need to respect the ability of small and large businesses across this country to step up for Canadians.""Anand's deputy minister, Bill Matthews, pointed out that the company had ""a history of importing medical goods into Canada.""In all, 26 contracts were awarded to 23 different suppliers for more than 132 million medical gowns.In some cases, finding out more about the companies involved is a challenge.MuFactor Ltd., for example, received a contract worth $257 million, also to procure gowns. The company is registered in Alberta, with its headquarters listed as a house in northwest Calgary. Searches of import databases show MuFactor has a history of importing furniture. Very little other information is available about the company — no contact information online, no email, no phone number.CBC News has asked the government about the status of the MuFactor contract and is awaiting its response.""What I've seen in my work over the last eight months … there's been a lot of opportunistic organizations, distributors that don't have any experience in procuring health care, PPE and equipment, that have kind of popped up,"" said Fraser Johnson, an expert on supply chain management at Western University's Ivey Business School.""From a procurement standpoint, if you're going to write contracts for several billions of dollars, and in these cases, tens of millions of dollars, you want to make sure that you know what the background of the company is.""That vetting process should assess whether a company is financially stable; what expertise it brings to the table; and the cost and quality of the products it can buy and how quickly it can deliver, he said.In a statement to CBC News, Public Services and Procurement Canada says potential suppliers were required to provide manufacturers' test results and certifications, and the Public Health Agency of Canada was responsible for validating those documents. Financial capability assessments were also performed, and delivery schedules were validated and confirmed, the statement says.Delivery of the PPE is validated and quality assurance tests are performed on site by the Public Health Agency of Canada, the government says.The speed and sheer size of the PPE procurement was in response to a desperate need in the early stages of the pandemic.""There was concern we didn't have sufficient domestic supply,"" said Dr. Sandy Buchman, who was head of the Canadian Medical Association when the COVID-19 crisis began last spring.""For example, I was told locally by the leadership in a Toronto hospital that they were concerned that they had a two-day supply of PPE at the beginning of the pandemic. So, obviously, things were very thin at the time.""There was a sense from government that they were scrambling to find PPE wherever they could.""Established PPE suppliers watched newcomers pour into the market.""There were literally tens of thousands of new entrants,"" said David Welsh, CEO of Edmonton-based Primed Medical Products, a company with 25 years of experience procuring and manufacturing a range of PPE.Ottawa has spent $240B fighting COVID-19 in just 8 months. A CBC investigation follows the moneyWelsh, whose company was awarded $93 million in government PPE contracts, says Ottawa did an excellent job of securing enormous amounts of PPE at a time when it was in huge demand around the world.""But, yes, it was the Wild West.

Canada's ties to China's military underscore the weird contradictions in its foreign policy | CBC News,It's been obvious for some time that there is something a little weird about the way Canada approaches its relationship with China — a disconnect brought into sharp relief this week by the news that Global Affairs and the Department of National Defence were not on the same page when it came to military ties and training involving the People’s Liberation Army.,2020-12-12T09:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canada-china-pla-peoples-liberation-army-1.5838658,"It's been obvious for some time that there is something weird about the way Canada approaches its relationship with China — a disconnect brought into sharp relief this week by the news that Global Affairs and the Department of National Defence were not on the same page when it came to military ties and training involving the People's Liberation Army.In some respects, the volcanic online political eruption which followed stories in The Globe and Mail and other media outlets, based on exclusive access to information documents, was predictable, as was the flurry of finger-pointing in the House of Commons on Thursday and Friday.Diplomats were alarmed when Gen. Jonathan Vance, the country's senior military commander, cancelled winter military exercises with the PLA in 2019, fretting that it might aggravate Beijing or make the lives of Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor even worse.It makes for fire-breathing memes, sizzling copy and wonderful political theatre.What's missing, though, is a recognition that Canada's policy toward a rising China has been contradictory and incoherent for almost a decade, maybe more, said Charles Burton, a political scientist at Brock University in St. Catharines, Ont. and a respected China expert at the Macdonald-Laurier Institute.""Cabinets were always split on China, whether it's Liberal or Conservative,"" Burton said, referring to debates more than three decades ago during the government of former prime minister Brian Mulroney.It is more urgent than ever, in the context of an increasingly belligerent and assertive China, to present a united political front, he added.""This is really about the defence of our sovereignty and security on matters over which there is consensus across the political spectrum in Canada,"" he said.Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan, in an attempt at political damage control late this week, made a point of saying that Chinese troops are no longer training for winter warfare at Garrison Petawawa, Ont.He also (rather meekly) noted that the exchange and training program with the PLA was instituted in August 2013 under the Conservatives while defence critic James Bezan, one of the most vocal and fiery opponents this week, was parliamentary secretary of defence.Bezan's retort was along the lines of that was then, this is now.""The defence minister knows full well that the Chinese government back then and the Chinese government today are completely different,"" Bezan said during question period on Thursday.It was a different time, no question.Chinese President Xi Jinping had taken office only a few months before, and the Department of National Defence (DND) tasking order that established the exchange program, obtained by CBC News under access to information, noted that working with the PLA ""complements the Government of Canada led efforts to broaden our bilateral relationship with China.""After years of hectoring and hammering China, the Conservatives — under former prime minister Stephen Harper — had decided that limited engagement was the way to go.And here is where Canada's curious incoherence comes into play.At precisely the moment the former chief of the defence staff, the now-retired general Tom Lawson, was penning the Canadian military's marching orders on closer cooperation with the PLA, the foreign affairs ministry — led at the time by John Baird — was firing off flares about China's unilateral declaration of an air defence zone in the East China Sea.It was a bellwether moment.""The U.S. has indicated deep concern over the establishment of the Chinese ADIZ stating that the U.S. views this development as a destabilizing attempt to alter the status quo in the region and that this move increases the risk of misunderstanding and miscalculations,"" said a Nov. 23, 2013 briefing note to Baird, obtained by CBC News in 2017.""More broadly, the rise of China is reshaping the strategic landscape.""Burton said the rise of President Xi marked the beginning of the new, more aggressive China. The establishment of the air zone — now largely forgotten against a backdrop of fortified artificial islands in the South China Sea, reports of Uyghurs in concentration camps and the haze of tear gas in Hong Kong — marked the first step.So were our politicians and senior leaders paying attention not only to events, but to what other federal departments were saying?According to what former foreign affairs minister (and current finance minister) Chrystia Freeland had to say in question period this week, the answer is yes.""I have long personal experience reporting on authoritarian communist regimes and I am very aware of the threat they pose,"" she said.Here's the question no one seemed to ask this week: why was the military exchange and training program still going on even before hostage diplomacy swept up the two Michaels?National Defence is no stranger to suspicions about China, having spent an enormous amount of time quietly defending itself from cyberattacks purportedly launched by  Beijing or by groups associated with it.The Trump administration has been tightening the screws on China from a diplomatic, security and trade perspective. There has been considerable, growing debate among Western allies — led by the Americans — about the downside of military engagement and co-operation with China, with Five Eyes intelligence partners each exchanging their own warnings — a series of discussions that eventually prompted Canada's current top military commander, Gen. Jonathan Vance, to cancel the winter warfare exercises.And then, of course, there's debate over the telecom giant Huawei and its future in this country.The signs were all there, Burton said — but no one actually woke up to the problem until Kovrig and Spavor were imprisoned. The public has been galvanized, he added, but ""it doesn't seem to have penetrated fully to the senior levels of the political and economic elite.""Burton said that — as weird as it might sound, with everything else that has happened — he believes there are some within the Canadian Establishment who still cling to the notion that if the ""consular cases of Spavor and Kovrig are resolved, we can go back"" to business as usual."
"In Ottawa's rush to buy PPE, companies with little or no experience got some of the biggest contracts | CBC News",The federal government awarded a $371-million contract to secure personal protective equipment — one of the largest medical supply deals in its history — to a small company headquartered in a house in suburban Ottawa that had no apparent prior experience in PPE procurement.,2020-12-13T09:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/ppe-covid-coronavirus-personal-protective-equipment-politics-1.5831340,"This story is part of The Big Spend, a CBC News investigation examining the unprecedented $240 billion the federal government handed out during the first eight months of the pandemic.The federal government awarded a $371-million contract to secure personal protective equipment — one of the largest medical supply deals in its history — to a small company headquartered in a house in suburban Ottawa that had no apparent prior experience in PPE procurement.Proline Advantage Inc.'s tender submission was one of more than 26,000 received by the government through its BuyandSell.gc.ca portal after it put out a call to suppliers last March for help procuring PPE.Of those thousands of submissions, a number of lucrative contracts went to low-profile companies that pivoted to the PPE market, seeing opportunity in the mad dash to secure supplies in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic.In the case of Proline Advantage Inc., the government says the company delivered the goods and fulfilled the obligations of its contract by August, coincidentally the same month Proline's PPE procurement website went live.The company's headquarters is owned by its two directors, Mike Caron and Chantal Beauchamp. Caron is also listed as a partner in a nutritional supplement company called Max Q and is the founder and director of Portions Master, a company that sells supplements and a product called the Skinny Plate. Available on Amazon, the Skinny Plate is a plastic dish with dividers designed to help limit portion sizes.Caron declined the CBC's request for an interview, providing an emailed statement instead.""Our company is experienced in supply chain management and has a proud track record of sourcing products of various types from around the world,"" Caron wrote.""Like many firms, we were able to quickly pivot our business, and leverage our international sourcing expertise to answer the government's call and address the immediate and pressing need to provide PPE to front-line medical professionals.""In total, the federal government has spent just over $6.1 billion on what it describes as ""a broad range of equipment and supplies from domestic and international suppliers to combat COVID-19,"" not including vaccines.As of Oct. 15, gowns were the biggest-ticket item on the list — accounting for 29 per cent of the overall amount, at nearly $1.8 billion.Proline Advantage Inc.'s contract of $371,318,000 accounted for almost 21 per cent of that.In addition to gowns, Proline's contract included about $17.5 million for other protective clothing such as shoe and boot covers, and disposable overalls.WATCH | The 'Wild West' early days of the scramble for PPE:The NationalThe size of the contract, and the fact it's at the top of the list posted by Public Services and Procurement Canada, has drawn media attention and raised some eyebrows among Conservative MPs and some supply chain experts.""The largest medical supply contract in Canadian history was given to Proline Advantage for medical gowns,"" Conservative MP Pierre Paul-Hus said in a meeting of the government operations committee last month. ""I want to know whether or not this company is well established in the medical field.""""This company is a small business and ensured that their gowns were made available as soon as possible by renting the largest plane in the world until all of their gowns were delivered,"" responded Anita Anand, minister of public services and procurement.""This company stepped up at the beginning of the crisis when this country had no gowns, gloves, masks and the like. We need to respect the ability of small and large businesses across this country to step up for Canadians.""Anand's deputy minister, Bill Matthews, pointed out that the company had ""a history of importing medical goods into Canada.""In all, 26 contracts were awarded to 23 different suppliers for more than 132 million medical gowns.In some cases, finding out more about the companies involved is a challenge.MuFactor Ltd., for example, received a contract worth $257 million, also to procure gowns. The company is registered in Alberta, with its headquarters listed as a house in northwest Calgary. Searches of import databases show MuFactor has a history of importing furniture. Very little other information is available about the company — no contact information online, no email, no phone number.CBC News has asked the government about the status of the MuFactor contract and is awaiting its response.""What I've seen in my work over the last eight months … there's been a lot of opportunistic organizations, distributors that don't have any experience in procuring health care, PPE and equipment, that have kind of popped up,"" said Fraser Johnson, an expert on supply chain management at Western University's Ivey Business School.""From a procurement standpoint, if you're going to write contracts for several billions of dollars, and in these cases, tens of millions of dollars, you want to make sure that you know what the background of the company is.""That vetting process should assess whether a company is financially stable; what expertise it brings to the table; and the cost and quality of the products it can buy and how quickly it can deliver, he said.In a statement to CBC News, Public Services and Procurement Canada says potential suppliers were required to provide manufacturers' test results and certifications, and the Public Health Agency of Canada was responsible for validating those documents. Financial capability assessments were also performed, and delivery schedules were validated and confirmed, the statement says.Delivery of the PPE is validated and quality assurance tests are performed on site by the Public Health Agency of Canada, the government says.The speed and sheer size of the PPE procurement was in response to a desperate need in the early stages of the pandemic.""There was concern we didn't have sufficient domestic supply,"" said Dr. Sandy Buchman, who was head of the Canadian Medical Association when the COVID-19 crisis began last spring.""For example, I was told locally by the leadership in a Toronto hospital that they were concerned that they had a two-day supply of PPE at the beginning of the pandemic. So, obviously, things were very thin at the time.""There was a sense from government that they were scrambling to find PPE wherever they could.""Established PPE suppliers watched newcomers pour into the market.""There were literally tens of thousands of new entrants,"" said David Welsh, CEO of Edmonton-based Primed Medical Products, a company with 25 years of experience procuring and manufacturing a range of PPE.Ottawa has spent $240B fighting COVID-19 in just 8 months. A CBC investigation follows the moneyWelsh, whose company was awarded $93 million in government PPE contracts, says Ottawa did an excellent job of securing enormous amounts of PPE at a time when it was in huge demand around the world.""But, yes, it was the Wild West. Decisions had to be made more quickly than normal. And the level of due diligence had to be shortened,"" he said.Necessarily so, say some experts, because of the fast-moving, highly volatile situation at the time.""This was akin to a war footing here, given the severity of the event,"" said Vikas Mehrotra, a business professor at the University of Alberta.Mehrotra said the government had to act quickly because other countries would be chasing the same PPE supplies and there was concern the world would be cut off from PPE manufacturers, most of which are based in China.""The purpose was to make sure that in case we get shut off from the global supply chain, we still have our own equipment to deal with the crisis,"" said Mehrotra.In that sense, he said, the $6-billion government PPE procurement operation was an overwhelming success, regardless of who filled the orders."

"As Canadians sour on China, an ambassador changes his tone | CBC News","Dominic Barton, Canada's ambassador to China, made his first appearance at the China committee this week since before the pandemic hit Canada. He was noticeably less forgiving of Beijing and less bullish on business opportunities than last time — perhaps reflecting a turn against China in public opinion.",2020-12-10T09:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/china-kovrig-spavor-dominic-barton-1.5835036,"Today marks two years since the two Michaels were detained by China.It's also been ten long pandemic months since Canada's ambassador to Beijing, Dominic Barton, made his previous appearance before the Commons subcommittee on Canada-China relations. Tuesday's second round of that hearing showed how much the mood around China has changed during 2020. Barton appeared conscious of the need to make some repairs to the impression he left in February, when his testimony drew unusually direct criticism from former diplomats with experience working in China.Back then, Barton suggested that it was incumbent upon Canadians to recognize that ""China values unity and the needs of society at large, rather than freedom of individual choice ... we just have to understand that.""Former diplomat and China expert Charles Burton told the subcommittee that Barton's words parroted Communist Party propaganda asserting that Chinese culture is inherently averse to liberty and democracy — when in fact the aversion comes from Xi Jinping's Politburo.Watch: Trudeau says government will examine all options to bring Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig.:Politics NewsIn his Tuesday appearance, however, Barton opened with remarks on ""our efforts to promote rights and freedoms in China.""""We are concerned by the decline of civil and political rights in China,"" he told MPs.Barton began his appearance with a lengthy description of a recent visit to the Tibet Autonomous Region, which he toured in a party of foreign diplomats. It was one of two closely-supervised Tibetan tours put on for mostly western diplomats this year, a sign that the Communist Party — bravado notwithstanding — still cares about what western countries say regarding its human rights record.It may also have been an attempt to switch foreign attention to Tibet from the even more problematic neighbouring region of Xinjiang, where China's heavy-handed persecution of the Muslim Uighur people is opening new fronts for confrontation with the West.Barton said that he had consulted with pro-Tibet groups and academics in Canada before accepting the trip, which he said he undertook partly to show Tibetans the world was still concerned about their plight.In addition to discussing what he'd seen on the tour — which took in a school, a monastery and greenhouses — Barton also talked about the motives of the Communist Party in allowing the trip. He said he understood that ""what I saw was not the complete picture on any issue"" and described one effort to escape his minders — when he left his hotel at 5 a.m. for an unaccompanied stroll through the streets of Lhasa.Barton once famously described himself as ""a bull on China"" and his entire pre-diplomatic career was built on viewing China primarily as a business opportunity.During his last committee appearance, Barton told members he ""would love to talk more about promoting trade and investment. I probably should shut up and move on, but I'm very excited by the opportunity we have on many fronts.""This time, he took his own advice and left out the economic boosterism — suggesting that the ambassador had not only learned to read the room but perhaps understood how the ground had shifted under him.""Countries all around the world are evolving their approach to China,"" he told the subcommittee Tuesday night. That's certainly true in Europe, where both public attitudes and government approaches to China have become considerably tougher over the course of 2020. Shachi Kurl of the Angus Reid Institute said Barton's changed tone also reflects new realities at home.""This isn't just about Canada and Ambassador Barton aligning with the Western consensus,"" she told CBC's Power and Politics. ""It really is about aligning with the Canadian consensus, because for several years we have seen a deterioration, and then a deterioration, and then a further deterioration in Canadian views of the Beijing regime.""Opinion polls do show a crashing decline in China's standing in Canadian public opinion, reaching what Kurl calls ""an all-time low"" as 2020 draws to a close.""You now find among the Canadian population a bloody-mindedness that says, 'You know what? This is not OK,'"" she said. ""This is about more than the human rights situation, this is about more than events in Hong Kong. What has really viscerally affected Canadians is the kidnapping of the two Michaels.""Obviously, the detention of Kovrig and Spavor was always intended by Beijing to be a pressure tactic — not a play for hearts and minds. But it hasn't worked as a pressure tactic and has instead backfired disastrously upon China's public image.Would the CCP judge the strategy wise in hindsight, or consider it a failure? Either way, the need to save face makes it hard for the Communist Party — famously averse to backing down on anything — to alter its course now.During his committee appearance, Barton praised the two Canadians for their resilience, which he said was an inspiration to him.Barton was eager to mend fences when asked about another Canadian detainee: Huseyin Celil, a Uighur rights activist from Burlington, Ont. who was snatched on behalf of Chinese authorities while visiting Uzbekistan 14 years ago, whisked across the border and given a life sentence.When asked about the case in February, Barton said he had not been able to visit Celil because Celil was not a Canadian citizen. Once again, he was echoing a view espoused by the government of China, which has refused to recognize the fact that Celil has been a Canadian citizen since 2001. Foreign Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne was forced to correct the record in the House of Commons a few days after Barton's misstatement.Two former ambassadors to China condemned Barton's mischaracterization of Celil. ""China doesn't get to determine who is or becomes a Canadian citizen,"" said David Mulroney, who represented Canada in Beijing from 2009 to 2012.This time, Barton described the steps he had taken to reach out to the Celil family in the wake of that embarrassing incident.There is still no sign of progress in Celil's case, however. His detention differs from that of Kovrig and Spavor in that Celil was not seized as a bargaining chip to pressure Canada, and his case predates the Huawei dispute.Instead, Celil's detention intersects with another issue that has raised tensions between China and Canada — one that also came up in one of the tenser moments in this week's meeting between Barton and MPs.Conservative MP Garnett Genuis pressed Barton to make a clear statement on China's suppression of its Uighur minority, who are concentrated in the far western Xinjiang region.He read out the recent words of the Trudeau government's newish ambassador to the UN, Bob Rae, who told CBC News ""there's no question that there's aspects of what the Chinese are doing that fits into the definition of genocide in the genocide convention."" Did Barton agree with that statement? The ambassador refused to be pinned down, saying that while the situation was ""very, very concerning,"" more reports from the area were needed.Rights activists are particularly suspicious of Barton on this file because the company he headed, McKinsey, earned a reputation for indifference to Uighur suffering while eagerly promoting the Chinese government's economic plans for their homeland.The company defended itself but faced harsh criticism — even from the traditional business press.""I think we need to see the reports,"" Barton said. ""I haven't talked to Ambassador Rae about the particular evidence he has on that side.""""We need to have independent people on the ground who can go wherever they want"" in Xinjiang in order to determine what's happening, he added. Genuis was skeptical. ""We'd love to get access,"" he said. ""I think there's realities in terms of whether that's ever going to be given.""""Is Mr. Rae's statement consistent with the government's policy, or is yours?"" Genuis asked.Barton minimized the gap between the two, arguing that Rae was also seeking more investigation. A noticeable difference remained, however, in how the two men described the situation."

While questions remain about the Sinopharm shot, already at least one country outside China plans to roll it out in a mass-vaccination campaign.The U.A.E., home to Dubai and Abu Dhabi, conducted a trial beginning in September of the vaccine by Chinese state-owned pharmaceutical giant Sinopharm involving 31,000 volunteers from 125 nations. Volunteers between 18 and 60 years old received two doses of the vaccine over 28 days.The U.A.E.'s Health and Prevention Ministry announced the results via a statement on the state-run WAM news agency, saying it has ""reviewed Sinopharm CNBG's interim analysis of the Phase III trials.""""The analysis shows no serious safety concerns,"" the statement said, without detailing whether any participant suffered side effects.It wasn't immediately clear if the announced results included only those taking part in the testing in the UAE or if they also include results from China and elsewhere. The statement described the vaccine as receiving ""official registration"" without elaborating on what that meant.Emirati officials and Sinopharm did not respond to questions from The Associated Press.However, calls Wednesday to SEHA, the Abu Dhabi health authority, included an option for individuals to schedule an appointment to receive a ""COVID-19 vaccine."" The centre was swamped with calls following the announcement on the vaccine's efficacy.The Sinopharm vaccine has been approved for emergency use in a few countries and the company is still conducting late-stage clinical trials in 10 countries. Morocco is gearing up for an ambitious COVID-19 vaccination program, aiming to vaccinate 80 per cent of its adults in an operation starting this month that's relying initially on the Sinopharm vaccine.Sinopharm's shot relies on a tested technology, using a killed virus to deliver the vaccine, similar to how polio immunizations are made. Leading Western competitors, like the shot made by Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech, use newer, less-proven technology to target the coronavirus's spike protein using RNA. The United Kingdom already has begun vaccinating people with the Pfizer shot.WATCH | Inside the scramble to mass produce a COVID-19 vaccine:The NationalTop officials in the UAE, including Dubai's ruler, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, have publicly received the shots as part of the vaccine testing.Already, Pfizer reports its shot as being 95 per cent effective, while another RNA candidate from Moderna appears to be 94.5 per cent effective. Results suggest a third vaccine from Oxford University and AstraZeneca is safe and about 70 per cent effective, but questions remain about how well it may help protect those over 55.In transport, Pfizer says its vaccine must be stored in a freezer at –80 C to –60 C or in a thermal container at –90 C to –60 C. The Moderna vaccine must remain at a temperature of –20 C.The Sinopharm vaccine is believed to be able to travel at a temperature of 2 C to 8 C, a major draw for areas of the world where nearly three billion people live without stable electricity and refrigeration. In November, the Communist Party secretary for Sinopharm said almost one million people in China had received its vaccine.Since the pandemic began, the UAE has detected over 178,000 cases of the virus, with 160,000 recoveries and nearly 600 deaths. Its aggressive testing policy has seen over 17 million tests conducted in a country home to just over nine million people."

Venezuelan opposition claims large turnout in anti-Maduro protest | CBC News,Droves of Venezuelans blaming President Nicolas Maduro for their country's collapse voiced their frustrations Saturday in a creative protest rivalling recent elections they boycotted as fraudulent.,2020-12-13T04:15:45.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/venezuela-opposition-maduro-protest-1.5839520,"Droves of Venezuelans blaming President Nicolas Maduro for their country's collapse voiced their frustrations Saturday in a creative protest rivalling recent elections they boycotted as fraudulent.In the so-called ""people's consultation,"" U.S.-backed opposition leader Juan Guaido urged Venezuelans at home and around the world to register their ire through cellphone apps. Others visited makeshift polling stations in cities across Venezuela and in other Latin American Nations, the U.S. and Europe.""Hope has been mobilized in Venezuela,"" Guaido said shortly before the results were announced. ""We must underscore a heroic people who mobilized throughout the country and the world in defence of their rights.""Opposition leaders reported that nearly 6.5 million people responded to the survey. The Associated Press could not independently verify the validity of the figures, and even some opposition election experts questioned the number.The opposition's report said more than 3.2 million participated in person within Venezuela and nearly 850,000 visited centres outside the country, while more than 2.5 million sent in their responses digitally.The survey asked whether people want to end Maduro's rule and hold fresh presidential and legislative elections, and also seek even greater pressure from international allies to make it happen.Though the event had no legal force, opposition leaders said the survey would unify the foes of Maduro. That includes the five million Venezuelans who have fled the nation's hyperinflation and lack of basic services such as reliable running water, electricity and gasoline, they said.Mirla De Lorenzo, a bank employee, visited a center in her Caracas neighborhood to participate, saying she would take any opportunity to express herself if there was any chance it could bring international attention to Venezuela's plight and trigger an end to Maduro's rule.""We're definitely tired of this situation that's brought us nothing but poverty,"" she said, adding that her daughter moved to Spain and her sister migrated to Chile, among relatives who have fled the crisis.""You can't compete with deceitful people, with people who use force, with people who have weapons,"" she said. ""There is no way.""The consultation came days after Maduro's ruling socialist party declared victory in congressional elections that Guaido's coalition boycotted, arguing the vote was a fraud. Canada, the U.S. and the European Union are among the nations and regional bodies that rejected the elections as undemocratic.Guaido, acting as the National Assembly's leader, proclaimed himself interim president in early 2019, arguing that Maduro was an illegitimate leader because his most popular challengers were barred from running in the presidential election the previous year.Guaido quickly won broad support at home among energized supporters who flooded the streets as well as the backing of leaders in dozens of nations, including the U.S. The Trump administration took the lead, imposing sanctions on Maduro, dozens of his political allies and the state-run oil firm PDVSA. The U.S. Justice Department also unveiled an indictment of Maduro charging him with being a ""narcoterrorist,"" and offered a $15 million USreward for his arrest.Nearly two years later, however, Maduro remains in power with control of the military and international allies including Iran, Russia, China, Turkey and Cuba.On Jan. 5, the term of the current opposition-dominated National Assembly ends and Maduro's political allies take over the last governmental body not controlled by the president's socialist party. Guaido and his political allies vow to continue fighting.Risa Grais-Targow, a Venezuela analyst for the Eurasia Group, said that in addition to seeking to unite Venezuelans who don't like Maduro, the symbolic referendum was meant to send a message to international supporters.""They've organized a process for their foreign partners from the U.S. to the European Union and regional governments,"" Grais-Targow said. ""So they can continue to back him even when he's no longer in control of the National Assembly.""The U.S. ambassador for Venezuela, James Story, praised the opposition's survey from Colombia's capital, where he has worked since the U.S. and Venezuela broke diplomatic relations and the U.S. closed its embassy in Caracas.""We're proud to see the people of Venezuela in the street voting for their right to democracy, justice, liberty,"" Story tweeted. ""Their voices have been heard. Democracy must return to Venezuela.""Support among Venezuelans for the opposition has waned amid growing frustrations over Maduro remaining in power.Maduro's popularity is even lower. Just 31 per cent of Venezuela's voters cast ballots in the Dec. 5 congressional elections — less than half the turnout for the 2015 legislative elections.Maduro's ruling party staged a celebration in the historic centre of Caracas on Saturday to mark the victories of their National Assembly candidates, including Maduro's wife and son. Politicians gave speeches condemning the domestic opposition and U.S. policy interference in Venezuela. Salsa music played and people danced.A political talk show on state television Saturday night featured a segment mocking the referendum by showing cellphone videos said to have been recorded by people who drove by survey centers in cities across the nation.""There's nobody, absolutely nobody,"" one unidentified driver says. ""Look there's four people standing around talking nonsense."""

Not once,"" Wong said.He noted that China currently hosted no fewer that two dozen North Korea representatives connected to Pyongyang's weapons of mass destruction programs or banks.He accused China of ""seeking to undo the UN sanctions regime they themselves voted for in 2006, in 2009, in 2013, in 2016, and in 2017.""""They are seeking to revive trade links and revenue transfers to the North, thereby ensuring Chinese reach into the North's economy,"" he said.China insists it abides by UN sanctions requirements on North Korea, although it has also expressed hope, along with Russia, that an easing of those conditions could help break the deadlock in nuclear talks between Washington and Pyongyang."

That means many nations will likely have to choose some semblance of their 2021-22 national teams by the end of this season, since most of the world's tracks won't be iced and operating before those training weeks in China are held.""A replacement for the World Cup in March 2021 will be announced next week,"" Groesswang said.USA Bobsled and Skeleton and USA Luge are sitting out the pre-Christmas portions of the World Cup schedules in those sports, as are several other nations, because of concerns about international travel and other pandemic-related issues.In a women's World Cup bobsleigh race in Latvia on Saturday, only six sleds finished the two runs. That was believed to be the smallest World Cup field since women began competing on the circuit.It's been tradition for at least the last five Olympic cycles for a World Cup event to be held on that track that will host the games the following winter, and those races have been critical in terms of teams collecting data and formulating an Olympic strategy.But not having the training weeks and World Cups in China could raise the possibility of some nations, the U.S. included, not competing internationally at all this season."

"2 years after Meng Wanzhou's arrest, fate of 2 detained Canadians, China relationship hang in balance | CBC News","Two years after the arrest of Meng Wanzhou, the wife of Michael Kovrig, one of two Canadians detained in China, says she believes an end to the Huawei executive's extradition case would open the path to the detained men's liberation. But that end is still likely years away.",2020-12-01T09:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/meng-wanzhou-arrest-anniversary-michaels-1.5822546,"On a sweltering day last August, Michael Kovrig's wife sat in the back of a Vancouver courtroom, listening as lawyers for Meng Wanzhou and Canada's attorney general plotted out the coming months of the Huawei executive's extradition proceedings.It wasn't the first time Vina Nadjibulla had attended one of Meng's court dates.Her presence in B.C. Supreme Court represents a kind of collision of worlds: the slow drip of the legal process to determine if Meng should be extradited to the United States to face trial on charges of fraud and conspiracy on the one hand, and the urgent need for action on behalf of two Canadians whose fates appear tied to Meng's on the other.Kovrig, a former diplomat, and entrepreneur Michael Spavor were detained by Chinese authorities nine days after Meng's arrest at Vancouver International Airport on Dec. 1, 2018.They have  been charged with spying in a case most observers believe is simple retaliation for Canada's arrest of Huawei's chief financial officer at the request of the U.S.Nadjibulla is separated from Kovrig but remains his most vocal advocate. As the second anniversary of Meng's arrest rolls around, she says it has become impossible to detach Meng's situation from that of the two Michaels, as the men are known.""I have been following Meng's extradition case very closely because it is inextricably linked to Michael's unjust detention in China,"" Nadjibulla told CBC News.""I believe that an end to her extradition case, by one means or another, would open up the path to Michael's liberation as well.""It's been two years since Meng stepped off a Cathay Pacific flight from Hong Kong onto a jetway, where she was intercepted by Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) officers and her phones were bagged as RCMP officers watched unobserved from a short distance away.Police had obtained a provisional warrant for Meng's arrest the day before at the request of the U.S. Department of Justice.The 48-year-old is charged with lying to an HSBC banker in Hong Kong in August 2013 about Huawei's control of a subsidiary that is accused of violating U.S. economic sanctions against Iran.Prosecutors claim that by relying on Meng's alleged lies to continue a financial relationship with Huawei, HSBC was placed at risk of loss and prosecution.Meng has denied the accusations against her.""Ms. Meng is staying patient and positive,"" said Alykhan Velshi, vice-president of corporate affairs at Huawei Canada. ""It can be trying at times because she knows the charges against her are false. She believes that she's a pawn in a global game of chess.""But right from the start, she's always expressed faith in Canada's system of justice.""Meng is the daughter of Huawei's billionaire founder, Ren Zhengfei.Her arrest came as the United States was beginning a campaign to exclude Huawei from being part of the country's next generation of wireless technology — known as 5G. The U.S., one of five countries belonging to the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing network, has labelled the telecommunications giant a security threat and called on its allies to follow suit.Other members of the Five Eyes network — the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand — have all blocked the use of Huawei's technology, while Canada has still not decided if Huawei can be part of its 5G grid.Yves Tiberghien, a political science professor at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, said Meng's arrest has highlighted questions over the future of wireless technology, as well as the trade battle between the U.S. and China, which has its roots in concerns over intellectual property theft.But he said the case also speaks to the Americans' use of sanctions law and its financial system to pressure rivals, as well as China's hard-line tactics and lack of respect for human rights — as seen in the country's targeting of Canadian exports and the imprisonment of Kovrig and Spavor.""This is at the intersection of all those fault lines,"" Tiberghien said.""For Canadians, the No. 1 story is the two Michaels, and so there is a lot of frustration in Canada, and the plight of the two Michaels is a prism to understand a much more aggressive China.""The case also promises to test Canada's extradition law as Meng's legal team painstakingly exposes every element of the case to scrutiny — beginning with the moments that immediately followed her first steps on Canadian soil.CBSA officers questioned Meng for almost three hours before they handed her over to the RCMP. Her lawyers claim the two agencies conspired with the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation to have customs officers question her without a lawyer, in violation of her rights.The officers who were involved in the arrest have been on the witness stand in recent weeks, giving testimony that the defence is hoping can be used to bolster an argument to have the case tossed out next spring for alleged abuse of process.RCMP officers have testified that they deferred to CBSA jurisdiction as ""gatekeepers"" to Canada, and the border officers claimed that legitimate concerns about Meng as a potential national security threat warranted the beginning of an admissibility exam.But working against the Crown, a CBSA officer gave the RCMP a piece of paper on which he wrote the passcodes to her phones, allegedly by mistake. And an RCMP staff sergeant whom the defence accuses of sending the serial numbers belonging to Meng's electronic devices to the FBI is refusing to testify.All have denied any wrongdoing or collusion. Their testimony, originally scheduled to last two weeks, has expanded to at least four, likely pushing other dates in the extradition proceedings further into 2021.It's hard to know whether the evidence points to conspiracy, business as usual or a sloppiness that fits somewhere in the middle.Associate Chief Justice Heather Holmes has remarked on the huge amount of detail that has emerged from the testimony so far, asking the defence and the Crown to ready submissions on what it all means as she prepares to wade through it.The defence also plans to argue that U.S. President Donald Trump is using Meng as a bargaining chip in trade with China and that the United States deliberately misled Canada into the extradition proceedings by omitting key facts that undermined the strength of the case.Gary Botting, a Vancouver-based legal expert and author on extradition law, said he doesn't expect those arguments will ultimately be substantive enough to derail the proceedings. He agrees with high-profile supporters of the two Michaels — such as former Liberal justice minister Allan Rock and former Supreme Court of Canada justice Louise Arbour — who say there is nothing stopping Justice Minister David Lametti from intervening to end the case.The Liberal government has repeatedly stated that the rule of law has to play out in court before Lametti can weigh in, but over the summer, Rock, Arbour and others sought a legal opinion from Toronto lawyer Brian Greenspan, who said Lametti has the ability to act at any time.Botting said he thinks he should. The facts of the case are weak, he said, and he's troubled by Canada being pulled into a request involving a Chinese national, a British bank and a lie that allegedly happened in Hong Kong.""I think it's significant in the sense that it's very clear that the minister of justice has complete control over who is sent over to a foreign country upon a request for extradition,"" Botting said.""He can say no at any point.""Prime Minister Justin Trudeau recently congratulated U.S. president-elect Joe Biden on his victory in last month's election. He also brought up the issue of the two Michaels, but there's no indication of what a new U.S. administration might mean for the proceedings.Nadjibulla said she'll continue to attend Meng's court proceedings, which began last fall, if she can. And wait.""Given the complexities of this extradition request and absent an intervention by the U.S. or Canadian authorities, the legal process is likely to take years,"" she said.Meng has been living under a form of house arrest since her release on $10 million bail, a little more than a week after she was arrested.She is required to wear a GPS monitoring bracelet on her ankle and is trailed by around-the-clock security, whom she pays to ensure she doesn't travel beyond court-ordered boundaries that stop short of the ferry terminals and airport.It's a far cry from the conditions Kovrig and Spavor have endured since they were first detained in China. Kovrig has spent months in solitary confinement. The COVID-19 pandemic also meant both men were cut off from consular visits last January.They were only recently allowed two virtual visits with the Canadian ambassador.China has provided no evidence of the claims against them. They've also been given no idea of when they might face a trial.Unlike Meng, though, the outcome — if it comes to that — is in little doubt.Experts say China has a 99.9 per cent conviction rate."

Let's not fall into the temptation of tough and irresponsible rhetoric that will generate no tangible result for Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, our farmers and entrepreneurs, and human rights victims and advocates.""The two Michaels, as they've come to be known, have been imprisoned in China for almost two years in retaliation for Canada's arrest of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou on an extradition request from the United States.Canadian farmers, fishers and exporters have also been hurt by retaliatory measures taken by China in the wake of Meng's arrest.Champagne's plea came a week after the House of Commons passed a Conservative motion calling on the government to decide by Dec. 18 whether to allow Huawei to be involved in development of Canada's next generation 5G wireless network.The motion, passed with the support of all opposition parties over the objections of the government, also called on the government to unveil within 30 days a robust plan to deal with growing intimidation by China of Canadians within Canada's borders.The motion is not binding and Champagne told the committee that government action on both fronts will be guided by national security requirements, not by arbitrary deadlines.Since taking over the helm of the Conservatives last August, Erin O'Toole has made standing up to China a central pillar of his pitch to Canadian voters.The Conservative leader has accused Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's Liberal government of being ""willing to look past the Chinese government's numerous human rights abuses, flagrant trade abuses and security issues because the potential to sell into the massive Chinese market was so lucrative.""""Trudeau's approach to China has failed, and it's weakened our standing in the world. We must stand up for our citizens who have been detained as bargaining chips in an extradition case, even if it leads to more reprisals from Beijing,"" O'Toole argued in an op-ed in the National Post in September.O'Toole has called for an ""eyes wide open"" approach to relations with China. But Champagne contended that's precisely the approach his government is taking.He argued that Canada's policy toward China has evolved as China itself has evolved, increasingly flouting the international rules-based order, violating the human rights of Uighurs in Xinjiang province and democracy protesters in Hong Kong, and engaging in ""coercive diplomacy"" to get its way.""The China of 2020 is not the China of 2015 or even the China of 2018,"" Champagne said.""We see a country and a leadership increasingly prepared to throw its weight around to advance its interests.""Champagne said the government has adopted a new framework for dealing with China. He described it as a three-pronged approach in which there will be areas, such as human rights abuses, where Canada needs to challenge China.In other areas, such as trade matters, he said Canada needs to compete with China, and still other areas where Canada needs to co-operate with China, such as the fight against climate change.China's more aggressive posture is not just a challenge for Canada, he argued. Countries around the world are grappling with it.Champagne said the best antidote is for all liberal democracies to band together to speak with one voice to pressure China to change its ways — just as Canada has rallied other countries to speak out against the detention of Kovrig and Spavor."
Canada's ties to China's military underscore the weird contradictions in its foreign policy | CBC News,It's been obvious for some time that there is something a little weird about the way Canada approaches its relationship with China — a disconnect brought into sharp relief this week by the news that Global Affairs and the Department of National Defence were not on the same page when it came to military ties and training involving the People’s Liberation Army.,2020-12-12T09:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canada-china-pla-peoples-liberation-army-1.5838658,"It's been obvious for some time that there is something weird about the way Canada approaches its relationship with China — a disconnect brought into sharp relief this week by the news that Global Affairs and the Department of National Defence were not on the same page when it came to military ties and training involving the People's Liberation Army.In some respects, the volcanic online political eruption which followed stories in The Globe and Mail and other media outlets, based on exclusive access to information documents, was predictable, as was the flurry of finger-pointing in the House of Commons on Thursday and Friday.Diplomats were alarmed when Gen. Jonathan Vance, the country's senior military commander, cancelled winter military exercises with the PLA in 2019, fretting that it might aggravate Beijing or make the lives of Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor even worse.It makes for fire-breathing memes, sizzling copy and wonderful political theatre.What's missing, though, is a recognition that Canada's policy toward a rising China has been contradictory and incoherent for almost a decade, maybe more, said Charles Burton, a political scientist at Brock University in St. Catharines, Ont. and a respected China expert at the Macdonald-Laurier Institute.""Cabinets were always split on China, whether it's Liberal or Conservative,"" Burton said, referring to debates more than three decades ago during the government of former prime minister Brian Mulroney.It is more urgent than ever, in the context of an increasingly belligerent and assertive China, to present a united political front, he added.""This is really about the defence of our sovereignty and security on matters over which there is consensus across the political spectrum in Canada,"" he said.Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan, in an attempt at political damage control late this week, made a point of saying that Chinese troops are no longer training for winter warfare at Garrison Petawawa, Ont.He also (rather meekly) noted that the exchange and training program with the PLA was instituted in August 2013 under the Conservatives while defence critic James Bezan, one of the most vocal and fiery opponents this week, was parliamentary secretary of defence.Bezan's retort was along the lines of that was then, this is now.""The defence minister knows full well that the Chinese government back then and the Chinese government today are completely different,"" Bezan said during question period on Thursday.It was a different time, no question.Chinese President Xi Jinping had taken office only a few months before, and the Department of National Defence (DND) tasking order that established the exchange program, obtained by CBC News under access to information, noted that working with the PLA ""complements the Government of Canada led efforts to broaden our bilateral relationship with China.""After years of hectoring and hammering China, the Conservatives — under former prime minister Stephen Harper — had decided that limited engagement was the way to go.And here is where Canada's curious incoherence comes into play.At precisely the moment the former chief of the defence staff, the now-retired general Tom Lawson, was penning the Canadian military's marching orders on closer cooperation with the PLA, the foreign affairs ministry — led at the time by John Baird — was firing off flares about China's unilateral declaration of an air defence zone in the East China Sea.It was a bellwether moment.""The U.S. has indicated deep concern over the establishment of the Chinese ADIZ stating that the U.S. views this development as a destabilizing attempt to alter the status quo in the region and that this move increases the risk of misunderstanding and miscalculations,"" said a Nov. 23, 2013 briefing note to Baird, obtained by CBC News in 2017.""More broadly, the rise of China is reshaping the strategic landscape.""Burton said the rise of President Xi marked the beginning of the new, more aggressive China. The establishment of the air zone — now largely forgotten against a backdrop of fortified artificial islands in the South China Sea, reports of Uyghurs in concentration camps and the haze of tear gas in Hong Kong — marked the first step.So were our politicians and senior leaders paying attention not only to events, but to what other federal departments were saying?According to what former foreign affairs minister (and current finance minister) Chrystia Freeland had to say in question period this week, the answer is yes.""I have long personal experience reporting on authoritarian communist regimes and I am very aware of the threat they pose,"" she said.Here's the question no one seemed to ask this week: why was the military exchange and training program still going on even before hostage diplomacy swept up the two Michaels?National Defence is no stranger to suspicions about China, having spent an enormous amount of time quietly defending itself from cyberattacks purportedly launched by  Beijing or by groups associated with it.The Trump administration has been tightening the screws on China from a diplomatic, security and trade perspective. There has been considerable, growing debate among Western allies — led by the Americans — about the downside of military engagement and co-operation with China, with Five Eyes intelligence partners each exchanging their own warnings — a series of discussions that eventually prompted Canada's current top military commander, Gen. Jonathan Vance, to cancel the winter warfare exercises.And then, of course, there's debate over the telecom giant Huawei and its future in this country.The signs were all there, Burton said — but no one actually woke up to the problem until Kovrig and Spavor were imprisoned. The public has been galvanized, he added, but ""it doesn't seem to have penetrated fully to the senior levels of the political and economic elite.""Burton said that — as weird as it might sound, with everything else that has happened — he believes there are some within the Canadian Establishment who still cling to the notion that if the ""consular cases of Spavor and Kovrig are resolved, we can go back"" to business as usual."
"In Ottawa's rush to buy PPE, companies with little or no experience got some of the biggest contracts | CBC News",The federal government awarded a $371-million contract to secure personal protective equipment — one of the largest medical supply deals in its history — to a small company headquartered in a house in suburban Ottawa that had no apparent prior experience in PPE procurement.,2020-12-13T09:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/ppe-covid-coronavirus-personal-protective-equipment-politics-1.5831340,"This story is part of The Big Spend, a CBC News investigation examining the unprecedented $240 billion the federal government handed out during the first eight months of the pandemic.The federal government awarded a $371-million contract to secure personal protective equipment — one of the largest medical supply deals in its history — to a small company headquartered in a house in suburban Ottawa that had no apparent prior experience in PPE procurement.Proline Advantage Inc.'s tender submission was one of more than 26,000 received by the government through its BuyandSell.gc.ca portal after it put out a call to suppliers last March for help procuring PPE.Of those thousands of submissions, a number of lucrative contracts went to low-profile companies that pivoted to the PPE market, seeing opportunity in the mad dash to secure supplies in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic.In the case of Proline Advantage Inc., the government says the company delivered the goods and fulfilled the obligations of its contract by August, coincidentally the same month Proline's PPE procurement website went live.The company's headquarters is owned by its two directors, Mike Caron and Chantal Beauchamp. Caron is also listed as a partner in a nutritional supplement company called Max Q and is the founder and director of Portions Master, a company that sells supplements and a product called the Skinny Plate. Available on Amazon, the Skinny Plate is a plastic dish with dividers designed to help limit portion sizes.Caron declined the CBC's request for an interview, providing an emailed statement instead.""Our company is experienced in supply chain management and has a proud track record of sourcing products of various types from around the world,"" Caron wrote.""Like many firms, we were able to quickly pivot our business, and leverage our international sourcing expertise to answer the government's call and address the immediate and pressing need to provide PPE to front-line medical professionals.""In total, the federal government has spent just over $6.1 billion on what it describes as ""a broad range of equipment and supplies from domestic and international suppliers to combat COVID-19,"" not including vaccines.As of Oct. 15, gowns were the biggest-ticket item on the list — accounting for 29 per cent of the overall amount, at nearly $1.8 billion.Proline Advantage Inc.'s contract of $371,318,000 accounted for almost 21 per cent of that.In addition to gowns, Proline's contract included about $17.5 million for other protective clothing such as shoe and boot covers, and disposable overalls.WATCH | The 'Wild West' early days of the scramble for PPE:The NationalThe size of the contract, and the fact it's at the top of the list posted by Public Services and Procurement Canada, has drawn media attention and raised some eyebrows among Conservative MPs and some supply chain experts.""The largest medical supply contract in Canadian history was given to Proline Advantage for medical gowns,"" Conservative MP Pierre Paul-Hus said in a meeting of the government operations committee last month. ""I want to know whether or not this company is well established in the medical field.""""This company is a small business and ensured that their gowns were made available as soon as possible by renting the largest plane in the world until all of their gowns were delivered,"" responded Anita Anand, minister of public services and procurement.""This company stepped up at the beginning of the crisis when this country had no gowns, gloves, masks and the like. We need to respect the ability of small and large businesses across this country to step up for Canadians.""Anand's deputy minister, Bill Matthews, pointed out that the company had ""a history of importing medical goods into Canada.""In all, 26 contracts were awarded to 23 different suppliers for more than 132 million medical gowns.In some cases, finding out more about the companies involved is a challenge.MuFactor Ltd., for example, received a contract worth $257 million, also to procure gowns. The company is registered in Alberta, with its headquarters listed as a house in northwest Calgary. Searches of import databases show MuFactor has a history of importing furniture. Very little other information is available about the company — no contact information online, no email, no phone number.CBC News has asked the government about the status of the MuFactor contract and is awaiting its response.""What I've seen in my work over the last eight months … there's been a lot of opportunistic organizations, distributors that don't have any experience in procuring health care, PPE and equipment, that have kind of popped up,"" said Fraser Johnson, an expert on supply chain management at Western University's Ivey Business School.""From a procurement standpoint, if you're going to write contracts for several billions of dollars, and in these cases, tens of millions of dollars, you want to make sure that you know what the background of the company is.""That vetting process should assess whether a company is financially stable; what expertise it brings to the table; and the cost and quality of the products it can buy and how quickly it can deliver, he said.In a statement to CBC News, Public Services and Procurement Canada says potential suppliers were required to provide manufacturers' test results and certifications, and the Public Health Agency of Canada was responsible for validating those documents. Financial capability assessments were also performed, and delivery schedules were validated and confirmed, the statement says.Delivery of the PPE is validated and quality assurance tests are performed on site by the Public Health Agency of Canada, the government says.The speed and sheer size of the PPE procurement was in response to a desperate need in the early stages of the pandemic.""There was concern we didn't have sufficient domestic supply,"" said Dr. Sandy Buchman, who was head of the Canadian Medical Association when the COVID-19 crisis began last spring.""For example, I was told locally by the leadership in a Toronto hospital that they were concerned that they had a two-day supply of PPE at the beginning of the pandemic. So, obviously, things were very thin at the time.""There was a sense from government that they were scrambling to find PPE wherever they could.""Established PPE suppliers watched newcomers pour into the market.""There were literally tens of thousands of new entrants,"" said David Welsh, CEO of Edmonton-based Primed Medical Products, a company with 25 years of experience procuring and manufacturing a range of PPE.Ottawa has spent $240B fighting COVID-19 in just 8 months. A CBC investigation follows the moneyWelsh, whose company was awarded $93 million in government PPE contracts, says Ottawa did an excellent job of securing enormous amounts of PPE at a time when it was in huge demand around the world.""But, yes, it was the Wild West. Decisions had to be made more quickly than normal. And the level of due diligence had to be shortened,"" he said.Necessarily so, say some experts, because of the fast-moving, highly volatile situation at the time.""This was akin to a war footing here, given the severity of the event,"" said Vikas Mehrotra, a business professor at the University of Alberta.Mehrotra said the government had to act quickly because other countries would be chasing the same PPE supplies and there was concern the world would be cut off from PPE manufacturers, most of which are based in China.""The purpose was to make sure that in case we get shut off from the global supply chain, we still have our own equipment to deal with the crisis,"" said Mehrotra.In that sense, he said, the $6-billion government PPE procurement operation was an overwhelming success, regardless of who filled the orders."

"As Canadians sour on China, an ambassador changes his tone | CBC News","Dominic Barton, Canada's ambassador to China, made his first appearance at the China committee this week since before the pandemic hit Canada. He was noticeably less forgiving of Beijing and less bullish on business opportunities than last time — perhaps reflecting a turn against China in public opinion.",2020-12-10T09:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/china-kovrig-spavor-dominic-barton-1.5835036,"Today marks two years since the two Michaels were detained by China.It's also been ten long pandemic months since Canada's ambassador to Beijing, Dominic Barton, made his previous appearance before the Commons subcommittee on Canada-China relations. Tuesday's second round of that hearing showed how much the mood around China has changed during 2020. Barton appeared conscious of the need to make some repairs to the impression he left in February, when his testimony drew unusually direct criticism from former diplomats with experience working in China.Back then, Barton suggested that it was incumbent upon Canadians to recognize that ""China values unity and the needs of society at large, rather than freedom of individual choice ... we just have to understand that.""Former diplomat and China expert Charles Burton told the subcommittee that Barton's words parroted Communist Party propaganda asserting that Chinese culture is inherently averse to liberty and democracy — when in fact the aversion comes from Xi Jinping's Politburo.Watch: Trudeau says government will examine all options to bring Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig.:Politics NewsIn his Tuesday appearance, however, Barton opened with remarks on ""our efforts to promote rights and freedoms in China.""""We are concerned by the decline of civil and political rights in China,"" he told MPs.Barton began his appearance with a lengthy description of a recent visit to the Tibet Autonomous Region, which he toured in a party of foreign diplomats. It was one of two closely-supervised Tibetan tours put on for mostly western diplomats this year, a sign that the Communist Party — bravado notwithstanding — still cares about what western countries say regarding its human rights record.It may also have been an attempt to switch foreign attention to Tibet from the even more problematic neighbouring region of Xinjiang, where China's heavy-handed persecution of the Muslim Uighur people is opening new fronts for confrontation with the West.Barton said that he had consulted with pro-Tibet groups and academics in Canada before accepting the trip, which he said he undertook partly to show Tibetans the world was still concerned about their plight.In addition to discussing what he'd seen on the tour — which took in a school, a monastery and greenhouses — Barton also talked about the motives of the Communist Party in allowing the trip. He said he understood that ""what I saw was not the complete picture on any issue"" and described one effort to escape his minders — when he left his hotel at 5 a.m. for an unaccompanied stroll through the streets of Lhasa.Barton once famously described himself as ""a bull on China"" and his entire pre-diplomatic career was built on viewing China primarily as a business opportunity.During his last committee appearance, Barton told members he ""would love to talk more about promoting trade and investment. I probably should shut up and move on, but I'm very excited by the opportunity we have on many fronts.""This time, he took his own advice and left out the economic boosterism — suggesting that the ambassador had not only learned to read the room but perhaps understood how the ground had shifted under him.""Countries all around the world are evolving their approach to China,"" he told the subcommittee Tuesday night. That's certainly true in Europe, where both public attitudes and government approaches to China have become considerably tougher over the course of 2020. Shachi Kurl of the Angus Reid Institute said Barton's changed tone also reflects new realities at home.""This isn't just about Canada and Ambassador Barton aligning with the Western consensus,"" she told CBC's Power and Politics. ""It really is about aligning with the Canadian consensus, because for several years we have seen a deterioration, and then a deterioration, and then a further deterioration in Canadian views of the Beijing regime.""Opinion polls do show a crashing decline in China's standing in Canadian public opinion, reaching what Kurl calls ""an all-time low"" as 2020 draws to a close.""You now find among the Canadian population a bloody-mindedness that says, 'You know what? This is not OK,'"" she said. ""This is about more than the human rights situation, this is about more than events in Hong Kong. What has really viscerally affected Canadians is the kidnapping of the two Michaels.""Obviously, the detention of Kovrig and Spavor was always intended by Beijing to be a pressure tactic — not a play for hearts and minds. But it hasn't worked as a pressure tactic and has instead backfired disastrously upon China's public image.Would the CCP judge the strategy wise in hindsight, or consider it a failure? Either way, the need to save face makes it hard for the Communist Party — famously averse to backing down on anything — to alter its course now.During his committee appearance, Barton praised the two Canadians for their resilience, which he said was an inspiration to him.Barton was eager to mend fences when asked about another Canadian detainee: Huseyin Celil, a Uighur rights activist from Burlington, Ont. who was snatched on behalf of Chinese authorities while visiting Uzbekistan 14 years ago, whisked across the border and given a life sentence.When asked about the case in February, Barton said he had not been able to visit Celil because Celil was not a Canadian citizen. Once again, he was echoing a view espoused by the government of China, which has refused to recognize the fact that Celil has been a Canadian citizen since 2001. Foreign Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne was forced to correct the record in the House of Commons a few days after Barton's misstatement.Two former ambassadors to China condemned Barton's mischaracterization of Celil. ""China doesn't get to determine who is or becomes a Canadian citizen,"" said David Mulroney, who represented Canada in Beijing from 2009 to 2012.This time, Barton described the steps he had taken to reach out to the Celil family in the wake of that embarrassing incident.There is still no sign of progress in Celil's case, however. His detention differs from that of Kovrig and Spavor in that Celil was not seized as a bargaining chip to pressure Canada, and his case predates the Huawei dispute.Instead, Celil's detention intersects with another issue that has raised tensions between China and Canada — one that also came up in one of the tenser moments in this week's meeting between Barton and MPs.Conservative MP Garnett Genuis pressed Barton to make a clear statement on China's suppression of its Uighur minority, who are concentrated in the far western Xinjiang region.He read out the recent words of the Trudeau government's newish ambassador to the UN, Bob Rae, who told CBC News ""there's no question that there's aspects of what the Chinese are doing that fits into the definition of genocide in the genocide convention."" Did Barton agree with that statement? The ambassador refused to be pinned down, saying that while the situation was ""very, very concerning,"" more reports from the area were needed.Rights activists are particularly suspicious of Barton on this file because the company he headed, McKinsey, earned a reputation for indifference to Uighur suffering while eagerly promoting the Chinese government's economic plans for their homeland.The company defended itself but faced harsh criticism — even from the traditional business press.""I think we need to see the reports,"" Barton said. ""I haven't talked to Ambassador Rae about the particular evidence he has on that side.""""We need to have independent people on the ground who can go wherever they want"" in Xinjiang in order to determine what's happening, he added. Genuis was skeptical. ""We'd love to get access,"" he said. ""I think there's realities in terms of whether that's ever going to be given.""""Is Mr. Rae's statement consistent with the government's policy, or is yours?"" Genuis asked.Barton minimized the gap between the two, arguing that Rae was also seeking more investigation. A noticeable difference remained, however, in how the two men described the situation."

While questions remain about the Sinopharm shot, already at least one country outside China plans to roll it out in a mass-vaccination campaign.The U.A.E., home to Dubai and Abu Dhabi, conducted a trial beginning in September of the vaccine by Chinese state-owned pharmaceutical giant Sinopharm involving 31,000 volunteers from 125 nations. Volunteers between 18 and 60 years old received two doses of the vaccine over 28 days.The U.A.E.'s Health and Prevention Ministry announced the results via a statement on the state-run WAM news agency, saying it has ""reviewed Sinopharm CNBG's interim analysis of the Phase III trials.""""The analysis shows no serious safety concerns,"" the statement said, without detailing whether any participant suffered side effects.It wasn't immediately clear if the announced results included only those taking part in the testing in the UAE or if they also include results from China and elsewhere. The statement described the vaccine as receiving ""official registration"" without elaborating on what that meant.Emirati officials and Sinopharm did not respond to questions from The Associated Press.However, calls Wednesday to SEHA, the Abu Dhabi health authority, included an option for individuals to schedule an appointment to receive a ""COVID-19 vaccine."" The centre was swamped with calls following the announcement on the vaccine's efficacy.The Sinopharm vaccine has been approved for emergency use in a few countries and the company is still conducting late-stage clinical trials in 10 countries. Morocco is gearing up for an ambitious COVID-19 vaccination program, aiming to vaccinate 80 per cent of its adults in an operation starting this month that's relying initially on the Sinopharm vaccine.Sinopharm's shot relies on a tested technology, using a killed virus to deliver the vaccine, similar to how polio immunizations are made. Leading Western competitors, like the shot made by Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech, use newer, less-proven technology to target the coronavirus's spike protein using RNA. The United Kingdom already has begun vaccinating people with the Pfizer shot.WATCH | Inside the scramble to mass produce a COVID-19 vaccine:The NationalTop officials in the UAE, including Dubai's ruler, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, have publicly received the shots as part of the vaccine testing.Already, Pfizer reports its shot as being 95 per cent effective, while another RNA candidate from Moderna appears to be 94.5 per cent effective. Results suggest a third vaccine from Oxford University and AstraZeneca is safe and about 70 per cent effective, but questions remain about how well it may help protect those over 55.In transport, Pfizer says its vaccine must be stored in a freezer at –80 C to –60 C or in a thermal container at –90 C to –60 C. The Moderna vaccine must remain at a temperature of –20 C.The Sinopharm vaccine is believed to be able to travel at a temperature of 2 C to 8 C, a major draw for areas of the world where nearly three billion people live without stable electricity and refrigeration.

Venezuelan opposition claims large turnout in anti-Maduro protest | CBC News,Droves of Venezuelans blaming President Nicolas Maduro for their country's collapse voiced their frustrations Saturday in a creative protest rivalling recent elections they boycotted as fraudulent.,2020-12-13T04:15:45.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/venezuela-opposition-maduro-protest-1.5839520,"Droves of Venezuelans blaming President Nicolas Maduro for their country's collapse voiced their frustrations Saturday in a creative protest rivalling recent elections they boycotted as fraudulent.In the so-called ""people's consultation,"" U.S.-backed opposition leader Juan Guaido urged Venezuelans at home and around the world to register their ire through cellphone apps. Others visited makeshift polling stations in cities across Venezuela and in other Latin American Nations, the U.S. and Europe.""Hope has been mobilized in Venezuela,"" Guaido said shortly before the results were announced. ""We must underscore a heroic people who mobilized throughout the country and the world in defence of their rights.""Opposition leaders reported that nearly 6.5 million people responded to the survey. The Associated Press could not independently verify the validity of the figures, and even some opposition election experts questioned the number.The opposition's report said more than 3.2 million participated in person within Venezuela and nearly 850,000 visited centres outside the country, while more than 2.5 million sent in their responses digitally.The survey asked whether people want to end Maduro's rule and hold fresh presidential and legislative elections, and also seek even greater pressure from international allies to make it happen.Though the event had no legal force, opposition leaders said the survey would unify the foes of Maduro. That includes the five million Venezuelans who have fled the nation's hyperinflation and lack of basic services such as reliable running water, electricity and gasoline, they said.Mirla De Lorenzo, a bank employee, visited a center in her Caracas neighborhood to participate, saying she would take any opportunity to express herself if there was any chance it could bring international attention to Venezuela's plight and trigger an end to Maduro's rule.""We're definitely tired of this situation that's brought us nothing but poverty,"" she said, adding that her daughter moved to Spain and her sister migrated to Chile, among relatives who have fled the crisis.""You can't compete with deceitful people, with people who use force, with people who have weapons,"" she said. ""There is no way.""The consultation came days after Maduro's ruling socialist party declared victory in congressional elections that Guaido's coalition boycotted, arguing the vote was a fraud. Canada, the U.S. and the European Union are among the nations and regional bodies that rejected the elections as undemocratic.Guaido, acting as the National Assembly's leader, proclaimed himself interim president in early 2019, arguing that Maduro was an illegitimate leader because his most popular challengers were barred from running in the presidential election the previous year.Guaido quickly won broad support at home among energized supporters who flooded the streets as well as the backing of leaders in dozens of nations, including the U.S. The Trump administration took the lead, imposing sanctions on Maduro, dozens of his political allies and the state-run oil firm PDVSA. The U.S. Justice Department also unveiled an indictment of Maduro charging him with being a ""narcoterrorist,"" and offered a $15 million USreward for his arrest.Nearly two years later, however, Maduro remains in power with control of the military and international allies including Iran, Russia, China, Turkey and Cuba.On Jan. 5, the term of the current opposition-dominated National Assembly ends and Maduro's political allies take over the last governmental body not controlled by the president's socialist party. Guaido and his political allies vow to continue fighting.Risa Grais-Targow, a Venezuela analyst for the Eurasia Group, said that in addition to seeking to unite Venezuelans who don't like Maduro, the symbolic referendum was meant to send a message to international supporters.""They've organized a process for their foreign partners from the U.S. to the European Union and regional governments,"" Grais-Targow said. ""So they can continue to back him even when he's no longer in control of the National Assembly.""The U.S. ambassador for Venezuela, James Story, praised the opposition's survey from Colombia's capital, where he has worked since the U.S. and Venezuela broke diplomatic relations and the U.S. closed its embassy in Caracas.""We're proud to see the people of Venezuela in the street voting for their right to democracy, justice, liberty,"" Story tweeted. ""Their voices have been heard. Democracy must return to Venezuela.""Support among Venezuelans for the opposition has waned amid growing frustrations over Maduro remaining in power.Maduro's popularity is even lower. Just 31 per cent of Venezuela's voters cast ballots in the Dec. 5 congressional elections — less than half the turnout for the 2015 legislative elections.Maduro's ruling party staged a celebration in the historic centre of Caracas on Saturday to mark the victories of their National Assembly candidates, including Maduro's wife and son. Politicians gave speeches condemning the domestic opposition and U.S. policy interference in Venezuela. Salsa music played and people danced.A political talk show on state television Saturday night featured a segment mocking the referendum by showing cellphone videos said to have been recorded by people who drove by survey centers in cities across the nation.""There's nobody, absolutely nobody,"" one unidentified driver says. ""Look there's four people standing around talking nonsense."""

Not once,"" Wong said.He noted that China currently hosted no fewer that two dozen North Korea representatives connected to Pyongyang's weapons of mass destruction programs or banks.He accused China of ""seeking to undo the UN sanctions regime they themselves voted for in 2006, in 2009, in 2013, in 2016, and in 2017.""""They are seeking to revive trade links and revenue transfers to the North, thereby ensuring Chinese reach into the North's economy,"" he said.China insists it abides by UN sanctions requirements on North Korea, although it has also expressed hope, along with Russia, that an easing of those conditions could help break the deadlock in nuclear talks between Washington and Pyongyang."

That means many nations will likely have to choose some semblance of their 2021-22 national teams by the end of this season, since most of the world's tracks won't be iced and operating before those training weeks in China are held.""A replacement for the World Cup in March 2021 will be announced next week,"" Groesswang said.USA Bobsled and Skeleton and USA Luge are sitting out the pre-Christmas portions of the World Cup schedules in those sports, as are several other nations, because of concerns about international travel and other pandemic-related issues.In a women's World Cup bobsleigh race in Latvia on Saturday, only six sleds finished the two runs. That was believed to be the smallest World Cup field since women began competing on the circuit.It's been tradition for at least the last five Olympic cycles for a World Cup event to be held on that track that will host the games the following winter, and those races have been critical in terms of teams collecting data and formulating an Olympic strategy.But not having the training weeks and World Cups in China could raise the possibility of some nations, the U.S. included, not competing internationally at all this season."

"2 years after Meng Wanzhou's arrest, fate of 2 detained Canadians, China relationship hang in balance | CBC News","Two years after the arrest of Meng Wanzhou, the wife of Michael Kovrig, one of two Canadians detained in China, says she believes an end to the Huawei executive's extradition case would open the path to the detained men's liberation. But that end is still likely years away.",2020-12-01T09:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/meng-wanzhou-arrest-anniversary-michaels-1.5822546,"On a sweltering day last August, Michael Kovrig's wife sat in the back of a Vancouver courtroom, listening as lawyers for Meng Wanzhou and Canada's attorney general plotted out the coming months of the Huawei executive's extradition proceedings.It wasn't the first time Vina Nadjibulla had attended one of Meng's court dates.Her presence in B.C. Supreme Court represents a kind of collision of worlds: the slow drip of the legal process to determine if Meng should be extradited to the United States to face trial on charges of fraud and conspiracy on the one hand, and the urgent need for action on behalf of two Canadians whose fates appear tied to Meng's on the other.Kovrig, a former diplomat, and entrepreneur Michael Spavor were detained by Chinese authorities nine days after Meng's arrest at Vancouver International Airport on Dec. 1, 2018.They have  been charged with spying in a case most observers believe is simple retaliation for Canada's arrest of Huawei's chief financial officer at the request of the U.S.Nadjibulla is separated from Kovrig but remains his most vocal advocate. As the second anniversary of Meng's arrest rolls around, she says it has become impossible to detach Meng's situation from that of the two Michaels, as the men are known.""I have been following Meng's extradition case very closely because it is inextricably linked to Michael's unjust detention in China,"" Nadjibulla told CBC News.""I believe that an end to her extradition case, by one means or another, would open up the path to Michael's liberation as well.""It's been two years since Meng stepped off a Cathay Pacific flight from Hong Kong onto a jetway, where she was intercepted by Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) officers and her phones were bagged as RCMP officers watched unobserved from a short distance away.Police had obtained a provisional warrant for Meng's arrest the day before at the request of the U.S. Department of Justice.The 48-year-old is charged with lying to an HSBC banker in Hong Kong in August 2013 about Huawei's control of a subsidiary that is accused of violating U.S. economic sanctions against Iran.Prosecutors claim that by relying on Meng's alleged lies to continue a financial relationship with Huawei, HSBC was placed at risk of loss and prosecution.Meng has denied the accusations against her.""Ms. Meng is staying patient and positive,"" said Alykhan Velshi, vice-president of corporate affairs at Huawei Canada. ""It can be trying at times because she knows the charges against her are false. She believes that she's a pawn in a global game of chess.""But right from the start, she's always expressed faith in Canada's system of justice.""Meng is the daughter of Huawei's billionaire founder, Ren Zhengfei.Her arrest came as the United States was beginning a campaign to exclude Huawei from being part of the country's next generation of wireless technology — known as 5G. The U.S., one of five countries belonging to the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing network, has labelled the telecommunications giant a security threat and called on its allies to follow suit.Other members of the Five Eyes network — the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand — have all blocked the use of Huawei's technology, while Canada has still not decided if Huawei can be part of its 5G grid.Yves Tiberghien, a political science professor at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, said Meng's arrest has highlighted questions over the future of wireless technology, as well as the trade battle between the U.S. and China, which has its roots in concerns over intellectual property theft.But he said the case also speaks to the Americans' use of sanctions law and its financial system to pressure rivals, as well as China's hard-line tactics and lack of respect for human rights — as seen in the country's targeting of Canadian exports and the imprisonment of Kovrig and Spavor.""This is at the intersection of all those fault lines,"" Tiberghien said.""For Canadians, the No. 1 story is the two Michaels, and so there is a lot of frustration in Canada, and the plight of the two Michaels is a prism to understand a much more aggressive China.""The case also promises to test Canada's extradition law as Meng's legal team painstakingly exposes every element of the case to scrutiny — beginning with the moments that immediately followed her first steps on Canadian soil.CBSA officers questioned Meng for almost three hours before they handed her over to the RCMP. Her lawyers claim the two agencies conspired with the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation to have customs officers question her without a lawyer, in violation of her rights.The officers who were involved in the arrest have been on the witness stand in recent weeks, giving testimony that the defence is hoping can be used to bolster an argument to have the case tossed out next spring for alleged abuse of process.RCMP officers have testified that they deferred to CBSA jurisdiction as ""gatekeepers"" to Canada, and the border officers claimed that legitimate concerns about Meng as a potential national security threat warranted the beginning of an admissibility exam.But working against the Crown, a CBSA officer gave the RCMP a piece of paper on which he wrote the passcodes to her phones, allegedly by mistake. And an RCMP staff sergeant whom the defence accuses of sending the serial numbers belonging to Meng's electronic devices to the FBI is refusing to testify.All have denied any wrongdoing or collusion. Their testimony, originally scheduled to last two weeks, has expanded to at least four, likely pushing other dates in the extradition proceedings further into 2021.It's hard to know whether the evidence points to conspiracy, business as usual or a sloppiness that fits somewhere in the middle.Associate Chief Justice Heather Holmes has remarked on the huge amount of detail that has emerged from the testimony so far, asking the defence and the Crown to ready submissions on what it all means as she prepares to wade through it.The defence also plans to argue that U.S. President Donald Trump is using Meng as a bargaining chip in trade with China and that the United States deliberately misled Canada into the extradition proceedings by omitting key facts that undermined the strength of the case.Gary Botting, a Vancouver-based legal expert and author on extradition law, said he doesn't expect those arguments will ultimately be substantive enough to derail the proceedings. He agrees with high-profile supporters of the two Michaels — such as former Liberal justice minister Allan Rock and former Supreme Court of Canada justice Louise Arbour — who say there is nothing stopping Justice Minister David Lametti from intervening to end the case.The Liberal government has repeatedly stated that the rule of law has to play out in court before Lametti can weigh in, but over the summer, Rock, Arbour and others sought a legal opinion from Toronto lawyer Brian Greenspan, who said Lametti has the ability to act at any time.Botting said he thinks he should. The facts of the case are weak, he said, and he's troubled by Canada being pulled into a request involving a Chinese national, a British bank and a lie that allegedly happened in Hong Kong.""I think it's significant in the sense that it's very clear that the minister of justice has complete control over who is sent over to a foreign country upon a request for extradition,"" Botting said.""He can say no at any point.""Prime Minister Justin Trudeau recently congratulated U.S. president-elect Joe Biden on his victory in last month's election. He also brought up the issue of the two Michaels, but there's no indication of what a new U.S. administration might mean for the proceedings.Nadjibulla said she'll continue to attend Meng's court proceedings, which began last fall, if she can. And wait.""Given the complexities of this extradition request and absent an intervention by the U.S. or Canadian authorities, the legal process is likely to take years,"" she said.Meng has been living under a form of house arrest since her release on $10 million bail, a little more than a week after she was arrested.She is required to wear a GPS monitoring bracelet on her ankle and is trailed by around-the-clock security, whom she pays to ensure she doesn't travel beyond court-ordered boundaries that stop short of the ferry terminals and airport.It's a far cry from the conditions Kovrig and Spavor have endured since they were first detained in China. Kovrig has spent months in solitary confinement. The COVID-19 pandemic also meant both men were cut off from consular visits last January.They were only recently allowed two virtual visits with the Canadian ambassador.China has provided no evidence of the claims against them. They've also been given no idea of when they might face a trial.Unlike Meng, though, the outcome — if it comes to that — is in little doubt.Experts say China has a 99.9 per cent conviction rate."
"Champagne warns tough talk on China could hurt efforts to free Kovrig, Spavor | CBC News",Foreign Affairs Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne is warning that tough talk about China could hurt efforts to gain the release of two arbitrarily detained Canadians.,2020-11-24T13:40:45.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/champagne-china-committee-1.5813826,"Foreign Affairs Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne warned Monday that tough talk about China could hurt efforts to gain the release of two arbitrarily detained Canadians.Testifying before the House of Commons Canada-China relations committee, Champagne urged MPs to keep the fate of Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig in mind when they spout off about the perils and perfidy of China's Communist regime.""I know, Mr. Chair, that some like to talk tough on China,"" Champagne told the committee.""To those who are seduced by this one-dimensional view, I say this: while it is easy to be tough, let's continue to be smart. Let's not fall into the temptation of tough and irresponsible rhetoric that will generate no tangible result for Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, our farmers and entrepreneurs, and human rights victims and advocates.""The two Michaels, as they've come to be known, have been imprisoned in China for almost two years in retaliation for Canada's arrest of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou on an extradition request from the United States.Canadian farmers, fishers and exporters have also been hurt by retaliatory measures taken by China in the wake of Meng's arrest.Champagne's plea came a week after the House of Commons passed a Conservative motion calling on the government to decide by Dec. 18 whether to allow Huawei to be involved in development of Canada's next generation 5G wireless network.The motion, passed with the support of all opposition parties over the objections of the government, also called on the government to unveil within 30 days a robust plan to deal with growing intimidation by China of Canadians within Canada's borders.The motion is not binding and Champagne told the committee that government action on both fronts will be guided by national security requirements, not by arbitrary deadlines.Since taking over the helm of the Conservatives last August, Erin O'Toole has made standing up to China a central pillar of his pitch to Canadian voters.The Conservative leader has accused Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's Liberal government of being ""willing to look past the Chinese government's numerous human rights abuses, flagrant trade abuses and security issues because the potential to sell into the massive Chinese market was so lucrative.""""Trudeau's approach to China has failed, and it's weakened our standing in the world. We must stand up for our citizens who have been detained as bargaining chips in an extradition case, even if it leads to more reprisals from Beijing,"" O'Toole argued in an op-ed in the National Post in September.O'Toole has called for an ""eyes wide open"" approach to relations with China. But Champagne contended that's precisely the approach his government is taking.He argued that Canada's policy toward China has evolved as China itself has evolved, increasingly flouting the international rules-based order, violating the human rights of Uighurs in Xinjiang province and democracy protesters in Hong Kong, and engaging in ""coercive diplomacy"" to get its way.""The China of 2020 is not the China of 2015 or even the China of 2018,"" Champagne said.""We see a country and a leadership increasingly prepared to throw its weight around to advance its interests.""Champagne said the government has adopted a new framework for dealing with China. He described it as a three-pronged approach in which there will be areas, such as human rights abuses, where Canada needs to challenge China.In other areas, such as trade matters, he said Canada needs to compete with China, and still other areas where Canada needs to co-operate with China, such as the fight against climate change.China's more aggressive posture is not just a challenge for Canada, he argued. Countries around the world are grappling with it.Champagne said the best antidote is for all liberal democracies to band together to speak with one voice to pressure China to change its ways — just as Canada has rallied other countries to speak out against the detention of Kovrig and Spavor."
China blasts off on mission to collect moon rocks | CBC News,China launched an ambitious mission on Tuesday to bring back rocks and debris from the moon's surface for the first time in more than 40 years — an undertaking that could boost human understanding of the moon and of the solar system more generally.,2020-11-24T12:44:10.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/china-moon-mission-1.5813803,"China launched an ambitious mission on Tuesday to bring back rocks and debris from the moon's surface for the first time in more than 40 years — an undertaking that could boost human understanding of the moon and of the solar system more generally.Chang'e 5 — named for the Chinese moon goddess — is the country's boldest lunar mission yet. If successful, it would be a major advance for China's space program, and some experts say it could pave the way for bringing samples back from Mars or even a crewed lunar mission.The four modules of the Chang'e 5 spacecraft blasted off at just after 4:30 a.m. Tuesday (3:30 p.m. ET Monday) atop a massive Long March-5Y rocket from the Wenchang launch centre along the coast of the southern island province of Hainan.Minutes after liftoff, the spacecraft separated from the rocket's first and second stages and slipped into Earth-moon transfer orbit. About an hour later, Chang'e 5 opened its solar panels to provide its independent power source.Spacecraft typically take three days to reach the moon.The launch was carried live by national broadcaster CCTV which then switched to computer animation to show its progress into outer space.The mission's key task is to drill 2 metres beneath the moon's surface and scoop up about 2 kilograms of rocks and other debris to be brought back to Earth, according to NASA. That would offer the first opportunity for scientists to study newly obtained lunar material since the American and Russian missions of the 1960s and 1970s.With Chang’e 5, China has launched an effort to join the U.S. &amp; the former Soviet Union in obtaining lunar samples. We hope China shares its data with the global scientific community to enhance our understanding of the Moon like our Apollo missions did &amp; the Artemis program will. <a href=""https://t.co/mPjG4FE0qQ"">pic.twitter.com/mPjG4FE0qQ</a>The Chang'e 5 lander's time on the moon is scheduled to be short and sweet. It can only stay one lunar daytime, or about 14 Earth days, because it lacks the radioisotope heating units to withstand the moon's freezing nights.The lander will dig for materials with its drill and robotic arm and transfer them to what's called an ascender, which will lift off from the moon and dock with the service capsule. The materials will then be moved to the return capsule to be hauled back to Earth.The technical complexity of Chang'e 5, with its four components, makes it ""remarkable in many ways,"" said Joan Johnson-Freese, a space expert at the U.S. Naval War College.""China is showing itself capable of developing and successfully carrying out sustained high-tech programs, important for regional influence and potentially global partnerships,"" she said.In particular, the ability to collect samples from space is growing in value, said Jonathan McDowell, an astronomer at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. Other countries planning to retrieve material from asteroids or even Mars may look to China's experience, he said.While the mission is ""indeed challenging,"" McDowell said China has already landed twice on the moon with its Chang'e 3 and Chang'e 4 missions, and showed with a 2014 Chang'e 5 test mission that it can navigate back to Earth, re-enter and land a capsule. All that's left is to show it can collect samples and take off again from the moon.""As a result of this, I'm pretty optimistic that China can pull this off,"" he said.The mission is among China's boldest since it first put a man in space in 2003, becoming only the third nation to do so after the U.S. and Russia.Oh! Cheeky shot of the return capsule <a href=""https://t.co/pymZvYTltG"">pic.twitter.com/pymZvYTltG</a>Chang'e 5 and future lunar missions aim to ""provide better technical support for future scientific and exploration activities,"" Pei Zhaoyu, mission spokesperson and deputy director of the Chinese National Space Administration's Lunar Exploration and Space Engineering Center told reporters at a Monday briefing.""Scientific needs and technical and economic conditions"" would determine whether China decides to send a crewed mission to the moon, said Pei, whose comments were embargoed until after the launch. ""I think future exploration activities on the moon are most likely to be carried out in a human-machine combination.""While many of China's crewed spaceflight achievements, including building an experimental space station and conducting a spacewalk, reproduce those of other countries from years past, the CNSA is now moving into new territory.Chang'e 4 — which made the first soft landing on the moon's relatively unexplored far side almost two years ago — is currently collecting full measurements of radiation exposure from the lunar surface, information vital for any country that plans to send astronauts to the moon.China in July became one of three countries to have launched a mission to Mars, in China's case an orbiter and a rover that will search for signs of water on the Red Planet. The CNSA says the spacecraft Tianwen 1 is on course to arrive at Mars around February.China has increasingly engaged with foreign countries on missions, and the European Space Agency will be providing important ground station information for Chang'e 5.U.S. law, however, still prevents most collaborations with NASA, excluding China from partnering with the International Space Station. That has prompted China to start work on its own space station and launch its own programs that have put it in a steady competition with Japan and India, among Asian nations seeking to notch new achievements in space.China's space program has progressed cautiously, with relatively few setbacks in recent years. The rocket being used for the current launch failed on a previous launch attempt, but has since performed without a glitch, including launching Chang'e 4.""China works very incrementally, developing building blocks for long-term use for a variety of missions,"" Freese-Johnson said. China's one-party authoritarian system also allows for ""prolonged political will that is often difficult in democracies,"" she said.While the U.S. has followed China's successes closely, it's unlikely to expand cooperation with China in space amid political suspicions, a sharpening military rivalry and accusations of Chinese theft of technology, experts say.""A change in U.S. policy regarding space cooperation is unlikely to get much government attention in the near future,"" Johnson-Freese said."

China congratulates Biden on U.S. election win | CBC News,China on Friday became one of the last major countries to congratulate U.S. president-elect Joe Biden.,2020-11-13T15:24:54.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/china-biden-us-election-1.5800598,"China on Friday became one of the last major countries to congratulate U.S. president-elect Joe Biden.China, along with Russia, avoided joining the throng that congratulated Biden last weekend after he and vice-presidential running mate Kamala Harris secured enough electoral college votes to unseat President Donald Trump.""We respect the choice of the American people,"" said a foreign ministry spokesperson, Wang Wenbin. ""We congratulate Mr. Biden and Ms. Harris.""Wang gave no reason for the delay but said, ""the result will be confirmed according to U.S. laws and procedures.""U.S.-Chinese relations have plunged to their lowest level in decades amid a tariff war over Beijing's technology ambitions and trade surplus, accusations of spying, and tension over human rights, the coronavirus pandemic, Hong Kong and control of the South China Sea.Trump labelled China a security threat and imposed export curbs and other sanctions on Chinese companies. On Thursday, he stepped up those sanctions by issuing an order that bars Americans from investing in securities issued by companies U.S. officials say are owned or controlled by the Chinese military.Forecasters had said even if he lost his re-election bid, Trump was likely to try to increase pressure on Beijing before he leaves office on Jan. 20.Political analysts expect Biden to try to resume co-operation with Beijing on climate change, North Korea, Iran and the coronavirus. However, economists and political analysts expect few big changes due to widespread frustration with Beijing's trade and human rights record, as well as accusations of spying and technology theft.""A tough stance on China has broad support across the U.S. political spectrum,"" Louis Kuijs of Oxford Economics said in a report this week. ""Biden's own pronouncements and policy program suggest he will continue to try to maintain the U.S. technological lead and to attract manufacturing activity.""Some forecasters suggest the change from Trump — who rejected multilateral alliances — to Biden might increase pressure on China if Washington forms a coalition with other developed countries to push for policy changes.China has tried to recruit Germany, France, South Korea and other governments as allies against Washington but all have refused. They criticized Trump's trade tactics of surprise tariff hikes, which also were used against allies, but echoed U.S. complaints that China is violating its free-trade commitments.Some Chinese trade experts have suggested Beijing might try to renegotiate the Phase 1 agreement signed in January as a first step toward ending the trade war. It calls for China to increase purchases of U.S. goods in exchange for postponing further tariff hikes. But that came before the coronavirus derailed global trade, leaving China behind on meeting its commitments.Renegotiation might fit a ""more strategic, longer-term orientation"" expected from a Biden administration, but he ""cannot be seen to be 'soft' on China"" after the ""hard rhetoric"" of the campaign, Kuijs said.Chinese leaders were quieter during this year's election than in the 2016 presidential race, when they favoured Trump over former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. They disliked her for carrying out then-President Barack Obama's foreign policy, which included pressuring Beijing on human rights. Trump's public image of business success resonated with the Chinese public.Trump shook up China's leaders by hiking tariffs on Chinese products in 2018 over complaints Beijing steals or pressures companies to hand over technology.The White House has lobbied allies to exclude telecom equipment giant Huawei Technologies Ltd., China's first global tech brand, from next-generation telecom networks on security grounds. Huawei's access to American components and technology was cut off over the past year, threatening to cripple its global sales.Trump is also trying to bar Chinese social media companies from the United States, citing fears they might gather too much personal information about Americans. The White House is pressing video service TikTok to sell its U.S. operation and is trying to block companies from dealing with WeChat, the popular Chinese message service.Trump has not been vocal on the subject of human rights, rarely mentioning the plight of Hong Kong democracy activists or the detained Uighurs in Xinjiang, though members of his administration such as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have taken up that role.Former U.S. national security adviser John Bolton even alleged in his recent book that Trump expressed his support to Chinese President Xi Jinping over the building of camps to detain the Muslim minority Uighurs, though Trump angrily denied that claim.Despite the contentious issues, Trump spoke favourably of his personal relationship with Xi for over three years, dialling back such talk as the coronavirus pandemic, first noticed in China, spread throughout the U.S.All of the G7 nations and the majority of G20 countries have now congratulated the U.S. president-elect. Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, on friendly terms with Trump, has been an exception, though on Friday his vice-president Hamilton Mourao said that Biden's victory in the election was ""becoming more and more irreversible.""Mexico's President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has been cautious, saying he wants to wait until U.S. states certified election results in the coming weeks before congratulating a winner.The Kremlin said on Monday it would wait for the official results of the election before commenting on its outcome, but Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov was at least contemplating a change in administration, telling reporters on Thursday he thought U.S. foreign policy under Biden would be similar to that seen under Obama, especially on Iran and climate change."

Canada-China relations frayed at 50,"“This is something which we shall never forget.” Those were just some of the strong words Canada’s new ambassador to the UN, Bob Rae, shared last week in reference to China’s treatment of Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor.

Bob Rae calls on UN to investigate evidence of genocide against China's Uighur minority | CBC News,Canada’s ambassador to the United Nations says he’s called on the organization’s Human Rights Council to investigate whether China’s persecution of Uighurs in Xinjiang province should be considered an act of genocide.,2020-11-15T18:59:38.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/bob-rae-genocide-investigation-uighur-minority-1.5802920,"Canada's ambassador to the United Nations says he's called on the organization's Human Rights Council to investigate whether China's persecution of Uighurs in Xinjiang province should be considered an act of genocide.""There's no question that there's aspects of what the Chinese are doing that fits into the definition of genocide in the genocide convention,"" Bob Rae told CBC Chief Political Correspondent Rosemary Barton. ""But that then requires you to go through a process of gathering information and of making sure that we've got the evidence that would support that kind of an allegation.""Last month, a House of Commons subcommittee tabled a report concluding that China's treatment of the mostly Muslim minority — including mass detentions in concentration camps, forced labour and population control measures such as forced sterilization — meets the definition of genocide.The Chinese foreign ministry lashed out at the report's findings, calling it ""full of lies and disinformation"" and warned parliamentarians to ""avoid doing any further damage to China-Canada relations.""Arif Virani, the parliamentary secretary to Canada's justice minister and attorney general, has told the Commons that ""it is genocide that appears to be taking place today in China.""Foreign Affairs Minister François-Philippe Champagne previously said he is ""deeply disturbed"" by the committee's report, but did not say whether Ottawa would impose sanctions on Chinese officials responsible for mistreatment of Uighurs living in Xinjiang province.Rae, who previously served as Canada's special envoy to Myanmar, said Canada cannot turn a blind eye to the plight facing China's Uighur population. ""But as I've learned in my work on the Rohingya, there's a big difference between information and evidence. And what we have to do now is see how we can gather evidence in order to carry out further steps, according to the genocide convention,"" he said in an interview on Rosemary Barton Live.China continued its backlash efforts on Monday, with Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian calling Rae's genocide comments ""ignorant."" He went on to suggest Canada's population growth rates better suit the definition of a country committing genocide.""It seems that it is not the Uighurs who are persecuted but rather the people of Canada, am I right? You can see how ridiculous the ambassador's statement is,"" Zhao told a media briefing in Beijing.""A piece of advice for him: do some homework before crafting a publicity stunt, so as not to make a fool of himself.""Canada joined 38 other United Nations member countries last month in calling on China ""to allow immediate, meaningful and unfettered access to Xinjiang for independent observers,"" including the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights and her office.""We are gravely concerned about the human rights situation in Xinjiang,"" read the joint declaration to the UN General Assembly's Third Committee. ""We call on China to respect human rights, particularly the rights of persons belonging to religious and ethnic minorities.""A number of activist groups have already urged the agency's Human Rights Council to probe potential human rights violations and to implement commitments on genocide prevention. As for efforts to secure the release of detained Canadians Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, Rae said it's an issue many are seized with resolving.""It's not simply about doing what we have to do with the UN to draw attention to it. It's also about doing the work in Beijing and in Washington and Ottawa and everywhere else to make sure that we can get these two people released.""Kovrig and Spavor were detained in China in December 2018, days after Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou was arrested in Vancouver at the request of U.S. authorities, who allege she violated U.S. sanctions on doing business with Iran.During a meeting of the UN General Assembly last month, Rae had harsh words for his Chinese counterpart over comments that Canada was bullying China.""When you say to a country of 35 million people that we are somehow bullying a nation of over a billion — one of the great superpowers of the world — and they have chosen to treat these two Canadian citizens in this way, this is something which we shall never forget,"" Rae said.""If you think that insulting us or insulting my country or insulting anyone is going to help in resolving this situation, you are sadly mistaken,"" he added.Reflecting on that meeting, Rae told Barton that he was attempting to make a case to other General Assembly members that the ""practice of arbitrary detention...is frankly disgraceful.""Rae succeeded Marc-André Blanchard as Canada's Permanent Representative to the UN in New York in August, assuming the role during the final months of the U.S presidential election.In an interview on Rosemary Barton Live last week, Foreign Affairs Minister François-Philippe Champagne said he hoped to work with president-elect Joe Biden and other leaders to ""rebuild"" relationships with multilateral organizations like the UN and the World Health Organization.""I think there's going to be more engagement on the multilateral front...for example, on the environment,"" Rae said, citing Biden's promise to rejoin the Paris Agreement.Rae said he also expects to see improved engagement on other issues, including tackling the COVID-19 pandemic and renewed support for the WHO.""I think on a whole range of those fronts, things will be better. There's still lots of disruptive forces...but having one less is a good thing."""

The acid test: Western diplomats ponder the problem of dealing with a more aggressive China | CBC News,"International affairs experts are fond of saying that China's weakness as a superpower is that it lacks friends. But for China's geopolitical foes and rivals, alliances are only as strong as the political will behind them.",2020-11-21T09:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/china-pompeo-coons-halifax-forum-1.5811099,"It was an ominous beginning to an ominous conversation about how western democracies should face the growing authoritarian reflexes of China on the world stage.One of the marquee panels at the Halifax International Security Forum, held virtually this year, began on Friday with a grainy, grey video of an elephant being chased and eventually overpowered by a pride of lions.It was a stark visual metaphor for Beijing's relative isolation as a world power — the fact that China is a powerful nation with few allies, while western democracies are overwhelming when they act in concert.There was, however, a palpable sense of dismay among some of the panellists when the conversation turned to whether the international community is a pride of lions or a collection of kittens.Emily Lau, a former democratic legislator in Hong Kong, delivered a sobering warning that China's expanded political and security crackdown in the former British-administered territory is an acid test of western strength and resolve.""We are sort of disappearing before the world's eyes,"" Lau said via video conference from Hong Kong. ""What is disappearing? Our freedom. Our personal safety. The rule of law.""Appealing to Beijing for fairness and respect ""doesn't get us anywhere,"" she added.A year ago at the same forum, Lau accepted the John McCain Prize for Leadership in Public Service. She and democratic activist Figo Chan represented the people of Hong Kong in accepting the award after months of street protests and violence that drew global attention.Lau said she hopes like-minded countries, with core values of freedom and democracy, can work together to ""convince China to be reasonable.""Under an international agreement signed with Britain in the late 1990s, Beijing guaranteed Hong Kong's system of government, including its political and economic freedom, for half a century. The recent introduction of new security legislation and an ongoing political crackdown violate the spirit, if not the letter, of that agreement, said Lau.""The way China treats Hong Kong will be very indicative to the whole world of how China will behave,"" she said. ""If China cannot keep the promise, then how can China act as a responsible, respectable member of the international community?""There has been a lot of international attention focused on Hong Kong during the past year, but Lau said things have only gotten worse over that time — with the rooting out of opposition members in the city's legislature, the imposition of the national security law and the postponement of elections.U.S. Democratic Senator Chris Coons — whose name is being mentioned a lot as Washington insiders handicap various candidates for the secretary of state post in the incoming administration of president-elect Joe Biden — said one of the first priorities for the new government will be to reinvigorate alliances.It may take a lot more than that, though.Liam Fox, Britain's former defence secretary, said western democracies are suffering through a crisis of confidence — doubts which have allowed authoritarian regimes to rise and fill the space in the developing world.""If we don't believe what we stand for is better, if we don't believe in the rule of law, democracy, freedom, why should anyone else listen to us?"" Fox said. ""I believe we have to reassert a belief in our core values.""With tangled supply chains that wrap around the globe, the business of standing up to China is not solely a political responsibility, said the Trump administration's top diplomat.""Governments need to do their part,"" said U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in recorded remarks. He noted that countries which have stood up to China have paid a price for it.He acknowledged that Canada had ""done a good job"" but went on to say the corporate sector, which makes an enormous amount of money in China, ""has a moral responsibility to think through the activities their companies are engaged in, and whether that is in their own host country's best national security interest.""Pompeo made no reference to Canada's detention of Meng Wanzhou, the Chinese telecom executive, nor to the imprisonment of Canadians Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor."

China's economy accelerates as virus recovery gains strength | CBC News,China's shaky economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic is gaining strength as consumers return to shopping malls and auto dealerships while the United States and Europe endure painful contractions.,2020-10-19T10:24:23.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/china-economy-1.5767499,"China's shaky economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic is gaining strength as consumers return to shopping malls and auto dealerships while the United States and Europe endure painful contractions.Growth in the world's second-largest economy accelerated to 4.9 per cent over a year earlier in the three months ending in September, up from the previous quarter's 3.2 per cent, official data showed Monday. Retail spending rebounded to above pre-virus levels for the first time and factory output rose, boosted by demand for exports of masks and other medical supplies.China is the only major economy that is expected to grow this year while activity in the United States, Europe and Japan shrinks.The recovery is ""broadening out and becoming less reliant"" on government stimulus, Julian Evans-Pritchard of Capital Economics said in a report. He said growth is ""still accelerating"" heading into the present quarter.Most Asian stock markets rose on the news of increased activity in China, the biggest trading partner for all of its neighbours. Japan's Nikkei 225 index added 1.1 per cent while Hong Kong's Hang Seng climbed 0.9 per cent. Markets in South Korea and Australia also rose.China's benchmark Shanghai Composite Index lost 0.7 per cent on expectations the relatively strong data will reduce the likelihood of additional stimulus that might boost share prices.China, where the pandemic began in December, became the first major economy to return to growth after the ruling Communist Party declared the disease under control in March and began reopening factories, shops and offices.The economy contracted by 6.8 per cent in the first quarter, its worst performance since at least the mid-1960s, before rebounding.The economy ""continued the steady recovery,"" the National Bureau of Statistics said in a report. However, it warned, ""the international environment is still complicated and severe."" It said China faces great pressure to prevent a resurgence of the virus.Authorities have lifted curbs on travel and business but visitors to government and other public buildings still are checked for the virus's telltale fever. Travellers arriving from abroad must be quarantined for two weeks.Last week, more than 10 million people were tested for the virus in the eastern port of Qingdao after 12 cases were found there. That broke a two-month streak with no virus transmissions reported within China.Industrial production rose 5.8 per cent over the same quarter last year, a marked improvement over the first half's 1.3 per cent contraction. Chinese exporters are taking market share from foreign competitors that still are hampered by anti-virus controls.Retail sales rose 0.9 per cent over a year earlier. That was up from a 7.2 per cent contraction in the first half as consumers, already anxious about a slowing economy and a tariff war with Washington, put off buying. Online commerce rose 15.3 per cent.In a sign demand is accelerating, sales in September rose 3.3 per cent.""China's recovery in private consumption is gathering momentum,"" said Stephen Innes of AxiCorp in a report.Economists say China is likely to recover faster than other major economies due to the ruling party's decision to impose the most intensive anti-disease measures in history. Those temporarily cut off most access to cities with a total of 60 million people.The International Monetary Fund is forecasting China's economic growth at 1.8 per cent this year while the U.S. economy is expected to shrink by 4.3 per cent. The IMF expects a 9.8 per cent contraction in France, 6 per cent in Germany and 5.3 per cent in Japan.Private sector analysts say as much as 30 per cent of China's urban workforce, or up to 130 million people, may have lost their jobs at least temporarily. They say as many as 25 million jobs might be lost for good this year."

Kam Han Szechuan House — 2318 Spiller Rd.

The ruling Communist Party has lifted most curbs on travel and business but still monitors travellers and visitors to public buildings for signs of infection.Authorities were investigating the source of the infections in eight patients at Qingdao's Municipal Chest Hospital and one family member, the National Health Commission said.""The whole city will be tested within five days,"" it said on its social media account.China, where the pandemic emerged in December, has reported 4,634 deaths and 85,578 cases, plus nine suspected cases that have yet to be confirmed.The last reported virus transmissions within China were four patients found on Aug. 15 in the northwestern city of Urumqi in the Xinjiang region. All the cases reported since then were in travellers from outside the mainland.The ruling party lifted measures in April that cut off most access to cities with a total of some 60 million people including Wuhan in central China.Qingdao is a busy port with the headquarters of companies including Haier, a major appliance maker, and the Tsingtao brewery. The government gave no indication whether the latest cases had contacts with travel or trade.Travellers arriving from abroad in China still are required to undergo a 14-day quarantine."

The lower dose was enough to produce a good immune response in younger people, but the response was much weaker in those over 60, they said.The manufacturing problem was first reported by Stat, a website that focuses on health and medical news.GSK and Sanofi said their research to date makes them confident the vaccine will ultimately be successful.In adults 18 to 49, the vaccine produced an immune response comparable to patients who had recovered from COVID-19, the companies said, citing results from the early stage trials.In addition, GSK and Sanofi have now tested a reformulated version of the vaccine on non-human primates.

"China angered by U.S. arms sales to Taiwan, threatens sanctions | CBC News","China threatened on Thursday to retaliate against the latest U.S. arms sale to Taiwan, as the island welcomed the weapons package but said it was not looking to get into an arms race with Beijing.",2020-10-22T12:27:25.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/china-response-us-arms-taiwan-1.5772252,"China threatened on Thursday to retaliate against the latest U.S. arms sale to Chinese-claimed Taiwan, as the island welcomed the weapons package but said it was not looking to get into an arms race with Beijing.The Trump administration has ramped up support for Taiwan through arms sales and visits by senior U.S officials, adding to tensions between Beijing and Washington, already heightened by disagreements over the South China Sea, Hong Kong, human rights and trade.Beijing has applied increasing pressure on democratically ruled Taiwan to accept China's sovereignty, including by flying fighter jets across the sensitive mid-line of the Taiwan Strait, which normally serves as an unofficial buffer.Beijing considers Taiwan a wayward province it has vowed to reunite with the mainland, by force if necessary. Washington considers it an important democratic outpost and is required by law to provide it with the means to defend itself.Responding to the U.S. approval of a potential $1.8 billion US arms sale to Taiwan, China's Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said during a daily news briefing that such sales should stop.The sales ""seriously interfere with China's internal affairs, seriously damage China's sovereignty and security interests, send a seriously wrong signal to Taiwan independence forces and severely damage China-U.S. relations and peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait,"" he said.""China will make a legitimate and necessary response according to how the situation develops,"" Zhao added.He did not give details, but China has sanctioned U.S. companies in the past for selling weapons to Taiwan, though it is unclear what form they have taken.In Taipei, Taiwan Defence Minister Yen De-fa thanked the United States and said the weapons were to help Taiwan improve their defensive capabilities to deal with the ""enemy threat and new situation.""""This includes a credible combat capability and asymmetric warfare capabilities to strengthen our determination to defend ourselves,"" he added.""This shows the importance attached by the United States to security in the Indo-Pacific and Taiwan Strait. We will continue to consolidate our security partnership with the United States.""Yen said they were not looking for confrontation.""We will not engage in an arms race with the Chinese Communists. We will put forward requirements and build fully in accordance with the strategic concept of heavy deterrence, defending our position and defensive needs.""Taiwan's armed forces are dwarfed by China's, which are expanding their capability with new weapons like aircraft carriers and stealth fighters.Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen has made defence modernization a priority in the face of a rising Chinese threat, particularly ""asymmetric warfare"" capabilities, which refers to making any Chinese attack difficult and costly, for example with smart mines and portable missiles.Like most countries, Washington has no formal diplomatic ties with Taipei, though it is its strongest global backer. The U.S. has been pushing Taiwan to modernize its military so it can become a ""porcupine"" — that is, hard for China to attack.Among other weapons systems, Wednesday's formal notifications to Congress by the State Department were for 11 truck-based rocket launchers made by Lockheed Martin called a High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS), for an estimated cost of $436.1 million.The notifications also covered 135 AGM-84H Standoff Land Attack Missile Expanded Response (SLAM-ER) Missiles and related equipment made by Boeing for an estimated $1.008 billion, and six MS-110 Recce external sensor pods made by Collins Aerospace for jets, at an estimated cost of $367.2 million.Further congressional notifications are expected to follow, including drones made by General Atomics and land-based Harpoon anti-ship missiles made by Boeing to serve as coastal defence cruise missiles.The U.S. administration has stepped up pressure on Beijing in the run-up to the Nov. 3 U.S. presidential election, in which President Donald Trump has made a tough approach to China a key foreign policy theme.Last week, the U.S. national security adviser, Robert O'Brien, said that while China probably was not ready to invade Taiwan for now, the island needed to ""fortify itself"" against a future attack or any bid to isolate it through non-military means, such as an embargo.Taiwan has been testing new surface-to-surface missiles, which its media says have the ability to strike deep inside China, potentially giving the island the ability to attack far-off Chinese air bases and command centres."

China lodges complaint with Canada over Trudeau's 'coercive diplomacy' remarks | CBC News,China said on Wednesday it has lodged solemn representations with Canada on media reports that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had criticized China over its measures in Hong Kong and Xinjiang.,2020-10-14T12:14:34.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/china-trudeau-50-anniversary-1.5761470,"China said Wednesday it has lodged solemn representations with Canada in response to media reports of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau criticizing China over its measures in Hong Kong and Xinjiang.During a news conference on Tuesday, Trudeau attacked Beijing's human rights record while marking the 50th anniversary of Canada's diplomatic ties with China.""We will continue to work with China for advancing Canadian interests and Canadian producers. At the same time, we will remain absolutely committed to working with our allies to ensure that China's approach of coercive diplomacy, its arbitrary detention of two Canadian citizens, alongside other citizens of other countries around the world, is not viewed as a successful tactic by them,"" he said.""It has put a significant strain on Canada-China relations and we will continue to highlight our concern for the Canadians detained, our concern for the protection of human rights in places like Hong Kong, in Xinjiang province with the Uighurs.""Zhao Lijian, a spokesperson for the Chinese foreign ministry, said the Canadian government had shown hypocrisy and weakness.Canada is continuing to press China to release Canadians Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor. Both men were detained in China in December 2018 following Canada's arrest of Meng Wanzhou, a senior executive with the Chinese telecom giant Huawei. Meng is also the daughter of the company's founder.Canadian police detained Meng in Vancouver on a U.S. extradition request nine days before Kovrig and Spavor were arrested. The U.S. is seeking Meng's extradition on fraud charges and her extradition case is before the Canadian courts. Her arrest severely damaged relations between China and Canada.One month after Kovrig and Spavor were arrested, China sentenced Canadian Robert Lloyd Schellenberg to death in a sudden retrial. Schellenberg already had been sentenced to a 15-year jail term for drug smuggling.All three moves were widely seen as punishment for Canada's arrest of Meng Wanzhou.Today, Canadian Ambassador to China Dominic Barton was granted virtual consular access to Schellenberg; because of the provisions in the Privacy Act, the government disclosed no further information.Podcast - Sanctioned: The Arrest of a Telecom GiantSchellenberg was first detained on Dec. 2, 2014. Canadian officials were granted regular consular access to him until January 22, 2020.""I continue to call for the immediate release of Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, and for clemency for Robert Schellenberg, as we do for all Canadians facing the death penalty,"" said Foreign Affairs Minister François-Philippe Champagne in a statement."

Beijing erupts at Canada after parliamentary committee says China's Uighur policy amounts to 'genocide' | CBC News,China’s foreign ministry is lashing out at Canada after a House of Commons subcommittee concluded that the state's mistreatment of Uighurs living in Xinjiang province is tantamount to genocide.,2020-10-22T18:10:41.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/parliamentary-committee-uighur-genocide-1.5772757,"China's foreign ministry is lashing out at Canada after a House of Commons subcommittee concluded that the state's mistreatment of Uighurs living in Xinjiang province amounts to a policy of genocide.The committee's report, tabled Wednesday, says that China's persecution of this Muslim minority — through mass detentions in concentration camps, forced labour, state surveillance and population control measures — is a clear violation of human rights and is meant to ""eradicate Uighur culture and religion.""The committee said that it agrees with the experts who say China's campaign against the Uighurs meets the definition of genocide set out in the 1948 Genocide Convention.Zhao Lijian, a spokesperson for the Chinese foreign ministry, said today that this ""so-called genocide"" is ""a rumour and a farce fabricated by some anti-Chinese forces to slander China.""""Its groundless statement is full of lies and disinformation,"" he said of the committee's report, warning parliamentarians to ""avoid doing any further damage to China-Canada relations.""This is blatant interference in China's internal affairs and reflects those Canadian individuals' ignorance and prejudice. China firmly deplores and rejects that.""The subcommittee on international human rights, chaired by Liberal MP Peter Fonseca, heard from witnesses who survived the concentration camps China has built to suppress Muslims living in this oil-rich northwestern province.Committee witnesses described ""deplorable"" conditions where they were psychologically, physically and sexually abused and subjected to forced assimilation and indoctrination into the dominant Chinese culture.Asked about the camps, Zhao insisted they are ""vocational training and education centres"" where religious ""extremists"" were educated in the ""national common spoken and written language, legal knowledge, vocational skills and de-radicalization.""""The aim is to eliminate the root cause of terrorism and extremism,"" he said.The Commons committee also concluded that Chinese communist officials have forcibly sterilized Uighur women and girls and pushed abortions and intrauterine contraceptive devices (IUDs) on hundreds of thousands in a systematic attempt ""to persecute and possibly eradicate Uighurs.""Uighurs make up less than one per cent of the population in a country where Mandarin-speaking ethnic Chinese people — the Han — constitute the overwhelming majority.While the Turkic-speaking Uighurs are just a small ethnic subset, Chinese government documents obtained by the committee show that approximately 80 per cent of all new IUD placements in China took place in Xinjiang.Birth rates continue to plummet across the region, falling nearly 24 per cent last year alone — compared to a drop of just 4.2 per cent nationwide — according to statistics compiled by researcher Adrian Zenz in a report published by the U.S.-based Jamestown Foundation. The population control measures are backed by mass detention, both as a threat and as a punishment for failure to comply.  Witnesses also told committee members about a ""poverty reduction"" measure implemented by Beijing that forced Uighurs into camps to perform slave labour, making products that were to be sold in Canada and other western nations. A recent report titled ""Uighurs for sale"" by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute found that thousands of Muslims have been used as forced labour in factories that supply companies like BMW, Nike and Huawei, among others.The Chinese government has facilitated the mass transfer of Uighur and other ethnic minority citizens from Xinjiang to factories across the country.Under constant state surveillance through closed-circuit television cameras and mobile tracking devices, Uighur survivors have said they lived in constant fear.They told committee members that Uighur expatriates are subjected to harassment and intimidation by the Chinese regime — even in Canada.""The subcommittee unequivocally condemns the persecution of Uighur and other Turkic Muslims in Xinjiang by the government of China,"" the committee's report reads. ""The subcommittee is persuaded that the actions of the Chinese Communist Party constitute genocide.""The committee said these control tactics are designed to suppress the Uighurs because they ""desire more autonomy or independence from China,"" and the communists consider them a ""threat"" to economic development and prosperity.The committee is recommending the federal government condemn China's abuse of Uighurs, work with allies to secure unfettered access to Xinjiang for international observers to prevent further abuse, recognize that China's actions constitute genocide and impose sanctions on implicated officials through Canada's so-called Magnitsky law.That law allows the government to impose sanctions and freeze assets owned by foreign nationals and prohibit financial transactions by known human rights abusers.The law is informally named after Russian tax adviser Sergei Magnitsky, who was tortured and died in a Moscow prison after documenting fraud in Russia.""Canada needs to take immediate action and live up to the values it espouses at home and abroad,"" says the report. ""Canada must act now to address China's aggression against Uighurs and other Turkic Muslims.""In a statement, Foreign Affairs Minister François-Philippe Champagne said he is ""deeply disturbed"" by the troubling reports documented by the subcommittee.He said he raised the issue of Uighur abuse with Michelle Bachelet, the UN commissioner for human rights, during a recent meeting in Switzerland.Earlier this month, Canada and 37 allies also expressed ""grave concerns"" about the situation in Xinjiang at the UN, he said.Champagne said the government would back a plan to send impartial advisers into the region to document the plight of the Uighurs.""Canada takes the allegations of genocide very seriously. We will continue ... with our allies to push for these to be investigated through an international independent body,"" he said.Champagne did not address a question about whether Canada would pursue Magnitsky sanctions like those slapped on Russian and Venezuelan officials in recent years.This parliamentary report is the latest attempt by some MPs and senators to put pressure on the government to take a tougher stand against China.In June, more than a dozen senators — including several appointed by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau — urged the federal government to impose sanctions on Chinese officials for ""gross violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms.""Citing China's detention of Uighur Muslims, its crackdown on democratic rights in Hong Kong, its decades-long repression of Tibet and its imprisonment of Canadians Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig, the senators described the regime in Beijing as the ""biggest threat to mankind and a danger to international security.""That letter was followed by a call from 68 MPs and senators for Canada to levy sanctions on top Chinese officials."

He said Kovrig and Spavor were ""suspected of engaging in activities that endanger China's national security.""Despite its disavowals of any connection, Beijing has repeatedly tied the detentions to the arrest of Meng Wanzhou, Huawei's chief financial officer and the daughter of the company's founder. The U.S. is seeking her extradition on fraud charges and the case is before Canadian courts.""What Canada did in the case of Meng Wanzhou was arbitrary detention,"" Zhao said.Bilateral ties have suffered as China has upped its demands that Canada release Meng, who was detained during a stopover in Vancouver in December 2018 and is currently living in one of her mansions in that city while fighting extradition. Kovrig and Spavor were detained days later."

"For these families, returning to China from N.S. comes at 'insane' cost | CBC News",Two Nova Scotian families are upset by how much Nova Scotia wants to charge them to administer and process a COVID-19 test in order for their mothers to return to China. Both families are baffled by the fact neighbouring New Brunswick is doing the same job for a fraction of the cost.,2020-10-14T09:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/covid-19-test-fee-china-1.5760578,"Cora Huang was happy to have her mother, Qin Chen, arrive in Nova Scotia from China last December to help prepare for the birth of her son.Now, 10 months into what was supposed to be a three-month visit, Huang's mother is ready to go home — but not before paying an ""insane"" fee to take a COVID-19 test.Chinese authorities require a negative test result before she can return home. In Nova Scotia, non-Canadians are charged more than $1,000 to be tested.""Which is insane for us, for our family,"" Huang told CBC news in a recent interview.Huang, a permanent resident, is on leave from her job and only receiving employment insurance benefits.""And my husband is still looking for a job due to all the stuff happening right now,"" said Huang. ""And that's a major financial burden for our family.""We don't have that much income right now. And all we have now is savings.""Julie Chen is in a similar situation with her mother, who is also visiting from China. Her mother arrived in September 2019 and planned to go home last March.The family has been trying to arrange a flight home now that COVID-19 infections are better under control in China, but they are also astounded at the cost of the test.""The flight ticket is very expensive from Halifax to China,"" said Julie Chen. ""It's around, like, $2,000 and a quarantine in China for 14 days, around $2,000 as well.""And then the testing fee [of] $1,000 is a huge amount for me.""Like Huang, she cannot understand why Nova Scotia is charging almost triple what neighbouring New Brunswick is charging non-Canadians for asymptomatic testing.Non-Canadian residents pay $360 for a COVID-19 test in New Brunswick, compared to $1,017.50 in Nova Scotia.Dr. Brendan Carr, CEO of the Nova Scotia Health Authority, said Wednesday he wasn't sure how the fee amount was arrived at. But he said the rationale for charging non-Canadians a much higher amount was that they hadn't contributed to the health infrastructure needed to provide the service.""That makes sense to a point, but why our, you know, why we are specifically at the level that we're at, I don't know that actually that there's a very good reason based upon the actual costs,"" Carr said following his appearance at a legislature committee.He also said the fee was under review and would likely be reduced.""What I can say is that this is something that we're actively looking at and my expectation will be that we will revise that cost in the weeks ahead as we understand better what the actual costs are,"" he said. ""I fully expect that our price is going to probably drift down as we understand the precise costing better, but it's still not going to be inexpensive. It is going to cost money because … it does constitute a demand on the system."" Carr also said that people who are unable to pay the fee because they cannot afford it are able to ask for it to be waived. Huang and Chen said their mothers are both scheduled to fly back to China next month. "

""A direct in-person visit should have already taken place a long time ago with appropriate social distancing.""Kovrig and Spavor have been in prison in China since December 2018 in what is widely seen as retaliation for Canada arresting Chinese high-tech executive Meng Wanzhou on an American extradition warrant.Dominic Barton, Canada's ambassador to China, had internet-based visits with Spavor on Friday and Kovrig on Saturday.It was the first contact Canadian diplomats have had with the two men since in-person visits in mid-January.Kovrig's wife, Vina Nadjibulla, told CBC News that her husband was ""greatly relieved to receive news from the outside world"" after ten months spent in isolation with no consular access.""He was particularly heartened by reassurances regarding the health of everyone in the family and the ongoing efforts to secure his freedom. He was astonished to learn about the details of the COVID-19 pandemic and remarked that it all sounded like some 'zombie apocalypse movie,'"" her statement read.""We are extremely proud that despite his long confinement, Michael's spirit, determination — and even his sense of humour — remain unbroken. This is definitely something we can be grateful for this Thanksgiving weekend. And of course, our focus remains on doing everything possible to bring Michael home. We are deeply grateful for the support and solidarity of all Canadians.""The Chinese government has said it can't allow in-person visits to prisons because of concerns around COVID-19. The federal government has been pushing China since the spring for an alternative form of access in order to check on the welfare of the two men.""There was absolutely no reason that virtual access couldn't have been offered by China even during the height of the pandemic, and no justification for denying in-person visits after China emerged from lockdown during the summer,"" said David Mulroney, a former Canadian ambassador to China.""This is simply more cruel treatment by China, with the expectation that we will be grateful even for even a half-hearted effort on their part. We shouldn't fall into that trap.""Foreign Affairs Minister François-Philippe Champagne pressed for virtual access in his own in-person meeting with his Chinese counterpart, Wang Yi, when the two crossed paths in Rome in August.Up until January, Canadian diplomats had been able to visit the two men approximately once a month.Chong reiterated past Conservative criticism of the government's handling of relations with China, saying its approach has lacked coherence, and that Canada should impose targeted sanctions on the people responsible for the imprisonment of the two men.But Chong said he is seeing signs of the government taking a firmer stand against China recently with tougher rhetoric this past week from Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan and Bob Rae, Canada's ambassador to the United Nations.""I think the Liberal government's finally responding to the pressure that the Conservatives have been putting on them,"" said Chong.Sajjan accused China of engaging in ""hostage diplomacy"" in an online panel discussion, while Rae ripped into his Chinese counterpart in a meeting of the UN General Assembly on Friday for saying that Canada was bullying the People's Republic.Rae said Meng was living under ""house arrest"" while Spavor and Kovrig ""have been living in terrible conditions, without consular access, without any humane treatment whatsoever.""""This is something which we shall never forget,"" Rae added. ""If you think that insulting us or insulting my country or insulting anyone is going to help in resolving the situation, you're sadly mistaken.""Champagne, too, has ramped up his public criticism of China's human rights record on a number of issues: Beijing's crackdown on dissent in Hong Kong and the forced detention Uighur Muslims in the country's Xinjiang province.In a recent interview prior to the virtual visits with Kovrig and Spavor, Champagne said Canada would continue to push back against Beijing by working with allies.""We need to act together, and we need to be strong together to face what we have seen, a coercive type of diplomacy by China,"" the minister said.Champagne said it was significant that the case of the ""two Michaels"" was raised in China's recent summit with the European Union, including in its final communique.Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also thanked U.S. President Donald Trump for America's ""ongoing support"" in the effort to free Kovrig and Spavor during a Saturday phone call.A source with knowledge of the call who spoke confidentially to CBC News said there has been engagement between Canada and the U.S. in recent weeks on the push to get the pair released.According to the source, Kirsten Hillman, Canada's ambassador to the U.S., has raised the matter with the White House and has spoken to U.S. national security adviser Robert O'Brien. "

Kate MacDonald Butler, Montgomery's granddaughter and representative of her heirs, is thrilled by the project.""Well the plan is pretty exciting, and I have given my blessing to the project,"" she said.Tourism associations on P.E.I. and the province's Department of Innovation are excited by the project too, hoping interest in the book will lead to the same kind of interest in visiting Anne's land in China that the province has seen from Japan."

Participants include about 76 wealthy, self-financing ones, but neither the U.S. nor Russia.COVAX is co-led by the GAVI vaccines alliance, the WHO and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI).It is designed to discourage national governments from hoarding COVID-19 vaccines and to focus on first vaccinating the most high-risk people in every country.But its prospects of success had been dim until recently, as some rich nations, including the United States, chose to sign their own supply deals.""Vaccine deals are underway and we are fast approaching our initial fundraising target to jump-start support for lower-income countries,"" GAVI's chief executive, Dr. Seth Berkley, told Reuters in a statement.""What seemed like an impossible challenge just a few months ago — ensuring every country, rich or poor, gets equitable, rapid access to COVID-19 vaccines — is now becoming a reality.""The move also means China ""will be procuring vaccines through the facility for a proportion of their own population, just as with other countries,"" a GAVI spokesman said.China has ample capability to make COVID-19 vaccine and will prioritize supplies to developing countries when they are ready, the foreign ministry added.China has at least four experimental vaccines in final stages of clinical trials.Two are being developed by state-backed China National Biotec Group (CNBG) and two by Sinovac Biotech and CanSino Biologics.It has also inoculated hundreds of thousands of essential workers and other high-risk groups, though incomplete clinical trials have provoked safety concerns among experts."

OPINION | Opinion: Pandemic is an opportunity for Canada to reduce economic dependence on China | CBC News,"Post-pandemic, the world needs more engagement with China — but not through asymmetrical relationships, writes Ethan Lou.",2020-10-02T08:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/opinion/opinion-ethan-lou-china-trade-1.5743475,"This column is an opinion by Ethan Lou, the author of Field Notes from a Pandemic: A Journey Through a World Suspended. He is a former Reuters reporter and has served as a visiting journalist at the University of British Columbia. For more information about CBC's Opinion section, please see the FAQ.There is no time more apt than now for Canada to re-examine its economic relationship with China.Increasingly, signs are showing that China is taking advantage of the COVID-19 chaos to extend its influence globally. Post-pandemic, it will likely only get more powerful and assertive against a Western world mired in social and economic mayhem.Both Canada and the world have allowed the pursuit of profit to gradually force dependence on a sometimes hostile market — that is the bedrock of China's power. Now that COVID-19 has disrupted international supply chains, when Canada rebuilds, it should be toward an economy less integrated with China's.Middle powers like Canada, which have long been dancing between the majors, are increasingly impotent against tactics such as China's detention of this country's citizens, for example. China detained Canadians Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor in 2019 on spying charges — widely considered to be retaliation over the Vancouver arrest of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou under an extradition request by the U.S.So began a new era in bilateral relations, calling into question decades of diplomacy. That boldness by China would have been unthinkable just a decade or so ago.It's a new boldness, born from China's economic rise and the increasing chaos in the West — and the pandemic is accelerating both.China was hit badly by COVID-19, but it was hit first and it recovered first. And it recovered shrewdly — from outshining the United States at the World Health Organization, to its face-mask and vaccine diplomacy, to its alleged disinformation operations, to its bearing down on Hong Kong while the world's attention is divided, to restarting its economy while others' are suspended.Meanwhile, harsh pandemic lockdowns threaten to return to Europe and Canada. The United States, China's chief counterweight, is beset by all manner of instability.In 2017, Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland, then foreign affairs minister, told Parliament the rules-based international order the West has upheld since the end of the Second World War is becoming less stable, and that Canada needs to chart its ""clear and sovereign course."" Post-pandemic, that could prove to be particularly prescient.The NationalCanada recently abandoned free-trade talks with China, a move revealed Sept. 18 by Foreign Affairs Minister Francois Philipe-Champagne. That revelation is largely symbolic, however, as free trade was never close to realization to begin with.And on the same day, Canada's ambassador to China, Dominic Barton, said this country needs to ""do more in China.""What Canada needs to realize is the heavy price of the trade it already has.Since Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, the father of Canada's current leader, established diplomatic relations with China, bilateral trade has become a torrent — that cheap manufacturing, that vast market of 1.3 billion people. Thus Canada enriched itself.But while China has become Canada's second-biggest trading partner, this country is only the Asian giant's 16th-largest trading partner. When China stymied Canadian canola seed and soybean imports in 2019, it hurt major industries in this country. But for China, the lack of such grains from Canada was insignificant.That asymmetrical relationship has also made the affair over Huawei's Meng Wanzhou all the worse. There is little Canada can do to pressure China, but an arsenal of options in terms of what China can do, has done and will continue to do to Canada. China recently blocked an experimental COVID-19 vaccine shipment bound for Canada, for example.Pandemic lockdowns have devastated economies because companies had sourced parts and labour from all over the world based on where they were the cheapest, and did not stockpile so as to maintain efficiency by eliminating warehouse costs. That lesson is the same one to be learned from Canada's current troubles with China: prioritizing profit has come at the cost of resiliency.As Canada restarts its economy, the government would be wise to guide companies toward diversified markets. It needs to further cultivate alternative trading partners, such as fast-growing India and Brazil, and those with similar values, such as the European Union. And it needs to do so actively and aggressively.The goal is not to replace China, which is impossible, and this is also not an argument for disengagement. This is about reducing dependence and, in doing so, patching a vulnerability.This is also about loosening the hold China has over others, a tiny step to steering it toward a more constructive international role.Post-pandemic, the world needs more engagement with China, not less — but not through asymmetrical relationships — and it needs a rule-abiding China mindful of the adage that with great power comes great responsibility."
"China's aircraft demand growing, Boeing says","Boeing Co. has raised its 20-year forecast of China's demand for commercial aircraft, based on strong economic growth and more competitive Chinese carriers.",2010-11-02T00:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/china-s-aircraft-demand-growing-boeing-says-1.951250,"Boeing Co. has raised its 20-year forecast of China's demand for commercial aircraft, based on strong economic growth and more competitive Chinese carriers.Chinese airlines are expected to add 4,330 aircraft worth $480 billion US by 2029, up from a forecast last year of 3,770 planes worth $400 billion, Chicago-based Boeing said Tuesday.Boeing, Europe's Airbus Industrie and rivals from Russia, Brazil, Japan and Canada are looking to China to drive sales as U.S. and European growth slows. Beijing is also trying to create its own civilian jetliner industry.Boeing raised its outlook due to China's strong growth, demand for midsize aircraft and the competitiveness of its airlines, said Randy Tinseth, vice-president for marketing in Boeing's commercial airlines unit.""We have seen a much stronger market than we anticipated for single-aisle airplanes,"" Tinseth told reporters. ""When we look at international traffic, we think that the Chinese airlines will grab a larger market share of that traffic than we did last year.""Global airlines have rebounded quickly from the economic crisis.The International Air Transport Association, an industry group, said in September airline profits this year should be $8.9 billion after total losses of nearly $26 billion over 2008 and 2009.In China, Boeing said passenger numbers should more than triple and airline fleets will double in size by 2020.China's communist government has its own aerospace ambitions and is developing the the C919, a homegrown narrow-body, single-aisle jet.State-owned Commercial Aircraft Corp. of China, known as Comac, plans to deliver its first C919 in 2016.""I don't think there is any question that Comac will develop a successful aircraft,"" Tinseth said. ""How successful remains to be seen.""Despite rising competition, Tinseth said Boeing hopes to hold on to its 52 per cent market share in China. He said Boeing has looked at what market share the C919 might capture, but declined to say what it was.The rise in China of Western-style budget carriers could boost passenger numbers and aircraft demand, but Boeing expects only ""modest deregulation"" that would allow low-cost airlines to flourish, Tinseth said.""We don't have the same type of open, deregulated market that you have in the United States or Europe here,"" he said. ""The opportunity for a true low-cost airline would be later rather than sooner."""

""It is a measure, if you like, of the activity of the knowledge economy.""""We do have one very major driver,"" he said, calling China's figures ""extraordinary.""Domestic-only applications made up about two-thirds of the global total; only about 42,000 Chinese applications were for patents outside China. The United States, meanwhile, led the way when it comes to filing patent applications abroad, at nearly 238,000 last year.    The agency says the computer technology, electrical machinery and digital communications sectors recorded the highest number of published patent applications.Overall, the number of patents last year grants grew 5.2 percent to 1.2 million. Trademark applications jumped 15.3 percent to nearly six million, and industrial design applications rose 2.3 percent to 872,000. "
Ex-CIA officer charged with spying for China | CBC News,"A former CIA officer has been charged with spying for China, including by disclosing secret tradecraft and information on sources to intelligence officers, according to court documents unsealed Monday.",2020-08-17T21:28:32.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/ex-cia-officer-spying-china-1.5689883,"A former CIA officer and contract linguist for the FBI has been charged with spying for China, including by disclosing secret tradecraft and information on sources to intelligence officers, according to court documents unsealed Monday.Alexander Yuk Ching Ma, 67, was arrested last week in a scheme that involved a relative who had also worked for the  CIA, the U.S. Justice Department said on Monday.After an undercover operation, prosecutors say he accepted an envelope with $2,000 US in exchange for information about his past espionage activities. He told a law enforcement officer who was posing as a Chinese intelligence officer that he wanted to see the ""motherland"" succeed, prosecutors said.An FBI affidavit accuses Ma, who worked for the CIA from 1982 to 1989 with top-secret security clearance, of revealing government secrets to five Chinese intelligence officers in a Hong Kong hotel room over a three-day period in March 2001. Those secrets included information about CIA sources, international operations, staffing practices and operational tradecraft.Prosecutors said the unnamed relative with whom Ma conspired also worked as a CIA spy but resigned from the agency in 1983 following allegations that they used their official position to help Chinese citizens enter the U.S.""The trail of Chinese espionage is long and, sadly, strewn with former American intelligence officers who betrayed their colleagues, their country and its liberal democratic values to support an authoritarian communist regime,"" Assistant Attorney John Demers, the Justice Department's top national security official, said in a statement.Ma remained in touch with the Chinese intelligence officers after he joined the FBI as a contract linguist in 2004, at which point he used his work computer to copy images of documents related to missiles and weapon system technology research.He was charged in federal court in Honolulu with conspiring to gather and communicate national defence information for a foreign nation.Ma, a naturalized U.S. citizen born in Hong Kong, faces up to life in prison if convicted, and is due to make his first court appearance Tuesday.No defence lawyer was listed on court records for him."

Tory wants aid to China stopped,,2005-07-23T00:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/tory-wants-aid-to-china-stopped-1.561335,"A Conservative MP says it's time to ""turn off the tap"" of Canadian foreign aid to China. Canada has given China over $1 billion in aid over a decade and will contribute $50 million this year, Tory MP Helena Guergis said in media release on Thursday. ""Every dollar that Canada gives to China, no matter how well intended, is a dollar that the Chinese government can spend on its military, space program and propping up other corrupt and abusive regimes like North Korea or Zimbabwe,"" she said. Guergis asked why the Liberal government is giving money to a country that: Earlier this year, Minister of International Cooperation Aileen Carroll refused to end aid to China. ""No, I will not,"" she said in response to a question in the House of Commons. ""China influences hugely and will continue to influence the international scene. As such, it is very much incumbent on Canada to continue to work with the groups to build freedom in that country, to develop human rights and to develop a rules-based society ... ""We are helping China grow and influence it in the right way."" On its website, the Canadian International Development Agency says aid to China is necessary because, despite its progress, it still contains 20 per cent of the world's poor and ""some of the earth's most severe environmental problems."" Inequality between rural and urban areas, particularly in western China where women and ethnic minorities are ""disproportionately affected,"" means ""targeted measures are needed to address these imbalances."" The last shipment of UN food aid to China, wheat donated by Canada, reached the country in April. China is now being encouraged to become a food donor. ""We need China's help and resources to apply the crucial lessons learned here to other countries still struggling with hunger,"" James Morris, executive director of the UN's World Food Program, said in a release announcing the final shipment to China."
"China, Russia and Cuba win spots on UN Human Rights Council | CBC News","China, Russia and Cuba won seats on the UN's premier human rights body Tuesday despite opposition from activist groups over their abysmal human rights records.",2020-10-13T15:52:23.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/geneva-unhrc-nations-vote-1.5760060,"China, Russia and Cuba won seats on the UN's premier human rights body Tuesday despite opposition from activist groups over their abysmal human rights records.Russia and Cuba were running unopposed, but China and Saudi Arabia were in a five-way competition in the only contested race for seats on the Human Rights Council.In that race, Pakistan received 169 votes, Uzbekistan 164, Nepal 150, China 139 and Saudi Arabia just 90 votes.Despite announced reform plans by Saudi Arabia, Human Rights Watch said that nation continues to target human rights defenders, dissidents and women's rights activists — which include jailed former University of British Columbia student Loujian Alhathloul — and has demonstrated little accountability for past abuses, including the killing of Washington Post columnist and Saudi critic Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul two years ago.Except for the Asia-Pacific contest, the election of 15 members to the 47-member Human Rights Council has been all but decided because all the other regional groups have uncontested slates.Under the council's rules, seats are allocated to regions to ensure geographical representation. The body is composed of nations who've been elected to overlapping three-year terms.Four countries won Africa seats: Ivory Coast, Malawi, Gabon and Senegal. Russia and Ukraine were the only candidates for two East European seats. In the Latin American and Caribbean group, Mexico, Cuba and Bolivia ran unopposed for three seats. And Britain and France are the sole candidates for two seats for the Western European and others group.""We need for states to have a choice,"" said Louis Charbonneau, the UN director for Human Rights Watch. ""They don't want competition.… Essentially these are backroom deals that are worked out among the regional groups.""When states don't have a choice, the worst candidates easily find their way on to the council,"" he said at a briefing last week. ""This is an unfortunate political reality, but we keep hammering the message that we need competition and a real election, not a fake election.""Last week, a coalition of human rights groups from Europe, the United States and Canada called on UN member states to oppose the election of China, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Cuba, Pakistan and Uzbekistan, saying their human rights records make them ""unqualified.""""Electing these dictatorships as UN judges on human rights is like making a gang of arsonists into the fire brigade,"" said Hillel Neuer, executive director of UN Watch.The Geneva-based rights organization published a 30-page joint report with the Human Rights Foundation and the Raoul Wallenberg Center for Human Rights evaluating candidates for council seats. The report lists Bolivia, Ivory Coast, Nepal, Malawi, Mexico, Senegal and Ukraine as having ""questionable"" credentials due to problematic human rights and UN voting records that need improvement. It gave ""qualified"" ratings only to the United Kingdom and France.Human Rights Watch pointed to an unprecedented call by 50 UN experts on June 26 for ""decisive measures to protect fundamental freedoms in China,"" warning about its mass rights violations in Hong Kong and Tibet and against ethnic Uighurs in the Chinese province of Xinjiang as well as attacks on rights defenders, journalists, lawyers and government critics. Their call was echoed by over 400 civil society groups from more than 60 countries.Conservative Party leader Erin O'Toole reacts:By allowing these nations to take a lead role in the effort to police human rights abuses around the world, the UN has effectively given their actions a United Nations seal of approval. 3/4The rights group said Russia's military operations with the Syrian government ""have deliberately or indiscriminately killed civilians and destroyed hospitals and other protected civilian infrastructure in violation of international humanitarian law,"" and noted Russia's veto of UN Security Council resolutions on Syria, including blocking Damascus's referral to the International Criminal Court.The Geneva-based Human Rights Council can spotlight abuses and has special monitors watching certain countries and issues. It also periodically reviews human rights in every UN member country.Created in 2006 to replace a commission discredited because of some members' poor rights records, the new council soon came to face similar criticism.The United States announced its withdrawal from the council in June 2018 partly because it considered the body a forum for hypocrisy about human rights, though also because Washington says the council is anti-Israel."

U.S. mogul launches $300M China scholarship,"A U.S. private equity tycoon announced Sunday the establishment of a $300 million US endowed scholarship program in China for students from around the world, and billed it as a rival to the prestigious Rhodes Scholarship.",2013-04-22T00:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/u-s-mogul-launches-300m-china-scholarship-1.1364727,"A U.S. private equity tycoon announced Sunday the establishment of a $300 million US endowed scholarship program in China for students from around the world, and billed it as a rival to the prestigious Rhodes Scholarship.Stephen A. Schwarzman, founder of the private equity firm Blackstone, said he would give $100 million as a personal gift and raise another $200 million to endow the Schwarzman Scholars program at Beijing's Tsinghua University. It will be the largest philanthropic gift with foreign money in China's history, according to the tycoon and the university.The Wall Street mogul said China's rapid economic growth and rising global influence would define the 21st century, as U.S. ties to Europe did to the 20th century — when the Rhodes Scholarship was created at Oxford University with the goal of producing outstanding leaders.""China is no longer an elective course, it's core curriculum,"" he said in Beijing.By partnering with the prestigious Chinese university, Schwarzman said he hoped the educational program would train future world leaders and play a positive role in relations between China and the United States.""For future geopolitical stability and global prosperity, we need to build a culture of greater trust and understanding between China, America and the rest of the world,"" he said.Tsinghua — known for its engineering programs but in the midst of transforming itself to be more comprehensive in academic offerings — also has produced many of China's senior leaders, who have traditionally been technocrats. It is the alma mater for both President Xi Jinping and former President Hu Jintao.The $300 million endowment will allow 200 students each year to take part in a one-year master's program at Tsinghua — all expenses paid — in public policy, economics and business, international relations or engineering, beginning in 2016. Schwarzman said 45 per cent of the students would come from the United States, 20 per cent from China and the rest from other parts of the world.Already, $100 million has been raised in the last six months from private donors, Schwarzman said.The advisory board of the program includes several former world leaders including Canada's Brian Mulroney, ex-British PM Tony Blair, Australia's Kevin Rudd and France's Nicolas Sarkozy.Former U.S. secretaries of state Henry Kissinger, Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice are also on the boardBoth President Barack Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping sent congratulatory letters, which were read out loud at the announcement ceremony at the Great Hall of People — China's symbolic heart of political power. ""That was pretty remarkable to listen to,"" Schwarzman said. ""That was pretty awesome.""Vice Premier Liu Yandong attended the announcement and gave a speech.The announcement also was the top news on state-run China Central Television's evening newscast, which is typically reserved for the activities of China's top leaders.The program's advisory board includes former world leaders such as France's Nicolas Sarkozy, Britain's Tony Blair, Canada's Brian Mulroney and Australia's Kevin Rudd. Former U.S. secretaries of state Henry Kissinger, Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice are also on the board, as is renowned cellist Yo-yo Ma.""The board shares my belief that fostering connections between Chinese students, American students and students from around the world is a critical aspect of ensuring geopolitical stability now, and into the future,"" Schwarzman said.He said the program would be jointly governed by the Schwarzman Education Foundation and Tsinghua University on matters including curriculum and faculty.Schwarzman said he believes the program will enjoy academic freedom like any other Western educational institute and that he understands no topic will be off limits in the classrooms at the Schwarzman College, home to the program, to be built on the Tsinghua campus.Many international corporations already have signed on as donors to the program, including BP, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Boeing, GE, JPMorgan Chase, Bloomberg Philanthropies, Caterpillar, Credit Suisse and Deloitte. International companies often give charitable gifts to cultivate ties with potential future leaders.Tsinghua traces its roots to 1911, when the United States used the indemnity money paid by the Chinese government after an anti-foreigner rebellion to establish a preparatory school for students later sent to study in America. "
China woos Hollywood studios with film fund,"China extended its courtship of Hollywood on Wednesday, with government officials touting a new fund for co-financing movies.",2012-03-08T00:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/china-woos-hollywood-studios-with-film-fund-1.1154770,"China extended its courtship of Hollywood on Wednesday, with government officials touting a new fund for co-financing movies.The push comes just weeks after China's leader-in-waiting, Vice President Xi Jinping, unveiled rules that would give foreign films better access to its booming box office and a larger percentage of ticket receipts.China is looking to learn from Hollywood and develop the ability to make commercially successful movies on par with the biggest blockbusters. U.S. studios are trying to break further into China, where box office receipts rose more than a third last year to $2 billion US. That puts it on pace to become the world's second largest movie market in a few years, expected to top $5 billion US by 2015.   Meanwhile, North American theater revenue has fallen for two years straight, and ended the year with $10.2 billion US in ticket sales. With attendance falling and DVD sales continuing to slump, China represents one of the most attractive growth opportunities for the U.S. movie industry.Yang Buting, former chairman of one China's two national movie distributors, China Film Group, said that China wants to help make movies that appeal to both Chinese and global audiences while developing its fledgling movie-making industry.""China boasts a long history and a rich culture,"" Yang told attendees at a film finance conference in Los Angeles.""But we must see that compared with the American film industry, we still have a long way to go in terms of screenwriting, production, marketing and distribution.""For the last decade, China has allowed only 20 foreign films a year — mostly big-budget Hollywood fare — to get national distribution in a tightly controlled system that limits the foreign share of ticket sales to a range from 13.5 percent to 17.5 percent.  The U.S. had pressed for further easing of the rules since 2007 and a state visit last month by Xi led to a breakthrough. Under the new rules, China will allow in up to 14 more foreign films a year as long as they are made in 3D or for the big-screen Imax format, and raise the share of ticket sales to 25 percent.China is also encouraging joint ventures where Chinese companies have a majority stake.Films co-produced in such ventures can evade the quota system and get a higher share of ticket sales — up to 43 percent of all box office receipts, Yang said in an interview after his presentation.Several tie-ups have been announced over the last year, including one announced in February that will give Kung Fu Panda maker DreamWorks Animation SKG Inc. a 45 percent stake in a Shanghai-based studio with three Chinese companies. That venture is expected to begin operation later this year.Yang declined to say how much money would be in the fund, called the China Mainstream Media National Film Capital Hollywood Group Inc. He simply said the amount would be ""adequate"" to co-finance films made at the Hollywood studio level."

The spacecraft was launched aboard a Long March 2F rocket and will transport the crew to the Tiangong 1, which functions as an experimental prototype for a much larger Chinese space station to be launched in 2020. The craft will spend 12 days docked with the Tiangong.  On the heels of Canadian astronaut Chris Hadfield's wildly popular YouTube videos from the International Space Station, the Chinese crew plans to deliver a series of talks to students from aboard the Tiangong.  The craft carried two men, mission commander Nie Haisheng and Zhang Xiaoguang, and China's second female astronaut, Wang Yaping.  Earlier in the afternoon, President Xi Jinping was shown live on television wishing them well at the launch centre.""You have made Chinese people feel proud of ourselves,"" Xi told the three astronauts. ""You have trained and prepared yourselves carefully and thoroughly, so I am confident in your completing the mission successfully.""I wish you success and look forward to your triumphant return.""State television showed Xi watching the launch, as well as Premier Li Keqiang who was at the space command centre in Beijing. The space program is a source of enormous national pride for China, reflecting its rapid economic and technological progress and ambition to rank among the world's leading nations.  China is hoping to join the United States and Russia as the only countries to send independently maintained space stations into orbit. It is already one of just three nations to have launched manned spacecraft on its own.The space classrooms mark the boldest step so far to bring the military-backed program into the lives of ordinary Chinese and follows in the footsteps of NASA, which uses student outreach to inspire interest in space exploration and sustain support for its budgets.  At a news conference Monday, Wang said she was ""eager to explore and feel the magic and splendor of space with young friends.""Her fellow astronaut Zhang told reporters they would conduct dozens of space science experiments and would ""enjoy personalized space foods especially designed by our nutritionists."

China Philharmonic plans historic concert for the Pope,The China Philharmonic Orchestra will play for the Pope for the first time in a concert scheduled for Wednesday at the Vatican's audience hall.,2008-05-05T00:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/china-philharmonic-plans-historic-concert-for-the-pope-1.733533,"The China Philharmonic Orchestra will play for the Pope for the first time in a concert scheduled for Wednesday at the Vatican's audience hall.Pope Benedict XVI has set improving relations with China as a major goal of his pontificate.However, it was Beijing that approached the Vatican to ask about playing before the Pope.A  priest told Reuters that a Chinese diplomatic envoy approached a Vatican official outside Italy to broach the idea of a concert, and the offer was repeated several months ago.The Beijing-based Philharmonic Orchestra will be playing with the Shanghai Opera House Chorus, conducted by the Yu Long, a Shanghai-born, German-trained music director.The program includes Mozart's Requiem — Pope Benedict XVI is said to be a great lover of Mozart — and Chinese folk songs including Jasmine Flower. The orchestra is in the midst of a three-week European tour.""I certainly feel very excited. It is a historic visit. Although we played in Rome in 2004, this will be the orchestra's first appearance at the Vatican,"" Yu said in an interview with China Daily. For its part, China is hoping for an image boost after three weeks of demonstrations about Tibet during the Olympic torch relays.China wants the Vatican to drop its recognition of Taiwan, which it regards as a renegade state.Pope Benedict published a 55-page open letter in June saying he would be seeking to restore full diplomatic ties with China, which the Vatican has not recognized since 1951.However, the Pope has also accused China of ""grave violations of religious freedom."" Chinese Catholics loyal to the Pope must worship underground, as China has created a separate state-sanctioned church.Last September, the Vatican approved the installation of a new state-approved Catholic bishop of Beijing.And China has also made cultural overtures, including presentation of the same concert at St. Ignatius Cathedral in Shanghai to an audience of more than 1,000, to mark the church's 400th anniversary.There are hopes the performance will build on this détente, similar to the New York Philharmonic Orchestra's concert in North Korea earlier this year.""I don't think they (the Communist government) are doing it out of love for the Pope or love of the Holy See, but it will be positive in the end,"" said a Vatican source.The concert is to be broadcast in China, giving Chinese people a chance to see the Pope. "

This year's 484-page report allocated several more pages to each country than the previous one.It cited North Korea's technological advances in recent nuclear tests and says Pyongyang might have achieved the capability to miniaturize atomic weapons and develop warheads.""North Korea's military activity has increased tensions on the Korean Peninsula, and become a grave and imminent threat not only to Japan but also to the security in the region and the international society,"" the report said. It reiterated concerns that North Korean may have acquired a missile capable of launching as far as 10,000 kilometres.The report called China's reclamation moves in the South China Sea a provocation, and urged Beijing to accept a recent international arbitration ruling.It said China's escalating activity in the East China Sea caused Japan to scramble against Chinese warplanes more than 570 times last year.The report said China has stepped up activity around Japan-controlled islands that Beijing also claims, adding that a Chinese warship entered a strip of water just outside Japanese claimed waters in the area.China's navy has fired dozens of missiles and torpedoes during exercises in the East China Sea that come amid heightened maritime tensions in the region, underscoring Beijing's determination to back up its sovereignty claims with force if needed.The live-fire drills that began Monday follow China's strident rejection of an international arbitration panel's ruling last month that invalidated Beijing's claims to a vast swath of the South China Sea.That led to days of angry statements from Beijing, followed by live-firing naval exercises in the South China Sea and the launch of regular aerial patrols in the area.China's Supreme Court said on Tuesday people caught illegally fishing in Chinese waters could be jailed for up to a year, issuing a judicial interpretation defining those waters as including China's exclusive economic zones.China's actions over conflicting maritime claims are unilateral and high-handed, and some of them are ""dangerous actions that could trigger unanticipated situations,"" the Japanese report said. ""They raise strong concern about what may happen in the future."""

That's according to a teacher from Harrow who works and lives in China. David Brian has been teaching there for about 30 years, and is currently in Suzhou where he lives and works.It's also a place he says has no COVID-19 cases currently. ""I would have to say the last time we had some cases is probably going to be maybe back last May,"" Brian told CBC Radio's Windsor Morning. ""It's really business as usual, traveling, shopping, visiting. You'll see some people with masks on, but not very apparent.""Brian said there are still precautions being taken, such as temperature checks at commercial businesses or schools, and anyone who leaves the country would have to face quarantine rules on their return. But ultimately he attributes the situation to country's ability to come together to stop the spread of the virus. ""It was that fear back in the spring where everybody just fled to voluntary lockdown. They took it very seriously, and then hence this is where we're at today,"" he said. The city of Wuhan saw a mandatory 76-day lockdown this year, which ended in April. The city's 11 million residents were permitted to leave without special authorization as long as a mandatory smartphone application powered by a mix of data-tracking and government surveillance showed they were healthy and have not been in contact with anyone confirmed to have the virus. Other areas of the country followed this model, but Brian said most of the country entered lockdown voluntarily. WATCH | Traffic starts moving in and out of Wuhan after 11 weeks:NewsGovernment information was clear, he said, that people needed to stay home and factories and schools shut down voluntarily as ""a community effort.""""We're well aware of the country that we live in, there's significant control of information, but when things were at its height in the springtime, all of that information was open and public,"" said Brian. As a testament to that openness, Brian pointed out that one of the smartphone apps even showed blocks of a city where someone may have a COVID-19 case. Now that restrictions are lifted and people are permitted to work and travel more Brian said apps are also used, along with temperature checks, to ensure people have a clear bill of health and even where they have been. ""It allows for contact tracing afterwards in the event,"" he explained. At the onset of the pandemic in China, schools were shutdown starting in February. and lasted until mid-April, said Brian. When classes first restarted, strict protocols were followed. All students wore masks, temperature was checked three times a day, hand washing, restrictions on the playground, the canteen — all the tables had partitions so each individual was basically in a little box eating,"" he said. ""And then now that we've come back as of September 1st, all of the partitions are gone. Masks — you don't have to wear except when you enter the school.""Brian said the classrooms are pretty much ""back to normal,"" though temperatures are still checked and travel history is recorded as a precaution. ""Field trips are cancelled, and I'm just thinking that that's about it. So if you walk to the school, you would think it was just a normal running situation,"" he said. Brian attributes the successes in China to people's compliance with public health measures. ""You got to do this,"" he said. ""The COVID-19 doesn't discriminate rich or poor, young or old and if you don't do it, how else is it going to get stopped? That's the only way it stopped here is people just didn't give it that opportunity to spread."""

I don't believe that this will be repeated again,"" said Hagerman.Barges bring critical fuel and other dry goods to Arctic coastal and Mackenzie River communities every summer in both the N.W.T. and Nunavut.Hagermen said these four barges from China Merchants Jinling Shipyard are part of a new series that are made specifically to handle large volumes of fuel products. With the increased capacity, it will allow MTS to decrease the number of deliveries into some communities.An Infrastructure spokesperson said the total budget to design, build and deliver the four barges is $20.7 million; the federal government paid for 75 per cent, and the territorial government covered the other 25 per cent.Hagerman said, so far, organizing the delivery has been going better than he anticipated — despite the shipyard in China shutting down ""for well over a month"" since the height of the pandemic in March.Another concern has been that, like the N.W.T., China has been seeing high water levels, and the country is dealing with severe flooding.""We were really concerned, of course, that we wouldn't be able to get the barges at all this year,"" he said. ""I don't know how they did it, but they fast-tracked and put us right back on schedule.""With the ships coming in during the COVID-19 pandemic, there will be restrictions in place, said an Infrastructure spokesperson in an email Tuesday. Interactions between crew and residents are already restricted for regular community cargo deliveries, with designated drop-off zones. ""For the delivery of the barges from China, the barges will be unloaded by another vessel between 30 and 60 kilometres offshore, depending on weather. There will be no physical interactions or contact between vessels or vessel crews,"" the email said.The crew from China will not leave their vessel, with communication between crews only by radio. The email said MTS staff who are physically involved with attaching the new barges have gone through 14 days of self-isolation, as have the Chinese crew members.Nunakput MLA Jackie Jacobson said the new barges are going to be a big deal for his riding and other Arctic coastal communities.""It just reassures, having new barges in place that are able to carry as much fuel as we need for these communities. Instead of doing two trips a year, they are able to do it all in one,"" said Jacobson.""I'm looking forward to making sure that all my coastal communities are being serviced and I think this is a big step for our government working with the coastal communities.""""We haven't seen any big boats since last year, so it will be good to see,"" said Jacobson.Hagerman, with MTS, said the heavy-lift ship is slated to head overseas with the barges on July 28.It should arrive about 14 days later, depending on the weather.Hagerman said the new vessels won't be replacing any current barges, and although these vessels are generally used on the ocean, they can also be used on rivers."
"China, top global emitter, aims to go carbon-neutral by 2060 | CBC News",Chinese President Xi Jinping says his country will aim to stop adding to the global warming problem by 2060.,2020-09-23T13:01:48.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/china-carbon-neutral-1.5735172,"Chinese President Xi Jinping says his country will aim to stop adding to the global warming problem by 2060.Xi's announcement during a speech Tuesday to the UN General Assembly is a significant step for the world's biggest emitter of greenhouse gases.Calling for a ""green revolution,"" Xi said the coronavirus pandemic had shown the need to preserve the environment.""Humankind can no longer afford to ignore the repeated warnings of nature,"" he said.Citing the Paris Agreement that he and former U.S. President Barack Obama helped forge in 2015, Xi said his country would raise its emissions reduction targets with ""vigorous policies and measures.""""We aim to have CO2 emissions peak before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2060,"" he said.The term ""carbon neutrality"" means releasing no additional CO2 into the atmosphere, though technically it allows countries to keep emitting if they ensure that an equal amount is captured again in some form.The announcement was cheered by climate campaigners. Greenpeace executive director Jennifer Morgan called it ""an important signal"" that showed climate change is ""top of agenda for China.""""A big shift for curbing emissions and a significant step forward in international cooperation"" U.N. climate chief Patricia Espinosa said.The goal will be a challenge for China, which relies heavily for its electricity on coal, one of the most carbon-intensive fossil fuels.China released the equivalent of 10 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide, or CO2, into the atmosphere in 2018, according to the Global Carbon Project that tracks emissions worldwide. That was almost twice as much as the United States and three times as much as the European Union.Several other major emitters have set earlier deadlines, with the EU aiming to be carbon neutral by 2050. Frans Timmermans, who leads the EU executive's efforts on climate change, welcomed Xi's announcement.""We need decisive action from every country to keep temperatures under control, tackle climate change and keep our planet inhabitable,"" he said.The United States has so far not set such a goal. President Donald Trump, who once described climate change as a hoax invented by China, has started the process of pulling the U.S. out of the Paris accord.If China fulfills Xi's goal, it could prevent 0.2 to 0.4 C further warming for the world, according to ""very rough estimates"" by MIT management professor John Sterman, who models and tracks emission reductions and pledges with Climate Interactive.But much depends on how they do their emissions reduction and how soon they cut them, he said, adding he has to do a more thorough analysis.""That's a lot,"" Sterman said. ""China's by far the world's big emitter. They're emitting more than the EU and US together.""""It puts a lot more pressure on the United States,"" Sterman said.Perhaps even more important than the carbon neutrality pledge is the effort to peak carbon dioxide emissions before 2030 instead of by 2030, Sterman said. Carbon dioxide's more than 100-year lifetime in the air makes earlier emission cuts more effective than promises in the future, he said.""Emissions that don't happen between now and 2030 are going to reduce warming a lot more than the same emission reductions after 2060,"" Sterman said.However, pledges are not the same as actions. What's needed is signs of action, such as eliminating plans to build new coal-fired power plants, cutting subsidies for coal power and getting off coal entirely, Sterman said. Coal is the biggest carbon dioxide emitter of power sources.Twenty-nine nations before China have pledged to achieve climate neutrality in different years, according to the Carbon Neutrality Coalition. They include Canada.With China, the 30 countries that have some kind of carbon neutrality pledges, account for about 43 per cent of the world's carbon dioxide emissions from the burning of fossil fuels. The largest polluting countries not on the list are the United States, India, Russia, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, South Africa, Turkey, Brazil and Australia."
Dell to sell PCs through China retailer,Dell Inc. announced a deal Monday to sell computers through China's biggest chain of electronics stores in an effort to capture a bigger share of the booming market.,2007-09-24T00:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/dell-to-sell-pcs-through-china-retailer-1.671322,"Dell Inc. announced a deal Monday to sell computers throughChina's biggest chain of electronics stores in an effort to capture a bigger share of the booming market.The deal extends Dell's strategy of expanding beyond its traditional internet- and phone-based sales model into retail to cope with competition from Hewlett-Packard Co. and other rivals. Dell also has targeted China with a low-cost PC unveiled in March and aimed at rural customers.Sales will start in 50 Gome Group stores next month and expand to more stores early next year, said Michael Tatelman, vice-president of marketing and sales for Dell's global consumer business.""Our market share in China is obviously well below our global average. So we hope to be successful here and get our rightful share of the business,"" Tatelman said. ""We think this partnership gives us a platform to certainly expand our business here.""Tatelman declined to give any sales projections.Dell, based in Round Rock, Texas, used to lead global PC sales with its lower-cost direct sales model. But since HPpassedit in market share last year, Dell has started to turn to retail sales, including recent deals with Wal-Mart Stores Inc. in the United States, Bic Camera Inc. in Japan and Carphone Warehouse PLC in Britain.Dell said it has about 18 per cent of China's PC market by revenue and 10 per cent by number of units sold. In China, Dell trails Beijing-based rival Lenovo Group Ltd., which bought IBM Corp.'s PC business in 2005, and Hewlett-Packard, the world's biggest computer seller.The new China sales plan calls for putting Dell employees in some Gome stores. The chain has about 700 outlets in 210 cities in China.Gome already sells home computers from a wide range of brands, said Wang Junzhou, the company's executive vice-president, who joined Tatelman at the news conference.He said some outlets have more than 200 different models on display.Dell models to be sold at Gome include the XPS M1330 and Inspiron 1420 notebooks and XPS 720, Dimension 9200 and Inspiron 530 desktop, according to the company.Dell plans to continue with its internet and phone-based sales in China, Tatelman said. He declined to say which method was expected to be more profitable.The low-cost basic desktop PCs designed for China that went on sale in March are priced at about $300 US, he said.Gome Group is the parent company of Hong Kong-listed Gome Electrical Appliances Holding Ltd. Gome's rapid expansion has made its founder, Huang Guangyu, one of China's richest entrepreneurs, with a fortune estimated last year by Forbes magazine at $2.3 billion."

Dozens of journalists, labour and human rights activists and others have been imprisoned.Ren, 69, was convicted of corruption, bribery, embezzlement of public funds and abuse of power, the Beijing No. 2 Intermediate People's Court announced on its social media account. It cited Ren as saying he wouldn't appeal.The former chairman and deputy party secretary of Huayuan Group was expelled from the ruling party in July.In a commentary that circulated on social media, Ren criticized a Feb. 23 video conference with 170,000 officials held early in the pandemic at which Xi announced orders for responding to the COVID-19 disease caused by the virus.Ren didn't mention Xi's name but said, ""standing there was not an emperor showing off his new clothes but a clown who had stripped off his clothes and insisted on being an emperor.""Ren criticized propaganda that portrayed Xi and other leaders as rescuing China from the disease without mentioning where it began and possible mistakes including suppressing information at the start of the outbreak.""People did not see any criticism at the conference. It didn't investigate and disclose the truth,"" Ren wrote, according to a copy published by China Digital Times, a website in California. ""No one reviewed or took responsibility. But they are trying to cover up the truth with all kinds of great achievements.""Ren had an early military career, and his parents were both former high officials in the Communist Party. Some called him a princeling, a term for offspring of the founders of the communist government, a group that includes Xi.He appeared to have crossed a political line by criticizing Xi's personal leadership."

This is a government blockage carefully designed to look like the problem is with Gmail,"" the company said in a brief statement.China has some of the world's strictest internet controls and blocks many popular social media sites, including YouTube, Facebook and Twitter. The government intensified those efforts after pro-democracy protest erupted across the Middle East in January.Around that time, anonymous calls for protesters to gather for a ""Jasmine Revolution"" in China triggered a crackdown by Chinese authorities, who stepped up web censorship and deployed huge numbers of police to planned protest sites. No protests happened.A Google spokesperson said users in China, the world's most populous internet market, have reported having intermittent problems with the service since the end of January.Problems include difficulty accessing the home page for Gmail and problems sending emails when logged into the service. The instant messaging function is often not working as well.Google officials said the blocking appears to be more sophisticated than other problems experienced by users in the past because the disruption is not a complete block.In addition, a March 11 blog post by Google about security said the company had ""noticed some highly targetted and apparently politically motivated attacks against our users. We believe activists may have been a specific target."" In the posting, Google declined to elaborate on which activists had been targetted or where the attacks had come from.A company spokesperson refused to say if Google has raised the issue directly with Chinese government officials.China's Foreign Ministry had no immediate comments on Google's accusation.Google has had highly public run-ins with the Chinese government.In January last year, Google announced that it would no longer co-operate with the government's requirement to censor search results for banned sites. It also complained about major attacks on its website by Chinese hackers, suggesting the government may have instigated the attacks.Attacks were also mounted against email accounts by activists working on human rights in China at that time.Google moved its Chinese-language search engine to Hong Kong, which operates under separate rules from the rest of mainland China."

The university started using the virtual private network in the spring. It is intended to give students in China faster access to certain pre-approved online learning websites.But it doesn't lift restrictions on resources that aren't generally available in China, including YouTube and access to certain newspapers and magazines.MacFarlane said instructors therefore may be forced to weigh if they want to include academic materials in their online courses that are not accessible in China, or that might be considered subversive.THREAD: My university has ""engaged a service"" from Alibaba Cloud (Aliyun) operating in China to facilitate UWaterloo course content to students in China this term. So what is this and why should instructors (frankly, everyone) be concerned? 1/nHe says this could lead to a chilling effect on academic freedom, whether it's intentional or not.""You want to treat students fairly, but you also don't want to change the content of your course on the basis of censorship,"" said MacFarlane.The University of Toronto, which is also using the VPN service provided by Alibaba, said on its website that ""there is an inherent risk of monitoring for individuals in mainland China using any network solution.""In a statement, University of Waterloo vice-president David DeVidi noted that student activities using Alibaba are ""no more or less open to monitoring"" than any internet activity in China. ""Network traffic from a student's computer in China to Waterloo learning technologies is secured by end-to-end encryption,"" he said.Devidi also noted that the university has not, and will not, provided any guidance to faculty about altering course content. Another spokesperson for the university said the institution could not comment on the number of students learning remotely from China this term.In fall 2018 there were more than 7,500 students from China studying at the University of Waterloo."

""And we see attempts on the part of individual countries to use the current situation in order to move forward their narrow interests of the moment in order to settle the score with the undesirable governments or geopolitical competitors.""That was too much for the United States' UN ambassador, Kelly Craft, who opened her remarks late in the meeting with a blunt rejoinder.""Shame on each of you. I am astonished and disgusted by the content of today's discussion,"" Craft said. She said other representatives were ""squandering this opportunity for political purposes.""""President Trump has made it very clear: We will do whatever is right, even if it's unpopular, because, let me tell you what, this is not a popularity contest,"" Craft said.WATCH | UN chief says nations need to work together:WorldShe quoted Trump's speech Tuesday to the virtual opening of the General Assembly's leaders meeting in which he said that to chart a better future, ""we must hold accountable the nation which unleashed this plague onto the world: China.""""The Chinese Communist Party's decision to hide the origins of this virus, minimize its danger, and suppress scientific co-operation [that] transformed a local epidemic into a global pandemic,"" Craft said, adding that these actions ""prove that not all member states are equally committed to public health, transparency, and their international obligations.""Chinese UN Ambassador Zhang Jun asked for the floor at the end of the meeting and delivered a lengthy retort, saying ""China resolutely opposes and rejects the baseless accusations by the United States.""""Abusing the platform of the UN and its Security Council, the U.S. has been spreading political virus and disinformation, and creating confrontation and division,"" Zhang said.Zhang said: ""The U.S. should understand that its failure in handling COVID-19 is totally its fault.""The United Nations chief said in opening the Security Council meeting that the world failed to co-operate in tackling the COVID-19 pandemic. Guterres said that if the world responds to even more catastrophic challenges with the same disunity and disarray, ""I fear the worst.""He said the international community's failure ""was the result of a lack of global preparedness, co-operation, unity and solidarity.""Guterres pointed to the nearly one million people around the world that the coronavirus has killed, the more than 30 million who have been infected. He said the global response is more and more fragmented, and ""as countries go in different directions, the virus goes in every direction."""

If successful, itwill pave the way for a lunar landing mission, Xinhua quoted National Space Administration director Sun Laiyan as saying Sunday in a speech at Beijing Jiaotong University.In 2003, China joined the United States and the Soviet Union as just the third country to put a person into space and has since set an aggressive timetable for its space program in the hopes of catching up to Europe and the U.S.An unmanned landing on the moon is expected to follow the lunar orbiter mission in 2012. The six-wheeled rover under development will reportedly run on nuclear power, as opposed to the rechargeable lithium ion batteries used to power the U.S.'s Mars rovers, Spirit and Opportunity.China's mission to Mars will be a joint venture with Russia and will launch in October 2009, Xinhua said, quoting sources in the Shanghai Space Administration.The joint mission was first signed in March 2007. China will contribute the probe, or satellite, to the mission while Russia will supply the landing vehicle, Phobos-Grunt.Phobos-Grunt is designed to take rock samples and return them to Earth.The race to explore the moon and Mars is reminiscent of the earlier space race between the United States and the Soviet Union in the 1960s.China has ambitions to land a person on the moon in 15 years, or by 2022, putting its timetable very close to that of the United States.NASA has already announced plans to have its new class of Orion spacecraft begin its first flight in 2014 and land a four-person team on the moon by 2020."
China's rise revives ancient number craze,"The love of numbers in China is nothing new, experts say.",2008-08-08T00:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/china-s-rise-revives-ancient-number-craze-1.706202,"Belief in the baleful or beneficent influence of numbers is ubiquitous in Chinese culture, says Wenran Jiang of the University of Alberta's China Institute.""It's a kind of Chinese numerology, not a science, a philosophy or an art,"" Jiang says.""Think of it as a superstition that almost everyone pays attention to ... especially when it comes to groups of numbers and how they sound, and what they add up to.""Chinese numbers and what they sound likeThose combinations can include 518, which when spoken in many Chinese dialects sounds like the phrase ""I will prosper.""In Hong Kong and southern China, the local Cantonese tongue makes the numbers 289 resemble ""easy long-term prosperity"" making that combination especially valued for an address, a bank account or a cellphone number.Similarly, people avoid the numbers four and combinations of digits that add up to that amount.The Chinese word for four, spoken in some dialects, sounds like the word for death.  Other numbers, including seven and in some areas one, are also not popular.Jiang says China's recent economic growth and advances in education have, if anything, made devotion to numerology even more alluring.""This practice lives on in modern China. People go on with their lives, use technology and science, but when it comes to weddings, meetings and other things, when they have a choice, they go with the lucky numbers,"" he says.Laughing, Jiang points to his own phone number which contains two pairs of lucky numbers. ""Even I do this,"" he says.""Think Friday the 13th in Western society.  Many people [in the West] do fear it or try to avoid it. It's the same with the numbers [in China]. It does no harm but maybe does some good.""Some in China worry that this year's Olympic lucky numbers may have been misinterpreted.The fact that the numerical dates of the Sichuan earthquake (May 12 or 5/12) or the worst day of the recent riots in Tibet (March 14 or 3/14 ) add up to eight, or the luckiest single digit of all, has worried some who follow numerology.To Chinese fortune teller and Hong Kong-based feng shui master Raymond Lo, using Western numbers to denote the year is where people have been led astray.""The Western calendar calls this year 2008 but in Chinese we call it the year of the rat,"" Lo said.""The year of the rat is actually made up of two elements … earth sitting on water…and this … is like a mountain which is floating in a sea which means the earth is unstable.""But Lo is definitely in the minority in today's China.The pursuit of lucky numbers, and avoidance of their unlucky counterparts, has never been more intense or widespread, Jiang says.It's also obvious that traditional numerology enjoys some degree of support from China's Communist authorities, who once campaigned to eradicate superstition from their society.Who else in a rigid, centrally controlled country like China could have approved the decision to start the Olympic Games opening ceremony at eight minutes past the eighth hour of the eighth day of the eighth month of the year 2008?"

That indicates to us it was political. We were the only two journalists left in China working for Australian media,"" Smith told Reuters in a telephone interview.""It felt very, very political. It very much felt like a diplomatic tussle in the broader Australia-China relationship,"" Birtles told ABC television on Tuesday.WATCH | Australian reporter's chilling encounter with China's national security officials:WorldThe Australian government had earlier warned the two men to leave China, as tension escalated over the detention of another Australian citizen, Chinese state television anchor Cheng Lei.Cheng was detained on suspicion of criminal activities endangering national security, China's foreign ministry said on Tuesday.Police arrived before the men could catch flights booked for Thursday, however.""At 12.30 a.m., I was woken by a huge pounding on my front door,"" Smith recalled.Seven police officers entered his home, surrounding him and recording him on video as they read out a statement designating him a person of interest in a national security investigation, though he was not the subject of the case.""They put a spotlight on my face. It was intimidating. I was getting quite scared,"" he said.Australian consular officials decided ""it was best"" that the duo be able to stay with Australian officials on Australian premises while the issues were tackled, Payne told radio station 2GB.Smith said he was taken in a car with diplomatic plates and a consular officer collected his packed bags.Both men stayed with Australian officials for five days until a resolution was reached in which the two agreed to be interviewed by Chinese security officials.Smith was driven by diplomatic escort to a Shanghai hotel on Monday afternoon, where he was questioned for an hour about Cheng, whom he had once encountered briefly but never spoken to, and Hong Kong, among other topics.Australian consular officials accompanied the two to Shanghai airport and to the gate.""This incident targeting two journalists, who were going about their normal reporting duties, is both regrettable and disturbing,"" the Australian Financial Review said in a statement.Their departure leaves Australian media organizations with no correspondent in China for the first time since the 1970s.""It is disappointing that after many years, Australia will not have a media organization present in China,"" Payne told reporters.On Tuesday, China's foreign ministry said the questioning of the men was a normal enforcement of the law, to which authorities had strictly adhered during their investigations.Australia has a tense diplomatic relationship with China, which worsened this year after Beijing vowed trade reprisals and said it was angered by Australia's call for an international inquiry into the source of the coronavirus pandemic.Australia had issued a travel warning in July that citizens could be at risk of arbitrary detention in China, advice Payne said ""remains appropriate and unchanged.""The incident comes as foreign journalists face greater difficulty in China. The Foreign Correspondents' Club of China says a record number of 17 were expelled, through cancellations of credentials, in the first half of 2020."

U.S. reacts angrily to losing WTO ruling on China tariffs | CBC News,"A World Trade Organization panel ruled Tuesday that Trump administration tariffs on $200 billion US worth of Chinese goods are illegal, vindicating Beijing even if the United States has all but incapacitated the WTO's ability to hand down a final, binding verdict.",2020-09-15T18:13:46.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/wto-china-tariffs-us-1.5724881,"A World Trade Organization panel ruled Tuesday that Trump administration tariffs on $200 billion US worth of Chinese goods are illegal, vindicating Beijing even if the United States has all but incapacitated the WTO's ability to hand down a final, binding verdict.The decision marks the first time that the Geneva-based trade body has ruled against a series of high-profile tariffs that U.S.President Donald Trump's government has imposed on a number of countries — allies and rivals alike. Trump has repeatedly claimed that the WTO treats the U.S. unfairly.In its decision, the WTO's dispute settlement body ruled against the U.S. government's argument that China has wrongly engaged in practices harmful to U.S. interests on issues including intellectual property theft and technology transfer.The ruling, in theory, would allow China to impose retaliatory tariffs on billions' worth of U.S. goods.But it is unlikely to have much practical impact, at least in the short term, because the U.S. can appeal the decision and the WTO's appeals court is currently no longer functioning — largely because of Washington's single-handed refusal to accept new members for it.The appeals court issues final rulings in trade cases and stopped functioning last year when the terms of two of its last three judges expired with no replacements. That means the United States can appeal the decision ""into the void,"" said Timothy Keeler, a lawyer at Mayer Brown and former chief of staff for the U.S. Trade Representative.""This panel report confirms what the Trump administration has been saying for four years: The WTO is completely inadequate to stop China's harmful technology practices,"" said U.S. trade representative Robert Lighthizer in a statement. He said the U.S. had presented ""extensive evidence"" of China's intellectual property theft and the WTO has offered no fixes for it.""The United States must be allowed to defend itself against unfair trade practices, and the Trump administration will not let China use the WTO to take advantage of American workers, businesses, farmers, and ranchers,"" he said.Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley, one of the prominent China critics in the Republican Party, said it was ""more evidence that the WTO is outdated, sclerotic, and generally bad for America. USA should withdraw and lead the effort to abolish it.""The Chinese ministry of commerce said the ruling was ""objective and fair"" and called on the U.S. to respect it.The U.S. tariffs target two batches of Chinese products. Duties of 10 per cent were imposed on some $200 billion worth of goods in September 2018, and were jacked up to 25 per cent eight months later. An additional 25 per cent duties were imposed in June 2018 against Chinese goods worth about $34 billion in annual trade.The Trump administration has justified the sanctions under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, once a common tool used by the U.S. government to impose sanctions — and recently revived by Trump. The U.S. argued that China's actions had amounted to ""state-sanctioned theft"" and ""misappropriation"" of U.S. technology, intellectual property and commercial secrets.The WTO panel ruled that the U.S. measures violated longstanding international trade rules because they only applied to products from China, and that Washington had not adequately substantiated its claim that the Chinese products hit with the extra duties had benefited from the allegedly unfair Chinese practices."

The honour has been awarded only twice before— to South African leader Nelson Mandela and Swedish diplomat Raoul Wallenberg, who saved countless Jews from extermination during the Second World War.Nobel prize winnerThe Dalai Lama won a Nobel peace prize in 1989 for his lifelong struggle for Tibetan autonomy and his pursuit of peace. He has lived in exile since 1958, when China annexed Tibet.Amnesty International says freedom of religion, expression and association continued to be severely restricted in Tibet last year. Arbitrary arrests and unfair trials are rampant there.""Over 100 Tibetan prisoners of conscience, mainly Buddhist monks and nuns, remained in prison,"" Amnesty said inits annual report.China is Canada's second-largest trading partner, with annual trade worth $30 billion in 2004, according to the Department of Foreign Affairs.Zang hinted that Parliament's decision could bring economic repercussions.""We have 1.3 billion population and we are developing and the future for China is bright and China has a big market and we hope we can co-operate with all the countries in the world,"" Zang said.""But if some problems or troubles always appear or emerge in the bilateral relationship, certainly the other relationships certainly will be hurt, so we have to manage all the differences and difficulties with caution.""China not issuing 'threat': officialAsked if China was levelling a threat, Zang smiled and said, ""I don't think it's a threat. I'm just trying to make things clearer. It is a clear fact and very easy to be seen.""Foreign Affairs says Canada recognizes the People's Republic of China as the legitimate government of China and Tibet.""Canada does not recognize the Tibet government in exile, but Canada considers the Dalai Lama to be an important and widely supported spiritual leader,"" said spokeswoman Kim Girtel.Prime Minister Stephen Harper has been less than enthusiastic about building ties with China since hisConservative government came to power, andcomplained about Chinese espionage early in his tenure.New Democratic Party MP Peggy Nash, a member of the Canada-Tibet Parliamentary Committee that pushed for the honorary status, said the Dalai Lama is expected to visit Canada in early September."

According to China Daily, a      Luliang         Chemical   Industry employee and two employees from a coal company are also charged.Government officials initially denied the contamination of the reservoir, which feeds into the Pearl River — one of China's longest and most valuable waterways.At the time, officials said they had contained and cleaned the chromium-contaminated soil and water, but they now say the cleanup won't be complete until the end of 2012.Hexavalent chromium is easily absorbed by the body, and can cause vomiting, abdominal pain, dermatitis and eczema.

China lifts quarantine on Canadian students,"China lifted a swine flu quarantine on a group of Canadian students Wednesday, two days early, after the measure was questioned by the Canadian government and world health authorities.",2009-05-06T00:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/china-lifts-quarantine-on-canadian-students-1.783159,"The 25 students and a professor from the University of Montreal — who travelled to the densely populated country last week to learn Chinese — were placed in a lakeside hotel after being pulled aside by provincial officials in Changchun after their plane landed in the northeastern city on Saturday. They were told they would be quarantined for seven days.A Chinese official said the country will continue its strident checks on travellers from regions affected by an outbreak of the new strain of H1N1 flu, which is believed to have originated in Mexico.Despite the restrictive measures, none of the group showed any symptoms or complained of feeling ill.Patrick Martin-Menard, one of the quarantined students, told CBC News the students first heard the restrictions were being lifted from the Canadian consul, who called their professor earlier Wednesday to inform them of media reports he was hearing.""We did not get any word from Chinese officials directly,"" Martin-Menard said in a telephone interview.The group is scheduled to leave the hotel on Thursday morning, but Martin-Menard said they were finally allowed to step outside the hotel for the first time since Saturday.""We were able to go outside and take a walk,"" he said.The decision to lift the quarantine shows local officials were obviously pressured by Beijing, the CBC's China correspondent Michel Cormier reported from the Chinese capital.""This was starting to be quite an embarrassment for the Beijing national government,"" Cormier said.""This was a local decision because the students had been allowed into the Beijing International Airport without any problems.""Canada's Foreign Affairs Department sent a diplomatic note on Tuesday seeking an explanation from China for placing the students under medical surveillance, even though none exhibited symptoms of the virus.Speaking to reporters in Ottawa on Wednesday morning, Foreign Affairs Minister Lawrence Cannon said he would personally raise the matter during his trip to China on the weekend.""I've asked for an explanation,"" the minister said.The quarantine itself appeared severely flawed, as several students told CBC News they were in regular contact with hotel staff.When asked by reporters about the World Health Organization's position on China's quarantine measures, the WHO's flu chief said Tuesday the organization was asking some countries to justify their disease control measures. But Dr. Keiji Fukuda refused to criticize China directly.The students are eventually heading to the Northeast China Normal University and will spend another nine weeks in the country. Martin-Menard said the experience wouldn't sway them from their purpose.""We're all going to continue what we came here to do,"" he said. ""We certainly don't want all that has happened in the past few days to ruin the rest of our travel."""

"Visit your aged parents often, China orders children",The national legislature of China on Friday amended its law on the elderly to require that adult children visit their aged parents 'often' — or risk being sued by them.,2012-12-28T00:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/visit-your-aged-parents-often-china-orders-children-1.1193286,"Visit your parents. That's an order.So says China, whose national legislature on Friday amended its law on the elderly to require that adult children visit their aged parents ""often"" — or risk being sued by them.The amendment does not specify how frequently such visits should occur.State media say the new clause will allow elderly parents who feel neglected by their children to take them to court. The move comes as reports abound of elderly parents being abandoned or ignored by their children.A rapidly developing China is facing increasing difficulty in caring for its aging population. Three decades of market reforms have accelerated the breakup of the traditional extended family in China, and there are few affordable alternatives, such as retirement or care homes, for the elderly or others unable to live on their own.Earlier this month, state media reported that a grandmother in her 90s in the prosperous eastern province of Jiangsu had been forced by her son to live in a pig pen for two years. News outlets frequently carry stories about other parents being abused or neglected, or of children seeking control of their elderly parents' assets without their knowledge.The expansion of China's elderly population is being fueled both by an increase in life expectancy — from 41 to 73 over five decades — and by family planning policies that limit most families to a single child. Rapid aging poses serious threats to the country's social and economic stability, as the burden of supporting the growing number of elderly passes to a proportionately shrinking working population and the social safety net remains weak."

China bars HIV-positive Aussie author,China has refused a visa to Australian writer Robert Dessaix on the grounds he is HIV-positive.,2010-03-13T00:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/china-bars-hiv-positive-aussie-author-1.869639,"A war of words has erupted between Australia and China over Chinese refusal to grant an HIV-positive Australian author a permit to enter the country.Robert Dessaix was invited to be a speaker at the Australian Literary Festival in Beijing and Shanghai.Dessaix was a replacement for author Frank Moorhouse, who decided to pull out in protest at China's imprisonment of local writer and activist Liu Xiaobo. The 65-year-old Dessaix, who makes his home in Hobart, Tasmania, told reporters he felt ""snubbed and insulted, of course, and also humiliated.""The author, who was slated to be at the festival starting Friday, believes the HIV issue could be a way of Chinese authorities thumbing their nose at Australia in response to the Moorhouse boycott.""If out of all this the Chinese are encouraged to look again at their blanket ban on people with HIV entering the country — except in this case there is this ban apparently — then it's been worthwhile,"" Dessaix told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.Australian officials have raised the issue with their Chinese counterparts, who have refused to reverse their decision to deny Dessaix a visa based on his HIV status.""If he's HIV-positive, according to the current regulations in China, he's not allowed to enter the country,"" foreign ministry spokesman Qin Gang told the ABC.""There are clear regulations on this. So we hope that Australians in general and the author himself can understand this.""In fact, the HIV restriction was temporarily suspended during the 2008 Beijing Olympics.China's action has stirred some dissent within the country.Professor Li Dun, who teaches at the Tsinghua University Centre for Study of Contemporary China, told a Chinese newspaper that ""historically speaking, confining people has proven to be ineffective, if not meaningless in preventing the spread of this disease.""He called the visa denial an act of discrimination.During the 1990s, Li was a government consultant on the prevention of AIDS."
Experts call on Canadian universities to close off China's access to sensitive research | CBC News,"Three Canadian universities are among the most active in the world when it comes to collaborative work with Chinese researchers. Now, some are calling on post-secondary institutions to take steps to keep the Chinese military away from Canadian science.",2020-09-15T08:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/china-canada-universities-research-waterloo-military-technology-1.5723846,"The U.S. State Department revealed last week that, over the past three months, it has expelled more than a thousand Chinese ""high-risk graduate students and research scholars"" who were working at American universities.The State Department said their visas were revoked under Presidential Proclamation 10043, issued by President Donald Trump at the end of May to counter ""a wide‑ranging and heavily resourced campaign to acquire sensitive United States technologies and intellectual property, in part to bolster the modernization and capability of its military, the People's Liberation Army.""The individuals whose visas were revoked represent only a small fraction of the 370,000 Chinese nationals studying in the U.S. — and a big escalation in Washington's conflict with China over the control of the world's most coveted technologies.Washington is not alone in suggesting that the Chinese military has encouraged or even enlisted academics to collaborate with counterparts in the West, in person or remotely, while masking their affiliations with the People's Liberation Army [PLA] or its institutes of learning, such as the National University of Defence Technology.In Canada, the Commons Committee on Canada-China Relations heard similar allegations in testimony in the weeks leading up to prorogation — including the claim that some of the core technology behind China's surveillance network was developed in Canadian universities.In Australia, the Sydney Morning Herald documented a startling array of projects which saw Australian scientists collaborate with Chinese universities to carry out military research beneficial to the PLA — some of it funded by Australian taxpayers. Much of that research found its way into new Chinese weapons systems or the surveillance networks employed by the Chinese regime, the Herald said.In 2018, the Australian Strategic Policy Institute published a study that looked at the number of peer-reviewed papers co-authored by PLA scientists and overseas researchers. It found that universities in Australia and Singapore had the highest level of collaboration.But three Canadian universities also made the top ten ranking: the University of Toronto (10th place), McGill University (9th), and the University of Waterloo (4th).There were just over 140,000 Chinese nationals studying in Canada before the pandemic hit. Waterloo's vice-president of research Charmaine Dean said her university's focus on science and engineering makes it naturally attractive to Chinese researchers, citing artificial intelligence and robotics as two areas of particularly strong cooperation.She said science — not geopolitics — is front of mind for Waterloo researchers. ""Individuals tend to work with other researchers that are brilliant around the world in order to advance an area,"" she said.Dean is one of a group of research VPs from Canada's 15 main research universities who have met with officials from the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) to discuss their work with Chinese counterparts.""I do reach out to them routinely,"" she told CBC News. ""I would say before the pandemic hit, we're talking about every month, every other month, to identify whether there are any issues with any of our collaborations … And I will tell you that there has been no specific or general direction that I am expected to take in how I am approaching collaborations with China on the research file.""Dean said the university is more than open to being given more direction by the federal government.""If the government of Canada would like to provide universities as a whole advice on national security matters, or if there are any specific concerns with regards to the University of Waterloo, I think that is really important for us to hear that,"" she said. ""We can't make assessments on issues of national security.""But some in academia are pushing back on that viewpoint.""I believe it's up to every citizen of Canada to be defending national security,"" said Margaret McCuaig-Johnston, who spent decades in some of the federal government's top scientific posts and served on the Canada-China Joint Committee on Science & Technology before joining the University of Ottawa, where she researches China's science and technology strategy.She said AI and robotics are two areas of great interest to the Chinese military.""They're really putting a big focus on artificial intelligence and developing lethal autonomous weapons. So that would be robotics in the field of war,"" she said.""They're looking for help from Canada in artificial intelligence, biotechnology, advanced materials, quantum computing, all areas that can help their military and help other aspects of their economy as well.""And what it means for Canadians is, if we're partnering with China on these areas, our R&D, government funded R&D often could be going directly to the Chinese military. And I've talked to scientists about that, including in artificial intelligence. And it's quite concerning that they often say, 'Well, I've been friends with these researchers for 20 years, they wouldn't do that kind of thing.'""But in China, it's required that researchers partner with the military.""The Chinese Embassy in Ottawa told CBC News there is nothing to fear from scientific collaboration with China.""China believes that international cooperation is an inevitable requirement for scientific and technological development, and is an unstoppable trend of the times as well. Countries should create favourable conditions for normal exchanges and cooperation between the educational and scientific communities and create a suitable atmosphere,"" said spokesman Du Xudong in an email.""The PLA has always been a staunch force for maintaining the world peace and stability. We firmly oppose the politicization of normal exchanges and cooperation on academic and scientific research and the demonization of the Chinese military.""McCuaig-Johnston said Waterloo and other universities have received guidance from Canada's security agencies and should be doing more to guard against rogue technology transfers to China — ""particularly when your university has been identified as one of the top ten in the world partnering with Chinese military institutions. We need to get ourselves out of this top 10 list.""In 2017, there were 84 co-publications between Canadian researchers and Chinese researchers with military technologies,"" she said. ""And this is just the tip of the iceberg, because those are the ones where there was collaboration that led to a publication. There's all kinds of other collaboration going on that hasn't yet led to publications.""Dean said researchers can only assume that anyone granted a visa to study in Canada has been vetted already. ""So that that assessment was already made by the government of Canada in allowing them to come in here. Same with our research visitors,"" she said.WATCH | Calls for Canada to block China from sensitive research:The National""Of course, with all the heat on the China file, there's been a strong interest in making sure that we have all the legal aspects of our agreements in place, with T's crossed and I's dotted. And of course we are looking at security and security risks.""But Dean said her role is to facilitate contacts, not to erect barriers.""If a vice president research starts interfering with individual collaborations to say, 'Yes, you may do this research, no, you may not do this research,' without some mechanism of providing due rationale to a researcher, then I think we'd be starting to walk down a path that would tread on the freedom of individuals to conduct research and also tread on due justice,"" she said.Richard Fadden headed CSIS from 2009 to 2013 and was the first director to go public with concerns about influence campaigns by the Chinese Communist Party. He triggered a furor in 2010 when he said that CSIS knew of prominent Canadian politicians under the influence of Beijing.Fadden said he disputes the claim that the agency he once headed hasn't provided guidance and advice to universities. He also said that if universities won't act on their own, the government should block off whole areas of research rather than trying to vet thousands of individuals.""I think we're a bit bonkers in that we don't really restrict the areas in which Chinese students can study,"" he said.While Fadden said that ""we mustn't go down the rabbit hole"" of suspecting every Chinese student coming to Canada of working for Chinese state security — and that it would be a mistake to consider China the only problem nation — he does view Beijing as the most active and aggressive state player in the acquisition of other countries' intellectual property and technical secrets.""I think there are probably ... ten or so areas of study that have national security implications,"" he said, citing the high value of optics research to maintaining NATO's technical edge over its rivals.""There are some areas where we should simply say, 'You can't study in those areas. You can't invest in those areas, you can't buy in those areas.' And for the life of me, I don't understand why with the Five Eyes or the United States or NATO … couldn't come up with [a] commonly accepted list of areas and say, 'We, as NATO, are not going to allow work in this area.'""Will the Chinese be annoyed? Absolutely. But they don't allow us to do any of this in their country. So, you know, reciprocity is an important principle of international relations.""Fadden said that if western countries act in unison to stop the bleeding of military technology to China, there will be less blowback for any individual nation.Right now, he said, the U.S. is actively hunting spies in a way that Canada is not.""We don't worry as much about national security as does the United States,"" he said. ""So I think, from that perspective, we're viewed as an easier target.""A spokesperson for CSIS, meanwhile, disputed the suggestion that the agency hasn't given universities enough guidance.""CSIS provides regular unclassified briefings to many stakeholders including universities so that they are fully aware of the threat environment around them,"" said John Townsend. ""These threats can include attempts of espionage to steal privileged information and research as well as the manipulation of students through foreign interference ...""Mary-Liz Power, spokesperson for Public Safety Minister Bill Blair, also said that the government had ""actively engaged"" universities and researchers through the Safeguarding Science Initiative, which ""provides workshops featuring experts from several federal departments and agencies, and equips participants with the base knowledge they need to better protect and secure their research and data.""McCuaig-Johnston said that while the government needs to take a more active role, ""it's still up to [Canadian universities] to be looking at where Chinese universities may be a problem.""There's a list of 160 Chinese universities and labs that are focused on defence purposes, and that list of 160 should be being given by each university to their researchers in natural sciences and engineering so that they can check themselves as to whether they're partnering with those institutions,"" she said. ""And if they are partnering, they should stop.""Dean said that the University of Waterloo is always open about its research and publishes it as widely as possible.""Pretty much everything that we do has to be disseminated in venues that are open to the general scientific community to utilize,"" she said. ""So even if we did it with Germany, it would still be available publicly to anybody in China to use because of that open, transparent research process.""But there's a difference between merely reading about research and taking part in it, said McCuaig-Johnston.""When you collaborate with China, the Chinese scientists and engineers can actually shape the research as it's being done and direct it as it's evolving …"" she said.""What China is doing is it's developing new technologies that wouldn't exist at all. It's force-feeding the military apparatus of China. And we don't want Canadian researchers or Canadian tax dollars to be going into that kind of R&D."""

He could not say when they would be rescheduled.""The writing was on the wall,"" MacLellan told reporters on a teleconference following a cabinet meeting.A hallmark of McNeil's time as premier has been efforts to strengthen ties between the province and China, something that's resulted in a massive expansion of exports, particularly seafood.A key goal of that effort has been the establishment of a direct commercial flight.MacLellan said the government had high hopes that the charter flights, which would go from Guangzhou to Halifax, would be a benefit to tourism development. Passengers would have toured parts of this province, along with New Brunswick and P.E.I.""That was a critical step forward in terms of our growth as a sector,"" he said.""It has a broad-reaching direct impact and certainly a psychological impact for us as we try to hold the tourism sector together.""MacLellan said officials in his department and with Tourism Nova Scotia have held out hope in broader terms for this year's tourism season, but he said it's clear things will be difficult. ""Unfortunately, hope is not a strategy,"" he said.The minister said his government continues to look for ways to help the tourism industry weather the effects of COVID-19.Officials have said the closed border between Canada and the United States, large uncertainty around air travel, and even the expected reluctance for many people to stray far from home this year all add up to a difficult scenario for operators.The CEO of Tourism Nova Scotia estimates the virus and its effects will cost the province at least $1 billion."

"Twitter removes 170,000 China-linked accounts spreading disinformation | CBC News",Twitter has removed accounts that it says are linked to the Chinese government and were pushing false information that is favourable to the country's Communist Party.,2020-06-12T20:10:25.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/twitter-china-removing-disinformation-1.5610073,"Twitter has removed a vast network of accounts that it says is linked to the Chinese government and was pushing false information favourable to the country's Communist Party. Beijing denied involvement Friday, and said the company should be taking down accounts smearing China instead.The U.S. social media company suspended 23,750 accounts that were posting pro-Beijing narratives, and another 150,000 accounts dedicated to retweeting and amplifying those messages.The network was engaged in ""a range of co-ordinated and manipulated activities"" in predominantly Chinese languages, including praise for China's response to the coronavirus pandemic and ""deceptive narratives"" about Hong Kong pro-democracy protests, Twitter said.The accounts also tweeted about two other topics: Taiwan and Guo Wengui, an exiled billionaire waging a campaign against China's President Xi Jinping and his administration.Most of the accounts had little to no followers and failed to get much attention. The accounts were suspended under Twitter's manipulation policies, which ban artificial amplification and suppression of information.Twitter and other social media services like Facebook and YouTube are blocked in China.""While the Chinese Communist Party won't allow the Chinese people to use Twitter, our analysis shows it is happy to use it to sow propaganda and disinformation internationally,"" said Fergus Hanson, director of the Australian Strategic Policy Institute's International Cyber Policy Centre, which worked with the company on the takedown.China has denied involvement.""It holds no water at all to equate China's response to the epidemic with disinformation,"" Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said at a daily news briefing in Beijing on Friday. She said she wasn't aware of Twitter's takedown and the reason behind it.""If Twitter wants to make a difference, it should shut down those accounts that have been organized and co-ordinated to attack and discredit China,"" she said, adding that China was the ""biggest victim of false information.""Twitter also removed more than 1,000 accounts linked to a Russian media website engaging in state-backed political propaganda in Russian, and a network of 7,340 fake or compromised accounts used for ""cheerleading"" the ruling party in Turkey.Turkey's presidential communications director, Fahrettin Altun, said allegations that the accounts were fake are ""untrue"" and called Twitter's move an attempt to smear Turkey's government and the ruling party.""The arbitrary act, hidden behind the smokescreen of transparency and freedom of expression, has demonstrated yet against that Twitter is no mere social media company but a propaganda machine with certain political and ideological inclinations,"" Altun said."

Vatican's China envoy urges church to get tough with Beijing,"The Vatican's top envoy for China says the time has come for the Holy See to get tough with Beijing and not compromise over religious freedom, saying relations are taking a ""worrisome slide.""",2009-06-17T00:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/vatican-s-china-envoy-urges-church-to-get-tough-with-beijing-1.835982,"The Vatican's top envoy for China says the time has come for the Holy See to get tough with Beijing and not compromise over religious freedom, saying relations are taking a ""worrisome slide.""Hong Kong Cardinal Joseph Zen also said the Vatican shouldn't give so much importance to re-establishing diplomatic relations with Beijing because such a move could trick people into thinking there was religious freedom in China when there isn't.And in an interview Tuesday with the Vatican-affiliated missionary news agency AsiaNews, Zen repeated his call for official bishops in China to ""not give in"" to pressure from the state-sanctioned church, saying they have to remain firm in their faith and loyalty to the Pope — even to the point of martyrdom.China forced its Roman Catholics to cut ties with the Vatican in 1951, shortly after the officially atheist Communist party took power. Worship is allowed only in state-backed churches, which recognize the Pope as a spiritual leader but appoint their own priests and bishops.Millions of Chinese, however, belong to unofficial congregations that are loyal to Rome. Underground priests and bishops have been harassed or arrested by Beijing authorities.Pope Benedict XVI has made improving often-tense relations with Beijing a priority of his papacy, and has sought to unify the country's 12 million faithful under his wing.But there has been little tangible evidence of progress in his four-year effort, and the Vatican recently denounced a new wave of arrests of underground priests and bishops, and accused Beijing of mounting obstacles to a dialogue with the Holy See.The Vatican insists that Benedict alone must appoint bishops; China says such papal authority interferes in its internal affairs. In recent years, the two sides have reached a compromise of sorts under which both Beijing and Rome agree on candidates.In 2007, Benedict sent a special letter to Catholics in China, praising the underground church, but also urging the faithful to reconcile with followers of the official church. Zen, an outspoken advocate of freedom of worship and a critic of Beijing, said that letter was supposed to have ushered in a new season of relations with Beijing but hasn't.""We've come to the point where it's not possible and just to accept compromise as we did before,"" he said. ""In these two years, there hasn't been a turn toward clarity. In fact, it seems to me that we're taking a worrisome slide along the slope of compromise.""Most worrisome, he said, was a planned assembly of official Chinese priests and bishops this year, which he said would be an ""insult to the Holy Father"" because it would ""completely ignore"" his letter.Liu Bainian, spokesman for the Catholic Patriotic Association of China, said Wednesday the date of the meeting had still not been decided. He declined to comment on Zen's other remarks, saying they were his personal comments.Zen also criticized the Vatican for not having reinforced the 2007 letter, noting that Chinese authorities have tried to block its distribution among mainland faithful.The Vatican has said it was ready ""at any time"" to switch its diplomatic relations from Taiwan to China. But Zen warned against moving too quickly.""Sometimes too much importance is placed on diplomatic relations, when these alone don't set things straight,"" AsiaNews quoted Zen as saying.""In fact, sometimes it could be misleading because it can give the false impression that religious freedom exists."""
Hong Kong pro-democracy activist reportedly among those detained after China intercepts boat | CBC News,"Chinese authorities have arrested at least 10 people, including a Hong Kong pro-democracy activist, after its coast guard intercepted a speedboat believed to be heading to Taiwan, media reports said Thursday.",2020-08-27T17:02:31.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/china-intercepts-boat-hong-kong-activists-1.5702148,"Chinese authorities have arrested at least 10 people, including a Hong Kong pro-democracy activist, after its coast guard intercepted a speedboat believed to be heading to Taiwan, media reports said Thursday.The reports, citing unnamed sources, said activist Andy Li was among those detained. Li had been arrested earlier this month with nine others on charges of collusion with foreign forces under a sweeping national security law imposed by Beijing and was out on bail.A social media post by China's coast guard said the arrests were made on Sunday when it intercepted the boat off the coast of the southern province of Guangdong. It said that two people surnamed Li and Tang were among those detained. It was not immediately clear what charges they're facing.""We are aware of such reports. For the time being, we do not have any information from the mainland-relevant authorities,"" Hong Kong police commissioner Chris Tang told a news conference Thursday.WATCH | Hong Kong police say they can't offer details about arrests:NewsTang said that they were actively seeking information about the incident.The people on board were believed to be fleeing to Taiwan, and at least one other person had previously been arrested on charges related to last year's anti-government protests, the South China Morning Post reported.Taiwan in July opened an office to help Hong Kongers seeking to emigrate to the self-ruled island, and received over 1,000 inquiries in its first month alone. It's a popular choice among protesters who have chosen to leave Hong Kong.The national security law, which took effect June 30, criminalizes subversion, secession, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces. Those found guilty could face a maximum punishment of life imprisonment.Beijing implemented the law after months of anti-government protests wracked the semi-autonomous city last year. Critics have said the legislation is a blow to the ""one country, two systems"" framework, which gives Hong Kong freedoms not found on mainland China."

China easing airline access amid conflict with Washington | CBC News,"Chinese regulators said Thursday more foreign airlines will be allowed to fly to China as anti-coronavirus controls ease, but it was unclear whether the change will defuse a fresh conflict with the Trump administration over air travel.",2020-06-04T07:04:41.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/china-airline-access-1.5597915,"Chinese regulators said Thursday more foreign airlines will be allowed to fly to China as anti-coronavirus controls ease, but it was unclear whether the change will defuse a fresh conflict with the Trump administration over air travel.The announcement came after Washington said Wednesday it would bar four Chinese airlines from the United States because Beijing was failing to allow United Airlines and Delta Air Lines to resume flights to China.Airlines that were flying to China when controls were imposed in March were allowed to keep making one flight per week. United and Delta had suspended their flights before that and asked permission to resume.Airlines that aren't on the March list can make one flight per week starting Monday, the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) said on its website.The announcement appeared to open the door to United and Delta, but CAAC gave no indication which carriers were affected. An employee who answered the phone at CAAC said she had no details. She would give only her surname, Yan.Asked what it heard from Chinese regulators about its status, United said in a statement: ""We look forward to resuming passenger service between the United States and China when the regulatory environment allows us to do so.""The dispute adds to U.S.-Chinese strains over trade, technology, Taiwan, human rights and the status of Hong Kong.All foreign carriers authorized to fly to China will be allowed to increase to two flights per week if they go three weeks with no passengers testing positive for the virus, CAAC said. It said a route will be suspended for one week if the number of passengers who test positive reaches five.Ahead of the Chinese announcement, the U.S. Transportation Department accused Beijing of violating a 1980 agreement on air travel. It said in response that Chinese carriers would be allowed the same number of flights as Beijing permitted for U.S. airlines.The department said U.S. President Donald Trump could put the order into effect before June 16. The department protested last month that Beijing was preventing U.S. airlines from competing fairly against Chinese carriers.The four airlines affected by the order are Air China, China Eastern Airlines, China Southern Airlines and Xiamen Airlines.The Chinese ministries of commerce and transportation didn't immediately respond to questions about how Beijing might react.Before the pandemic, there were about 325 passenger flights a week between the United States and China, including ones operated by United, Delta and American Airlines. While U.S. carriers stopped flying, Chinese airlines made 20 weekly flights in mid-February and 34 by mid-March.The Transportation Department said it objected to China's March limit, but Beijing responded last week that it was not violating the air-travel treaty because the same one-flight limit applies to Chinese airlines.United and Delta announced last month that they hoped to resume flights to China in June, as air travel has begun to recover recently. United wants to fly from San Francisco to Shanghai and Beijing and from Newark, New Jersey, to Shanghai. Delta seeks to resume flights via Seoul to Shanghai from Seattle and Detroit."

Jaishankar and China's Wang Yi met in the Russian capital on Thursday night and concurred that ""the current situation in the border areas is not in the interest of either side,"" according to the joint statement issued Friday.Since last week, the Asian giants have accused each other of sending soldiers into the rival's territory and firing warning shots for the first time in 45 years, threatening a full-scale military conflict.They did not set any any timeline for the disengagement of tens of thousands of troops in a standoff since May, but agreed that ""both sides shall abide by all the existing agreements and protocol on China-India boundary affairs, maintain peace and tranquility in the border areas and avoid any action that could escalate matters.""Earlier this week, Jaishankar described the current situation along the Line of Actual Control as ""very serious"" and said the state of the border cannot be separated from the state of the relationship.On Thursday, the two countries agreed that as the situation eases, they should expedite work to conclude ""new confidence-building measures to maintain and enhance peace and tranquility in the border areas.""In a separate statement, Wang said: ""China-India relations have once again come to a crossroads.""Wang ""outlined China's stern position on the situation in the border areas, emphasizing that the imperative is to immediately stop provocations such as firing and other dangerous actions that violate the commitments made by the two sides,"" the statement said.""It is also important to move back all personnel and equipment that have trespassed.

The latest standoff is over portions of a pristine landscape that boasts the world's highest landing strip and a glacier that feeds one of the largest irrigation systems in the world.Both sides accuse the other of provocative behaviour including crossing into each other's territory, and both have vowed to protect their territorial integrity.The two nations fought a border war in 1962 that spilled into Ladakh and ended in an uneasy truce. Since then, troops have guarded the undefined border area, occasionally brawling. They have agreed not to attack each other with firearms.Rival soldiers brawled in May and June with clubs, stones and their fists in a clash on a high ridge June 15, leaving 20 Indian soldiers dead. China reported no casualties."

On the Indian side, the area is known as Chushul, where the two countries' local military commanders have held several rounds of talks to defuse the tense standoff.After shots were fired, Chinese forces took ""necessary measures to stabilize and control the situation,"" the command said in the statement citing spokesperson Zhang Shuili. It demanded the Indian forces withdraw and investigate the move to open fire.However, India has rejected allegations of violating border agreements, and on Tuesday accused Chinese troops of firing in the air during a faceoff on their tense border.In a statement, the Indian army said Chinese soldiers tried to close in on a forward Indian position in the Ladakh sector, and when they were met by Indian troops, the Chinese soldiers fired a few rounds in the air.There was no word of casualties on either side.Late last month, India says its soldiers thwarted the Chinese military's moves ""to change the status quo"" in violation of a consensus reached in past efforts to settle the standoff. In turn, China also accused Indian troops of crossing established lines of control.The activity last month and on Monday were alleged to have occurred in Chushul area on the southern bank of Pangong Lake, a glacial lake divided by the de facto frontier and where the India-China faceoff began on its northern flank in early May.The standoff escalated to a medieval, nighttime clash June 15 that was the deadliest conflict in 45 years between the nuclear-armed rivals. According to Indian officials, Chinese troops atop a ridge at the mouth of the narrow Galwan Valley threw stones, punched and pushed Indian soldiers down the ridge at around 4,500 metres.India said 20 of its soldiers were killed, including a colonel. China did not report any casualties.The disputed and un-demarcated 3,500-kilometre border between India and China, referred to as the Line of Actual Control, stretches from the Ladakh region in the north to the Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh. According to China, the frontier is about 2,000 kilometres and claims entire Arunachal Pradesh as its territory.The Asia giants fought a border war in 1962 that also spilled into Ladakh and ended in an uneasy truce. The two countries have been trying to settle their border dispute since the early 1990s, without success.India unilaterally declared Ladakh a federal territory and separated it from disputed Kashmir in August 2019, ending its semi-autonomous status. The move further strained the relationship between New Delhi and Beijing, which raised the issue at international forums including the UN Security Council.In a symbolic move amid soaring tensions, India has banned scores of Chinese-owned apps, including TikTok, citing privacy concerns that it said pose a threat to India's sovereignty and security."

OPINION | Opinion | Why the democratic world needs unity to 'engage-and-constrain' China | CBC News,"As the UN flags a dismaying array of concerns about the erosion of rights and freedoms, Canada and other democracies need to demonstrate that our rules-based system best protects health and liberty, writes Colin Robertson.",2020-09-15T00:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/opinion/opinion-democracy-pandemic-united-nations-1.5723288,"This column is an opinion by Colin Robertson, a former diplomat and now vice-president and fellow at the Canadian Global Affairs Institute. For more information about CBC's Opinion section, please see the FAQ.On the International Day of Democracy, the United Nations is flagging a dismaying array of concerns about the erosion of rights and freedoms, issues that have been exacerbated by the pandemic. With democracy in retreat in many regions, its champions at the UN, in Canada and elsewhere need to demonstrate anew that protecting health and preserving liberties is done best under democratic institutions.For the fourteenth consecutive year, Freedom House reports a decline in global freedoms. The Economist Intelligence Unit's Democracy Index says democratic rights around the world are at their lowest ebb since the survey began in 2006. Only 22 countries including Canada, representing 5 per cent of the global population, qualify as ""full democracies,"" while more than a third live under authoritarianism.The Chinese model of authoritarianism works. It has lifted billions out of poverty. Under Chinese Communist Party rule, China is restored as a great, even pre-eminent, world power. It has managed the pandemic better than others. But a democracy it ain't. As for human rights — look how it treats Tibet, its Uighers, its dissidents, and now Hong Kong.We in the West assumed that economic liberalization went hand in hand with political liberalization. We were wrong, a reminder that diplomacy requires us to better understand different histories and cultures.Now we risk making another mistake in resurrecting the paradigm of the Cold War to address issues with China.""Decoupling from China,"" as President Trump has tweeted, is wrong-headed.It was not Ambassador Lighthizer’s fault (yesterday in Committee) in that perhaps I didn’t make myself clear, but the U.S. certainly does maintain a policy option, under various conditions, of a complete decoupling from China. Thank you!U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is closer to the mark when he argues the democracies need to negotiate with China on the basis of reciprocity and transparency.An even better approach, as former Australian diplomat Peter Varghese argues, is to ""engage and constrain."" We disagree on human rights, but surely we can work together on shared interests, like vaccines and climate mitigation.In his splendid, magisterial America in the World, Robert Zoellick notes that self-doubt is inherent to democracies. But as Ronald Reagan told British parliamentarians at Westminster in 1982, the ""mission"" of the democracies is to ""preserve freedom as well as peace,"" while advancing ""individual liberty, representative government, and the rule of law.""Advancing these ideals means deepening the ties among democracies. The G7 — still the top table of democracies — should bring in India, Indonesia, Korea and Australia and, from this base, work to effect global action on the economic recovery from COVID-19 within the G20, the premier forum for economic cooperation. Isolationism and nationalism will not stop the pandemic — a multilateral response can.It also means collective diplomatic effort to compete more effectively with China in international institutions and key regions like Africa.Reducing dependence on China's market and Chinese technology will oblige a collective research effort in critical areas like artificial intelligence and quantum computing. Infrastructure investments must establish resilient and dependable supply chains.We also need to link collective defence in the Indo-Pacific, the Atlantic and the Arctic, especially in preserving the vital sea-lanes that carry our commerce.Wars and catastrophes are catalysts for change. As World War II ended, a U.S.-led coalition created a rules-based international order. The UN and its alphabet soup of agencies oversaw geo-politics. The Bretton Woods twins — the IMF and World Bank — managed geo-economics. The western democracies created NATO to deter the Soviet Union. The G7 was born out of the oil shocks in the '70s. The G20 came of age after the Asian financial crisis, proving its worth in the 2008 financial collapse. But facing the pandemic, these institutions have not proved fit for purpose.So in this, the COVID moment, can Canada be a helpful fixer?We were engineers to the American architects during the post-war reconstruction, and then godfather to the G20. In helping to create the rules-based order, we introduced the principle of functionalism. This is the abiding legacy of Louis St. Laurent, Lester Pearson and others — internationalists by conviction, they were realists by experience. Canada was not a great world power, but in certain sectors — food and energy — we had vital interests and capacity. This merited a place at the table. With competence, investment and artful diplomacy we earned our seat in the UN's functional agencies and, albeit temporarily, joined the great powers on the Security Council.To play helpful fixer will require the traditional skills of quiet diplomacy, rather than the preachiness of late.It means finding the niches in which we do well, including running elections, policing and administering justice, and managing diversity. It means reinvesting in the non-governmental organizations (NGOs) that do these things, and staying the course.Canada's effectiveness also depends on a United States prepared to lead and champion the order it created. As we have seen these past four years, without U.S. leadership the system fails. The allies need to share the burden.COVID-19 has put the spotlight on democracies and our multilateral institutions. We must demonstrate that our rules-based system best protects health and liberty."

Trump's plan to 'decouple' from China will require a robot revolution: Don Pittis | CBC News,Trump’s latest plan to spurn China and bring manufacturing jobs home is no quick fix but it’s a step in the right direction as an “economic catastrophe” transforms North American jobs. But it will need to be well managed.,2020-09-09T08:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/trump-s-plan-to-decouple-from-china-will-require-a-robot-revolution-don-pittis-1.5716301,"As North America goes through its biggest recession and loss of jobs in decades, U.S. President Donald Trump is offering a job creation solution.In a Labour Day election address to the media, the Republican candidate declared that a move toward ""decoupling"" from China would transform the U.S. economy and bring manufacturing jobs home.""We will make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world and we'll end reliance on China once and for all,"" Trump said in a White House speech to reporters.Nice to see even robots follow the ""bend at the knees"" rule. <a href=""https://t.co/Ra9U93EMbl"">pic.twitter.com/Ra9U93EMbl</a>""I don't think it's wild,"" said Joel Blit, senior fellow at the Centre for International Governance and Innovation, an economist and engineer who teaches at Ontario's University of Waterloo.Fresh research by the Waterloo professor shows that what he calls in his paper published last month in Canadian Public Policy, ""the biggest human and economic catastrophe in recent history"" may have a positive outcome — if it is well managed.Essentially, what Blit's research shows is that in Canada, following the three recessions since the dawn of the computer age that he examined, some jobs disappeared, never to return.""We've seen a very large decrease in routine jobs, whereas non-routine jobs basically weren't hit at all,"" Blit said in a phone interview. He says that's not what used to happen before the 1980s, according to U.S. data, when both kinds of jobs were similarly affected by recessions.The non-routine jobs — jobs that required creativity or could not easily be automated — that were lost bounced back quickly after each recession ended. That was not so for the relatively routine jobs. Blit's research shows that once gone, they were gone for good.Besides automation, of course, as labour activists and anti-globalizationists have complained, many good factory jobs disappeared as U.S. manufacturers sought cheaper labour in places like China.When jobs disappeared, some traditional blue-collar workers were unable to find well-paying jobs to support their families, leading to what U.S. scholars have called ""deaths of despair."" But as rock-bottom unemployment rates before the coronavirus struck demonstrate, eventually the economy did put people back to work, and was beginning to push wages higher.When routine jobs disappeared many of those left unemployed went to non-routine jobs, some of them in sectors such as retail, warehousing or entertainment services that were difficult to automate.Blit's ominous projection is that in the current deep recession, when the loss of routine jobs happens again, many of those sectors such as retail and food services will go through the same process of automation because robots have gotten so much better. Not only that, but he expects COVID-19 will lead to even more job losses.""Added on top of the usual forces we see in recessions, this time around there is also a health incentive to automate,"" he said.The most obvious examples have been the growth in online shopping favouring companies like Shopify or Amazon, and food delivery services. But in manufacturing, human-to-human contact is being replaced by human-to-machine contact that blocks disease transmission, he said.Blit points to other examples, such as Walmart's cashierless store experiment, that, if it works, could save the company money and wipe out hundreds of thousands more routine jobs. Not only that, but the medical field itself, which has so far resisted automation, will be forced to discover new ways to eliminate routine tasks that involve face-to-face contact, thus increasing productivity. He foresees something similar happening in the education sector that until now has been resistant to automation.Those that fail to automate may find themselves losing out to others that have — what he calls the ""reallocation"" of market share, of capital and of workers to successful automators.For employees who don't find work with the winners, eventually the economy will create new jobs to put those people back to work. But if history repeats, the process of re-employment will take years, which is why Blit supports some sort of minimum income support guarantee from governments for what he fears will be a worse dislocation than in the past.However, he strongly objects to the extension of government wage subsidies for employers that he says will circumvent the incentive toward greater automation, which he says is essential to the success of the North American economy in a low-wage world.A stroll through almost any shop in the U.S. or Canada reading ""made in"" labels reveals just how big a job it would be to bring that production home. As Jia Wang, deputy director of the China Institute at the University of Alberta, once explained, low-wage Chinese manufacturing has become indispensable to North Americans.""For the U.S. it's the massive amount of consumer goods — the clothing, the shoes, the household electronics, the computers and the phones,"" she told CBC News in 2018.The latest trade figures from the U.S. census bureau show imports from China this year, while off their highs following trade squabbles and as the coronavirus disrupted shipments, still dwarf U.S. exports to China.With the threat of a growing trade war, China has rushed to learn how to make the high tech, high-value goods it buys from the west. But for the U.S. to make the low-value goods that North America imports from China is almost impossible, said Wang.Rich country labour costs are just too high for lower-income Americans to be able to afford the output if the goods were made in the United States.""If suddenly the price goes up by 50 per cent, can they still afford it? And that's the real danger,"" Wang told me.Whether Trump has a real plan to reinvigorate U.S. manufacturing or whether it is just short-term electioneering, Joel Blit believes a push for North American manufacturers to make better use of advances in robotics really could begin to bring production home.He calls the push for automation caused by recessions a ""silver lining."" But unless a robot revolution brings a bigger share of global manufacturing back to the U.S. and Canada, there is a danger that the job losses due to greater efficiency will merely make the lives of the poorest even harder.""It's going to be great because we're going to be a lot more productive, we're going to be richer as a country,"" said Blit. ""But I am concerned that the benefits are only going to go to a few.""Follow Don on Twitter @don_pittis"

Mushroom not main cause of mystery deaths in China: McMaster researcher,"Over the past 30 years, some 400 people in southwest China have died mysterious, sudden deaths. Many have concluded that they died from eating toxic mushrooms. Now a McMaster University researcher has proven that wrong.",2012-12-07T00:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/hamilton/news/mushroom-not-main-cause-of-mystery-deaths-in-china-mcmaster-researcher-1.1245237,"Over the past 35 years, some 400 people in southwestern China have died mysterious, sudden deaths. Many researchers have concluded that they died from eating a toxic mushroom.Now a McMaster University biologist has changed all that.Jianping Xu has spent the last four summers climbing mountains and slogging through forests in search of the Trogia venenata, a mushroom once suspected of causing fatal heart attacks with its high concentration of the metal barium.But after trekking up to 30 kilometres per day collecting samples for analysis, Xu has found that the mushroom may have been a minor factor in the deaths, but not the primary cause.Xu found that the barium concentration in the mushrooms is so low that it mirrors the level in common foods such as fresh poultry. In fact, a 150-pound person would have to eat at least 35 kg of the dried mushroom for it to be lethal, Xu said.That means we still don't know what caused Yunnan Sudden Unexplained Death (SUD) in 400 otherwise healthy Chinese citizens during the rainy seasons from June to August, he said.A 2010 article in the journal Science said the mushrooms were at fault, and that's been the common hypothesis.Now ""it is sort of back to the drawing board,"" Xu said, who published his findings in Applied and Environmental Biology.It wasn't easy work collecting samples for the study. Often led by local guides, Xu walked and climbed for hours a day collecting the fruiting bodies of mushrooms. One day, the trek was so strenuous that his companion was hospitalized.Xu thinks genetics have something to do with the deaths, which occurred in remote villages and often claimed female victims. SUD claimed as many as seven lives in some families, and as many as one-third of the residents of some villages.Because the victims were residents of remote villages, few researchers have actually seen someone die from SUD, Xu said.""The story I've heard is the person would be eating and talking, stand up and have a sudden cardiac arrest,"" he said. ""Most of them were otherwise young and healthy.""Barium can't be ruled out as a cause of death given that high levels were found in some of the victims. But the mushrooms were likely not the primary cause.Xu plans to continue analyzing mushrooms in the region to determine if any of them could have contributed to the deaths."

Mushroom not main cause of mystery deaths in China: McMaster researcher,"Over the past 30 years, some 400 people in southwest China have died mysterious, sudden deaths. Many have concluded that they died from eating toxic mushrooms. Now a McMaster University researcher has proven that wrong.",2012-12-07T00:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/hamilton/news/mushroom-not-main-cause-of-mystery-deaths-in-china-mcmaster-researcher-1.1245237,"Over the past 35 years, some 400 people in southwestern China have died mysterious, sudden deaths. Many researchers have concluded that they died from eating a toxic mushroom.Now a McMaster University biologist has changed all that.Jianping Xu has spent the last four summers climbing mountains and slogging through forests in search of the Trogia venenata, a mushroom once suspected of causing fatal heart attacks with its high concentration of the metal barium.But after trekking up to 30 kilometres per day collecting samples for analysis, Xu has found that the mushroom may have been a minor factor in the deaths, but not the primary cause.Xu found that the barium concentration in the mushrooms is so low that it mirrors the level in common foods such as fresh poultry. In fact, a 150-pound person would have to eat at least 35 kg of the dried mushroom for it to be lethal, Xu said.That means we still don't know what caused Yunnan Sudden Unexplained Death (SUD) in 400 otherwise healthy Chinese citizens during the rainy seasons from June to August, he said.A 2010 article in the journal Science said the mushrooms were at fault, and that's been the common hypothesis.Now ""it is sort of back to the drawing board,"" Xu said, who published his findings in Applied and Environmental Biology.It wasn't easy work collecting samples for the study. Often led by local guides, Xu walked and climbed for hours a day collecting the fruiting bodies of mushrooms. One day, the trek was so strenuous that his companion was hospitalized.Xu thinks genetics have something to do with the deaths, which occurred in remote villages and often claimed female victims. SUD claimed as many as seven lives in some families, and as many as one-third of the residents of some villages.Because the victims were residents of remote villages, few researchers have actually seen someone die from SUD, Xu said.""The story I've heard is the person would be eating and talking, stand up and have a sudden cardiac arrest,"" he said. ""Most of them were otherwise young and healthy.""Barium can't be ruled out as a cause of death given that high levels were found in some of the victims. But the mushrooms were likely not the primary cause.Xu plans to continue analyzing mushrooms in the region to determine if any of them could have contributed to the deaths."

Canadian COVID-19 clinical trial scrapped after China wouldn't ship potential vaccine | CBC News,A collaboration between a Chinese vaccine manufacturer and a Halifax research team to test a potential COVID-19 vaccine has been abandoned after China would not approve the vaccine candidate for export to Canada.,2020-08-26T22:00:24.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/canada-china-covid-19-vaccine-trial-plug-pulled-1.5701101,"A collaboration between a Chinese company and a Halifax research team aiming to carry out Canada's first clinical trials of a potential COVID-19 vaccine has been abandoned amid rising tensions between the two countries.The partnership between the National Research Council of Canada and CanSino Biologics was announced by the federal government in May.A team at the Canadian Centre for Vaccinology at Dalhousie University was supposed to work with CanSino to run the first Canadian clinical trials for a possible COVID-19 vaccine. CanSino's vaccine, called Ad5-nCoV, was already being run through human trials in China and has shown promising results.In May, Health Canada gave the go-ahead for the Canadian trials to begin, and the hope was that clinical trials in Halifax could begin within weeks.But in late July, The Canadian Press reported that the Canadian-Chinese partnership was on the rocks, saying China had held up shipments the company was supposed to send to the Halifax researchers by the end of May.In an emailed statement, the National Research Council (NRC) said the vaccine candidate had not been approved by Chinese customs to ship to Canada.The statement said CanSino's collaborators in the Chinese government — the Beijing Institute of Technology and the Ministry of Science and Technology, which had provided funding to CanSino — reviewed the agreement between the NRC and CanSino before it was signed.""Subsequent to signing, the government of China introduced process changes regarding shipping vaccines to other countries,"" the NRC said in its statement.""The process is not clear to the NRC, but CanSino does not have the authority to ship the vaccine at this time.""The NRC did not say what, if any, role the ongoing tensions between Canada and China played in this development.CBC News has reached out to CanSino, but did not get a response by the time of publication. However, company chairman and CEO Dr. Xuefeng Yu told The Globe and Mail, which first reported this story on Tuesday, that bureaucratic indecision was the reason behind the shipping delays, and now the time to do the trials had ""already passed.""Yu told the newspaper that some divisions of the Chinese government were not clear on whether the vaccine should ""go to global trials or how to handle it."" Scott Halperin, the director of the Canadian Centre for Vaccinology, said it was disappointing to not be able to work with CanSino.""We were ready to start the study, had all the approvals back in June, but the company had been trying to ship us the vaccine but had not been permitted to do so,"" he said.""No matter what they tried, they were not able to get approvals to ship the vaccine.""Based on the amount of time that's gone by, Halperin said the study has become less relevant. ""At this point, CanSino's already ready to go into Phase 3 studies,"" he said. ""So this study, which was going to provide some more information, I think it's past its best-before date.""He said CanSino's vaccine is one of the vaccines that's furthest along worldwide in terms of its approval process, so it could have potentially been one of the first vaccines available to Canadians if all the studies continued to look good.Halperin said there are always risks in collaborating with other countries, which is why Canada has been pushing to make sure there will be Canadian-manufactured vaccines available.""There are other vaccines in the pipeline, and there will be plenty of other studies that are [being] done with other vaccines that will hopefully also look good.""MORE TOP STORIES"

The China Connection,How the Saskatchewan government partnered with a company linked to a businessman who was wanted by China for fraud.,2017-05-24T02:11:47.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news2/interactives/china-connection,"This story has been updated.Saskatchewanâs Brightenview Development International Inc. has always had an oversized view of itself. For years its website proclaimed it is âone of the fastest growing companies in Canada.â Thatâs despite the fact Brightenview hasnât yet built any of its promised projects. In 2013, it said it would construct a wholesale megamall in the 600-person town of Dundurn, Sask., south of Saskatoon. The concept: Chinese entrepreneurs would buy one of 350 units in the 300,000-square-foot mall, immigrate to Canada and sell their wares across North America. The Dundurn International Exhibition Centre was supposed to open in 2015. It hasnât. In 2014, Brightenview announced a similar project in Chatham-Kent, Ont. The Global Development Centre was to open in 2016. The project now appears dead.

(The Chatham Voice)Earlier this month, Brightenview broke ground on yet another version of this megamall concept â the Global Trade and Exhibition Centre: A $45-million wholesale mall in Regina at the Global Transportation Hub.

That investigation has found an immigration company run by a man who was wanted by the Chinese government for fraud. That company, which is closely affiliated with Brightenview, has shattered dreams and torn apart families.

(CBC News)On Sept. 26, 2014, Brightenview's vice-president of government relations, Lorne Nystrom (second from right), and CEO Joe Zhou (far right) broke ground on a new project with politicians from Chatham-Kent, Ont. (The Chatham Voice)A sign announcing the Global Trade and Exhibition Centre has been installed at the Global Transportation Hub in Regina. (CBC News)Brad Wall spoke to Chinese entrepreneurs in Beijing last fall. (Brightenvantage)Last fall, Saskatchewan Premier Brad Wall was in Beijing, speaking to a crowd of hundreds of Chinese entrepreneurs, inviting them âto explore one of our most significant investment opportunities: the Global Transportation Hub.â  The Sept. 24, 2016, event was organized by the government-owned GTH (an inland port west of Regina) and Chinese officials.   Officials from Brightenview were also in attendance. The companyâs new project at the GTH was the investment opportunity receiving much of the spotlight. The first phase of Brightenviewâs Global Trade and Exhibition Centre (GTEC) is slated to house up to 300 vendors owned by Chinese business people.

      Wall told the crowd âfor Chinese industries seeking access to North American markets, the GTH offers the right location, the right team and the right programs to foster business growth.â  
        Brightenview's rendering of the Global Transportation Hub. (Brightenview)
      In her presentation, the GTHâs vice-president of business development, Rhonda Ekstrom, said Brightenviewâs GTEC project is an âexcellent business modelâ that âcombines the strength of the GTH with a powerful business platform that reduces the risk of doing business in North America.â   This event was yet another sign of a close relationship that has developed between Brightenview and the provincial government since the company signed a land sale agreement with the GTH on Feb. 3, 2016.   That was the same day CBCâs iTeam broke the story of the GTH land deal scandal: How two politically well-connected business people made $11 million on a series of transactions that saw 204 acres of land wind up in taxpayers' hands at two to three times more than the appraised value.  
        CBC's Geoff Leo explains the essentials of the GTH land deal controversy.
      Also on that February day, the GTH and Brightenview signed a âco-operation agreement.â A letter from then-GTH minister Bill Boyd to GTH CEO Bryan Richards spelled out the nature of the new relationship.  âGTH is the lead agency empowered by government to work with Brightenview on the proposed projects,â Boyd wrote. âPlease engage the relevant resources within government and any external agencies to assist as necessary.â  That agreement formalized a relationship between the Saskatchewan government and a company founded, and still connected to, a man who has been wanted by the Chinese government for loan fraud: Mike (Chuan) Niu.  CBCâs iTeam has obtained Interpol documents showing Niu and his partner Jessie (Yilin) Zhan were wanted by the Chinese government, accused of loan fraud. The arrest notices were issued as part of a Chinese government anti-corruption campaign.  In this country, Niu and Zhan have run the Toronto-based Canmax group of companies, which has been closely connected to Brightenview. Canmax promised to help Chinese people immigrate to Saskatchewan.   However, in many cases, the company has failed to deliver and that has resulted in about 20 lawsuits filed by people who say Canmax ripped them off.  Brightenview and government closely co-operating Immigration and deep co-operation from the Saskatchewan government are core to Brightenviewâs GTEC plan.   To work, it will need the government to approve the immigration applications of hundreds of Chinese business people in relatively short order through the entrepreneurial category of the provinceâs immigrant nominee program.   Signs of that close co-operation abound.  Ever since the GTH land deal story broke, the government has regularly pointed to the Brightenview agreement as proof that all is well at the inland port, despite the provincial auditorâs critical report about the land deal and an ongoing RCMP investigation into the scandal.  Earlier this month, when Saskatchewan Minister of the Economy Jeremy Harrison was asked critical questions about the land deal in the legislature, he pivoted to Brightenview.  âWeâre looking forward to that construction beginning, Mr. Speaker, and we look forward to a new business out at the GTH,â said Harrison.  Brightenview says, when complete, the GTEC will mean 200 jobs for the province and $200 million in corporate investment.   Harrison also showed his support by attending and speaking at the May 4, 2017, ribbon-cutting ceremony for Brightenviewâs GTEC project.   PCL Construction broke ground on Phase 1 of the project May 1, 2017. Brightenview says it will be complete by February 2018.   
        Brightenview's $45-million project breaks ground at the Global Transportation Hub, CBC's Adam Hunter reports.
      âWeâve worked closely with the company,â Harrison told the media. âWeâre confident that the project will move forward.â  But the relationship between Brightenview and the Saskatchewan government has left some people who were hurt by Canmax shaking their heads.   The Toronto businessman said Canmax was supposed to help his sister immigrate to Canada. Instead, it cost his family thousands of dollars and caused years of grief.   Do you know what type of company you supporting right now?  Xie has learned Canmax and Brightenview share a lot in common:   - Brightenview was founded by: Niu and Joe (Yongbo) Zhou. Both men are also founding directors of Canmax companies.
- Canmax has been involved in promoting Brightenviewâs projects in China. 
- Canmax has been a key Brightenview partner, with the agency offering settlement services to new immigrants the company brings in.
- Advertisements for Brightenview employees have been posted on the Canmaxgroup.com website.  In fact, when the Dundurn megamall, Brightenviewâs first Saskatchewan project, was initially pitched by Zhou to the Rural Municipality of Dundurn, he was there as a representative of Canmax. The July 10, 2012, RM council minutes read âthat council gives support in principle to Canmax Investment Group Inc. on the proposal of an International Exhibition Centre.â  When asked about the Canmax-Brightenview connection, Brightenviewâs vice-president of government relations, Lorne Nystrom, said âthereâs no relationship now with Canmax at all.â  Nystrom, whoâs a former MP with the federal NDP and a former leadership candidate for the party, couldnât say precisely when that relationship was severed or why.   Until a few weeks ago, Brightenviewâs website said Canmax was the company that would provide settlement services. The website has also referred to Canmax as one of its corporate partners.   However, since CBC started interviewing Canmax officials, all mention of the company was scrubbed from Brightenviewâs website.   âThe website is in the process of being changed,â said Nystrom. âI think some stuff has been taken down because it was old and no longer relevant to be on there.â   Nystrom also acknowledged that Canmaxâs China office was involved in selling Brightenviewâs Dundurn project to Chinese investors.   However, Nystrom insisted all of that is in the past.  âWe donât need Canmax,â said Nystrom. âWe have a lot of in-house ability in our company and we can reach out to other people on an as-needed basis.â  In an email Zhou also told CBC, âThere is no active business relationship between Canmax and Brightenview.â  However, Xie wonders if the government did its homework on Brightenviewâs history before partnering with the company.   He said if he could talk to Wall, âI would ask: âDo you know what type of company you supporting right now?ââ  In 2011, Xie hired Canmax. He paid the company $25,000 to help his sister immigrate to Canada through the Saskatchewan Immigrant Nominee Program.   Canmax explained to Xie that, at the time, Saskatchewan was the easiest place in the country to immigrate to.   At first, Xie was impressed. Within a couple of months, Canmax secured the required letter offering his sister a job.   Xie asked for a copy but the company refused. It was confidential, he was told. He thought that was odd, but he wasnât worried.  The contract sucks. All of the contracts suck. We admit that.  By the fall of 2014 â three years after hiring Canmax â Xieâs sister was still in China and they both were getting worried.  So, they asked for a refund. The contract stipulated a refund was possible if the company was unable to help a client immigrate to Canada. However, the contract didnât have a timeline related to when a refund could be granted, which left the whole process ambiguous.   Canmaxâs paralegal, James Bush, acknowledged the contract is âhorrible.â   âThe contract sucks. All of the contracts suck. We admit that,â said Bush.  Canmax said Xie would have to sign another contract, this time with an end date. If his sister wasnât in Canada by May 2015, Xie would get the money back.   By August 2015, he still hadnât heard a thing. He contacted Canmax and he said he was told the company had run out of money. There would be no refund.   âI realized something really wrong with Canmax,â Xie said.  A 'fake' company Xie contacted the Saskatchewan government and asked for all of the documents on his file.   He was stunned to learn his sisterâs case had been rejected by the government in 2013 â a fact Canmax failed to share with him.   He hired a private detective to look into the case and review the file.   The detective had a more detailed look at the job offer Xie's sister supposedly received through Canmax.  He discovered the address doesnât exist and the business name is fabricated.   âItâs a fake company,â Xie said. âThatâs why my sister get refused, because this job letter is a fake job letter. They not be able to verify this job letter.â  
        Richard Xie shows CBC's Geoff Leo what he discovered about his sister's job letter.
      It turns out problems with Canmax job offers were not uncommon.   In a 2014 email, Meg Brookes, a program integrity officer with Saskatchewan's Ministry of the Economy, asked the office of the Consulate General of Canada to put a Canmax file on hold âto determine if the job offer is still valid.â  In a follow-up email, Brookes wrote, âI have a whole bunch more for you to check please and place on hold. All are the same representative and I believe the job offers to be invalid.â   When CBC asked James Bush about the possibility that Canmax submitted fake job offers on behalf of clients, he explained if the letters were fake they would have been provided to Canmax by a third party.  âSo a rogue company creates phony job letters to get a referral fee from the head office of Canmax,â he posited. âYouâre [CBC] not saying who the letters were from or where they came from. You used a term thatâs too general. You used the term âCanmax.â Who specifically gave a job offer that was false to one of these people?â  Xie has filed a complaint with police and is planning to file a lawsuit against Canmax.  Heâs frustrated he had to discover this problem himself, when the government appears to have known.   âThey should have noticed that something goes wrong with this Canmax,â Xie said. âIf there are so many cases by Canmax that are rejected they should have noticed something.  âWhy donât they take some action? At least inform my sister, the applicant. But they didnât do anything.â  Examples of lawsuits against Canmax companies. (CBC News)Canmax has faced many complaints About 20 other people have already filed suits against Canmax companies. They follow the same basic pattern as Xieâs case.  - Plantiffs paid large deposits to a Canmax company on the companyâs promise it would help their relatives immigrate to Canada through the Saskatchewan Immigrant Nominee Program. 
- After long delays, the plaintiffs requested a refund, as spelled out in their contract.
- The Canmax firm failed to refund all of their money.  In its statements of defence, Canmax has routinely denied it has done anything wrong. It also insists that itâs the plaintiffs who have âunilaterally abrogatedâ their contractual obligations and therefore âany losses suffered by the Plaintiff are the fault solely of the Plaintiff.â   Some plaintiffs have won judgements, some have arrived at settlements, while others have been plodding through the courts for years.   Jonathan Fon, a Toronto-based paralegal, won a $10,000 lawsuit against Canmax earlier this year after fighting with the company in court for 2 Â½ years.   He said the delays seem to be part of the plan.   âTo me itâs really strategically playing; itâs not really they want to solve the problem,â Fon said. âThe settlement process was actually postponed, postponed, postponed, then the plaintiff may be tired and disgusted and theyâll want to give up.  âThey [Canmax] say the beautiful words but they never done any act. So thatâs their strategy.â   The Toronto nurse gave Canmax $60,000 to help her nephew and younger sister come to Saskatchewan from China through the provinceâs immigrant nominee program in 2012.  Just like Xie, she has faced long delays and has been promised refunds that have never arrived.  She said she would visit the Canmax office every week asking for answers. Eventually, a Canmax employee pushed back.  Li said the employee âvery rude talk to me and say, âYou are not welcome to come to our office anymore.â And he said, âWhy you come here? Whatâs your reason?â I said, âMy moneyâs in your company. We have an agreement.â He said, âThatâs your problem, not our problem.ââ  In a last ditch effort, she decided to stake out the front office to wait for the boss: Mike Niu.  The company called police and Li was kicked off the property.  How about if his mother and his father knows what he is doing? They are proud of him?  Since then, she has been fighting for her money in court.  She said the worst thing is some of her family, who are still in China, think she took the money for herself.  âMy oldest sister involved in this case says I take her son's money,â said Li. âAnd my mother heard this news and lost the sense to eat, to survive.â  In September 2015, her mother passed away after failing to eat for a few weeks.  
        Sophia Li speaks to CBC's Geoff Leo about her mother's death.
      Li said she will keep fighting because this isn't just about the money.  âIt's my honour.â  She said her experience with Canmax has ruined her life and she would like to ask Niu how he can live with himself.  âSo you never care how many people the life changed because of you and how many relatives the relationship is broken because of you?â said Li.  âHow about if his mother and his father knows what he is doing? They are proud of him?â  Niu is elusive. It's difficult to find someone who has seen him or knows much about him.  Even James Bush, who regularly represents Niu in court, said he has never met the man.  âMike has never attended at court on any hearing,â said Bush. âI have never spoken to him. And Iâve never directly had any communication with him in writing.â  Perhaps his elusiveness could be explained by a news story that broke in the Chinese press in 2015.  In April of that year, the Chinese government announced the results of an anti-corruption initiative called âFox Hunt 2014.â According to online news articles, the ministry of public security in mainland China was trying to track down what it called corrupt officials accused of economic crimes, who had fled the country.  The government published the names, photos and details of hundreds of people through Interpol. Several media outlets published the entire list. The list features more than 400 people for whom China has issued a âRed Notice.â According to Interpolâs website, âRed Notices are issued for individuals sought for prosecution or to serve a sentence. When the individual is sought for prosecution it means they are suspected of committing a crime but have not yet been prosecuted and so should be considered innocent until proven guilty.â  Niu and his partner, Zhan, were on that list, wanted by China for loan fraud.  According to corporate records, Zhan is the founder of Brightenvantage, the marketing arm of Brightenview.  Roger Tsai, Canmaxâs director of legal affairs, says Zhan is also the current âbossâ of Canmax.  In addition, Tsai also confirmed Niu and Zhan are a couple and have children together.  The names and dates of birth on the Interpol documents match the information about Niu and Zhan CBC has obtained elsewhere. Neither of them have responded to CBCâs requests for an interview.  Sometime in 2016, the names of Niu and Zhan and many of the other alleged corrupt officials were removed from Interpolâs public website. Interpol won't answer any questions about that. Neither will the Chinese consulate in Ottawa or Chinese police.  A few months after that Interpol story broke, Niuâs name was removed as director from all Canmax public records. In court, Canmaxâs director of legal affairs testified he didnât know why.  Niuâs dealings in Canada In 2005, Niu established his first immigration business, Winners Immigration Consulting Inc.   Since that time, he has started and operated a series of similar companies, many of which offered to assist people from China to immigrate to Canada.

Cheng said he had his own immigration consulting practice. He said with Winners, he was a silent director, though from time to time he would sign immigration documents for Winners cases because he's authorized to as a registered immigration consultant.  Cheng said he offered to help Niu and not charge for the service.   âI thought that we were friends and from the beginning Winners didnât make money. So, I said, 'OK, you do the business. If you need my help, Iâll help you to do some cases.ââ  But he said he started to notice Winners sometimes wasnât following the ICCRC rules.   âMaybe some cases I didnât sign; they submitted, using my name,â Cheng said. âI was not happy with all those kinds of things, I told him.â  A timeline of Mike Niu's companies.A timeline of Mike Niu's companies.A timeline of Mike Niu's companies.A timeline of Mike Niu's companies.A timeline of Mike Niu's companies.A timeline of Mike Niu's companies.A timeline of Mike Niu's companies.A timeline of Mike Niu's companies.A timeline of Mike Niu's companies.Toronto Star targets Winners In June 2007, Winners caught the attention of investigative reporters at the Toronto Star.  According to the story, an employee of Niu spoke with a Toronto Star reporter posing as a potential client.   The story says âafter hearing his visitorâs visa is due to expire in a month, [the employee] immediately suggests a refugee claim, even though the reporter hasnât mentioned persecution or hardship in China. Success is nearly guaranteed, she says; only two refugee claims filed by her office have ever failed and ânot because of us.ââ  Eventually Cheng got drawn into the story after Niu failed to respond to the Starâs follow-up questions.   The story quotes Cheng as saying, âI need to investigate further. If thatâs true that they told you to file a refugee claim when there isnât a reason, thatâs wrong.â  Cheng told CBC this sort of thing made him increasingly uncomfortable.   Winners slammed by complaints and lawsuits According to Cheng, he eventually told Niu he wanted to disassociate from the company.  Cheng said he never got paid for any of the work he did for Winners.   But the work has had a lasting effect on his career. He said three complaints have been filed with ICCRC related to his work at Winners. He has also been named as a defendant in a lawsuit along with Winners, Niu and Canmax.  In July 2016, Cheng was publicly reprimanded by the ICCRC for his work in one of those cases. The regulator found Cheng had signed blank documents for the Saskatchewan Immigrant Nominee Program.   âThe Member never met the complainant or provided any consulting services to the complainant,â the investigation found. It said Cheng had âin effect delegated or licensed his ICCRC membership to a third party.â It found he did not do this for dishonest reasons and wasnât paid for the service.   When he left the company in 2011, Cheng urged Niu to shut it down.   Niu did get rid of Winners â by turning it into Canmax. A court judgement spells out how that happened.   In 2009, Yu Qiao hired Winners to help her sister immigrate to Canada. A court judgement, Yu Qiao vs. Winners, says Niu was Qiaoâs main contact at Winners.   According to the judgement Qiao âsaid that Mike [Niu] made many confident promisesâ about how Saskatchewanâs program was a good and fast way to get into Canada.   One day, instead of meeting Niu at the Winners office, Qiao was directed to the offices of Canmax.   âMike advised Qiao that Winners was expanding and that Winners and Canmax were the same company,â the judgement says.  Despite the new name, the same problems occurred.  The judge concluded, âit is not clear that either of the corporate defendants [Winners or Canmax] did anything to assist [Qiaoâs] sisterâ and awarded $20,000 to Qiao.  Canmax's decline Itâs the Canmax companies that have faced the greatest number of lawsuits. CBC has identified about 20 actions against the company.   Canmaxâs director of legal affairs, Roger Tsai, told CBC that at its peak (in 2011 and 2012) Canmax was processing 100-150 applications a year for the Saskatchewan Immigrant Nominee Program. At that time, it had 70-80 employees.

      Since Saskatchewanâs immigration program rules tightened in 2013, Canmaxâs Saskatchewan business has all but dried up.   However, according to a 2015 email obtained through court records, in that year the company still had 400 active files and many of those clients were requesting refunds.   The company is now down to 10 employees, including the director of legal affairs.   Tsai said even though itâs a small company, his job is necessary because of all of the lawsuits.   Though Niuâs partner, Jessie Zhan, continues to run Canmax, Tsai said he hasnât seen or heard from Niu since he was removed as director in 2015.   Even James Bush said he wouldnât know where to start looking.  Brightenview CEO Joe Zhou (Brightenvantage).In August 2012, Niu founded Brightenview with his Canmax colleague Joe Zhou, who became its CEO and public face.  Zhou was also the founding director of two of the Canmax group of companies: Canmax Fortune Management Inc. and Canmax Financial Insurance Ltd.  While Niu and his companies have been sued, Zhou and his two Canmax companies have not. In a written statement, Zhou said those companies were âclosed soon after I became CEO with Brightenview,â though he acknowledges, âI have yet to deal with the closure of the companies from the registry.â   In early 2013, Zhou made Brightenviewâs first big announcement about what has come to be called the Dundurn megamall.   Brightenview said the project would be completed by 2015 and it expected that hundreds of Chinese entrepreneurs would flood into Saskatchewan.

      Then-Saskatchewan labour minister Don Morgan attended the event and, according to the Saskatoon StarPhoenix newspaper, was enthusiastic.  âWe want to make sure it has every opportunity to succeed and weâll do everything we can,â Morgan said.   Another StarPhoenix article, published on April 1, 2013, quoted Zhou as saying many of the megamallâs 350 suites had already been âspoken for.â  A Brightenview document obtained by CBC shows the company was charging between $450,000 and $1.1 million dollars for the units.   Immediately after signing a purchase contract, the Chinese entrepreneur is required to pay a 50 per cent deposit, according to a flow chart of the purchase process, also obtained by CBC.  CBC asked Nystrom how many people had paid deposits to Brightenview so far.  âThatâs all private transactional stuff. If even I wanted to, I couldnât divulge any of that stuff,â he said.   CBC asked Nystrom what the company says to customers who paid deposits back in 2013 on the now-stalled Dundurn project.   He said that project isnât dead, but the megamall at the GTH is the top priority now.  Whoâs running Brightenview? Since 2013, the Global Transportation Hub and Brightenview had been discussing the possibility of working together. The two organizations signed a confidentiality agreement that year.   Throughout those discussions, and up to the signing of the agreements on Feb. 3, 2016, Niu was one of two directors of the company, according to Saskatchewanâs corporate registry.   In a written statement, Zhou told CBC Niu was legally removed on May 15, 2015. But that is contradicted by the document he signed and filed with the registry, which says Niu ceased to be a director of the corporation on Feb. 3, 2016.  On that day Niu was replaced by a man named Hua Ma. He became a director and owner of 90 per cent of the companyâs shares.   CBC asked Nystrom about Maâs background. He would only say heâs a businessman living in Toronto.   âItâs the companyâs business,â Nystrom said.  Nystrom had the same response when asked why Niu was removed as director immediately after signing such a significant deal.   In its corporate records, Brightenview provided Maâs Toronto address. A search of property records shows that address is owned by Zhan, Niuâs partner.  CBC News asked GTH officials if they had been made aware of Maâs new interest and role in the company.   A spokesperson responded by email, saying, âThe GTH works directly with Joe Zhou, Brightenviewâs chief executive officer â¦ Brightenview has been operating in good standing as a registered Saskatchewan corporation since 2012.â The spokesperson added that this is a private business matter.  Brightenview is the parent company and Brightenvantage is a subsidiary, working on marketing the project in Canada and China. It has offices in Saskatchewan, Vancouver and China.  Brightenvantage was founded by Zhan in March 2012. In 2014, Nystrom became a director of the company.  But just last month, Zhanâs name was removed from the corporate record. Nystrom said it was a ârestructuring.â  Iâm not even sure whoâs running it in Vancouver.  CBC asked Nystrom who is running Brightenvantageâs Vancouver office, which is doing most of the companyâs Canadian business. Though heâs a director of the company, he couldnât say.  âIn Vancouver â oh, God â Iâm not even sure. Iâm not even sure whoâs running it in Vancouver,â Nystrom replied.  CBC spoke to a receptionist at the Vancouver Brightenvantage office and she confirmed Niu is the boss. Two former Brightenvantage employees confirmed the same thing.  CBC asked Nystrom what role Niu plays in the company. Initially, he said Niu had no current role. Then, he conceded perhaps he might.  âWhether heâs doing some stuff in the office off and on, I do not know,â said Nystrom.  When CBC pointed out that Brightenvantageâs Vancouver receptionist had confirmed Niu works in the office and is the boss, Nystrom said, âI would dispute that.â  âShe just started very recently. And I donât think she has been there long enough to know what the structure is.â  After Nystromâs denial, CBC called the Brightenvantage office in Vancouver again and asked the receptionist if she could leave a message for Niu, asking him to call CBC. She said she would pass that message on to Niuâs assistants.  CBC also pointed out to Nystrom that in August 2016, months after Niu was removed as director of Brightenview, he registered a website called TheGTEC.com using Brightenviewâs email and phone number as his contact information.  Nystrom said thatâs not his area. He suggested Zhou would know more about that and he offered CBC a sit-down interview with Brightenviewâs CEO.  Later, Zhou declined an interview with CBC. Instead, he sent a email that didnât address many of the questions raised in the interview with Nystrom.  However, he did say everything Brightenview does is above board.  âI simply wish to remind you of the values, such as integrity, that we all hold dearly when it comes to personal, business and client information and privacy.â  A ribbon-cutting ceremony was held for the GTEC project in Regina in May 2017. (CBC News)For the past year and a half, CBC has been attempting to learn more about the relationship between the government of Saskatchewan and Brightenview. It filed a series of freedom of information requests to the GTH for documents related to Brightenview and this agreement.   While hundreds of pages have been provided, the GTH withheld dozens of documents, including the land sale agreement, the co-operation agreement and the confidentiality agreement.  CBC filed complaints with Saskatchewanâs Information and Privacy Commissioner about these withheld documents.  While he concluded that many of them could justifiably remain private, the commissioner recommended the GTH release 50 documents, including the land sale agreement and a confidentiality agreement.   - First review report.
- Second review report.
- Third review report. The GTH has refused to follow that recommendation.   Without access to the land sale contract and the co-operation agreement with Brightenview, it remains unclear precisely what the government committed to and how deeply connected taxpayers are to this company and its plans.   Government didnât dig deep enough, says Xie CBC has presented the provincial government with many of the key facts it has uncovered in this story and asked if, during its due diligence process, officials also came across these facts.  In an email, the Premierâs Office wrote, âwe wonât speak to specific assertions and innuendo about any specific company but we welcome the investment Brightenview has made in our province and look forward to their continued investment.â  The Premierâs Office said the GTH always conducts extensive research, meets with the client, checks government records, scans publicly available sources, and verifies the companyâs reputation.  âFor companies in China, the GTH works with the Saskatchewan trade office in Shanghai to complete the due diligence with local sources, applying the same process,â the email says.  So many people lost the money.  But Xie worries the government didnât dig deep enough.  âHow much do you know about Mike Niu? Do you know what he did before? How much money we lost from his different kinds of companies?â Xie asked.  âSo many people lost the money.â  Story editing and Shorthand design by Natascia Lypny. Update:On September 5, 2018, a judge ruled against Richard Xie in his court case with Canmax. The judge found
	that Xie filed the claim in his own name but in reality, the action was filed on behalf of his sister who was the
	one who actually had a contract with Canmax. As a result, the claim was dismissed because Xie ""has no standing to
	sue."" On January 14, 2019, following a court hearing, a judge found in favour of Sophia Li. The court
	ordered Canmax to pay $25,000 plus costs of $3,750. Recently, Joe Zhou, speaking on behalf of Canmax, defended the integrity of the company. He said
	Canmax had processed hundreds of immigration applications and yet there were only a handful of lawsuits. He said
	while the company itself has appeared to be essentially defunct, it has continued to maintain its legal unit to deal
	with the legal actions. Zhou said if Canmax was an illegitimate or dishonest company, the easiest approach would
	have been to simply go bankrupt. He said the fact that the company is continuing with the court processes shows it
	is attempting to be responsible. At the time of this report, CBC was unable to determine precisely what circumstances, and if an actual
	fraud, led to Mike Niu and Yilin Zhan being placed on the Interpol Red Notice list in 2014. That still remains
	unclear. At the time of publication, CBC pointed out that the couple had been removed from the public list. The
	circumstances weren't clear then and remain unclear to this day, why or when they were removed from the list. Photos

Hong Kong begins China-led mass-testing for coronavirus amid public doubts | CBC News,Hong Kong has tested thousands of people for coronavirus at the start of a mass-testing effort that's become another political flashpoint in the semi-autonomous Chinese territory.,2020-09-01T14:09:03.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/hong-kong-china-mass-testing-coronavirus-1.5707486,"Hong Kong tested thousands of people for coronavirus Tuesday at the start of a mass-testing effort that's become another political flashpoint in the semi-autonomous Chinese territory.Volunteers stood in lines at some of the more than 100 testing centres, though many residents are distrustful over the resources and staff being provided by China's central government, and some have expressed fear their DNA could be collected.The Hong Kong government has dismissed such concerns, and leader Carrie Lam urged the public to see the program in a fair and objective light and appealed to critics to stop discouraging people from being tested since participation was crucial to the program's success.Priscilla Pun, a sales manager, got tested to give herself peace of mind.""I don't see any reason not to do it, and this way I can let my family in Canada know that I am safe,"" said Pun, who was tested at a centre in the eastern Quarry Bay neighbourhood.Others, such as Giselle Ming, said that she decided to take part to support the Hong Kong government's initiative even though she was not worried that she might be a carrier of the coronavirus.""In this bad situation of the coronavirus, I hope I can do something to help the society,"" she said.Lam said at her weekly news conference that more than 10,000 people, including most of Hong Kong's government ministers, had been tested by Tuesday morning.""This large-scale universal community testing program is beneficial to fighting the epidemic and beneficial to our society,"" Lam said. ""It will also help Hong Kong come out of the pandemic unscathed and is conducive to the resumption of daily activities.""More than 500,000 people in the city of 7.5 million signed up in advance for the program, which will last at least a week. It is aimed at identifying silent carriers of the virus — those without symptoms — who could be spreading the disease.WATCH | Hong Kong's Lam encourages residents to get tested for coronavirus: WorldThe government expects five million people will take part in the program, which could be extended to two weeks depending on demand.Hong Kong has recorded 4,822 cases of the coronavirus and 90 deaths, according to a tally from Johns Hopkins University.The territory's worst outbreak of the pandemic, in early July, was blamed in part on an exemption from quarantine requirements for airline staff, truck drivers from mainland China and sailors on cargo ships.At its peak, Hong Kong recorded more than 100 locally transmitted cases a day after going weeks without any in June.The outbreak has slowed, with the city reporting just nine cases on Monday, the first time in two weeks that daily infections had fallen to single digits. However, the government and some experts say that community testing can help detect asymptomatic carriers to further stop the spread of the virus.Respiratory medicine expert professor David Hui said that even though infections have dwindled, the proportion of cases with untraceable sources of infection remain between 30 and 40 per cent.""That means there must be some silent transmission going on, so community testing has some role in picking up these silent transmitters,"" said Hui, who is a public health adviser to the city's government.""Hopefully, if we can identify these people and isolate them for a period of time, that may help to break the transmission chain in the community.""The program is more effective if most of the population takes part, Hui said.""If only one or two million people take part, then we may not be able to achieve that objective.""Other experts, such as Dr. Leung Chi-chiu, a respiratory specialist and a member of the Medical Council of Hong Kong, said that the testing program plays only a supplementary role in controlling the pandemic in the city because of the long and variable incubation period of the coronavirus.Leung said that mass-testing may not be the most cost-effective method, as it is not easy to pick up the disease in its early development, especially if a person is not having symptoms or has not had recent exposure to an infected patient.Even if mass-testing could identify infected patients, they may already be past the infectious stage, he said.WATCH | First COVID-19 reinfection documented in Hong Kong, researchers say: CBC NewsLeung said that large-scale testing will not be able to replace traditional methods of social distancing and contact tracing measures and should only be used as a complementary measure.Some pro-democracy activists, such as Joshua Wong, have publicly opposed the program. He called for a boycott, citing Swedish media reports that some test kits being used had high rates of false-positive results.Lam noted that while false-positives can happen, the tests used in the program have passed quality assurance procedures."

China bans 2 toy makers from exporting to U.S.,"China banned exports by two toy manufacturers whose products were subject to major recalls in the United States because they were decorated with lead-tainted paint, the government said Thursday.",2007-08-09T00:00:00.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/china-bans-2-toy-makers-from-exporting-to-u-s-1.649193,"China banned exports by two toy manufacturers whose products were subject to major recalls in the United States because they were decorated with lead-tainted paint, the government said Thursday.The General Administration for Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine said the restrictions on Lee Der Industrial Co. Ltd. and Hansheng Wood Products were temporary, but did not give any details.""They have been asked to evaluate and change their business practices,"" the administration said in a notice on its website.Mattel Inc. recalled 967,000 toys made by Lee Der last week because they were coated with paint found to have excessive amounts of lead. The plastic preschool toys, sold under the Fisher-Price brand in the U.S., included the popular Big Bird, Elmo, Dora and Diego characters.The quality control watchdog also suggested that foreign companies who contract Chinese factories to make their products should take more responsibility.""To prevent loopholes in quality control, overseas brand owners should improve their product design and supervision over product quality,"" the administration said.The agency said police were investigating two companies' use of ""fake plastic pigment"" but did not elaborate. Such pigments are a type of industrial latex usually used to increase surface gloss and smoothness.Chinese companies often have long supply chains, making it difficult to trace the exact origin of components, chemicals, and food additives.Officials at Lee Der and Hansheng, both located in the southern province of Guangdong, said Thursday they had not heard about the export ban and refused to comment further.It was not immediately clear how long the ban would last, or whether any further action was planned. The watchdog last month revoked the business licences of two other Chinese companies that made a tainted pet food ingredient blamed for causing the deaths of cats and dogs in North America.The Chinese watchdog also warned that other toy manufacturers whose products do not meet safety standards overseas will not be allowed to sell their goods abroad until they rectify problems. But it said the majority of toys made in China were manufactured strictly according to foreign specifications."

For years its website proclaimed it is âone of the fastest growing companies in Canada.â Thatâs despite the fact Brightenview hasnât yet built any of its promised projects. In 2013, it said it would construct a wholesale megamall in the 600-person town of Dundurn, Sask., south of Saskatoon. The concept: Chinese entrepreneurs would buy one of 350 units in the 300,000-square-foot mall, immigrate to Canada and sell their wares across North America. The Dundurn International Exhibition Centre was supposed to open in 2015. It hasnât. In 2014, Brightenview announced a similar project in Chatham-Kent, Ont. The Global Development Centre was to open in 2016. The project now appears dead.

(The Chatham Voice)A sign announcing the Global Trade and Exhibition Centre has been installed at the Global Transportation Hub in Regina. (CBC News)Brad Wall spoke to Chinese entrepreneurs in Beijing last fall. (Brightenvantage)Last fall, Saskatchewan Premier Brad Wall was in Beijing, speaking to a crowd of hundreds of Chinese entrepreneurs, inviting them âto explore one of our most significant investment opportunities: the Global Transportation Hub.â  The Sept. 24, 2016, event was organized by the government-owned GTH (an inland port west of Regina) and Chinese officials.   Officials from Brightenview were also in attendance. The companyâs new project at the GTH was the investment opportunity receiving much of the spotlight. The first phase of Brightenviewâs Global Trade and Exhibition Centre (GTEC) is slated to house up to 300 vendors owned by Chinese business people.

        Brightenview's rendering of the Global Transportation Hub. (Brightenview)
      In her presentation, the GTHâs vice-president of business development, Rhonda Ekstrom, said Brightenviewâs GTEC project is an âexcellent business modelâ that âcombines the strength of the GTH with a powerful business platform that reduces the risk of doing business in North America.â   This event was yet another sign of a close relationship that has developed between Brightenview and the provincial government since the company signed a land sale agreement with the GTH on Feb. 3, 2016.   That was the same day CBCâs iTeam broke the story of the GTH land deal scandal: How two politically well-connected business people made $11 million on a series of transactions that saw 204 acres of land wind up in taxpayers' hands at two to three times more than the appraised value.  
        CBC's Geoff Leo explains the essentials of the GTH land deal controversy.
      Also on that February day, the GTH and Brightenview signed a âco-operation agreement.â A letter from then-GTH minister Bill Boyd to GTH CEO Bryan Richards spelled out the nature of the new relationship.  âGTH is the lead agency empowered by government to work with Brightenview on the proposed projects,â Boyd wrote. âPlease engage the relevant resources within government and any external agencies to assist as necessary.â  That agreement formalized a relationship between the Saskatchewan government and a company founded, and still connected to, a man who has been wanted by the Chinese government for loan fraud: Mike (Chuan) Niu.  CBCâs iTeam has obtained Interpol documents showing Niu and his partner Jessie (Yilin) Zhan were wanted by the Chinese government, accused of loan fraud. The arrest notices were issued as part of a Chinese government anti-corruption campaign.  In this country, Niu and Zhan have run the Toronto-based Canmax group of companies, which has been closely connected to Brightenview. Canmax promised to help Chinese people immigrate to Saskatchewan.   However, in many cases, the company has failed to deliver and that has resulted in about 20 lawsuits filed by people who say Canmax ripped them off.  Brightenview and government closely co-operating Immigration and deep co-operation from the Saskatchewan government are core to Brightenviewâs GTEC plan.   To work, it will need the government to approve the immigration applications of hundreds of Chinese business people in relatively short order through the entrepreneurial category of the provinceâs immigrant nominee program.   Signs of that close co-operation abound.  Ever since the GTH land deal story broke, the government has regularly pointed to the Brightenview agreement as proof that all is well at the inland port, despite the provincial auditorâs critical report about the land deal and an ongoing RCMP investigation into the scandal.  Earlier this month, when Saskatchewan Minister of the Economy Jeremy Harrison was asked critical questions about the land deal in the legislature, he pivoted to Brightenview.  âWeâre looking forward to that construction beginning, Mr. Speaker, and we look forward to a new business out at the GTH,â said Harrison.  Brightenview says, when complete, the GTEC will mean 200 jobs for the province and $200 million in corporate investment.   Harrison also showed his support by attending and speaking at the May 4, 2017, ribbon-cutting ceremony for Brightenviewâs GTEC project.   PCL Construction broke ground on Phase 1 of the project May 1, 2017. Brightenview says it will be complete by February 2018.   
        Brightenview's $45-million project breaks ground at the Global Transportation Hub, CBC's Adam Hunter reports.
      âWeâve worked closely with the company,â Harrison told the media. âWeâre confident that the project will move forward.â  But the relationship between Brightenview and the Saskatchewan government has left some people who were hurt by Canmax shaking their heads.   The Toronto businessman said Canmax was supposed to help his sister immigrate to Canada. Instead, it cost his family thousands of dollars and caused years of grief.   Do you know what type of company you supporting right now?  Xie has learned Canmax and Brightenview share a lot in common:   - Brightenview was founded by: Niu and Joe (Yongbo) Zhou. Both men are also founding directors of Canmax companies.
- Canmax has been involved in promoting Brightenviewâs projects in China. 
- Canmax has been a key Brightenview partner, with the agency offering settlement services to new immigrants the company brings in.
- Advertisements for Brightenview employees have been posted on the Canmaxgroup.com website.  In fact, when the Dundurn megamall, Brightenviewâs first Saskatchewan project, was initially pitched by Zhou to the Rural Municipality of Dundurn, he was there as a representative of Canmax. The July 10, 2012, RM council minutes read âthat council gives support in principle to Canmax Investment Group Inc. on the proposal of an International Exhibition Centre.â  When asked about the Canmax-Brightenview connection, Brightenviewâs vice-president of government relations, Lorne Nystrom, said âthereâs no relationship now with Canmax at all.â  Nystrom, whoâs a former MP with the federal NDP and a former leadership candidate for the party, couldnât say precisely when that relationship was severed or why.   Until a few weeks ago, Brightenviewâs website said Canmax was the company that would provide settlement services. The website has also referred to Canmax as one of its corporate partners.   However, since CBC started interviewing Canmax officials, all mention of the company was scrubbed from Brightenviewâs website.   âThe website is in the process of being changed,â said Nystrom. âI think some stuff has been taken down because it was old and no longer relevant to be on there.â   Nystrom also acknowledged that Canmaxâs China office was involved in selling Brightenviewâs Dundurn project to Chinese investors.   However, Nystrom insisted all of that is in the past.  âWe donât need Canmax,â said Nystrom. âWe have a lot of in-house ability in our company and we can reach out to other people on an as-needed basis.â  In an email Zhou also told CBC, âThere is no active business relationship between Canmax and Brightenview.â  However, Xie wonders if the government did its homework on Brightenviewâs history before partnering with the company.   He said if he could talk to Wall, âI would ask: âDo you know what type of company you supporting right now?ââ  In 2011, Xie hired Canmax. He paid the company $25,000 to help his sister immigrate to Canada through the Saskatchewan Immigrant Nominee Program.   Canmax explained to Xie that, at the time, Saskatchewan was the easiest place in the country to immigrate to.   At first, Xie was impressed. Within a couple of months, Canmax secured the required letter offering his sister a job.   Xie asked for a copy but the company refused. It was confidential, he was told. He thought that was odd, but he wasnât worried.  The contract sucks. All of the contracts suck. We admit that.  By the fall of 2014 â three years after hiring Canmax â Xieâs sister was still in China and they both were getting worried.  So, they asked for a refund. The contract stipulated a refund was possible if the company was unable to help a client immigrate to Canada. However, the contract didnât have a timeline related to when a refund could be granted, which left the whole process ambiguous.   Canmaxâs paralegal, James Bush, acknowledged the contract is âhorrible.â   âThe contract sucks. All of the contracts suck. We admit that,â said Bush.  Canmax said Xie would have to sign another contract, this time with an end date. If his sister wasnât in Canada by May 2015, Xie would get the money back.   By August 2015, he still hadnât heard a thing. He contacted Canmax and he said he was told the company had run out of money. There would be no refund.   âI realized something really wrong with Canmax,â Xie said.  A 'fake' company Xie contacted the Saskatchewan government and asked for all of the documents on his file.   He was stunned to learn his sisterâs case had been rejected by the government in 2013 â a fact Canmax failed to share with him.   He hired a private detective to look into the case and review the file.   The detective had a more detailed look at the job offer Xie's sister supposedly received through Canmax.  He discovered the address doesnât exist and the business name is fabricated.   âItâs a fake company,â Xie said. âThatâs why my sister get refused, because this job letter is a fake job letter. They not be able to verify this job letter.â  
        Richard Xie shows CBC's Geoff Leo what he discovered about his sister's job letter.
      It turns out problems with Canmax job offers were not uncommon.   In a 2014 email, Meg Brookes, a program integrity officer with Saskatchewan's Ministry of the Economy, asked the office of the Consulate General of Canada to put a Canmax file on hold âto determine if the job offer is still valid.â  In a follow-up email, Brookes wrote, âI have a whole bunch more for you to check please and place on hold. All are the same representative and I believe the job offers to be invalid.â   When CBC asked James Bush about the possibility that Canmax submitted fake job offers on behalf of clients, he explained if the letters were fake they would have been provided to Canmax by a third party.  âSo a rogue company creates phony job letters to get a referral fee from the head office of Canmax,â he posited. âYouâre [CBC] not saying who the letters were from or where they came from. You used a term thatâs too general. You used the term âCanmax.â Who specifically gave a job offer that was false to one of these people?â  Xie has filed a complaint with police and is planning to file a lawsuit against Canmax.  Heâs frustrated he had to discover this problem himself, when the government appears to have known.   âThey should have noticed that something goes wrong with this Canmax,â Xie said. âIf there are so many cases by Canmax that are rejected they should have noticed something.  âWhy donât they take some action? At least inform my sister, the applicant. But they didnât do anything.â  Examples of lawsuits against Canmax companies. (CBC News)Canmax has faced many complaints About 20 other people have already filed suits against Canmax companies. They follow the same basic pattern as Xieâs case.  - Plantiffs paid large deposits to a Canmax company on the companyâs promise it would help their relatives immigrate to Canada through the Saskatchewan Immigrant Nominee Program. 
- After long delays, the plaintiffs requested a refund, as spelled out in their contract.
- The Canmax firm failed to refund all of their money.  In its statements of defence, Canmax has routinely denied it has done anything wrong. It also insists that itâs the plaintiffs who have âunilaterally abrogatedâ their contractual obligations and therefore âany losses suffered by the Plaintiff are the fault solely of the Plaintiff.â   Some plaintiffs have won judgements, some have arrived at settlements, while others have been plodding through the courts for years.   Jonathan Fon, a Toronto-based paralegal, won a $10,000 lawsuit against Canmax earlier this year after fighting with the company in court for 2 Â½ years.   He said the delays seem to be part of the plan.   âTo me itâs really strategically playing; itâs not really they want to solve the problem,â Fon said. âThe settlement process was actually postponed, postponed, postponed, then the plaintiff may be tired and disgusted and theyâll want to give up.  âThey [Canmax] say the beautiful words but they never done any act. So thatâs their strategy.â   The Toronto nurse gave Canmax $60,000 to help her nephew and younger sister come to Saskatchewan from China through the provinceâs immigrant nominee program in 2012.  Just like Xie, she has faced long delays and has been promised refunds that have never arrived.  She said she would visit the Canmax office every week asking for answers. Eventually, a Canmax employee pushed back.  Li said the employee âvery rude talk to me and say, âYou are not welcome to come to our office anymore.â And he said, âWhy you come here? Whatâs your reason?â I said, âMy moneyâs in your company. We have an agreement.â He said, âThatâs your problem, not our problem.ââ  In a last ditch effort, she decided to stake out the front office to wait for the boss: Mike Niu.  The company called police and Li was kicked off the property.  How about if his mother and his father knows what he is doing? They are proud of him?  Since then, she has been fighting for her money in court.  She said the worst thing is some of her family, who are still in China, think she took the money for herself.  âMy oldest sister involved in this case says I take her son's money,â said Li. âAnd my mother heard this news and lost the sense to eat, to survive.â  In September 2015, her mother passed away after failing to eat for a few weeks.  
        Sophia Li speaks to CBC's Geoff Leo about her mother's death.
      Li said she will keep fighting because this isn't just about the money.  âIt's my honour.â  She said her experience with Canmax has ruined her life and she would like to ask Niu how he can live with himself.  âSo you never care how many people the life changed because of you and how many relatives the relationship is broken because of you?â said Li.  âHow about if his mother and his father knows what he is doing? They are proud of him?â  Niu is elusive. It's difficult to find someone who has seen him or knows much about him.  Even James Bush, who regularly represents Niu in court, said he has never met the man.  âMike has never attended at court on any hearing,â said Bush. âI have never spoken to him. And Iâve never directly had any communication with him in writing.â  Perhaps his elusiveness could be explained by a news story that broke in the Chinese press in 2015.  In April of that year, the Chinese government announced the results of an anti-corruption initiative called âFox Hunt 2014.â According to online news articles, the ministry of public security in mainland China was trying to track down what it called corrupt officials accused of economic crimes, who had fled the country.  The government published the names, photos and details of hundreds of people through Interpol. Several media outlets published the entire list. The list features more than 400 people for whom China has issued a âRed Notice.â According to Interpolâs website, âRed Notices are issued for individuals sought for prosecution or to serve a sentence. When the individual is sought for prosecution it means they are suspected of committing a crime but have not yet been prosecuted and so should be considered innocent until proven guilty.â  Niu and his partner, Zhan, were on that list, wanted by China for loan fraud.  According to corporate records, Zhan is the founder of Brightenvantage, the marketing arm of Brightenview.  Roger Tsai, Canmaxâs director of legal affairs, says Zhan is also the current âbossâ of Canmax.  In addition, Tsai also confirmed Niu and Zhan are a couple and have children together.  The names and dates of birth on the Interpol documents match the information about Niu and Zhan CBC has obtained elsewhere. Neither of them have responded to CBCâs requests for an interview.  Sometime in 2016, the names of Niu and Zhan and many of the other alleged corrupt officials were removed from Interpolâs public website. Interpol won't answer any questions about that. Neither will the Chinese consulate in Ottawa or Chinese police.  A few months after that Interpol story broke, Niuâs name was removed as director from all Canmax public records. In court, Canmaxâs director of legal affairs testified he didnât know why.  Niuâs dealings in Canada In 2005, Niu established his first immigration business, Winners Immigration Consulting Inc.   Since that time, he has started and operated a series of similar companies, many of which offered to assist people from China to immigrate to Canada.   
A timeline of Mike Niu's companies.
A timeline of Mike Niu's companies.Niu, who is not registered as an immigration consultant, co-founded Winners with Jun Cheng, who is a member of the Immigration Consultants of Canada Regulatory Council (ICCRC).  Cheng said he had his own immigration consulting practice. He said with Winners, he was a silent director, though from time to time he would sign immigration documents for Winners cases because he's authorized to as a registered immigration consultant.  Cheng said he offered to help Niu and not charge for the service.   âI thought that we were friends and from the beginning Winners didnât make money. So, I said, 'OK, you do the business. If you need my help, Iâll help you to do some cases.ââ  But he said he started to notice Winners sometimes wasnât following the ICCRC rules.   âMaybe some cases I didnât sign; they submitted, using my name,â Cheng said. âI was not happy with all those kinds of things, I told him.â  A timeline of Mike Niu's companies.A timeline of Mike Niu's companies.A timeline of Mike Niu's companies.A timeline of Mike Niu's companies.A timeline of Mike Niu's companies.A timeline of Mike Niu's companies.A timeline of Mike Niu's companies.A timeline of Mike Niu's companies.A timeline of Mike Niu's companies.Toronto Star targets Winners In June 2007, Winners caught the attention of investigative reporters at the Toronto Star.  According to the story, an employee of Niu spoke with a Toronto Star reporter posing as a potential client.   The story says âafter hearing his visitorâs visa is due to expire in a month, [the employee] immediately suggests a refugee claim, even though the reporter hasnât mentioned persecution or hardship in China. Success is nearly guaranteed, she says; only two refugee claims filed by her office have ever failed and ânot because of us.ââ  Eventually Cheng got drawn into the story after Niu failed to respond to the Starâs follow-up questions.   The story quotes Cheng as saying, âI need to investigate further. If thatâs true that they told you to file a refugee claim when there isnât a reason, thatâs wrong.â  Cheng told CBC this sort of thing made him increasingly uncomfortable.   Winners slammed by complaints and lawsuits According to Cheng, he eventually told Niu he wanted to disassociate from the company.  Cheng said he never got paid for any of the work he did for Winners.   But the work has had a lasting effect on his career. He said three complaints have been filed with ICCRC related to his work at Winners. He has also been named as a defendant in a lawsuit along with Winners, Niu and Canmax.  In July 2016, Cheng was publicly reprimanded by the ICCRC for his work in one of those cases. The regulator found Cheng had signed blank documents for the Saskatchewan Immigrant Nominee Program.   âThe Member never met the complainant or provided any consulting services to the complainant,â the investigation found. It said Cheng had âin effect delegated or licensed his ICCRC membership to a third party.â It found he did not do this for dishonest reasons and wasnât paid for the service.   When he left the company in 2011, Cheng urged Niu to shut it down.   Niu did get rid of Winners â by turning it into Canmax. A court judgement spells out how that happened.   In 2009, Yu Qiao hired Winners to help her sister immigrate to Canada. A court judgement, Yu Qiao vs. Winners, says Niu was Qiaoâs main contact at Winners.   According to the judgement Qiao âsaid that Mike [Niu] made many confident promisesâ about how Saskatchewanâs program was a good and fast way to get into Canada.   One day, instead of meeting Niu at the Winners office, Qiao was directed to the offices of Canmax.   âMike advised Qiao that Winners was expanding and that Winners and Canmax were the same company,â the judgement says.  Despite the new name, the same problems occurred.  The judge concluded, âit is not clear that either of the corporate defendants [Winners or Canmax] did anything to assist [Qiaoâs] sisterâ and awarded $20,000 to Qiao.  Canmax's decline Itâs the Canmax companies that have faced the greatest number of lawsuits. CBC has identified about 20 actions against the company.   Canmaxâs director of legal affairs, Roger Tsai, told CBC that at its peak (in 2011 and 2012) Canmax was processing 100-150 applications a year for the Saskatchewan Immigrant Nominee Program. At that time, it had 70-80 employees.  
        A Canmax promotional video.
      Since Saskatchewanâs immigration program rules tightened in 2013, Canmaxâs Saskatchewan business has all but dried up.   However, according to a 2015 email obtained through court records, in that year the company still had 400 active files and many of those clients were requesting refunds.   The company is now down to 10 employees, including the director of legal affairs.   Tsai said even though itâs a small company, his job is necessary because of all of the lawsuits.   Though Niuâs partner, Jessie Zhan, continues to run Canmax, Tsai said he hasnât seen or heard from Niu since he was removed as director in 2015.   Even James Bush said he wouldnât know where to start looking.  Brightenview CEO Joe Zhou (Brightenvantage).In August 2012, Niu founded Brightenview with his Canmax colleague Joe Zhou, who became its CEO and public face.  Zhou was also the founding director of two of the Canmax group of companies: Canmax Fortune Management Inc. and Canmax Financial Insurance Ltd.  While Niu and his companies have been sued, Zhou and his two Canmax companies have not. In a written statement, Zhou said those companies were âclosed soon after I became CEO with Brightenview,â though he acknowledges, âI have yet to deal with the closure of the companies from the registry.â   In early 2013, Zhou made Brightenviewâs first big announcement about what has come to be called the Dundurn megamall.   Brightenview said the project would be completed by 2015 and it expected that hundreds of Chinese entrepreneurs would flood into Saskatchewan.   
        A promotional video for the Dundurn megamall featuring Brightenview's vice-president of government relations, Lorne Nystrom.
      Then-Saskatchewan labour minister Don Morgan attended the event and, according to the Saskatoon StarPhoenix newspaper, was enthusiastic.  âWe want to make sure it has every opportunity to succeed and weâll do everything we can,â Morgan said.   Another StarPhoenix article, published on April 1, 2013, quoted Zhou as saying many of the megamallâs 350 suites had already been âspoken for.â  A Brightenview document obtained by CBC shows the company was charging between $450,000 and $1.1 million dollars for the units.   Immediately after signing a purchase contract, the Chinese entrepreneur is required to pay a 50 per cent deposit, according to a flow chart of the purchase process, also obtained by CBC.  CBC asked Nystrom how many people had paid deposits to Brightenview so far.  âThatâs all private transactional stuff. If even I wanted to, I couldnât divulge any of that stuff,â he said.   CBC asked Nystrom what the company says to customers who paid deposits back in 2013 on the now-stalled Dundurn project.   He said that project isnât dead, but the megamall at the GTH is the top priority now.  Whoâs running Brightenview? Since 2013, the Global Transportation Hub and Brightenview had been discussing the possibility of working together. The two organizations signed a confidentiality agreement that year.   Throughout those discussions, and up to the signing of the agreements on Feb. 3, 2016, Niu was one of two directors of the company, according to Saskatchewanâs corporate registry.   In a written statement, Zhou told CBC Niu was legally removed on May 15, 2015. But that is contradicted by the document he signed and filed with the registry, which says Niu ceased to be a director of the corporation on Feb. 3, 2016.  On that day Niu was replaced by a man named Hua Ma. He became a director and owner of 90 per cent of the companyâs shares.   CBC asked Nystrom about Maâs background. He would only say heâs a businessman living in Toronto.   âItâs the companyâs business,â Nystrom said.  Nystrom had the same response when asked why Niu was removed as director immediately after signing such a significant deal.   In its corporate records, Brightenview provided Maâs Toronto address. A search of property records shows that address is owned by Zhan, Niuâs partner.  CBC News asked GTH officials if they had been made aware of Maâs new interest and role in the company.   A spokesperson responded by email, saying, âThe GTH works directly with Joe Zhou, Brightenviewâs chief executive officer â¦ Brightenview has been operating in good standing as a registered Saskatchewan corporation since 2012.â The spokesperson added that this is a private business matter.  Brightenview is the parent company and Brightenvantage is a subsidiary, working on marketing the project in Canada and China. It has offices in Saskatchewan, Vancouver and China.  Brightenvantage was founded by Zhan in March 2012. In 2014, Nystrom became a director of the company.  But just last month, Zhanâs name was removed from the corporate record. Nystrom said it was a ârestructuring.â  Iâm not even sure whoâs running it in Vancouver.  CBC asked Nystrom who is running Brightenvantageâs Vancouver office, which is doing most of the companyâs Canadian business. Though heâs a director of the company, he couldnât say.  âIn Vancouver â oh, God â Iâm not even sure. Iâm not even sure whoâs running it in Vancouver,â Nystrom replied.  CBC spoke to a receptionist at the Vancouver Brightenvantage office and she confirmed Niu is the boss. Two former Brightenvantage employees confirmed the same thing.  CBC asked Nystrom what role Niu plays in the company. Initially, he said Niu had no current role. Then, he conceded perhaps he might.  âWhether heâs doing some stuff in the office off and on, I do not know,â said Nystrom.  When CBC pointed out that Brightenvantageâs Vancouver receptionist had confirmed Niu works in the office and is the boss, Nystrom said, âI would dispute that.â  âShe just started very recently. And I donât think she has been there long enough to know what the structure is.â  After Nystromâs denial, CBC called the Brightenvantage office in Vancouver again and asked the receptionist if she could leave a message for Niu, asking him to call CBC. She said she would pass that message on to Niuâs assistants.  CBC also pointed out to Nystrom that in August 2016, months after Niu was removed as director of Brightenview, he registered a website called TheGTEC.com using Brightenviewâs email and phone number as his contact information.  Nystrom said thatâs not his area. He suggested Zhou would know more about that and he offered CBC a sit-down interview with Brightenviewâs CEO.  Later, Zhou declined an interview with CBC. Instead, he sent a email that didnât address many of the questions raised in the interview with Nystrom.  However, he did say everything Brightenview does is above board.  âI simply wish to remind you of the values, such as integrity, that we all hold dearly when it comes to personal, business and client information and privacy.â  A ribbon-cutting ceremony was held for the GTEC project in Regina in May 2017. (CBC News)For the past year and a half, CBC has been attempting to learn more about the relationship between the government of Saskatchewan and Brightenview. It filed a series of freedom of information requests to the GTH for documents related to Brightenview and this agreement.   While hundreds of pages have been provided, the GTH withheld dozens of documents, including the land sale agreement, the co-operation agreement and the confidentiality agreement.  CBC filed complaints with Saskatchewanâs Information and Privacy Commissioner about these withheld documents.  While he concluded that many of them could justifiably remain private, the commissioner recommended the GTH release 50 documents, including the land sale agreement and a confidentiality agreement.   - First review report.
- Second review report.
- Third review report. The GTH has refused to follow that recommendation.   Without access to the land sale contract and the co-operation agreement with Brightenview, it remains unclear precisely what the government committed to and how deeply connected taxpayers are to this company and its plans.   Government didnât dig deep enough, says Xie CBC has presented the provincial government with many of the key facts it has uncovered in this story and asked if, during its due diligence process, officials also came across these facts.  In an email, the Premierâs Office wrote, âwe wonât speak to specific assertions and innuendo about any specific company but we welcome the investment Brightenview has made in our province and look forward to their continued investment.â  The Premierâs Office said the GTH always conducts extensive research, meets with the client, checks government records, scans publicly available sources, and verifies the companyâs reputation.  âFor companies in China, the GTH works with the Saskatchewan trade office in Shanghai to complete the due diligence with local sources, applying the same process,â the email says.  So many people lost the money.  But Xie worries the government didnât dig deep enough.  âHow much do you know about Mike Niu? Do you know what he did before? How much money we lost from his different kinds of companies?â Xie asked.  âSo many people lost the money.â  Story editing and Shorthand design by Natascia Lypny. Update:On September 5, 2018, a judge ruled against Richard Xie in his court case with Canmax. The judge found
	that Xie filed the claim in his own name but in reality, the action was filed on behalf of his sister who was the
	one who actually had a contract with Canmax. As a result, the claim was dismissed because Xie ""has no standing to
	sue."" On January 14, 2019, following a court hearing, a judge found in favour of Sophia Li. The court
	ordered Canmax to pay $25,000 plus costs of $3,750. Recently, Joe Zhou, speaking on behalf of Canmax, defended the integrity of the company. He said
	Canmax had processed hundreds of immigration applications and yet there were only a handful of lawsuits. He said
	while the company itself has appeared to be essentially defunct, it has continued to maintain its legal unit to deal
	with the legal actions. Zhou said if Canmax was an illegitimate or dishonest company, the easiest approach would
	have been to simply go bankrupt. He said the fact that the company is continuing with the court processes shows it
	is attempting to be responsible. At the time of this report, CBC was unable to determine precisely what circumstances, and if an actual
	fraud, led to Mike Niu and Yilin Zhan being placed on the Interpol Red Notice list in 2014. That still remains
	unclear. At the time of publication, CBC pointed out that the couple had been removed from the public list. The
	circumstances weren't clear then and remain unclear to this day, why or when they were removed from the list. Photos
	from the source of the previous interpol list were removed from this story. "

China announces additional $30M in funding for WHO | CBC News,"China said on Thursday it would donate a further $30 million US to the World Health Organization, which is seeking more than $1 billion to fund its battle against the coronavirus pandemic that has killed more than 185,000 people worldwide.",2020-04-23T12:08:48.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/who-china-funding-1.5542134,"China said on Thursday it would donate a further $30 million US to the World Health Organization (WHO), which is seeking more than $1 billion to fund its battle against the coronavirus pandemic that has killed more than 185,000 people worldwide.The donation aimed to support the global fight against COVID-19, in particular strengthening health systems in developing countries, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said. She noted that China had already donated $20 million to the WHO on March 11.""At this crucial moment, supporting WHO is supporting multilateralism and global solidarity,"" Hua said on Twitter.The pledge comes about a week after U.S. President Donald Trump announced that U.S. funding would be halted while Washington reviewed WHO's role ""in severely mismanaging and covering up the spread of the coronavirus."" The review, he said, was likely to take 60 to 90 days.Trump accused the Geneva-based organization of promoting Chinese ""disinformation"" about the virus, which emerged in the central city of Wuhan last year.On Wednesday, WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said he hoped the Trump administration would reconsider its decision.""I hope the U.S. believes that this an important investment, not just to help others, but for the U.S. to stay safe also,"" Tedros said during a virtual briefing.The United States contributed more than $400 million to WHO in 2019, or roughly 15 per cent of the organization's budget.The organization's 2020-21 budget, approved by health ministers last May, amounts to nearly $4.85 billion in total and represents a nine per cent rise from the previous two-year period.WATCH | WHO's Dr. Mike Ryan rejects U.S. claim:NewsTrump's announcement drew international condemnation, coming as it did just over one month after WHO declared the spread of the coronavirus a pandemic, and there are fears it could impact other efforts in global health. The U.S. provides several hundred million dollars to WHO every year in voluntary funding tied to specific programs like polio eradication, vaccine-preventable disease, HIV and hepatitis, tuberculosis and maternal and newborn health.It also set up another potential fight on Capitol Hill in Washington. After Trump made his announcement, Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said it was ""dangerous, illegal and will be swiftly challenged.""Democrats in the House on Thursday accused the Trump administration of trying to ""scapegoat"" WHO and urged an immediate restoration of funding, according to a letter seen by Reuters on Thursday.""This policy is profoundly misguided and appears to be an effort to scapegoat the WHO in order to deflect attention from your administration's mismanaged and politicized response to the pandemic,"" said the letter, led by foreign affairs committee chair Eliot Engel and signed by all 26 of the panel's Democratic members.The U.S. Congress controls federal spending and could pass legislation to guarantee funding for WHO. However, to become law it would need to garner enough support, including from the Republican-led Senate, not just to pass but to override a likely veto."

Hong Kong residents defend free press as China cracks down | CBC News,"Last year, people took to the streets of Hong Kong to demand full democracy, many of them encouraged by a tabloid newspaper critical of China's ruling Communist Party. On Tuesday, they lined up at newsstands to buy that same paper in a bid to help the Apple Daily — and press freedom — survive.",2020-08-11T12:10:21.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/hong-kong-press-lai-apple-daily-1.5681687,"Last year, hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets of Hong Kong to demand full democracy, many of them encouraged by a tabloid newspaper critical of China's ruling Communist Party.On Tuesday, they lined up at newsstands across the city to buy that same paper in a bid to help the Apple Daily — and press freedom — survive.The public show of support came a day after police rounded up 10 people, including the paper's founder, and raided its headquarters. The move reinforced fears that a new national security law would be used to suppress dissent in Hong Kong after months of anti-government protests shook the city's leadership and the central government in Beijing last year.Police have expanded their use of the law since it took effect six weeks ago, first arresting protesters with slogans deemed to be in violation and then activists over online posts. Media tycoon Jimmy Lai, the Apple Daily founder, and his Next Digital media group were the largest targets to date.That people protested by buying a newspaper rather than by taking to the streets shows how much the climate has changed since the massive protests last year. People also bought Next Digital stock to show support, driving its price up more than 300 per cent on Tuesday,The Apple Daily, known for its celebrity coverage as well as its condemnation of China's authoritarian rule, remained defiant, printing 350,000 copies — five times its usual print run — after police investigators left Next Digital and told employees they could go back to work.Lines formed at newsstands Tuesday in a public show of support, and Apple Daily said it would print an additional 200,000 copies.""Apple Daily will fight on,"" the newspaper said on its front page.""I do not like the way Apple Daily reports news but I think it symbolizes press freedom in Hong Kong,"" Tiffany Chan said after buying a copy at a convenience store. ""I cannot just sit and watch the government destroy press freedom. This is the least I can do.""One newsstand operator said he had sold 200 of his allotment of about 300 papers by late morning. On a typical day, he sells about 100 copies, he said.In the early hours of Wednesday, Lai was released on bail. As he emerged from the police station, the crowd waiting outside cheered. Some of them held up copies of the Apple Daily newspaper in support and chanted ""Support Apple Daily, until the very end."" Lai was driven away in a black car, waving at supporters and giving them a thumbs-up.Agnes Chow, a prominent pro-democracy activist who was also one of the 10 people arrested under the national security law on Monday, was also granted bail on Tuesday night and released.On Tuesday, state media reported that China's top legislature has decided to extend the mandate for the current group of Hong Kong lawmakers for a year from its expiry date of Sept. 30, after a scheduled election was delayed.Critics cast the July 31 decision to postpone the election as political, saying it was intended to prevent Hong Kong's opposition pro-democracy camp from capitalizing on a wave of public support after China imposed the harsh new security law on the city in late June.The Hong Kong government justified the delay given what it called the ""severe"" COVID-19 epidemic situation and a need to protect public health.Hong Kong, and to a lesser degree Taiwan, have become battlegrounds for the competing world views of China and the United States. The U.S. imposed sanctions on 11 Hong Kong and Chinese officials last week, including city leader Carrie Lam, over the security law. China responded Monday by sanctioning 11 Americans, including six members of Congress.The Trump administration, which is feuding with China on multiple fronts, sent Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar to Taiwan this week for the highest-level visit by a U.S. official since the United States broke off diplomatic relations to recognize Beijing as the government of China in 1979.Taiwan Foreign Minister Joseph Wu, meeting Azar on Tuesday, said the self-governing island is fortunate to have U.S. support at a time when ""life has become increasingly difficult as China continues to pressure Taiwan into accepting its political conditions, conditions that will turn Taiwan into the next Hong Kong.""The fate of Hong Kong's 7.5 million residents ultimately lies in the hands of the Communist Party leadership in Beijing.""You can't really worry about it, it is what it is,"" said Anna Yuen, a retiree who said her family could leave if the situation really deteriorates. ""But I can't bear to leave Hong Kong. I think Hong Kong people are really admirable, especially the youth.""The fear in Hong Kong, which has its own laws and courts and greater freedoms than mainland China, is that the Communist Party wants to transform the region over time into a city similar to those on the mainland.Press freedom is just one characteristic that separates Hong Kong from the rest of China.""If they crack down on Apple Daily today, they will go down the list of media that do not support the Communist Party or the Hong Kong government, and what will be left is just news that sings the praises of the Communist Party,"" Chan said."

China says U.S. damaging global trade with Huawei sanctions | CBC News,China accused Washington of damaging global trade with sanctions that threaten to cripple tech giant Huawei and said Tuesday it will protect Chinese companies but gave no indication of possible retaliation.,2020-08-18T12:22:10.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/china-trade-united-states-huawei-1.5690379,"China accused Washington of damaging global trade with sanctions that threaten to cripple tech giant Huawei and said Tuesday it will protect Chinese companies but gave no indication of possible retaliation.Rules confirmed Monday by the Commerce Department block suppliers from using U.S. technology to produce processor chips and other components for Huawei. The company, China's first global tech competitor, is the biggest supplier of switching equipment for phone companies and a leading smartphone brand.The foreign ministry demanded the Trump administration ""stop suppressing Chinese companies.""Huawei Technologies Ltd. is at the centre of a worsening row between Washington and Beijing over technology and security. U.S. officials say Huawei is a security risk, which the company denies, and are lobbying European and other allies to avoid its technology as they upgrade to next-generation networks.The conflict has spread to include Chinese-owned short video app TikTok and messaging service WeChat, which the U.S. government has declared security risks that might give personal information about American users to Chinese authorities.The Trump administration is pressing TikTok's owner to sell it and has ordered American companies to stop dealing with WeChat.The United States is ""violating international trade rules, and undermining the global industrial chain, supply chain, and value chain,"" said a ministry spokesperson, Zhao Lijian.Beijing will ""take necessary measures to safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese companies,"" Zhao said. Chinese officials frequently use that phrase during trade disputes but it often has been followed by no official action.Huawei declined to comment on the latest U.S. action.The president of its consumer unit, Richard Yu, said this month Huawei is running out of processor chips for its smartphones. Huawei designs its own chips but Yu said production of the most advanced, the Kirin series, would stop Sept. 15 because the company relies on outside manufacturers that use American technology.Huawei removed U.S.-supplied components from its main products following earlier sanctions that blocked access to American technology.This week's sanctions extends those controls to Asian and European components if their manufacturing process uses U.S. technology, which is common.Earlier U.S. sanctions blocked Huawei from loading Google's popular music and other services onto its smartphones. That has hurt their ability to compete in markets outside China.Huawei passed Samsung and Apple to become the biggest-selling smartphone brand for the first time in the three months ending in June thanks to strong sales in China's populous market, according to Canalys. Sales abroad fell 27 per cent from a year earlier.Huawei, founded in 1987 by a former military engineer, denies accusations it might facilitate Chinese spying. Chinese officials accuse Washington of using national security as an excuse to stop a competitor to U.S. tech industries.""The more hysterical the U.S. suppression of Huawei and other Chinese companies, the more it proves the success of these companies and the hypocrisy and arrogance of the United States,"" said Zhao, the foreign ministry spokesperson.""We urge the United States to immediately correct its mistakes, stop slandering China and stop suppressing Chinese companies,"" he said.""The Chinese government will continue to take necessary measures to safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese companies.""Vendors including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp., the biggest contract chip producer, have been scrutinizing their supply and manufacturing lines since the latest U.S. restrictions were proposed in May.Huawei is one of the biggest customers of U.S. and other suppliers of chips and components. They stand to lose billions of dollars in potential sales.Nicole Peng of industry research firm Canalys said vendors she contacted Tuesday were still examining their supply lines and whether they could do business with Huawei. She said some rely on the Chinese company for up to half their sales.""I would guess many are really worried,"" said Peng. ""In general, there is a lot of uncertainty, and they need time to respond."""
Trudeau confirms some cargo planes sent to China for pandemic supplies returned empty | CBC News,A cargo jet chartered by the federal government to deliver badly needed personal protective equipment from China was forced to leave the airport in Shanghai without the shipment on board.,2020-04-21T18:33:38.000Z,http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/pandemic-coronavirus-covid-china-shanghai-ppe-1.5539869,"A cargo jet chartered by the federal government to deliver badly needed personal protective equipment (PPE) from China was forced to leave the airport in Shanghai without the shipment on board.The precious cargo of pandemic supplies wasn't lost or bought out by another country. Instead, the government says delays caused by a spike in cargo flights meant the delivery trucks couldn't get to the Canadian plane on time, forcing it to return to Canada without its load.""This occurred due to on-the-ground congestion caused by a significant surge in cargo flights out of terminals at the Shanghai Airport. As a result, the intended cargo was unable to get to the plane before its required takeoff time,"" said Emily Harris, director of communications at Public Services and Procurement Canada.The cargo still belongs to Canada; it's in a leased warehouse in Shanghai and the government says it will be delivered on a later flight. In addition to the empty federal plane, a cargo jet leased by an unidentified provincial government also flew back to Canada yesterday without its cargo for the same reason.The missed deliveries are a setback for Canadian procurement efforts — but such supply interruptions don't mean the fragile PPE supply chain is completely broken.Harris said four flights arrived from China over the weekend carrying medical supplies, including N95 and surgical masks, protective coveralls and one key component in reagents for novel coronavirus testing. Those planes also carried supplies ordered by the province of Quebec and the Red Cross.Politics NewsConservative Leader Andrew Scheer raised the issue of empty flights in the House of Commons on Monday. Scheer asked Prime Minister Justin Trudeau twice about reports that three chartered planes sent by Canada to China to pick up medical equipment returned to the country empty Sunday.Trudeau did not deny the report, saying Canada, like other countries, has struggled to get orders filled at a time when the entire world is trying to buy the same pandemic supplies.This morning, Trudeau clarified the details during his daily media conference just outside Rideau Cottage. He said two planes came back empty, not three, and that one was chartered by a provincial government.Politics NewsTrudeau cited severe restrictions on the ground in China on how long a plane can stay at the airport before having to take off — whether it's full or not — as the reason the plane returned empty.""Supply lines and truck shipments to the airports are difficult and interrupted by checkpoints and quarantine measures,"" Trudeau said.""For the most part, we've been able to navigate through those and ensure that Canada has received the equipment that it needs, but these two airplanes were forced to take off empty.""Canada has taken steps to build its own supply network for PPE to avoid some of the chaos affecting the global supply chains. Canada's Ambassador to China Dominic Barton redeployed much of the staff at Canada's embassy, consulates and trade offices all over China to focus on buying medical supplies for Canada.The government also has hired two companies — Deloitte Canada and Bolloré Logistics — to identify reliable PPE manufacturers and to help with transportation, storage and customs clearances.These measures have allowed the federal government to deliver millions of masks and gloves to front line workers and to help bolster provincial procurement efforts.But the supply network is incredibly fragile and Harris said the setback with the empty planes shows the system needs some tweaks.""We are closely monitoring this issue and continue to work closely with officials in China, including Ambassador Barton and other diplomatic staff, to navigate the current, complex supply chain environment,"" she said. ""Steps are being taken to ensure that this does not occur moving forward."""
