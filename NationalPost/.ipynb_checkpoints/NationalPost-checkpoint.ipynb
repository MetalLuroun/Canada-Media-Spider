      "CONTENT : Chinese authorities have been trying for three years to reverse the devastating imbalances of their one-child policy and coax couples to have more children.They’ve told couples that it’s their patriotic duty to have two babies. They’ve dangled tax breaks and housing subsidies. They’ve offered to make education cheaper and parental leave longer. They’ve tried to make it more difficult to get an abortion or a divorce.None of this has worked. China’s birthrate remains stubbornly low, creating a demographic crisis that could hinder economic growth for decades to come.But now, an economics professor at Fudan University in Shanghai has come up with another — and, unsurprisingly, controversial — solution: allow women to have multiple husbands, and they’ll have multiple babies.\n",

      "CONTENT : NEW DELHI — India is considering a plan to build a 10 gigawatts (GW) hydropower project in a remote eastern state, an Indian official said on Tuesday, following reports that China could construct dams on a section of the Brahmaputra river.The river, also known as the Yarlung Tsangbo in China, flows from Tibet into India’s Arunachal Pradesh state and down through Assam to Bangladesh. Indian authorities are concerned Chinese projects could trigger flash floods or create water scarcity.“The need of the hour is to have a big dam in Arunachal Pradesh to mitigate the adverse impact of the Chinese dam projects,” T.S. Mehra, a senior official in India’s federal water ministry, told Reuters.“Our proposal is under consideration at the highest level in the government,” Mehra said, adding the Indian plan would create a large water storage capacity to offset the impact of Chinese dams on flows.Diplomatic relations between India and China are at a nadir, with troops locked in a border face-off in the western Himalayas for months.Some analysts warned that damming the Brahmaputra could potentially develop into another flashpoint, as Beijing’s dam building activities moved closer to the Indian border.\n",

      "CONTENT : Tomorrow, Canada marks a grim milestone. For two years, Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor will have been held hostage in China simply for being Canadian.While Canadians are rightfully concerned about the fate of our two wrongfully imprisoned citizens, China’s hostage diplomacy has awoken the Canadian public to a far larger reality. A realignment in geopolitics has taken place over the last 40 years, and Canada has been late to heed its warnings.For 40 years the great opening of China’s free market has not gone as we had hoped. And for the past 30 years, since tanks rolled into Tiananmen Square, the Western world has chosen to hope that things would get better.To this day, every business, public or private, remains subject to the strategic objectives of the Chinese state. This may not have been a big deal when China produced mainly low-tech goods like shoes and toothbrushes, but it has dramatic implications today as Chinese tech firms export facial recognition technology and surveillance drones. All Chinese firms are required by law to collaborate with Chinese intelligence agencies. Yes, that includes mining TikTok videos and feel-good apps for data. And it certainly concerns Huawei building our digital future.\n",

Everything should be under consideration to defend Canada and Canadians – including a boycott of the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics,” he said in an email.Chong pointed out that it is an option where this country has some leverage. “Canada is a winter sports powerhouse.

      "CONTENT : WASHINGTON — The United States on Wednesday slapped sanctions on Wan Kuok Kai, the leader of China’s 14K Triad organized crime group and a member of the Chinese Communist Party’s Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference, the U.S. Treasury said.The sanctions also apply to three entities headed by Wan, who is also known as “Broken Tooth,” the Treasury Department said in a statement.The U.S. government also designated two other individuals from Liberia and the Kyrgyz Republic to face sanctions.Treasury said it targeted Wan for his activities at the helm of the 14K Triad, saying the Chinese organized crime group was engaged in drug trafficking, illegal gambling, racketeering, human trafficking, and a range of other criminal activities.Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFCA) also designated three entities owned or controlled by Wan – the World Hongmen History and Culture Association, based in Cambodia; Dongmei Group, based in Hong Kong; and the Palau China Hung-Mun Cultural Association, based in Palau.It said the World Hongmen group had managed to co-opt elite figures in Malaysia and Cambodia, continuing a “pattern of overseas Chinese actors trying to paper over illegal criminal activities by framing their actions in terms of China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI)” and other major initiatives of the CCP.Treasury also designated Raimbek Matraimov, a former deputy of the Kyrgyz Customs Service, who it said had been involved in a customs scheme in which at least $700 million was laundered from the Kyrgyz Republic.In Africa, it designated Harry Varney Gboto-Nambi Sherman, now a prominent lawyer, Liberian senator and head of the Liberian Senate Judiciary Committee, who was indicted but later acquitted for his role in a bribery scheme in Liberia.

He is also a vice chairman of the National People’s Congress standing committee, the permanent body of the country’s rubber stamp parliament, which imposed a national security law for Hong Kong in June.AmCham, which represents major U.S. businesses in China, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday.China’s foreign ministry and the U.S. embassy in Beijing also did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n",

Its foreign ministry said on its website on Tuesday that Chinese vice foreign minister Zheng Zeguang had summoned the acting representative in the U.S. embassy to express “solemn protest and strong condemnation.”Zheng also threatened “reciprocal” retaliation from China.“U.S. barbaric actions will only invoke the intense anger of the Chinese people against anti-China forces in the United States and cause 1.4 billion Chinese people, including our compatriots in Hong Kong, to full recognize the U.S. devious intentions and strengthen the resolve of the Chinese government in implementing the Hong Kong National Security Law,” he said.Earlier on Tuesday, China’s Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office and Chinese foreign ministry’s office of the commissioner to Hong Kong issued separate condemnations of the U.S. sanctions.

      "CONTENT : WASHINGTON — U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Wednesday accused China of taking “incredibly aggressive action” in a recent clash with India over a disputed section of the nuclear-armed neighbors’ border, saying the incident could not be assessed in isolation.On the night of June 15, Chinese forces and Indian troops fought for hours with rods and clubs, resulting in a dramatic escalation that left 20 Indian soldiers killed, with some falling to their deaths in the freezing waters of the Galwan river in the western Himalayas.On Monday, Indian government sources said China began pulling back troops from along the border with India, after weeks of talks between senior military officials on how to ease tensions. China has yet to confirm whether it suffered casualties but the Indian deaths were the highest along the border in more than five decades.“The Chinese took incredibly aggressive action and the Indians have done their best to respond to that,” Pompeo said in a news conference at the State Department. “I put this in the context of General Secretary Xi Jinping and his behavior throughout the region, throughout the world,” he said.\n",

While such missions happen regularly, for China to talk about them publicly is unusual.China’s Defence Ministry said the U-2 flew without permission over a no-fly zone in the northern military region where live fire drills were taking place, “seriously interfering in normal exercise activities.”This could easily have caused a misunderstanding or misjudgement or an “unexpected incident,” the ministry added.“It was an act of naked provocation, and China is resolutely opposed to it, and have already lodged stern representations with the U.S. side.”In a statement, the U.S. military said a U-2 flight was conducted in the Indo-Pacific region and it was “within the accepted international rules and regulations governing aircraft flights.”“Pacific Air Forces personnel will continue to fly and operate anywhere international law allows, at the time and tempo of our choosing,” the U.S. military said in the statement.\n",

While such missions happen regularly, for China to talk about them publicly is unusual.China’s Defence Ministry said the U-2 flew without permission over a no-fly zone in the northern military region where live fire drills were taking place, “seriously interfering in normal exercise activities.”This could easily have caused a misunderstanding or misjudgement or an “unexpected incident,” the ministry added.“It was an act of naked provocation, and China is resolutely opposed to it, and have already lodged stern representations with the U.S. side.”In a statement, the U.S. military said a U-2 flight was conducted in the Indo-Pacific region and it was “within the accepted international rules and regulations governing aircraft flights.”“Pacific Air Forces personnel will continue to fly and operate anywhere international law allows, at the time and tempo of our choosing,” the U.S. military said in the statement.\n",

      "CONTENT : JAKARTA/HANOI — The coronavirus outbreak has stoked a wave of anti-China sentiment around the globe, from shops barring entry to Chinese tourists, online vitriol mocking the country’s exotic meat trade and surprise health checks on foreign workers.The virus, which originated in China, has spread to more than a dozen countries, many of them in Southeast Asia which has sensitive relations with China amid concerns about Beijing’s vast infrastructure spending and political clout in the region and sovereignty disputes in the South China Sea.Authorities and schools in Toronto, Canada, were moved to warn against discrimination towards Chinese Canadians, while in Europe there was anecdotal evidence of Chinese residents facing prejudice in the street, and hostile newspaper headlines.“Orientalist assumptions plus political distrust plus health concerns are a pretty powerful combination,” said Charlotte Setijadi, and anthropologist who teaches at Singapore Management University.\n",

      "CONTENT : SEOUL — China’s efforts to win an international certification for Pao Cai, a pickled vegetable dish from Sichuan, is turning into a social media showdown between Chinese and South Korean netizens over the origin of Kimchi, a staple Korean cuisine made of cabbage.Beijing recently won a certification from the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) for Pao Cai, an achievement the state-run Global Times reported as “an international standard for the Kimchi industry led by China.”South Korean media was fast to dispute such a claim and accuse the bigger neighbor of trying to make Kimchi a type of China-made Pao Cai.The episode triggered anger on South Korean social media. “Its total nonsense, what a thief stealing our culture!” a South Korean netizen wrote on Naver.com, a widely popular web portal.“I read a media story that China now says Kimchi is theirs, and that they are making international standard for it, It’s absurd. I’m worried that they might steal Hanbok and other cultural contents, not just Kimchi,” said Kim Seol-ha, a 28-year old in Seoul.Some South Korean media even described the episode as China’s “bid for world domination,” while some social media comments flagged concerns that Beijing was exercising “economic coercison.”\n",

The Chinese government responded with “education and training centres” where “students” learn Chinese and labour skills to help them find jobs, he said. When he was asked about footage screened by the BBC of hundreds of detainees lined up at a railway depot, Cong said it was merely a prisoner transfer. “That is normal procedure … a very common practice,” he said. “The focus has been on so-called concentration camps but there are none of them.”\n",

      "CONTENT : HANOI — The United States this week hardened its position on the South China Sea, where it has accused China of attempting to build a “maritime empire” in the potentially energy-rich waters, despite regional concerns.The rivals have accused each other of stoking tension in the strategic waterway at a time of strained relations over everything from the new coronavirus to trade to Hong Kong.A statement from U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on July 13 was the first time the United States had called China’s claims in the sea unlawful and accused Beijing of a “campaign of bullying.”But heated rhetoric has also been on the rise in the region, where Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam challenge China’s claim to about 90% of the sea.REGIONAL TENSIONSVietnam, frequently at loggerheads with China over the issue, is this year chairing the 10-member Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN).\n",

      "CONTENT : BEIJING — China summoned the acting top U.S. diplomat in Beijing on Tuesday to protest U.S. sanctions on Chinese officials over Hong Kong, and vowed to take “reciprocal” retaliation.The United States on Monday imposed financial sanctions and a travel ban on 14 Chinese officials over their role in adopting a national security law for Hong Kong and Beijing’s disqualification last month of elected opposition legislators in Hong Kong.This is likely the first time that all 14 vice chairpersons of China’s lawmaking body, the National People’s Congress, have come under U.S. sanctions.The sanctions came just after China’s top diplomat Wang Yi urged the United States to maintain dialog at all levels and encourage exchanges between legislators and other groupings of people.China criticized the sanctions. Its foreign ministry said on its website on Tuesday that Chinese vice foreign minister Zheng Zeguang had summoned the acting representative in the U.S. embassy to express “solemn protest and strong condemnation.”In a statement on its website, the U.S. embassy said its Chargé d’Affaires Robert Forden told Zheng that Beijing has used the law repeatedly to suppress freedom of expression and assembly in Hong Kong and to arrest Hong Kong residents who have peacefully raised their concerns over Beijing’s oppressive policies.\n",

Beijing has never renounced the use of force to bring Taiwan under its control.Attending the commissioning of the domestically made, T$1.05 billion ($37.30 million) Anping in the southern city of Kaohsiung, Tsai praised its “specific” ability of being able to be used in time of conflict.“If necessary, it can be immediately be transformed into an important force for defense,” she said at the shipyard, where she also named the second ship to follow the Anping, the Chengkung.“This also means that while the coastguard strengthens law enforcement, national defense forces will be strengthened too.”The Anping is a similar vessel to the Tuo Chiang-class of corvettes, on which it is based, and has space for launchers for Hsiung Feng anti-ship and sea-to-land missiles but has added equipment for rescue operations.The Tuo Chiang vessels are state-of-the-art, highly maneuverable stealth vessels, meant to take out larger warships while operating close to Taiwan’s shores.\n",

We will continue to consolidate our security partnership with the United States.”\n",

      "CONTENT : WASHINGTON — China has been more transparent about the coronavirus than it has been in previous crises but Beijing has not yet accepted a U.S. offer of help to contain the epidemic, White House national security adviser Robert O’Brien said on Sunday.“So far the Chinese have been more transparent certainly than in past crises and we appreciate that,” O’Brien said in an interview with CBS’ “Face the Nation.”However, Beijing has still not responded to U.S. offers of help from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other health professionals to help contain the fast-moving, flu-like virus that has killed more than 300 people in China.“We have not heard back yet from the Chinese on those offers but we are prepared to continue to cooperate with them,” O’Brien said.“We’ve got tremendous expertise. This is a worldwide concern. We want to help our Chinese colleagues if we can and we’ve made the offer and we’ll see if they accept the offer.”\n",

That made China the fifth country to send satellites into orbit following the Soviet Union, the United States, France and Japan.Nov. 26, 1975: China’s first recoverable satellite was successfully launched and returned to Earth.Nov. 20, 1999: China successfully launched its first unmanned spacecraft, the Shenzhou 1, at the Jiuquan launch center. The country launched another three unmanned spaceships in 2001 and 2002 in preparation for a manned spacecraft.Oct. 15, 2003: China became the third country after the United States and Russia to send a man into space with its own rocket. Astronaut Yang Liwei spent about 21 hours in space aboard the Shenzhou-5 spacecraft.\n",

It fully exposes the Cold-War mentality and political prejudice of some Australian departments and officials,” a Xinhua spokesperson said, according to the agency.“What they have done not only seriously harms the reputation and image of Chinese media, but also seriously interferes with the normal people-to-people exchanges between China and Australia,” added the spokesperson, who was not identified.\n",

President-elect Joe Biden takes over on January 20.The State Department and the White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Up to 14 people, including officials of China’s parliament, or National People’s Congress, and members of the CCP, would likely be targeted by measures such as asset freezes and financial sanctions, two sources said.The U.S. official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said multiple individuals would be sanctioned. A person familiar with the matter said the group would likely include officials from Hong Kong as well as the mainland. The sources did not provide names or positions of those being targeted for sanctions. Two sources cautioned an announcement could still be delayed until later in the week.\n",

      "CONTENT : SYDNEY — Australia will begin screening passengers arriving from a Chinese city in a bid to stop the spread of a new virus, the country’s chief medical officer said on Tuesday, although authorities warned that an outbreak would be hard to prevent.Chinese authorities have confirmed more than 200 people have caught the coronavirus, which can cause a type of pneumonia that has killed four people in the central city of Wuhan.The virus – which can pass from person to person – broke out in Wuhan but four cases have been reported in Thailand, Japan and South Korea, raising concerns about its spread through international air travel.Brendan Murphy, the chief medical officer for the Australian government, said biosecurity officials would begin screening passengers arriving on the three weekly flights to Sydney from Wuhan starting on Thursday.Passengers would be given an information pamphlet and asked to present themselves if they had a fever or suspected they might have the disease.\n",

But the list comprises China Construction Technology Co Ltd and China International Engineering Consulting Corp, in addition to Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp (SMIC) and China National Offshore Oil Corp (CNOOC), according to the document and three sources.The Defense Department (DOD) did not respond to a request for comment.The move, coupled with similar policies, is seen as seeking to cement outgoing Republican President Donald Trump’s tough-on-China legacy and to box incoming Democrat Biden into hardline positions on Beijing amid bipartisan anti-China sentiment in Congress.\n",

President-elect Joe Biden takes over on January 20.The State Department and the White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Up to 14 people, including officials of China’s parliament, or National People’s Congress, and members of the CCP, would likely be targeted by measures such as asset freezes and financial sanctions, two sources said.The U.S. official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said multiple individuals would be sanctioned. A person familiar with the matter said the group would likely include officials from Hong Kong as well as the mainland. The sources did not provide names or positions of those being targeted for sanctions. Two sources cautioned an announcement could still be delayed until later in the week.\n",

      "CONTENT : BEIJING — China’s military said on Wednesday the latest U.S. navy sailing near Chinese-claimed Taiwan was “extremely dangerous” and stirring up such trouble was in neither country’s interests.The U.S. guided-missile destroyer USS Mustin sailed through the narrow and sensitive Taiwan Strait on Tuesday, the U.S. navy said, in what have become relatively routine trips in recent months, though they always anger China.The Eastern Theatre Command of China’s People’s Liberation Army said its air and naval forces followed and monitored the U.S. ship throughout its voyage.“Any words or deeds that … cause trouble in the Taiwan Strait are not in line with the fundamental interests of China and the United States, harm the well-being of compatriots on both sides of the strait, pose real threats to peace and stability in the region and are extremely dangerous,” it said.Chinese forces will remain on high alert at all times to safeguard China’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, it added.Taiwan’s defense ministry said the U.S. ship was on an “ordinary mission” and passed through the Taiwan Strait in a southerly direction.The sailing comes a week after U.S. Health Secretary Alex Azar visited Taiwan, the highest level U.S. official to travel to the island since Washington broke off diplomatic ties with Taipei in favor of Beijing in 1979.China responded by sending fighter jets close to Taiwan.China considers Taiwan a purely domestic matter, and routinely calls it the most sensitive and important issue in its relations with the United States.

      "CONTENT : NEW DELHI — China will take into consideration the interest of other countries before firming up any plan to develop a dam on the Yarlung Tsangbo river, which flows into India and Bangladesh, a Chinese official in New Delhi said on Wednesday.On Monday, Chinese state media reported the country could build up to 60 gigawatts (GW) of hydropower capacity in the lower reaches of the river, known as the Brahmaputra in India.The report raised concerns in India and Bangladesh, with authorities fearing that Chinese projects could trigger flash floods or create intense water scarcity.Ji Rong, an official at the Chinese embassy in New Delhi, said that downstream development of the river was at a “preliminary planning and demonstration” stage.“Any project will undergo scientific planning and demonstration with full consideration for the impact on the downstream areas and the interests of both upstream and downstream countries,” she said in a statement.The Brahmaputra is one of India’s largest and most important rivers, cutting through the northeastern part of the country, before entering Bangladesh.To offset any upstream Chinese construction, India is considering building a 10 GW hydropower project in the remote eastern state of Arunachal Pradesh, an Indian official said on Tuesday.Diplomatic relations between the neighboring nuclear powers are strained after clashes on a remote Himalayan border this summer, where thousands on troops remained deployed in the biting cold.

She’s out on bail while fighting extradition to the United States on fraud charges. Last week, her lawyers’ first round of arguments was thrown out by a B.C. judge, meaning the case continues.Nine days after Meng’s arrest, Chinese authorities sent Kovrig, an ex-diplomat working for the International Crisis Group, and Spavor, an entrepreneur who did business in North Korea, to prison. They are accused of violating China’s national security interests, but Canadian argues the men have been “arbitrarily detained.”\n",

Something called CGTN, whose slogan is “See the difference,” snarled that “Zhao Lijian told no lies about Australia,” above an op-ed that uses language that is, well, a red flag.“Co-Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying … defended Zhao’s tweet, stating that Australia needs to ‘do some soul-searching’ and that ‘it is Australian soldiers who committed such cruel crimes,’ ” it begins.

      "CONTENT : HONG KONG — Hong Kong police arrested eight more activists on Tuesday over an anti-government protest in July, the latest move by authorities in a relentless crackdown on opposition forces in the Chinese-ruled city.The police did not identify the people, saying only that they were aged between 24 and 64. Local media said former pro-democracy lawmaker and veteran activist Leung Kwok-hung, known as Long Hair, was among those arrested.The move comes a day after eight people aged between 16 and 34 were arrested, including three on suspicion of violating a sweeping national security law, over a brief demonstration at a university campus last month.Hong Kong police fired water cannon and tear gas to disperse protesters on July 1, the anniversary of the former British colony’s handover to Chinese rule, as thousands demonstrated despite a police ban on the annual protest.More than 300 were arrested in the rally that came after Beijing imposed security legislation on its freest city, saying it was vital to plug gaping holes in national security defenses exposed by months of sometimes violent anti-government protests that rocked the city over the last year.The law punishes what Beijing broadly defines as secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces with up to life in jail.Opposition politicians and Western governments fear the law is being used to suppress dissent and erode wide-ranging freedoms guaranteed to the former British colony when it returned to Chinese rule in 1997.On Monday, the United States announced further sanctions to punish Beijing for imposing the law on Hong Kong, escalating tensions between the two sides.

It fully exposes the Cold-War mentality and political prejudice of some Australian departments and officials,” a Xinhua spokesperson said, according to the agency.“What they have done not only seriously harms the reputation and image of Chinese media, but also seriously interferes with the normal people-to-people exchanges between China and Australia,” added the spokesperson, who was not identified.\n",

      "CONTENT : WASHINGTON — The U.S. national security adviser said on Friday that China was perpetrating “something close to” a genocide with its treatment of Muslims in its Xinjiang region.“If not a genocide, something close to it going on in Xinjiang,” Robert O’Brien told an online event hosted by the Aspen Institute, while highlighting other Chinese crackdowns including one on Hong Kong’s pro-democracy movement.The United States has denounced China’s treatment of Uighur and other minority Muslims in Xinjiang and imposed sanctions on officials it blames for abuses. It has not, though, so far termed Beijing’s actions genocide, a designation that would have significant legal implications and require stronger action against China.The United Nations estimates that more than a million Muslims have been detained in Xinjiang and activists say crimes against humanity and genocide are taking place there. China has denied any abuses and says its camps in the region provide vocational training and help fight extremism.O’Brien referred to seizures by U.S. customs of “massive numbers” of hair products made with human hair from Xinjiang.“The Chinese are literally shaving the heads of Uighur women and making hair products and sending them to the United States,” he said.\n",

      "CONTENT : VANCOUVER — A recent decision by the consulate-general of the People’s Republic of China to form a corps of citizen volunteers in this city is raising concerns about improper foreign interference in Canadian affairs.The volunteer group, whose recruits include some prominent Chinese-Canadian community leaders, was ostensibly created to assist Chinese nationals who run into legal trouble or physical danger in Canada. Being a consular volunteer is an “honour and a responsibility” and in keeping with the “watchful solidarity of the Chinese people,” says a recent posting on the consulate’s website.But some China watchers are suspicious of the initiative.“I believe that there’s more to the consulate’s efforts than simply training consular volunteers, and that they may be looking to enlist Chinese citizens, and even Canadians, to promote the Communist Party’s political agenda,” said David Mulroney, Canada’s former ambassador to China and a senior fellow at the University of Toronto’s Munk School of Global Affairs.\n",

That was a violation of the terms of the grants, they said.They said Wang is a Chinese-born U.S. citizen specializing in genetics and cardiovascular disease who has been affiliated with the Cleveland Clinic since 1997.“Dr. Wang deliberately failed to disclose his Chinese grants and foreign positions and even engaged in a pervasive pattern of fraud to avoid criminal culpability,” said Eric Smith, head of the FBI’s Cleveland office.\n",

See the Potential. Know the Challenge,” the government website is designed as a guide for digital and tech firms, encouraging good practice and raising awareness of potential issues.“The UK is determined to support our businesses to engage with China in a way that reflects the UK’s values and takes account of national security concerns,” digital minister Caroline Dinenage said in a Nov. 6 statement.Alongside case studies, guides on how to conduct due diligence and links to specialist consultancies, the site contains some warnings.\n",

      "CONTENT : WASHINGTON — A Chinese-born former employee of the Cleveland Clinic was arrested on fraud charges related to $3.6 million in federal grants, the FBI said on Thursday, the latest move in a U.S. crackdown on alleged attempts by China to steal American scientific advances.The FBI and other federal enforcement agencies searched the Shaker Heights, Ohio, home of Dr. Qing Wang, and arrested him on charges of false claims and wire fraud on Wednesday.Prosecutors said Wang accepted grants from the National Institutes of Health without disclosing that he was serving at same time as dean of the College of Life Sciences and Technology at the Huazhong University of Science and Technology. That was a violation of the terms of the grants, they said.They said Wang is a Chinese-born U.S. citizen specializing in genetics and cardiovascular disease who has been affiliated with the Cleveland Clinic since 1997.\n",

      "CONTENT : OTTAWA — Two Canadian men who have been detained by China for more than two years, in what Canada sees as retribution for its arrest of a Chinese executive, are in good mental and physical condition, Ottawa’s ambassador to Beijing said on Tuesday.China arrested businessman Michael Spavor and former diplomat Michael Kovrig in early December 2018, shortly after Canadian police picked up Huawei Technologies Co Ltd Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou on a U.S. warrant. The two men face spying charges.“They are both very healthy, physically and mentally,” Ambassador Dominic Barton told a special parliamentary committee on Canada’s ties with China.“I am deeply inspired by their resilience and their mindset – it’s incredible given what they’re going through … they are very, very strong and it’s remarkable,” he added.The affair has badly damaged bilateral relations. Canada, which says the return of the two men is a priority, condemns what it calls “hostage diplomacy” and dismisses Beijing’s insistence that the detentions are not linked to Meng’s arrest.Canada is trying to balance demands for the return of the two men and the insistence China improve its human rights record with what it says is the need to talk to Beijing about economic ties and climate change.\n",

Local media said former pro-democracy lawmaker and veteran activist Leung Kwok-hung, known as Long Hair, was among those arrested.The move comes a day after eight people aged between 16 and 34 were arrested, including three on suspicion of violating a sweeping national security law, over a brief demonstration at a university campus last month.Beijing imposed the legislation on its freest city in June, saying it was vital to plug gaping holes in national security defenses exposed by months of sometimes violent anti-government and anti-China protests that rocked the city over the last year.The law punishes what Beijing broadly defines as secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces with up to life in jail.Opposition politicians and Western governments fear the law is being used to suppress dissent and erode wide-ranging freedoms guaranteed to the former British colony when it returned to Chinese rule in 1997.On Monday, the United States announced further sanctions to punish Beijing for imposing the law on Hong Kong, escalating tensions between the two sides.

      "CONTENT : SHANGHAI — Raids on Chinese journalists living in Australia are “utterly appalling” and damage relations between the two countries, state news agency Xinhua said.China’s state-backed tabloid Global Times reported earlier this week that Australian authorities raided the homes of four Chinese journalists residing in the country in June.“This gross, imperious and unreasonable act was utterly appalling. It fully exposes the Cold-War mentality and political prejudice of some Australian departments and officials,” a Xinhua spokesperson said, according to the agency.“What they have done not only seriously harms the reputation and image of Chinese media, but also seriously interferes with the normal people-to-people exchanges between China and Australia,” added the spokesperson, who was not identified.On Thursday, foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said that such action from Australia “blatantly violates the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese journalists there and caused severe harm to the physical and mental health of the journalists and their families.”Australia’s trade minister on Friday responded to the reports saying that security agencies had acted in accordance with the law.Relations between the two major trading partners have become increasingly strained and news of the raids coincided with the exit of two Australian journalists from China.The pair returned home with the help of consular officials after China’s state security visited their residences in Beijing and Shanghai and questioned them.Another Australian citizen, Chinese television anchor Cheng Lei, was detained by Chinese authorities in August.

      "CONTENT : OTTAWA — Chinese telecom giant Huawei rose to dominance by stealing the technology of the defunct Canadian firm Nortel, Conservative Leader Erin O’Toole says.O’Toole levelled the industrial-espionage charge against Huawei and the Chinese Communist Party on Tuesday as he announced that the Conservatives are pushing the Liberals to decide within 30 days which companies can provide Canada’s next-generation 5G wireless internet technology.“The rise of Huawei was itself facilitated by years of industrial espionage conducted by China against Nortel,” O’Toole told a press conference on Parliament Hill.“Intellectual-property theft, counterfeiting and digital piracy are not exceptions to our dealings with China. They are the reality, and it’s high time our government and many corporate leaders realize that,” the Conservative leader added.“We may have lost Nortel to Huawei â¦ but we can and must learn from it. Because if we don’t, we have to accept that another company will be next.”Nortel Networks Corp., a once mighty Canadian telecom giant, filed for bankruptcy in 2009, becoming one of the country’s most spectacular business failures. Two years later, Nortel executed the biggest patent sale in history, raising billions in cash, when it auctioned off 6,000 patents to a consortium that included Apple and Microsoft.\n",

      "CONTENT : WASHINGTON — The United States on Monday imposed financial sanctions and a travel ban on 14 Chinese officials over their alleged role in Beijing’s disqualification last month of elected opposition legislators in Hong Kong.The move, which was first reported by Reuters overnight and sent Asian stock markets lower, targeted the vice chairpersons of the National People’s Congress Standing Committee (NPCSC), the top decision-making body of the Chinese legislature.The action was widely seen as part of an effort by outgoing President Donald Trump to cement his tough-on-China legacy and also box president-elect Joe Biden, before he takes office on Jan. 20, into hardline positions on Beijing at a time of bipartisan anti-China sentiment in Congress.The Trump administration earlier slapped sanctions on Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam, the Asian financial hub’s current and former police chiefs and other top officials in August for what it said was their role in curtailing freedoms in a crackdown on the territory’s pro-democracy movement.“Beijing’s unrelenting assault against Hong Kong’s democratic processes has gutted its Legislative Council, rendering the body a rubber stamp devoid of meaningful opposition,” U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement.\n",

      "CONTENT : BEIJING — China’s defense spending this year will rise 6.6% from 2019, according to a report issued at the opening of the country’s annual meeting of parliament on Friday, a slower rate than last year.The figure, set at 1.268 trillion yuan ($178.16 billion), is closely watched as a barometer of how aggressively the country will beef up its military capabilities.China set a 7.5% rise for the defense budget in 2019, outpacing what ended up as full-year gross domestic product (GDP) growth of 6.1% in the world’s second-largest economy.China’s economy shrank 6.8% in the first quarter of 2020 compared with a year earlier, as the novel coronavirus spread from the central city of Wuhan, where it emerged late last year.China omitted a 2020 economic growth target for the first time and pledged government support for the economy in Premier Li Keqiang’s work report on Friday, launching the country’s annual parliament meeting.\n",

      "CONTENT : VANCOUVER — A recent decision by the consulate-general of the People’s Republic of China to form a corps of citizen volunteers in this city is raising concerns about improper foreign interference in Canadian affairs.The volunteer group, whose recruits include some prominent Chinese-Canadian community leaders, was ostensibly created to assist Chinese nationals who run into legal trouble or physical danger in Canada. Being a consular volunteer is an “honour and a responsibility” and in keeping with the “watchful solidarity of the Chinese people,” says a recent posting on the consulate’s website.But some China watchers are suspicious of the initiative.“I believe that there’s more to the consulate’s efforts than simply training consular volunteers, and that they may be looking to enlist Chinese citizens, and even Canadians, to promote the Communist Party’s political agenda,” said David Mulroney, Canada’s former ambassador to China and a senior fellow at the University of Toronto’s Munk School of Global Affairs.\n",

And let’s disagree when we must,” Chapuis said.“We need to have a common understanding to say ‘no’ to bullying and intimidation, coercive diplomacy, ‘wolf-warrior’ diplomacy,” he said, referring to China’s increasingly assertive foreign policy.Chapuis also called for European countries to work with Australia, New Zealand and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to “find common ground” about the disputed South China Sea.China claims almost the entire South China Sea and warns other countries not to interfere in its dealings with Southeast Asian countries that also claim parts of the waterway and worry about China’s increasingly militarized presence there.“Freedom of navigation is essential. The South China Sea is not only a China issue, it is an international issue,” Chapuis said. (Reporting by Yew Lun Tian and Muyu Xu Editing by Robert Birsel)\n",

They are very emotional and concerned and they have decided to cancel the parade that was scheduled for this afternoon at Place de la Republique,” Hidalgo said on Europe 1 radio.“They are really not in a mood to party now,” she added.The city of Bordeaux in southwest France on Saturday also canceled planned Chinese New Year festivities in order to limit infection risk and as a gesture of support to the victims in China, its mayor said.On Sunday, China said the death toll from the virus has risen to 56 and that 1,975 people have been infected.A scattering of cases have been confirmed abroad, including in France, where three people have been infected, all Chinese nationals. Two are in hospital in Paris, one in Bordeaux.Chinese New Year celebrations in Rome, originally set for Feb. 2, have also been postponed to a future date, a spokeswoman for the Chinese community in the city told Ansa news agency on Sunday.“All the community agreed the celebrations should be postponed because there are people who are sick and it’s not the case to celebrate,” Lucia King said.

He was seized by plainclothes police while with Swedish diplomats.Gui’s situation soured relations between Sweden and China in the months leading up to Monday’s sentencing, with Chinese officials warning Swedish counterparts of meddling in Chinese internal affairs.Swedish foreign ministry officials, who had demanded his release, have yet to comment. The Ningbo court statement said Gui, 55, had stated that he would not appeal the sentence and had asked to have his Chinese citizenship reinstated. Chinese officials objected to Svenska PEN, a literary organization, awarding Gui Minhai the 2019 Tulcholsky Prize, praising his service to free speech.\n",

The Chinese foreign ministry did not immediately response to a request for comment.Commercial Aircraft Corp of China Ltd (COMAC), which is spearheading Chinese efforts to compete with Boeing and Airbus, is on the list, as is Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC) and 10 of its related entities.The list is included in a draft rule that identifies Chinese and Russian companies the U.S. considers “military end users,” a designation that means U.S. suppliers must seek licenses to sell a broad swath of commercially available items to them.According to the rule, applications for such licenses are more likely to be denied than granted.U.S President Donald Trump has stepped up his actions in recent months against China. Ten days ago, he unveiled an executive order prohibiting U.S. investments in Chinese companies that Washington says are owned or controlled by the Chinese military.\n",

They have also clashed over Hong Kong, human rights, trade and U.S. support for Chinese-claimed Taiwan.State Councillor Wang, speaking at his annual news conference, said China and the United States need to start coordinating macro policies for their respective economies as well as the world economy.The United States should stop wasting precious time, said Wang, who is also China’s foreign minister.China remains prepared to work with the United States in the spirit of cooperation and mutual respect, he told reporters.

      "CONTENT : An aggressive campaign by American authorities to root out Chinese espionage operations in the United States has snared a growing group of Chinese government officials, business people, and academics pursuing American secrets.In 2019 alone, public records show U.S. authorities arrested and expelled two Chinese diplomats who allegedly drove onto a military base in Virginia. They also caught and jailed former CIA and Defense Intelligence Agency officials on espionage charges linked to China.On Thursday, U.S. Attorney General William Barr, FBI director Christopher Wray and U.S. counterintelligence chief William Evanina will address a Washington conference on U.S. efforts to counter Chinese “economic malfeasance” involving espionage and the theft of U.S. technological and scientific secrets.China’s efforts to steal unclassified American technology, ranging from military secrets to medical research, have long been thought to be extensive and aggressive, but U.S. officials only launched a broad effort to stop alleged Chinese espionage in the United States in 2018.\n",

He was seized by plainclothes police while with Swedish diplomats.Gui’s situation soured relations between Sweden and China in the months leading up to Monday’s sentencing, with Chinese officials warning Swedish counterparts of meddling in Chinese internal affairs.Swedish foreign ministry officials, who had demanded his release, have yet to comment. The Ningbo court statement said Gui, 55, had stated that he would not appeal the sentence and had asked to have his Chinese citizenship reinstated. Chinese officials objected to Svenska PEN, a literary organization, awarding Gui Minhai the 2019 Tulcholsky Prize, praising his service to free speech.\n",

      "CONTENT : WASHINGTON — The United States on Monday imposed financial sanctions and a travel ban on 14 Chinese officials over their alleged role in Beijing’s disqualification last month of elected opposition legislators in Hong Kong.The move, which was first reported by Reuters overnight and sent Asian stock markets lower, targeted the vice chairpersons of the National People’s Congress Standing Committee (NPCSC), the top decision-making body of the Chinese legislature.The action was widely seen as part of an effort by outgoing President Donald Trump to cement his tough-on-China legacy and also box president-elect Joe Biden, before he takes office on Jan. 20, into hardline positions on Beijing at a time of bipartisan anti-China sentiment in Congress.The Trump administration earlier slapped sanctions on Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam, the Asian financial hub’s current and former police chiefs and other top officials in August for what it said was their role in curtailing freedoms in a crackdown on the territory’s pro-democracy movement.“Beijing’s unrelenting assault against Hong Kong’s democratic processes has gutted its Legislative Council, rendering the body a rubber stamp devoid of meaningful opposition,” U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement.\n",

But investigators found photos of her in a Chinese military uniform and discovered she had worked as a researcher at China’s Air Force Military Medical University.The Federal Bureau of Investigation questioned her on June 20 and afterward she went to the consulate where the FBI believes she has remained.She was charged with visa fraud on June 26. U.S. law enforcement cannot enter a foreign embassy or consulate unless invited, and certain top officials such as ambassadors have diplomatic immunity.The Chinese consulate in San Francisco and Tang could not be immediately reached for comment. The U.S. State Department did not reply to a request for comment.The news, first reported by Axios, comes as U.S.-China tensions flare, with the United States giving China 72 hours to close its consulate in Houston amid accusations of spying.\n",

      "CONTENT : PHNOM PENH — Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen said on Tuesday he will visit Cambodian students in the Chinese city of Wuhan, the epicenter of an outbreak of a new coronavirus, to give them moral support following criticism of his decision not to repatriate them.The outbreak has killed more than 420 people, most of them in the central Chinese province of Hubei, of which Wuhan is capital, and many countries have been sending aircraft to bring their citizens out and cutting travel links with China.Hun Sen, a close ally of China, said he would fly there on Wednesday from South Korea, where he is attending a summit, and that he had informed Chinese authorities of his trip.He said in a post on his Facebook page he would visit the students to “to show them warmth and to make sure they are not scared of the new type of infectious coronavirus.”Cambodia, which has a large community of expatriate Chinese people, reported its single case of the virus last week, a Chinese man who came with his family from Wuhan to the coastal city of Sihanoukville last month.Last week, Hun Sen said the coronavirus was under control in Cambodia despite public fears.He also said Cambodia would allow flights from China and would not evacuate Cambodian students and diplomats, sparking public criticism that he was not doing enough to help them.(Reporting by Prak Chan Thul Writing by Patpicha Tanakasempipat Editing by Robert Birsel)\n",

According to NPD Group, one of the largest market research firms in the world, consumption was up five per cent last year, translating into approximately a billion servings of wings being eaten across North America. While the reasons for the chicken wing boom are myriad — more specialty takeout restaurants, innovative dressings and culturally relevant associations — my personal taste for drums and flats runs deeper than current trendiness. Increase the heat of your wings to dizzying levels, drown them in infused honey-garlic sauce or layer them in lemon and pepper (wet, obviously) all you want, but I will always take a simpler option.I have pledged my loyalty to the Chinese takeout chicken wing. There’s nothing sensational or gimmicky about this chicken wing. It isn’t dressed up in any special way. It’s perfectly fried with just the right amount of salt and pepper seasoning. The perfect chicken wing. \n",

      "CONTENT : WASHINGTON/BEIJING — The United States imposed financial sanctions and a travel ban on 14 Chinese officials over their alleged role in Beijing’s disqualification last month of elected opposition legislators in Hong Kong, prompting China to say it will retaliate.Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told a news briefing on Tuesday that Beijing would take “firm counter-measures against the malicious actions by the U.S. to safeguard our sovereignty, security and developmental rights.”She also urged the United States to withdraw the decision.The U.S. move announced on Monday, which was first reported by Reuters, targeted the vice chairpersons of the National People’s Congress Standing Committee (NPCSC), the top decision-making body of the Chinese legislature.The action was widely seen as part of an effort by outgoing President Donald Trump to cement his tough-on-China legacy and also box president-elect Joe Biden, before he takes office on Jan. 20, into hardline positions on Beijing at a time of bipartisan anti-China sentiment in Congress.The Trump administration earlier slapped sanctions on Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam, the Asian financial hub’s current and former police chiefs and other top officials in August for what it said was their role in curtailing freedoms in a crackdown on the territory’s pro-democracy movement.\n",

      "CONTENT : The Asian Football Confederation (AFC) has changed the order of home matches to be played by Chinese clubs in the AFC Champions League group stage due to the outbreak of a new coronavirus in the country, Asian soccer’s governing body said on Wednesday.The move follows consultation with the Chinese Football Association (CFA) and means that home games of the four Chinese clubs on the first three match days will be rescheduled and played away by swapping the order with their opponents.“The decision, which was also made in conjunction with the competing clubs from the respective groups, is a precautionary measure to ensure the safety and well-being of all participating players and teams,” the AFC said in a statement.The outbreak has killed over 130 people with almost 6,000 others affected by the flu-like virus that emerged late last year in Wuhan in the central Hubei province.According to the revised schedule, Beijing Guoan will open their campaign at FC Seoul on Feb. 11 and visit Melbourne Victory on March 3.\n",

Their son Lufty was born in Xinjiang, and granted Australian citizenship in 2019, after Abdusalamu urged the Australian government to help the family.In February, after China’s deputy head of mission in Australia, Wang Xining, said on ABC Television Wumaier didn’t want to leave Xinjiang, she posted a photograph to Twitter holding a sign saying ‘I want to leave and be with my husband’.Payne said in July the Australian embassy in Beijing had formally requested the Chinese authorities allow Wumaier, a Chinese citizen, to leave.\n",

      "CONTENT : WENCHANG — China on Tuesday launched a robotic spacecraft to bring back rocks from the moon in the first bid by any country to retrieve samples from the lunar surface since the 1970s, a mission that underscores Chinese ambitions in space.The Long March-5, China’s largest carrier rocket, blasted off at 4:30 a.m. Beijing time (2030 GMT on Monday) in a pre-dawn launch from Wenchang Space Launch Center on the southern Chinese island of Hainan carrying the Chang’e-5 spacecraft.The Chang’e-5 mission, named after the ancient Chinese goddess of the moon, will seek to collect lunar material to help scientists understand more about the moon’s origins and formation. The mission will test China’s ability to remotely acquire samples from space, ahead of more complex missions.If successful, the mission would make China only the third country to have retrieved lunar samples, joining the United States and the Soviet Union.Upon entering the moon’s orbit, the spacecraft is intended to deploy a pair of vehicles to the lunar surface: a lander and an ascender. The landing is due to take place in about eight days, according to Pei Zhaoyu, a spokesman for the mission. The probe is due to be on the lunar surface for about two days, while the entire mission is scheduled to take around 23 days.\n",

As soldiers of the Republic of China, how could we let enemies strut around in our own airspace?” she said, using Taiwan’s formal name.“I’m aware that facing the provocative behavior of the communist planes that have encircled the island and damaged regional peace in recent days, your duty at the front line of the airspace in Penghu must be even heavier.”The base, now home to F-CK-1 Ching-kuo Indigenous Defence Fighters (IDF) which first entered service in 1997, is at the front line of Taiwan’s response to Chinese military intrusions.\n",

The phrase “wolf warriors” is also used by international media to characterize China’s sometimes combative diplomacy.Wuheqilin has long supported Chinese propaganda artwork, but it was only last summer when he infused political themes into his images as Hong Kong was rocked by street protests, according to interviews with Chinese media.\n",

That figure is well below the previous four-year average of roughly $5 billion per year, and lower still than pre-2015 levels when Chinese investment into Canadian natural resources was running at a record high.A separate set of recent data, from the Asia-Pacific Foundation of Canada, shows Chinese investment totalling $21 billion between 2016 and 2019, down from $27 billion in the four years between 2012 and 2015.The steady decline comes amid fraught relations between the federal Liberal Party and the Communist Party of China, which have deteriorated since the arrest of Huawei chief financial executive Meng Wanzhou.

It threatened retaliation but did not say what measures it might take.The State Department said the move was made “to protect American intellectual property and Americans’ private information.”The deterioration comes in the run-up to the November U.S. presidential election, in which President Donald Trump and his Democratic rival, Joe Biden, have appeared to compete over who can look tougher in response to China.Speaking on a visit to Denmark, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo repeated accusations about Chinese theft of U.S. and European intellectual property, which he said were costing “hundreds of thousands of jobs.”While offering no specifics about the Houston consulate, Pompeo referred to a U.S. Justice Department indictment on Tuesday of two Chinese nationals over what it called a decade-long cyber espionage campaign that targeted defense contractors, COVID researchers and hundreds of other victims worldwide.\n",

      "CONTENT : An aggressive campaign by American authorities to root out Chinese espionage operations in the United States has snared a growing group of Chinese government officials, business people, and academics pursuing American secrets.In 2019 alone, public records show U.S. authorities arrested and expelled two Chinese diplomats who allegedly drove onto a military base in Virginia. They also caught and jailed former CIA and Defense Intelligence Agency officials on espionage charges linked to China.On Thursday, U.S. Attorney General William Barr, FBI director Christopher Wray and U.S. counterintelligence chief William Evanina will address a Washington conference on U.S. efforts to counter Chinese “economic malfeasance” involving espionage and the theft of U.S. technological and scientific secrets.China’s efforts to steal unclassified American technology, ranging from military secrets to medical research, have long been thought to be extensive and aggressive, but U.S. officials only launched a broad effort to stop alleged Chinese espionage in the United States in 2018.\n",

China rejected Wray’s comments.Wray said the Fox Hunt program was aimed at silencing criticism of Beijing’s political and human rights policies by Chinese-born people living overseas.The families of those who refuse to return are threatened and some have been arrested in China “for leverage,” he said.\n",

It just so happened that they’re patrolling Natuna,” Adriyanto said. “We don’t have the order to start a war with China.”\n",

      "CONTENT : BEIJING — China successfully landed a spacecraft on the moon’s surface on Tuesday in a historic mission to retrieve lunar surface samples, Chinese state media reported.China launched its Chang’e-5 probe on Nov. 24. The uncrewed mission, named after the mythical Chinese goddess of the moon, aims to collect lunar material to help scientists learn more about the moon’s origins.The mission will attempt to collect 2 kg (4-1/2 lbs) of samples in a previously unvisited area in a massive lava plain known as Oceanus Procellarum, or “Ocean of Storms.”If the mission is completed as planned, it would make China the third nation to have retrieved lunar samples after the United States and the Soviet Union.The lander vehicle that touched down on the moon’s surface was one of several spacecraft deployed by the Chang’e-5 probe.Upon landing, the lander vehicle is supposed to drill into the ground with a robotic arm, then transfer its soil and rock samples to an ascender vehicle that would lift off and dock with an orbiting module.State broadcaster CCTV said it would start collecting samples on the lunar surface in the next two days. The samples would be transferred to a return capsule for the trip back to Earth, landing in China’s Inner Mongolia region.China made its first lunar landing in 2013. In January last year, the Chang’e-4 probe touched down on the far side of the moon, the first space probe from any nation to do so.

More than 2,500 ships transit and call at its ports ​annually.Continued complications with changing over ship crews due to coronavirus restrictions in some jurisdictions is still affecting supply chains despite an easing of lockdown in many parts of the world.Some 400,000 seafarers are affected on land or on ships – with many at sea for longer than an 11-month limit laid out in a maritime labor convention.Shipping industry officials say many are at breaking point, in a situation the United Nations has described as a “humanitarian crisis.”The first crew change operation took place in recent days in Djibouti and involved 19 seafarers who had been at sea on a merchant ship for over a year.\n",

The phrase “wolf warriors” is also used by international media to characterize China’s sometimes combative diplomacy.Wuheqilin has long supported Chinese propaganda artwork, but it was only last summer when he infused political themes into his images as Hong Kong was rocked by street protests, according to interviews with Chinese media.\n",

      "CONTENT : SYDNEY — Three Australian citizens of Chinese ethnicity who were asked to condemn the Chinese Communist Party as they appeared before a government inquiry into diaspora issues have criticized the incident as like “McCarthyism.”A Senate committee is examining problems facing diaspora communities, and the three Chinese Australians had been invited to attend a hearing on Wednesday.The Australian Security Intelligence Organisation has told the inquiry that diaspora communities are often victims of interference from foreign governments, and threats had been made against individuals on the basis of their political opinions.Australia has a tense diplomatic relationship with China, its largest trading partner, and there has been intense domestic political debate and media coverage of allegations the Chinese government is involved in foreign interference.There are also concerns Chinese communities in Australia are experiencing racism as a by-product.The Liberal Senator for Tasmania, Eric Abetz, known for hawkish views on China, asked the three Chinese Australians to “tell me whether they are willing to unconditionally condemn the Chinese Communist Party dictatorship,” a transcript shows.\n",

      "CONTENT : OTTAWA — Chinese investment into Canada has continued to decline amid souring relations between the two countries, according to new data.Total Chinese investment into Canada totalled $3.1 billion in 2019, according to data from the University of Alberta’s China Institute. That figure is well below the previous four-year average of roughly $5 billion per year, and lower still than pre-2015 levels when Chinese investment into Canadian natural resources was running at a record high.A separate set of recent data, from the Asia-Pacific Foundation of Canada, shows Chinese investment totalling $21 billion between 2016 and 2019, down from $27 billion in the four years between 2012 and 2015.The steady decline comes amid fraught relations between the federal Liberal Party and the Communist Party of China, which have deteriorated since the arrest of Huawei chief financial executive Meng Wanzhou. Canadian authorities arrested Meng, daughter of Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei, in December 2018 at the request of U.S. officials.\n",

In the meantime, it advised travelers to be prepared for disruption to air links between the two countries.Passenger flights between France and China were suspended earlier this year due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

More sinister propaganda in aid of whitewashing Beijing’s massive police-state crackdown in Hong Kong as a perfectly normal, unremarkable and necessary exercise in law enforcement. More thinly-veiled threats.This time around it’s Tong Xiaoling, China’s consul general in Vancouver. In a Monday interview with the self-described “Voice of Vancouver’s Chinese Community,” AM 1320, Tong singled out what she called “an extremely small group of people” in Metro Vancouver’s ethnic Chinese community who are “deliberately smearing and attacking Hong Kong’s national security law” and “collaborating with anti-Chinese powers in attempts to cause trouble overseas, to even create bases in foreign countries to stand against China and disrupt Hong Kong.”The alleged activities Tong described are specifically outlawed in the sweeping national security law that Beijing has imposed on Hong Kong in Xi Jinping’s efforts to crush the nominally autonomous city-state’s vigorous pro-democracy movement. The new law applies not just to Hong Kong residents but to anyone, of any nationality or citizenship, anywhere in the world.\n",

Asian shares fell over the Reuters story overnight, as investors fretted over fresh Sino-U.S. tensions, which offset bets over more stimulus in Europe and the United States.Hong Kong’s Beijing-backed government last month expelled four opposition members from its legislature after China’s parliament gave city authorities new powers to curb dissent. The move triggered mass resignations by pro-democracy opposition lawmakers in the former British colony.It also raised further alarm in the West. The Five Eyes intelligence-sharing group – comprised of Australia, Britain, Canada, New Zealand and the United States – said last month the move appeared to be part of a campaign to silence critics, and called on Beijing to reverse course.

      "CONTENT : NEW DELHI — Indian and Chinese troops were facing off on Wednesday, barely a few hundred meters apart, in a remote Himalayan region where shots were fired for the first time in decades, Indian officials said.The nuclear-armed neighbors have accused each other of firing in the air during a fresh flare-up in the Ladakh region on Monday, violating long-standing protocols to avoid using firearms along their undemarcated borders.“The situation is tense,” an official in New Delhi said, adding that Indian and Chinese troops were squaring off in close proximity in at least four locations south of the Pangong Tso lake that both lay claim to.“Both are on their own sides of the LAC,” the official said, referring to the Line of Actual Control, the de facto border.At a forward position near the Rezang La mountain pass, Indian and Chinese troops were only around 200 meters apart, another official in New Delhi said. Both officials declined to be named.On Monday, the Indian military said Chinese troops fired in the air after attempting to close in on a forward Indian position. But the China military said it was Indian troops who fired the shots, threatening Chinese border guards during a patrol.In photographs provided by sources in New Delhi from an area south of Pangong Tso taken on Monday, around two dozen Chinese troops with assault rifles hanging off their backs can be seen holding long poles with a curved blade. Reuters could not independently verify the photographs.A 70-km long patch of desolate snow desert south of Pangong Tso has emerged as the latest flash-point between the Asian giants, with some 3,000 Indian troops strung along strategic ridges and hilltops, the first Indian official said.The confrontation erupted after New Delhi mobilized soldiers late last month to occupy key heights to deter Chinese troops, whose movements suggested they aimed to occupy a hilltop that falls within territory that India considers its own, according to Indian officials.(Reporting by Devjyot Ghoshal; Editing by Sanjeev Miglani and Gareth Jones)\n",

It also adds to the growing list of flashpoints for two countries already at odds over issues such as trade, COVID-19 and Hong Kong.President Donald Trump issued a memorandum on Thursday calling for recommendations to be issued within 60 days to protect U.S. investors from what he said was China’s failure to allow audits of U.S.-listed Chinese companies.“American investors should not be subjected to hidden and undue risks associated with companies that do not abide by the same rules as U.S. firms,” Pompeo said in his statement. “Nasdaq’s action should serve as a model for other exchanges in the United States, and around the world.”\n",

Seventeen remain in hospital and eight have gone home, according to the health official.Earlier on Tuesday, South Korea reported a 42-year-old woman has tested positive for coronavirus after visiting Thailand. It was not clear yet where she had contracted the virus. (Reporting by Patpicha Tanakasempipat and Panarat Thepgumpanat; Editing by Andrew Heavens and Andrew Cawthorne)\n",

It comes as part of a Trump administration campaign against alleged Chinese influence operations and espionage activity.The State Department said it also would take action to help ensure all Chinese embassy and consular social media accounts were “properly identified.”“We’re simply demanding reciprocity. Access for our diplomats in China should be reflective of the access that Chinese diplomats in the United States have, and today’s steps will move us substantially in that direction'” U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told a news briefing.It was the latest U.S. step to restrict Chinese activity in the United States in the run-up to the November presidential election, in which President Donald Trump has made a tough approach to China a key foreign policy platform.Pompeo also said Keith Krach, the State Department’s undersecretary for Economic Growth, had written recently to the governing boards of U.S. universities alerting them to threats posed by the Chinese Communist Party.\n",

      "CONTENT : After President Donald Trump called the novel coronavirus “the Chinese Virus” in a tweet Monday, an evangelical leader responded by calling the label “unacceptable,” warning that it “instigates blame, racism, and hatred against Asians.”On Monday, Trump tweeted his confidence in American industries before calling the spread of the coronavirus or covid-19, “the Chinese Virus.”“The United States will be powerfully supporting those industries, like Airlines and others, that are particularly affected by the Chinese Virus. We will be stronger than ever before!”In a reply, Eugene Cho, a former pastor of a Seattle church who was just tapped to begin leading a large Christian nonprofit called Bread for the World in July, suggested that calling the coronavirus the “Chinese virus” could be dangerous. Cho said in an interview Monday that he was not speaking on behalf of the Washington-based hunger and poverty-fighting organization and is still living in Seattle, one of the epicenters of the outbreaks in the United States.“Mr. President: This is not acceptable,” he wrote in his tweet. “Calling it the “Chinese virus” only instigates blame, racism, and hatred against Asians – here and abroad. We need leadership that speaks clearly against racism; Leadership that brings the nation and world together. Not further divides.”Cho, who was born in Korea and immigrated to the United States when he was 6, said he knows three people who have been assaulted in the past couple weeks, incidents he believes are tied to the spread of the coronavirus.“I can’t speak for all Asians,” he said. “I know for myself and my family, we’re not just contending with a health crisis . . . there might be backlash verbal and physical.”\n",

Others have not been granted an extension yet, he said.“We once again urge the U.S. to immediately give up its illusions and stop the political persecution and suppression of Chinese reporters,” said Wang.“Do not say that you were not forewarned by China.”The two countries’ relations have deteriorated recently over various issues including trade and the novel coronavirus outbreak, which originated in China.

Their arrests in 2018 came shortly after Canadian officials detained Huawei executive, Meng Wanzhou in Vancouver.Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said the arrests and charges remain arbitrary and without merit and he is disappointed China continues to detain the two men.“We have continued to express our disappointment with the Chinese decision, with the Chinese detention of these two Canadians.

The footage showed a group of men praying around an orange body bag before it was tossed into the ocean.A Chinese embassy official in Jakarta did not immediately respond to a request for comment after the ambassador was summoned.Indonesian Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi later told a news conference that three Indonesian crew members had died aboard Chinese-flagged fishing vessels since December and had been buried at sea.“One crew member died and was buried at sea on March 31. In December 2019, two other crew members…died and were also buried at sea,” Marsudi said, adding that another crew member crew died onshore of pneumonia in a hospital in the South Korean port of Busan.\n",

Others have not been granted an extension yet, he said.“We once again urge the U.S. to immediately give up its illusions and stop the political persecution and suppression of Chinese reporters,” said Wang.“Do not say that you were not forewarned by China.”The two countries’ relations have deteriorated recently over various issues including trade and the novel coronavirus outbreak, which originated in China.

A fourth source at a major Chinese newspaper said he received a text message with a similar order from a senior colleague.No reason was given in the notice, but the sources said they believed it was because of the overseas backlash over the film’s links to Xinjiang.\n",

      "CONTENT : LONDON — The British government launched a website on Tuesday warning digital and technology firms of the ethical, legal and commercial risks of expanding into China and accepting Chinese investment.Britain published this month a bill giving ministers far-reaching power to intervene in corporate deals which could threaten national security, the culmination of years of growing concern about Chinese and other foreign investment in key industries.Launched with the slogan “China. See the Potential. Know the Challenge” the government website is designed as a guide for digital and tech firms, encouraging good practice and raising awareness of potential issues.“The UK is determined to support our businesses to engage with China in a way that reflects the UK’s values and takes account of national security concerns,” digital and culture minister Caroline Dinenage said in a statement.Alongside case studies, guides on how to conduct due diligence and links to specialist consultancies, the site contains some stark warnings.“There is a risk that your company’s technology could be used to violate human rights,” said a section on ethical risks, highlighting concerns about facial recognition software censorship, and mass surveillance among other concerns.Another section warns: “Taking legal steps to protect your IP (Intellectual Property) in China is important, but you should also consider your cybersecurity.”Earlier this year, ministers blocked Chinese firm Huawei Technologies Co Ltd from parts of the UK’s telecoms network over concerns about spying. Huawei has said the concerns are groundless.Under a new law put forward on Tuesday telecoms companies could be fined up to 10% of turnover or 100,000 pounds ($133,140) a day if they contravene a ban on using equipment made by Huawei.

      "CONTENT : WASHINGTON — The FBI on Thursday identified China as the biggest law enforcement threat to the United States, and its director said Beijing was seeking to steal American technology by “any means necessary.”FBI Director Christopher Wray told a conference the bureau currently had about 1,000 open investigations of Chinese technology theft across its 56 regional offices.FBI counterintelligence chief John Brown said the bureau arrested 24 people last year in China-related cases and had already arrested 19 in 2020.He told the conference at Washington’s Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) that the FBI believed “no country poses a greater threat than Communist China.”Wray said the threat needed to be addressed through action across the whole of the U.S. government.“As I stand here talking with you today, the FBI has about 1,000 investigations involving China’s attempted theft of U.S.-based technology in all 56 of our field offices and spanning just about every industry sector,” he said.\n",

Its package features a smiling man in a top hat. Its previous name was Darkie, and featured a man in blackface.Its current Chinese name still translates to “black person toothpaste.”“For more than 35 years, we have been working together to evolve the brand, including substantial changes to the name, logo and packaging. We are currently working with our partner to review and further evolve all aspects of the brand, including the brand name,” a Colgate spokesman told Reuters in an email.Colgate’s statement followed news on Wednesday that PepsiCo Inc was dropping its Aunt Jemima logo, prompting other brands to initiate reviews.

Washington has told its European allies the Chinese firm poses a security threat, noting that Chinese companies and citizens must by law aid the state in intelligence gathering.\n",

Taiwan has voiced its strong support for the protesters and repeatedly rejected Beijing’s proposals to rule the island with the “one country, two systems” model it uses for Hong Kong.\n",

Their arrests in 2018 came shortly after Canadian officials detained Huawei executive, Meng Wanzhou in Vancouver.Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said the arrests and charges remain arbitrary and without merit and he is disappointed China continues to detain the two men.“We have continued to express our disappointment with the Chinese decision, with the Chinese detention of these two Canadians. We will continue to advocate for their release, for their return to Canada,” he said.Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said each is charged with “secretly gathering state secrets for overseas forces with particularly serious consequences.”\n",

      "CONTENT : BEIJING — China has lodged stern representations with the United States over the expelling of Chinese officials, foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said at a regular briefing in Beijing on Monday.The U.S. government covertly moved to expel two officials from the Chinese embassy earlier this year after they drove onto a military base, the New York Times reported on Sunday.One of the two Chinese officials is believed to be an intelligence officer operating under diplomatic cover, the report said.“The U.S.accusations against Chinese personnel severely disregard reality,” said Geng.The Chinese officials breached security at a base in Virginia this fall, and only stopped driving after fire trucks were used to block their path, the Times said.The United States in recent years has stepped up efforts to combat concerns about suspected spying by the Chinese.A law enforcement official familiar with the episode confirmed to Reuters that the account in the Times is accurate.“We strongly urge the U.S. to correct its mistake, cancel the relevant decision and protect Chinese personnel’s proper rights according to the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations,” said Geng, referring to an international treaty on diplomatic privileges.

Their arrests in 2018 came shortly after Canadian officials detained Huawei executive, Meng Wanzhou in Vancouver.Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said the arrests and charges remain arbitrary and without merit and he is disappointed China continues to detain the two men.“We have continued to express our disappointment with the Chinese decision, with the Chinese detention of these two Canadians. We will continue to advocate for their release, for their return to Canada,” he said.Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said each is charged with “secretly gathering state secrets for overseas forces with particularly serious consequences.”\n",

The footage showed a group of men praying around an orange body bag before it was tossed into the ocean.A Chinese embassy official in Jakarta did not immediately respond to a request for comment after the ambassador was summoned.Indonesian Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi later told a news conference that three Indonesian crew members had died aboard Chinese-flagged fishing vessels since December and had been buried at sea.“One crew member died and was buried at sea on March 31. In December 2019, two other crew members…died and were also buried at sea,” Marsudi said, adding that another crew member crew died onshore of pneumonia in a hospital in the South Korean port of Busan.\n",

      "CONTENT : GUADALAJARA — Early next year, a Chinese businessman named Gan Xianbing will be sentenced in a Chicago courtroom for laundering just over $530,000 in Mexican cartel drug money.Gan, 50, was convicted in February of money laundering and operating an unlicensed money-transfer business that whisked cartel cash from U.S. drug sales offshore. Gan has maintained his innocence; his lawyers say he was entrapped by U.S. authorities. The trial garnered few headlines and little of the public fascination reserved for kingpins of powerful narcotics syndicates that U.S. federal prosecutors said Gan served.Still, U.S. law enforcement officials told Reuters that Chinese “money brokers” such as Gan represent one of the most worrisome new threats in their war on drugs. They say small cells of Chinese criminals have upended the way narcotics cash is laundered and are displacing the Mexican and Colombian money men that have long dominated the trade.Virtually unheard of a decade ago, these Chinese players are moving vast sums quickly and quietly, authorities said. Their expertise: routing cartel drug profits from the United States to China then on to Mexico with a few clicks of a burner phone and Chinese banking apps – and without the bulky cash ever crossing borders. The launderers pay small Chinese-owned businesses in the United States and Mexico to help them move the funds. Most contact with the banking system happens in China, a veritable black hole for U.S. and Mexican authorities.\n",

Under a Chinese law introduced in 2017, companies have an obligation to support and cooperate in China’s national intelligence work.The Trump administration has also ordered TikTok’s Chinese owner ByteDance to divest its U.S. operations within 90 days.(Reporting by Alexandra Alper; writing by Andrea Shalal; editing by Chris Reese)\n",

      "CONTENT : BEIJING — China said on Thursday it would revoke visa exemption treatment for U.S. diplomatic passport holders visiting Hong Kong and Macau after the United States imposed financial sanctions and a travel ban on more than a dozen Chinese officials.Beijing will also implement reciprocal sanctions against some U.S. officials, members of Congress, personnel at non-governmental organizations, and their family members, over their “vile” behavior on Hong Kong, foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told a news conference.China urges the United States not to go further down this “dangerous and mistaken path,” Hua added.She declined to give any names of those sanctioned or to say when the sanctions would start.The United States on Monday imposed financial sanctions and a travel ban on 14 Chinese officials over their role in adopting a national security law for Hong Kong and over Beijing’s disqualification last month of elected opposition legislators in Hong Kong.The U.S. action was widely seen as part of an effort by outgoing President Donald Trump to cement his tough-on-China legacy and to box President-elect Joe Biden into taking a similarly hardline position on Beijing at a time of bipartisan anti-China sentiment in Congress. Biden takes office on Jan. 20.In August the Trump administration slapped sanctions on Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam and other top officials over what it said was their role in curtailing freedoms during a crackdown on the territory’s pro-democracy movement.

      "CONTENT : OTTAWA — One of Canada’s most controversial ex-ambassadors to China says he repeatedly tried to improve the living conditions of Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor after their imprisonment in the People’s Republic almost two years ago.John McCallum also said Tuesday he regrets speaking about the October 2019 Canadian election in a meeting with Chinese officials in the months leading up to it.McCallum, the former Liberal cabinet minister who was fired as Canada’s envoy to China in January 2019, was testifying at the special House of Commons committee on Canada-China relations.Prime Minister Justin Trudeau fired McCallum after he made a series of public comments that broke with the government’s line following the arrests of Kovrig and Spavor, nine days after Canada’s arrest of Chinese high-tech scion Meng Wanzhou in December 2018 on a U.S. extradition warrant.McCallum said that’s when everything changed in Canada’s relations with China, and that he has no doubt Kovrig and Spavor would be free right now had Meng not been arrested.“From that moment onwards, the top priority of the government and of myself as ambassador was to secure the release of the two Michaels,” said McCallum, noting that he has been one of the few people to visit them in prison.\n",

      "CONTENT : U.S.-listed shares of Chinese firms fell on Friday, a day after President Donald Trump unveiled bans on U.S. transactions with the China-based owners of messaging app WeChat and video-sharing app TikTok, escalating tensions between the two countries.The executive orders will be effective in 45 days and come after the Trump administration said this week it was stepping up efforts to purge “untrusted” Chinese apps from U.S. digital networks.Tencent Holdings Ltd owns the popular WeChat app, while ByteDance is the owner of TikTok.Shares of other U.S.-listed Chinese companies backed by Tencent, including JD.com, Huya Inc and Nio Inc fell between 0.5% and 3.8%“(There’s) some very specific companies and policies mentioned and that appears to be a proverbial line in the sand,” said Eric Freedman, chief investment officer at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Minneapolis.China’s foreign ministry took a hard stance against the executive orders, saying it would defend the interests of Chinese businesses and warned that the United States would have to “bear the consequences” of its action.\n",

CanSino was supposed to provide samples of the vaccine for clinical trials at the Canadian Centre for Vaccinology at Dalhousie University, but the Chinese government blocked the shipments.“I would not have put all our eggs in the basket of China,” O’Toole said at a morning news conference.\n",

A fourth source at a major Chinese newspaper said he received a text message with a similar order from a senior colleague.No reason was given in the notice, but the sources said they believed it was because of the overseas backlash over the film’s links to Xinjiang.\n",

The WHO website shows the United States as its top donor, contributing nearly 15% of the budget.“We have kept the world informed about the latest data, information and evidence,” Tedros said, noting that Thursday would mark 100 days since China first notified the organization of cases of “pneumonia with unknown cause” on December 31.\n",

Beijing’s U.N. ambassador said the move was not “appropriate.”\n",

      "CONTENT : WASHINGTON — The United States said on Wednesday it would now require senior Chinese diplomats to get State Department approval before visiting U.S. university campuses or holding cultural events with more than 50 people outside mission grounds.Washington cast the move as a response to what it said was Beijing’s restrictions on American diplomats based in China. It comes as part of a Trump administration campaign against alleged Chinese influence operations and espionage activity.The State Department said it also would take action to help ensure all Chinese embassy and consular social media accounts were “properly identified.”“We’re simply demanding reciprocity. Access for our diplomats in China should be reflective of the access that Chinese diplomats in the United States have, and today’s steps will move us substantially in that direction,” U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told a news briefing.It was the latest U.S. step to curb Chinese activity in the United States in the run-up to the November presidential election, in which President Donald Trump has made a tough approach to China a key foreign policy platform.China’s Washington embassy called the move “yet another unjustified restriction and barrier on Chinese diplomatic and consular personnel” that “runs counter to the self-proclaimed values of openness and freedom of the U.S. side.”\n",

It has also tried to get international cooperation to track corrupt officials since President Xi Jinping began a war on graft nearly a decade ago.Five of the people charged in the United States, including an American private investigator, were arrested on Wednesday in New Jersey, New York and California, while the rest are believed to be in China, U.S. Justice officials said.China’s foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin told a briefing the United States should stop the “baseless accusation and smears about Chinese efforts to pursue escaped criminals and recover stolen monies.”\n",

Netflix announced earlier this month that it was turning the books into a live-action, English-language TV series led by D.B Weiss and David Benioff, the creators of HBO megahit “Game of Thrones.” Liu serves as a consulting producer on the project.In a letter to Netflix, the senators pointed to comments by Liu to the New Yorker magazine in 2019 about China’s clampdown on ethnic Uighurs and other Muslims in the Xinjiang region.“If anything, the government is helping their economy and trying to lift them out of poverty,” Liu said. “If you were to loosen up the country a bit, the consequences would be terrifying.”The United States and human rights groups have criticized China’s treatment of the Uighurs. China’s foreign ministry has repeatedly denied the existence of internment camps in Xinjiang, calling the facilities vocational and educational institutions and accusing what it calls anti-China forces of smearing its Xinjiang policy.\n",

Signed two years ago, the original deal was to expire on Thursday.The U.S. State Department and conservative Catholics say the Vatican has sold out to the communist government by agreeing the deal, especially at a time when they say religious freedom is coming under attack by the Chinese government.“The two sides will continue to keep in close communication and consultation, and continue to push forward the process of improving relations,” Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told a press briefing.Chinese-claimed Taiwan, which maintains formal diplomatic relations with the Vatican, has long been nervous that eventually the Vatican will abandon it and switch ties to Beijing.However, the Vatican Secretary of State said on Wednesday that talk of diplomatic relations was premature.\n",

      "CONTENT : TikTok said it is asking a judge to block the Trump administration from enacting a ban on the social media network, bringing a geopolitical fight over technology and trade into a U.S. courtroom in the run-up to the presidential election.TikTok said in a blog post Monday that its Chinese parent, ByteDance Ltd., is challenging an Aug. 6 order from President Donald Trump prohibiting U.S. residents from doing business with TikTok under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The order doesn’t take effect for weeks, but it escalated tensions as the U.S. declared Chinese businesses a security risk and Beijing assailed the administration as targeting China to score political points. TikTok argues it poses no security threat.The White House issued a second order Aug. 14 under a separate national security law that would force ByteDance to sell its U.S. assets. The suit sidesteps the second order. That order is based on an investigation by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. Decisions by the interagency panel, which is led by the Treasury Department, are all but impossible to overturn in court.\n",

Outside mainland China there have been about 500 cases in some two dozen countries and territories, with four deaths – in Japan, Chinese-ruled Hong Kong, the Philippines and France.In the French case, the Chinese man died at the Bichat hospital in Paris of a lung infection due to the flu-like virus, authorities said on Saturday.\n",

Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said the consulate was operating normally, declining to comment further on those reports.Ties between the United States and China have worsened sharply this year over a range of issues, from the novel coronavirus and telecoms gear maker Huawei to China’s territorial claims in the South China Sea and its imposition of a national security law on Hong Kong.\n",

Modernization of weapons and upgradation of infrastructure has enhanced our defense capabilities multifold,” he said in a speech to soldiers near Leh, the regional capital.India says Chinese troops have intruded across the Line of Actual Control, or the ceasefire line separating the two armies in the high altitude Ladakh region, and the clash on June 15 occurred because Chinese troops sought to erect defenses on India’s side of the de facto border.\n",

      "CONTENT : WASHINGTON — U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Tuesday he regretted China’s decision to rescind the press credentials of more U.S. journalists and hoped Beijing would reconsider, citing a need for transparency about the coronavirus.China announced earlier it was retaliating against U.S. restrictions on Chinese journalists, with actions that include rescinding the credentials of American correspondents with the New York Times, Wall Street Journal and Washington Post that expire by the end of this year.Pompeo told reporters at a State Department news conference the move would deprive the world and the Chinese people of information in “incredibly challenging” times brought about by the coronavirus.Early this month, Washington said it was slashing the number of Chinese nationals permitted to work at the U.S. offices of major Chinese state-owned media outlets in retaliation for what it called Beijing’s “long-standing intimidation and harassment of journalists.”\n",

The United States believes the four were members of China’s military posing as researchers.“In interviews with members of the Chinese People’s Liberation Army in over 25 cities across the U.S., the FBI uncovered a concerted effort to hide their true affiliation to take advantage of the United States and the American people,” John Brown, executive assistant director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s national security branch, said in a statement.Court filings show that the FBI believed the San Francisco consulate was harboring a fugitive since late June. U.S. law enforcement cannot enter a foreign embassy or consulate unless invited, and certain top officials such as ambassadors have diplomatic immunity.

A fourth source at a major Chinese newspaper said he received a text message with a similar order from a senior colleague.No reason was given in the notice, but the sources said they believed it was because of the overseas backlash over the film’s links to Xinjiang.\n",

      "CONTENT : SYDNEY — Australia has revoked the visas of two visiting Chinese academics in an apparent escalation of tension between the countries which has seen each accuse the other of inappropriate treatment of journalists.Chen Hong, a professor of Australian Studies at East China Normal University in Shanghai, said in an email to Reuters that he had received a letter from Australia’s Home Affairs Department canceling his visa. The letter said he had been deemed by security body ASIO to pose a threat to national security.“I absolutely refuse to accept this assessment, and believe a gross mistake has been made regarding my relationship with Australia,” Chen said in the email. “I have done nothing and will do nothing to act as a risk to Australia’s security.”Australian Broadcasting Corp reported that another scholar, Li Jianjun, had received a similar letter. Li could not immediately be reached for comment.The move intensifies a round of recriminations between the countries that has involved reports of Australian journalists in China being questioned by police, prompting them to leave the country, and of Australian authorities raiding the homes of Chinese media representatives there.A spokesman for Australian National University, where Li was named this year as a visiting scholar, said he finished his appointment there in February. The Department of Home Affairs and ASIO were also not immediately available for comment.Australia has a tense diplomatic relationship with China, which worsened this year after Beijing vowed trade reprisals and said it was angered by Australia’s call for an international inquiry into the source of the coronavirus pandemic.

      "CONTENT : OTTAWA — Two Canadian men who have been detained by China for more than two years, in what Canada sees as retribution for its arrest of a Chinese executive, are in good mental and physical condition, Ottawa’s ambassador to Beijing said on Tuesday.China arrested businessman Michael Spavor and former diplomat Michael Kovrig in early December 2018, shortly after Canadian police picked up Huawei Technologies Co Ltd Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou on a U.S. warrant. The two men face spying charges.“They are both very healthy, physically and mentally,” Ambassador Dominic Barton told a special parliamentary committee on Canada’s ties with China.“I am deeply inspired by their resilience and their mindset – it’s incredible given what they’re going through … they are very, very strong and it’s remarkable,” he added.The affair has badly damaged bilateral relations. Canada, which says the return of the two men is a priority, dismisses Beijing’s insistence that their detentions are not linked to Meng’s arrest.Chinese authorities, citing the risk of the coronavirus, blocked access by Canadian diplomats for many months. Barton said he was allowed virtual visits in October after months of pressure and also spoke to the two individually last month.Reuters reported last week that U.S. prosecutors were discussing a deal with Meng’s lawyers to resolve criminal charges against her.

It comes as part of a Trump administration campaign against alleged Chinese influence operations and espionage.The State Department said it would also take action to help ensure all Chinese embassy and consular social media accounts were “properly identified.”“We’re simply demanding reciprocity,” U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told a news briefing. “Access for our diplomats in China should be reflective of the access that Chinese diplomats in the United States have, and today’s steps will move us substantially in that direction.”It was the latest U.S. step to curb Chinese activity in the United States in the run-up to the November presidential election, in which President Donald Trump has made a tough approach to China a key foreign policy platform.China’s Washington embassy called the move “yet another unjustified restriction and barrier on Chinese diplomatic and consular personnel” that “runs counter to the self-proclaimed values of openness and freedom of the U.S. side.”\n",

      "CONTENT : DUBAI — The United Arab Emirates, a major international transit hub, has made sure its airports and ports are ready to handle coronavirus cases following an outbreak of a new virus in China, state news agency WAM reported.More than 200 people have caught the virus, which can cause a type of pneumonia, and four people have died, Chinese authorities have said.The virus, which appeared in the central Chinese city of Wuhan and can pass from person-to-person, has been reported in Thailand, Japan and South Korea, raising concerns about its spread through international air travel.The UAE’s ministry of health has made sure all ports of entry were “on standby to handle coronavirus cases,” WAM reported.No cases of the virus have been reported in the country, it said.The report did not disclose whether any new counter-measures had been introduced since the outbreak.UAE’s Dubai International Airport is one of the busiest in the world and home to major international airline Emirates.Emirates and Abu Dhabi’s Etihad Airways operate regular flights to China.Several Chinese airlines fly to the UAE, including China Southern Airlines which operates a flight to Dubai from Wuhan.Australia on Tuesday said it would screen passengers on flights from Wuhan amid rising concerns that the virus will spread globally as Chinese travelers take flights abroad for the Lunar New Year holiday starting this week.Several other countries including the United States have also increased screening measures.

      "CONTENT : Canada’s immigration minister is opening the doors to people in Hong Kong, with an aim to attract students and recent graduates, but potentially leaving out many vulnerable people in the former British colony that is coming under increasing Chinese pressure.The Chinese government imposed a new national security law on Hong Kong earlier this year in response to growing democracy protests. The law makes it a crime to advocate for secession or independence and allows for sweeping surveillance. It also allows for people charged with these crimes to be moved to China for trials that could occur behind closed doors.Earlier this week four pro-democracy legislators — two of whom were former Canadian citizens — were expelled from Hong Kong’s legislature causing others to resign and leaving the legislature without any opposition. Canada condemned that move in a statement as did several other Western nations.\n",

The documents confirm that Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, at the two-year mark of their hostage taking in China, are getting no service at all from the highest levels of our diplomatic bureaucracy.There are three levels to the Rebel Media scoop. The documents have been posted online.The first is the revelation that our military conducts friendly joint training with the People’s Liberation Army (PLA), as the communist Chinese are wont to call the army that ensures that the people do not enjoy any liberties not approved by the politburo. The second is how craven, even in private, our diplomatic establishment is, wishing to placate China even at the risk of alienating our closest allies.

It comes as part of a Trump administration campaign against alleged Chinese influence operations and espionage.The State Department said it would also take action to help ensure all Chinese embassy and consular social media accounts were “properly identified.”“We’re simply demanding reciprocity,” U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told a news briefing. “Access for our diplomats in China should be reflective of the access that Chinese diplomats in the United States have, and today’s steps will move us substantially in that direction.”It was the latest U.S. step to curb Chinese activity in the United States in the run-up to the November presidential election, in which President Donald Trump has made a tough approach to China a key foreign policy platform.China’s Washington embassy called the move “yet another unjustified restriction and barrier on Chinese diplomatic and consular personnel” that “runs counter to the self-proclaimed values of openness and freedom of the U.S. side.”\n",

      "CONTENT : BEIJING — China denied on Monday that foreign nationals are under threat of arbitrary detention, following a newspaper report that Beijing had warned Washington it might arrest Americans in China.The Chinese foreign ministry said it was Washington that was mistreating foreign citizens, accusing the United States of “outright political repression” of Chinese academics.“The U.S. claim that foreign nationals in China are under threat of arbitrary detention is playing the victim and confusing black and white,” Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told a regular news briefing. China protects the safety and legitimate rights of foreigners, he said.The Wall Street Journal reported on Saturday that Chinese officials had issued repeated warnings to U.S. government officials that China may detain Americans in response to the Justice Department’s prosecution of Chinese scholars affiliated to the military.In September, a State Department advisory warned against travel to China, saying the Chinese government uses arbitrary detention and exit bans for U.S. citizens and others “to gain bargaining leverage over foreign governments.”The Trump administration has increasingly accused China of using cyber operations and espionage to steal U.S. technological, military and other know-how. Beijing denies this.Earlier this year, Chinese prosecutors in June indicted two Canadian citizens on espionage charges, a move seen by Western governments as punishment for Canada’s arrest of Huawei Technologies Co. Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou in late 2018.Beijing has denied the indictment was related to Meng’s case and has repeatedly called for the release of Meng. China hopes Canada can think more about the future of the two countries’ relationship and settle Meng’s case at an early date, said Zhao.

Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said the consulate was operating normally, declining to comment further on those reports.Ties between the United States and China have worsened sharply this year over a range of issues, from the novel coronavirus and telecoms gear maker Huawei to China’s territorial claims in the South China Sea and its imposition of a national security law on Hong Kong.\n",

      "CONTENT : It’s a terribly imperfect metaphor, and it’s already something of a cliché, but fair enough, too. The global struggle with the disaster of the coronavirus that first emerged last December in the Chinese city of Wuhan is, without question, something very much like war. And almost everybody who’s saying so is relying on pretty well the same formulation.U.S. President Donald Trump has lately fashioned himself as a ‘wartime president,” determined to defeat a “horrible, invisible enemy.” French President Emmanuel Macron: “We are at war. The enemy is invisible and it requires our general mobilization.” Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis: “We are at war with an enemy that is invisible, but not invincible.” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu: “This is a battle for public health … We are at war with an invisible enemy.”So yes, fair enough. But we should be very careful that we don’t allow the confines of approved terminology and the banalities of official diction to leave us unmoored from the objective realities of the crisis we’ve all found ourselves stumbling through. Because that’s how colossally stupid public policy mistakes get made. It’s also how the powerful get away with occluding the truth and telling outright lies.\n",

      "CONTENT : BRUSSELS — Chinese video app TikTok, owned by Chinese company ByteDance, will be joining the European Union’s voluntary code of conduct to combat illegal hate speech online, the European Commission said on Tuesday.Social media platforms have come under increasing pressure from politicians and governments to do more to tackle online hate speech and disinformation, which have been blamed for helping to fuel a wave of racist attacks in some countries.The Commission set up the code of conduct in May 2016 where tech companies work with civil society organizations and public authorities to remove online hate speech.Commission Vice President for values and transparency Vera Jourova said the new addition to a group, whose members include Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter, Google’s YouTube and Snapchat, was a positive step.“It’s good that TikTok joined the code – a company favored by young users who are particularly vulnerable to online abuse and illegal hate speech,” she said in a statement.“Of course, I expect TikTok to adhere not only to the Code’s principles, but also fully respect European law when operating on European soil,” Jourova said.“Our ultimate goal is to eliminate hate on TikTok. We recognize that this may seem an insurmountable challenge as the world is increasingly polarized, but we believe that this shouldn’t stop us from trying,” TikTok’s head of trust and safety for EMEA Cormac Keenan said in a statement.

It earlier had restricted only those from the Chinese province of Hubei, the epicenter of a new coronavirus outbreak.The ban also covers foreigners coming from Hong Kong and Macau, said President Rodrigo Duterte’s longtime special assistant, Senator Christopher “Bong” Go.(Reporting by Enrico dela Cruz in Manila and Akshay Balan in Bangalore; Editing by Lincoln Feast and Gerry Doyle)\n",

      "CONTENT : China put on lockdown on Thursday two cities at the epicenter of a new coronavirus outbreak that has killed 17 people and infected nearly 600, as health authorities around the world scramble to prevent a global pandemic.Health officials fear the transmission rate will accelerate as hundreds of millions of Chinese travel at home and abroad during week-long holidays for the Lunar New Year, which begins on Saturday.The previously unknown virus strain is believed to have emerged late last year from illegally traded wildlife at an animal market in the central Chinese city of Wuhan.Most transport in Wuhan, a city of 11 million people, was suspended on Thursday morning and people were told not to leave. Hours later, neighbouring Huanggang, a city of some 7 million people, announced a similar lockdown.“The lockdown of 11 million people is unprecedented in public health history, so it is certainly not a recommendation the WHO has made,” Gauden Galea, the World Health Organization’s representative in Beijing, told Reuters\n",

      "CONTENT : A border standoff between China and India in the western Himalayas has seen terrifying new weapons emerge, the Times of London reports — including the use of a “microwave” beam that sent a high-frequency blast through Indian soldiers, forcing them back from strategic hilltops.Microwave weapons, the Times reports, send electromagnetic pulses through  their targets, which heats up human tissue and soon becomes unbearable.Indian officials, the Daily Mail reports, have responded to the report to say it is “fake news.” They accuse China of “pure and poor psyops.” India says its troops are still in charge of the hills in question.The nuclear armed Asian neighbours have in recent months deployed tens of thousands of troops on the rugged frontier between India’s Ladakh region and the Chinese-held Tibetan plateau.Tensions have run high in the region since June, when at least 20 Indian soldiers were killed after being attacked by Chinese troops using rocks and clubs. Indian officials say the Chinese troops had intruded across the disputed border in a remote valley. China said the Indian soldiers’ actions had been provocative.\n",

Several told Reuters they want the Chinese authorities to deal with the cases in a just, fair and transparent manner.The group inflated blue and white balloons and wrote the names of the detainees on them, before releasing them into a leaden sky. They chanted for their “immediate safe return” while holding white banners reading “SAVE 12” and “Return Home.”\n",

      "CONTENT : (Bloomberg) — A Chinese court sentenced former Interpol President Meng Hongwei to 13.5 years in prison, more than a year after he went missing during a visit to his home country.Meng previously pleaded guilty to charges that he accepted bribes of 14.5 million yuan ($2.1 million) between 2005 and 2017. China had earlier removed him from his government post as vice public security minister over violations that included taking bribes and abusing power, and expelled him from the Communist Party.Meng won’t appeal the verdict, a Tianjin municipal court said Tuesday in a social media post announcing the sentence.The disappearance and secretive investigation into the international law enforcement agency’s first Chinese president has shined a light on China’s opaque legal system and raised questions about its respect for international norms. Details about investigation into Meng’s finances have trickled out in Chinese state media since his disappearance in September 2018.\n",

      "CONTENT : SHANGHAI — Kazakhstan dismissed as incorrect on Friday a warning by China’s embassy for its citizens to guard against an outbreak of pneumonia in the central Asian nation that it described as being more lethal than the coronavirus.In a statement late on Thursday on its official WeChat account, the Chinese embassy flagged a “significant increase” in cases in the Kazakh cities of Atyrau, Aktobe and Shymkent since mid-June.On Friday, however, Kazakhstan’s healthcare ministry branded Chinese media reports based on the embassy statement as “fake news.”The ministry said its tallies of bacterial, fungal and viral pneumonia infections, which also included cases of unclear causes, were in line with World Health Organisation guidelines.“The information published by some Chinese media regarding a new kind of pneumonia in Kazakhstan is incorrect,” the ministry said.Kazakhstan, which imposed a second lockdown this week to rein in the pandemic, has a tally of almost 55,000 COVID-19 infections, including 264 deaths. The number of new cases rose on Thursday to a daily record of 1,962.\n",

      "CONTENT : MOSCOW — Russia discharged a Chinese national from hospital in the Siberian city of Chita on Wednesday after he recovered from a coronavirus infection, local authorities said.He was the second of Russia’s two confirmed cases of coronavirus to recover. The other patient, also a Chinese national, was said by authorities on Tuesday to have recovered and been released from quarantine in Siberia’s Tyumen region.Russia has isolated hundreds of Russian and Chinese nationals for virus screening upon arrival from China. A Chinese diplomat was quarantined as a precaution last week in the city of Yekaterinburg.Russia, which has a 4,300 km (2,670-mile) land border with China, has heavily restricted travel to its neighbor. The flu-like virus has killed more than 1,100 people, all but two in mainland China.The head of Russia’s consumer health watchdog said on Monday that more than 20,000 people were under observation for signs of infection. More than 6,000 of those were Chinese nationals, the official, Anna Popova, said.\n",

      "CONTENT : TAIPEI/BEIJING — Numerous Chinese and U.S. military exercises, Taiwan missiles tracking Chinese fighters and plummeting China-U.S. ties make for a heady cocktail of tension that is raising fears of conflict touched off by a crisis over Taiwan.In the last three weeks, China has announced four separate exercises along its coast, from the Bohai Gulf in the north to the East and Yellow Seas and South China Sea, along with other exercises it said were aimed at “the current security situation across the Taiwan Strait.”Meanwhile Taiwan, claimed by China as its “sacred” territory, said its surface-to-air missiles had tracked approaching Chinese fighters – details Taiwan does not normally give – as U.S. Health Secretary Alex Azar was visiting the island this month.Addressing the Chinese exercises, Taiwan’s defense ministry said on Tuesday the closer Chinese jets get to the island the “more actively” Taipei would respond, though it would “not escalate conflict” nor “trigger an incident.”The United States sent another warship through the Taiwan Strait this month, a few days after a U.S. carrier group conducted an exercise in the disputed South China Sea, and this week China complained a U.S. spy plane had observed Chinese live-fire exercises.\n",

      "CONTENT : BEIJING — Senior Chinese diplomat Wang Yi said Czech senate speaker Milos Vystrcil will “pay a heavy price” for violating the One China principle by making an official visit to Taiwan, according to a statement released by the Chinese foreign ministry on Monday.Vystrcil arrived in Taipei on Sunday. He said his visit would promote business links with Taiwan, and that the Czech Republic would not bow to Beijing’s objections.“We will make him pay a heavy price for his short-sighted behavior and political opportunism,” said Wang, while on a visit in Germany.Wang said that challenging the One China principle is tantamount to “making oneself the enemy of 1.4 billion Chinese people,” and the Chinese government and people will not tolerate such “open provocation” by the Czech senate speaker and the anti-China forces behind him.The One China principle refers to China and Taiwan both belonging to “one China”, a position which Beijing requires all countries it has diplomatic relations with to abide.China considers Taiwan a breakaway province ineligible for state-to-state relations.

Some 41 people have died in China and more than 1,300 have been infected globally, most of them in China.Bangkok’s Suvarnabhumi Airport said it had begun temperature scans on passengers arriving from Guangzhou and Wuhan, but not all Chinese cities. Flights from Wuhan have been canceled because it is under quarantine.“We will perform a virus scan if the Chinese government announces to watch out for other cities apart from Wuhan and Guangzhou,” the General Manager of Suvarnabhumi Airport, Suthirawat Suwannawat, told reporters.China is Thailand’s biggest source of tourists and had nearly 11 million visitors from there last year.\n",

Outside mainland China there have been about 500 cases in some two dozen countries and territories, with four deaths – in Japan, Chinese-ruled Hong Kong, the Philippines and France.In the French case, the Chinese man died at the Bichat hospital in Paris of a lung infection due to the flu-like virus, authorities said.\n",

The two have disputed the course of the frontier for over half a century.The Indian official, who was briefed on the latest incident, said the Indian troop move responded to an attempt by a large number of Chinese infantry to push through a key mountain pass late on Saturday.\n",

A spokeswoman for the EU’s executive Commission said it was too early to say if the bloc would consider sanctions against Beijing. Josep Borrell, the EU’s foreign policy chief, said on Monday that the EU needs a “more robust strategy” for Beijing. (Reporting by Robin Emmott Editing by Peter Graff)\n",

      "CONTENT : Chinese officials told the world about a new coronavirus on Jan. 7 but alarm bells had been ringing in Wuhan, the capital city of the central Chinese province of Hubei, for weeks.The unofficial version of events begins much earlier and is buried in unpublished Chinese government data, whistleblower accounts and chilling instant messages shared between doctors.The story begins with a 55-year-old man in Hubei province who got sick on Nov. 17, according to a report in the South China Morning Post that was based on unreleased government data. About a handful of cases were reported each day after that and by Dec. 20 there were 60 confirmed cases.The search for patient zero continues but some experts doubt that the person will ever be found, especially with a disease that can present almost no symptoms in some people. So far, health authorities in China have identified at least 266 people who were infected last year.\n",

      "CONTENT : BEIJING — The United States has taken actions that create and spread fear following a coronavirus outbreak in China, instead of offering any significant assistance, the Chinese foreign ministry said on Monday.The United States was the first nation to suggest partial withdrawal of its embassy staff, and the first to impose a ban on Chinese travelers, said ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying.“All it has done could only create and spread fear, which is a bad example,” Hua told an online news briefing, adding that China hoped countries would make judgements and responses that were reasonable, calm and based on science.The United States began evacuating U.S. citizens from the central Chinese city of Wuhan, where the virus is believed to have first emerged late last year, on Jan. 28.The World Health Organization on Jan. 30 declared the accelerating outbreak a global emergency. On the same day, the U.S. State Department raised its travel advisory for China.“It is precisely developed countries like the United States with strong epidemic prevention capabilities and facilities that have taken the lead in imposing excessive restrictions contrary to WHO recommendations,” Hua said.

Zhang Renli, a researcher at the Guangdong Provincial People’s Hospital, received a prison term of two years and Qin Jinzhou, a researcher at the Shenzhen Luohu Hospital Group, received a term of 18 months, suspended for two years.The verdict is China’s first public statement on the fate of He, who disappeared from view after his 2018 experiment sparked a global backlash. His work to edit the genes of embryos to make babies who are resistant to the virus that causes AIDs was sharply critiqued by the international scientific community as an abuse of new gene-engineering methods that are still not fully understood.\n",

Modernization of weapons and upgradation of infrastructure has enhanced our defense capabilities multifold,” he said in a speech to soldiers near Leh, the regional capital.India says Chinese troops have intruded across the Line of Actual Control, or the ceasefire line separating the two armies in the high altitude Ladakh region, and the clash on June 15 occurred because Chinese troops sought to erect defenses on India’s side of the de facto border.\n",

Business is feeling it very badly,” said Anastasia Nikolayeva, a hotel waitress in Listvyanka, a small lakeside town in the Irkutsk region.Flanked by snow-capped hills and woodlands, Lake Baikal contains about one-fifth of the earth’s unfrozen freshwater reserves.

But in an internal letter to staff on Monday seen by Reuters, the company’s founder and CEO Zhang Yiming said the firm had started talks with a tech company it did not identify to clear the way “for us to continue offering the TikTok app in the U.S.”\n",

      "CONTENT : WASHINGTON — A U.S. congressman is calling on the State Department to urge China to investigate the disappearance of three Chinese citizen journalists who sought to expose the impact of the coronavirus on the Chinese city of Wuhan.In a letter dated Tuesday, Republican Representative Jim Banks asked the U.S. government to seek a probe into the fates of Fang Bin, Chen Qiushi and Li Zehua. According to media reports, they went missing after taking videos and publishing them online including images of overwhelmed hospitals and corpses piled in a minibus.“All three of these men understood the personal risk associated with independently reporting on coronavirus in China, but they did it anyway,” Banks wrote, alleging that the Chinese government “imprisoned them – or worse.”The Chinese Embassy and the State Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment.The virus, which has become a global pandemic, first emerged in Wuhan in late December, sickening tens of thousands and upending life in the industrial city of 11 million people in central China.China’s censorship policies came under scrutiny since the virus outbreak amid allegations from online critics and local media that they potentially obscured the seriousness of the outbreak in its early stages.

With voting day a little more than a week away,  a group of activists is tracking and labelling provincial politicians based on their sympathies towards Beijing.The campaign, calling itself “No BC for Xi” lists candidates in the election — from all parties — on an online website, and labels them as to whether or not they are “CCP leaning” or “against CCP interference.” CCP refers to the Chinese Communist Party.“Join us in demanding BC’s candidates to take a stand against CCP​’s human rights violations and foreign infiltration into our institutions,” the website for the group says.The group, which includes the Canada Tibet Committee, Canada Friends of Hong Kong, Alliance Canada Hong Kong, among others, asks two specific questions of the candidates: Whether they would reject gifts or donations from China, and would they oppose the Chinese “belt and road” initiative, which is a series of infrastructure projects across 70 nations creating economic corridors.\n",

I did many bad, wrong things in the past, perhaps harming the motherland and the country,” Lee told the program, dressed in prison garb.In Taipei, the Mainland Affairs Council labeled the show “complete nonsense.”\n",

      "CONTENT : TAIPEI — Chinese air force jets, including at least one bomber, briefly entered Taiwan’s air defense identification zone on Monday, before being warned off by its air force, the island’s military said, the eighth such encounter in two weeks.The encounter came on the day President Tsai Ing-wen oversaw a test flight of a new locally-developed advanced trainer jet as she pushes to boost democratic Taiwan’s defenses, particularly as China ramps up its own military modernisation.Taiwan’s air force named the Chinese aircraft involved as the H-6 bomber and J-10 fighter jet, but did not say how many planes in total flew into the identification zone to the island’s southwest.The Chinese air force received verbal warnings to leave via radio, and patrolling Taiwanese fighters also “proactively drove off” the aircraft, Taiwan’s air force said in a short statement, without giving details.The H-6 is a nuclear-capable bomber based on an old Soviet design that has participated in several such drills near Taiwan, including what China calls “island encirclement” exercises around the Chinese claimed-island.China claims Taiwan as its own territory, and has previously said its drills near the island are routine and designed to show Beijing’s determination to protect its sovereignty. Taiwan has shown no interest in being run by autocratic China. (Reporting by Ben Blanchard; Editing by Clarence Fernandez)\n",

      "CONTENT : CALGARY — Police in Calgary have opened a hate-crime investigation into graffiti sprayed on the wall of a Chinese Consulate building.Three suspects wearing masks and black clothing were caught on video spray painting vulgar messages referencing COVID-19 early Wednesday morning.Investigators are releasing photos of the suspects in the hopes of identifying them.Police say it’s the second time in a little more than a week that the downtown building has been vandalized.But the message sprayed on the sidewalk outside on May 19 made no reference to the novel coronavirus.Police note there has been a worldwide increase in hate crimes against the Chinese community and people of Asian descent who have been scapegoated during the pandemic.“The pandemic has led to a lot of political debate and strong views, and people are obviously free to hold whatever view they wish,” said Const. Craig Collins, the service’s hate-crimes co-ordinator.“But when people are targeting others for ill treatment or committing crimes because of those views, we have a duty to get involved.”Collins said Calgary saw some racist incidents early-on in the pandemic, but has not seen the same spike other cities have.“We are hearing from the Chinese community that they are concerned about growing hostility, so we are monitoring it closely.”This report by The Canadian Press was first published on May 27, 2020\n",

The statement, quoting ministry spokesperson Ren Guoqiang, was posted on the ministry’s official Wechat account on Friday.All of China’s actions during the event were safe, professional, and in accordance with international law, it said, without providing further details.

Taiwan says China sent advanced Su-30 and J-10 fighters to participate.Taiwan Deputy Defence Minister Chang Che-ping said the drills threatened regional stability and endangered international aviation.“We once again say, do not underestimate the military’s determination to defend our home.

      "CONTENT : The U.S. government sought on Thursday to seize 280 cryptocurrency accounts it said were used by North Korean hackers who stole millions of dollars of cryptocurrency from two virtual exchanges, and used Chinese traders to launder their funds.The U.S. Department of Justice filed a civil forfeiture complaint after having in March charged two Chinese nationals with laundering more than $100 million in cryptocurrency on behalf of North Korea.Earlier court filings detailed what U.S. authorities have characterized as Pyongyang’s use of hackers to circumvent sanctions.“Today’s action publicly exposes the ongoing connections between North Korea’s cyber-hacking program and a Chinese cryptocurrency money laundering network,” Acting Assistant Attorney General Brian Rabbitt of the Justice Department’s criminal division said in a statement.Cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin and ether, are created through a computer process called mining, which requires powerful hardware.Once generated, they can be exchanged on anonymous online platforms for other currencies such as the U.S. dollar, enabling illegal activity such as money laundering and sanctions violations.The United Nations Security Council has imposed sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in a bid to choke off funding for Pyongyang’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs.North Korea has generated an estimated $2 billion for weapons of mass destruction programs using “widespread and increasingly sophisticated” cyberattacks to steal from banks and cryptocurrency exchanges, a U.N. report said last year.The U.N. experts said attacks against cryptocurrency exchanges have allowed North Korea to generate income without the oversight common in traditional banking channels.North Korea denied those U.N. allegations, calling them a “fabrication” aimed at tarnishing its image.

      "CONTENT : WASHINGTON — U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced on Wednesday the State Department was designating the U.S. operations of six more China-based media companies as foreign missions, a move he said was aimed at pushing back against communist propaganda.Pompeo also told a State Department news conference the United States would launch a dialog on China with the European Union on Friday and that on Sunday he would begin a trip to India, Sri Lanka, the Maldives and Indonesia.He said he expected the meetings would include discussions about how “free nations can work together to thwart threats posed by the Chinese Communist Party.”The State Department named the newly designated publications as the Yicai Global, Jiefang Daily, the Xinmin Evening News, Social Sciences in China Press, the Beijing Review, and the Economic Daily. It brought to 15 the number of Chinese media outlets so designated this year.It was the latest U.S. step to curb Chinese activity in the United States in the run-up to the Nov. 3 presidential election, in which President Donald Trump has made a tough approach to China a key foreign policy theme.Pompeo said the move was part of efforts to push back against “Chinese communist propaganda efforts” in the United States.\n",

      "CONTENT : TOKYO — China’s Foreign Minister Wang Yi is set to visit Tokyo on Tuesday marking the first such high-level trip since Japan picked a new leader in September and amid mounting concerns over Beijing’s growing assertiveness in the region.Wang could make a courtesy call on Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga, who has so far sought to balance Japan’s deep economic reliance on China with addressing security worries, including Beijing’s claims over disputed East China Sea isles.While Suga has steered clear of the harsh anti-China rhetoric used by Japan’s ally the United States, he has moved to counter its influence by deepening ties with Australia and making his first overseas trip to Vietnam and Indonesia.“There are various pending issues between the two countries, so through high-level meetings, it is important to reach solutions to each issue one by one,” Japanese Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi told reporters on Monday before the bilateral meeting.He said he would have a “frank exchange” of views on bilateral relations with Wang, including on how to resume traffic between the two countries during the pandemic.Japanese media reported that Motegi would also raise concerns about China’s beefed-up activity in the East China Sea.\n",

About a handful of cases were reported each day after that and by Dec. 20 there were 60 confirmed cases.The search for patient zero continues but some experts doubt that the person will ever be found, especially with a disease that can present almost no symptoms in some people. So far, health authorities in China have identified at least 266 people who were infected last year.\n",

But the move won’t stop the wave, given that 90% of the imported virus cases are Chinese nationals returning from other countries, according to data from China’s foreign ministry.Beijing is actively discouraging its 11 million Chinese diaspora from coming home, telling them that it would mean long delays in their studies and jobs overseas. And it’s no longer sending chartered flights to get citizens home, an about-turn from an earlier policy that saw it bring plane loads of Chinese back from Iran and Japan.\n",

Outside mainland China there have been about 500 cases in some two dozen countries and territories, with four deaths – in Japan, Chinese-ruled Hong Kong, the Philippines and France.In the French case, the Chinese man died at the Bichat hospital in Paris of a lung infection due to the flu-like virus, authorities said.\n",

      "CONTENT : WENCHANG — China on Tuesday launched a robotic spacecraft to bring back rocks from the moon in the first bid by any country to retrieve samples from the lunar surface since the 1970s, a mission that underscores Chinese ambitions in space.The Long March-5, China’s largest carrier rocket, blasted off at 4:30 a.m. Beijing time (2030 GMT on Monday) in a pre-dawn launch from Wenchang Space Launch Center on the southern Chinese island of Hainan carrying the Chang’e-5 spacecraft.The Chang’e-5 mission, named after the ancient Chinese goddess of the moon, will seek to collect lunar material to help scientists understand more about the moon’s origins and formation. The mission will test China’s ability to remotely acquire samples from space, ahead of more complex missions.State broadcaster CCTV, which ran live coverage of the launch, showed images of China National Space Administration staff in blue uniforms applauding and cheering as they watched the spacecraft climbing through the atmosphere, lighting up the night sky.If successful, the mission would make China only the third country to have retrieved lunar samples, joining the United States and the Soviet Union.Upon entering the moon’s orbit, the spacecraft is intended to deploy a pair of vehicles to the lunar surface: a lander and an ascender. The landing is due to take place in about eight days, according to Pei Zhaoyu, a spokesman for the mission. The probe is due to be on the lunar surface for about two days, while the entire mission is scheduled to take around 23 days.\n",

They said they were organizing their own graduation after the university said it would be held online because of the risk of the novel coronavirus.“I want to pass on the spirit … so the next generation of students don’t forget what happened last year,” said Philip, a social sciences graduate who declined to give his last name.In November last year, campuses of CUHK and the Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) saw prolonged clashes between students and riot police, with protesters firing petrol bombs from catapults and using bows and arrows and police responding with water cannon, tear gas and rubber bullets.The PolyU campus was surrounded by police for more than a week, with some students staging dramatic escapes through sewers rather than hand themselves in to police.On Thursday, the students held black balloons and a banner reading “Happy graduation, CU rioters.” They chanted pro-democracy slogans and brandished the three-finger “Hunger Games” salute, in a nod to the gesture of defiance adopted by anti-government protests in Thailand.\n",

He agreed it was a breach of public trust.Wang had told the inquiry on Tuesday that she had shared profits from the scheme with Maguire, and also admitted lying to investigators.Maguire accepted another allegation heard by the inquiry on Tuesday: that he had tried to make money from his position as chairman of the parliament’s Asia Pacific Friendship Group by promoting a series of Chinese business deals in the Pacific islands.He also acknowledged that a company in which he was a silent director, G8Way International, had advertised itself as offering access to the “highest levels of government” in Australia and China to assist business deals.\n",

The app, which has since seen millions of downloads, is not available on the Apple store just yet.While such proxy apps are not new in China, where a virtual private network (VPN) service is typically needed to allow domestic users passage to sites such as Google or Facebook, the arrival of Tuber suggests a slight lowering of the Great Firewall.While welcomed by internet users in China, some complained about the app’s slowness. References to sensitive political issues such as the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown and the Hong Kong protests were also censored in part, according to Reuters checks.Users of the app must also register with personal information such as their identity card numbers and real names, while being warned against flouting state interests and going against the country’s socialist system.Qihoo 360 could not immediately be reached for comment.

Signed two years ago, it expired on Thursday.The U.S. State Department and conservative Catholics say the Vatican has sold out to the communist government by agreeing the deal.Many believe it will eventually lead to diplomatic relations with Beijing, meaning that the Vatican would have to sever ties with Taiwan.The Vatican Secretary of State said Wednesday that talk of diplomatic relations was premature.“The two sides will continue to keep in close communication and consultation, and continue to push forward the process of improving relations,” foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told a press briefing.

      "CONTENT : WENCHANG — China on Tuesday launched a robotic spacecraft to bring back rocks from the moon in the first bid by any country to retrieve samples from the lunar surface since the 1970s, a mission that underscores Chinese ambitions in space.The Long March-5, China’s largest carrier rocket, blasted off at 4:30 a.m. Beijing time (2030 GMT on Monday) in a pre-dawn launch from Wenchang Space Launch Center on the southern Chinese island of Hainan carrying the Chang’e-5 spacecraft.The Chang’e-5 mission, named after the ancient Chinese goddess of the moon, will seek to collect lunar material to help scientists understand more about the moon’s origins and formation. The mission will test China’s ability to remotely acquire samples from space, ahead of more complex missions.State broadcaster CCTV, which ran live coverage of the launch, showed images of China National Space Administration staff in blue uniforms applauding and cheering as they watched the spacecraft climbing through the atmosphere, lighting up the night sky.If successful, the mission would make China only the third country to have retrieved lunar samples, joining the United States and the Soviet Union.Upon entering the moon’s orbit, the spacecraft is intended to deploy a pair of vehicles to the lunar surface: a lander and an ascender. The landing is due to take place in about eight days, according to Pei Zhaoyu, a spokesman for the mission. The probe is due to be on the lunar surface for about two days, while the entire mission is scheduled to take around 23 days.\n",

Fishermen have long complained that the cheap imports were strangling local trade.The coronavirus has slowed Chinese imports. Nervous customers have turned to local fish. But Kenya will soon face shortages unless imports from China resume; it produces just over a third of what it consumes.Kenyan fishermen like 38-year-old Maurice Misodhi, whose skin has been weathered by the sun and wind during two decades on the water, have had a bumper month. Based at Dunga Beach in Kisumu, customers want every fish he catches.Misodhi says the Chinese lockdown seemed to have dried up imports of cheaper Chinese fish.\n",

We expect and hope that Beijing will continue to exercise restraint consistent with their obligations as a major regional power,” Tsai told a forum organized by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute.Relations between China and the United States are widely seen to be at their worst point in decades, with deepening mistrust and friction over the novel coronavirus, U.S. accusations of unfair trade practices, and disputes over Hong Kong, the South China Sea and Taiwan.Tsai said the international community had closely followed the situation in Hong Kong as well as China’s militarization of the South China Sea.\n",

He was also charged with wire fraud and making false statements.Angwang is accused in court documents of reporting to Chinese consulate officials about the activities of Chinese citizens in the New York City area and assessing potential intelligence sources within the local Tibetan community.The criminal complaint showed Angwang told his handler in the Chinese government that he wanted to get promoted in the NYPD so that he could assist China and bring “glory to China.”In a statement on Tuesday, the Chinese Consulate General in New York said its staff had been “fulfilling duties in accordance with international law and the law of the United States,” calling their work “above board and beyond reproach.” (Reporting by Mohammad Zargham in Washington and Dan Whitcomb in Los Angeles; Additional reporting by Se Young Lee; Editing by Jonathan Oatis and Clarence Fernandez)\n",

Zhang Renli, a researcher at the Guangdong Provincial People’s Hospital, received a prison term of two years and Qin Jinzhou, a researcher at the Shenzhen Luohu Hospital Group, received a term of 18 months, suspended for two years.The verdict is China’s first public statement on the fate of He, who disappeared from view after his 2018 experiment sparked a global backlash. His work to edit the genes of embryos to make babies who are resistant to the virus that causes AIDs was sharply critiqued by the international scientific community as an abuse of new gene-engineering methods that are still not fully understood.\n",

      "CONTENT : SHANGHAI — Zoom Video Communications temporarily shut the account belonging to a group of U.S.-based Chinese activists after they held an event to commemorate the 31st anniversary of China’s Tiananmen Square crackdown, the activists said on Thursday.Humanitarian China said the event they held on May 31 was hosted by a paid account and was joined by over 250 people worldwide via video-conferencing platform Zoom, while more than 4,000 streamed it on social media, many of whom were from China. The account was shut on June 7, they said in a statement.Zoom confirmed the U.S.-based account had been suspended but had now been reactivated.When a meeting is held across different countries, the participants within those countries are required to comply with their respective local laws“When a meeting is held across different countries, the participants within those countries are required to comply with their respective local laws,” it said in an e-mailed statement.“We aim to limit the actions we take to those necessary to comply with local law and continuously review and improve our process on these matters.”\n",

She has adapted hers for summer, making them with a thinner silk that allows for better breathability in warmer weather.\n",

      "CONTENT : WENCHANG — China on Tuesday launched a robotic spacecraft to bring back rocks from the moon in the first bid by any country to retrieve samples from the lunar surface since the 1970s, a mission that underscores Chinese ambitions in space.The Long March-5, China’s largest carrier rocket, blasted off at 4:30 a.m. Beijing time (2030 GMT on Monday) in a pre-dawn launch from Wenchang Space Launch Center on the southern Chinese island of Hainan carrying the Chang’e-5 spacecraft.The Chang’e-5 mission, named after the ancient Chinese goddess of the moon, will seek to collect lunar material to help scientists understand more about the moon’s origins and formation. The mission will test China’s ability to remotely acquire samples from space, ahead of more complex missions.State broadcaster CCTV, which ran live coverage of the launch, showed images of China National Space Administration staff in blue uniforms applauding and cheering as they watched the spacecraft climbing through the atmosphere, lighting up the night sky.If successful, the mission would make China only the third country to have retrieved lunar samples, joining the United States and the Soviet Union.Upon entering the moon’s orbit, the spacecraft is intended to deploy a pair of vehicles to the lunar surface: a lander and an ascender. The landing is due to take place in about eight days, according to Pei Zhaoyu, a spokesman for the mission. The probe is due to be on the lunar surface for about two days, while the entire mission is scheduled to take around 23 days.\n",

      "CONTENT : BEIJING — An influential former Chinese property executive and critic of President Xi Jinping has been ousted from China’s ruling Communist Party, a notice from the Beijing district government showed Thursday.Ren Zhiqiang, the former chairman of state-controlled property developer Huayuan Real Estate Group, had called Xi a “clown” over a speech he made in February about government efforts to battle the coronavirus.Ren went missing in March, three of his friends told Reuters at the time. Beijing’s municipal anti-corruption watchdog later said he was under investigation for a “serious disciplinary violation.”In a notice on Thursday night, the watchdog said Ren had been ousted from the Chinese Communist Party because he was in “severe violation of discipline and law.”It accused Ren of “losing faith,” “not being aligned with the party on important matters of principle,” “vilifying the image of party and country” and being disloyal and dishonest to the party.According to the notice, Ren also used official funds on golf expenses, used office and residential spaces provided for free by businessmen, and unlawfully earned huge profits.Ren’s “unlawful gains” have been confiscated and he will be charged in court, the notice said.The notice made no mention of the article in which Ren also said a lack of free press and speech had prevented the coronavirus outbreak from being tackled sooner, causing the situation to worsen.Ren, who gained the nickname “Cannon Ren” for previous critiques posted on social media, was put on probation from the party for a year in 2016 as part of a punishment for publicly criticizing government policy.

And I made a great deal, $250 billion potentially worth of purchases,” Trump was quoted as telling Axios on Friday when asked why he had not enacted Treasury sanctions against Communist Party officials linked to repression in the Xinjiang region.The United Nations estimates that more than a million Muslims have been detained in camps there. The State Department has accused China of subjecting Muslims to torture and abuse.China has denied mistreatment and says the camps provide vocational training and help fight extremism.U.S. officials previously told Reuters that since late 2018 they had weighed sanctions against Chinese officials over Xinjiang but refrained because of trade and diplomatic considerations.\n",

Fishermen have long complained that the cheap imports were strangling local trade.The coronavirus has slowed Chinese imports. Nervous customers have turned to local fish. But Kenya will soon face shortages unless imports from China resume; it produces just over a third of what it consumes.Kenyan fishermen like 38-year-old Maurice Misodhi, whose skin has been weathered by the sun and wind during two decades on the water, have had a bumper month. Based at Dunga Beach in Kisumu, customers want every fish he catches.Misodhi says the Chinese lockdown seemed to have dried up imports of cheaper Chinese fish.\n",

The initiative could also bring in more people to bolster Canada’s health-care sector as it fights a second wave of COVID-19, he added.This announcement was part of Canada’s response to the Chinese government’s imposition in June of a new national-security law in Hong Kong that is widely seen as eroding democratic protections there.“Canada remains deeply concerned about China’s passage of the new national-security law. We have unequivocally stated that this legislation and the unilateral powers within it are in direct conflict with China’s international obligations and undermine the ‘one country, two systems’ framework,” said Mendicino.Hong Kong was supposed to operate under that framework after Britain handed its former colony over to Beijing in 1997 under an international agreement. But human-rights and democracy advocates say Beijing’s new national-security law is undermining freedom in Hong Kong.\n",

      "CONTENT : The Marginal Revolution weblog points us to an informed analysis by scholar Minxin Pei of what the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic signifies for the future of China’s president, Xi Jinping. Six months after the country’s delayed but overwhelming response to the initial outbreak of the virus, is Xi’s stock up or down? Unfortunately, it’s the usual informed answer: that depends.Pei’s account of the inner-party reaction to the disaster emerging in Hubei Province breaks things down into three general phases. In the first phase, as we now know, nobody really wanted to believe that there was a possibility of human-to-human transmission of the new coronavirus (identified as such, and as being SARS-like, on Dec. 27). Xi’s public account is that he gave local officials “unspecified instructions” on dealing with the Wuhan outbreak on Jan. 7, but Pei, in the tradition of Kremlinologists, notes that the itineraries and speeches of top Chinese officials, and particularly Xi, went forward as normal for a while. With the stage being set for a global pandemic in his own country, Xi paid a two-day visit to Burma on Jan. 17 and 18 and spent the next few days in the southwestern province of Yunnan, far from the crisis.\n",

According to a map the ministry provided, none got close to mainland Taiwan itself or flew over it.“ROCAF scrambled fighters, and deployed air defense missile system to monitor the activities,” the ministry said in a tweet, referring to the Republic of China Air Force, the formal name of Taiwan’s air force.Taiwan has complained of repeated incidents of Chinese aircraft near the island this year, and has regularly had to scramble its F-16s and other jets to intercept them.China had on Friday announced, at a news conference in Beijing about China’s U.N. peacekeeping efforts, combat drills near the Taiwan Strait and denounced what it called collusion between the island and the United States.\n",

      "CONTENT : DENPASAR — Steven Gu, a Chinese tourist on the Indonesian island of Bali, was supposed to fly back last month from his holiday to his home town in Jiangsu province to celebrate the Lunar New Year.But when he learned about the coronavirus outbreak in China, Gu, who has been in Bali since mid-January, decided to extend his stay with his wife, child and his parents.“The epidemic in China is very serious now, therefore I hope to keep my family safe by staying in Bali,” Gu told Reuters.He is not alone. Thousands of Chinese tourists on the resort island have opted to remain amid fears over the coronavirus, which has killed more than 600.A Bali-based law and human rights ministry official, Sutrisno, said authorities would help Chinese tourists with visas if they did not want to return yet.“We will extend their stay for one month. Every visa on arrival can be extended once and for 30 days. But if their country is not safe to return we will help to facilitate this for humanitarian purposes,” said Sutrisno, who uses one name.\n",

All three carriers have urged the FCC not to do that.\n",

Information flows from secretive North Korea are very limited, and such reports are not always accurate.\n",

The virus, originating in Wuhan at the end of last year, has spread to Chinese cities including Beijing and Shanghai, as well as the United States, Thailand, South Korea, Japan and Taiwan.The former Portuguese colony’s government said last week it issued prevention guidelines to schools and other social service institutions and enhanced temperature screening at maritime terminals and land-based checkpoints.Health authorities in neighboring Hong Kong said on Tuesday the city had no confirmed cases of people contracting the Wuhan virus.Coronaviruses are a family of viruses named because of the crown-like spikes on their surfaces that cause respiratory illnesses ranging from the common cold to the deadly Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).

That’s just a hegemonic practice. China is firmly opposed to that,” he said.The U.S. executive orders, which will be effective in 45 days, come after the Trump administration announced its efforts to purge “untrusted” Chinese apps from U.S. digital networks and called WeChat, controlled by Tencent Holdings Ltd, and ByteDance’s TikTok “significant threats.”Wang said that the United States was sacrificing the interests of users and companies and engaging in political manipulation and oppression, adding that it “will only lose its moral high ground with a damaged image and a deficit of trust.” (Reporting by Cate Cadell Writing by Tony Munroe; Editing by John Stonestreet and Alexander Smith)\n",

      "CONTENT : HONG KONG — Hong Kong opposition lawmakers, seen as representatives of moderate pro-democracy voices in the Chinese-ruled finance hub, are expected to formally tender their resignation on Thursday in protest against the dismissal of four of their colleagues.Their dramatic departure will remove a key avenue for dissent in Hong Kong, where Beijing’s move to introduce national security legislation on June 30 and COVID-19 restrictions have quashed the pro-democracy protests which started last year.The resignations are expected to be handed individually throughout the day at the Legislative Council, or Legco, in what is likely to be the swan song for the old guard of democrats.The younger generation of pro-democracy supporters prefer a more confrontational approach, although it is unclear whether hardline activists would pass authorities’ patriotic scrutiny to be able to challenge in future elections.“I never thought highly of the democrats, but now that they’ve all resigned we don’t even have anyone on our side with voting rights in Legco,” said 21-year-old student Jasmine Yuen on her way to classes.“One year ago I was so angry and I was out there at the protests. But now I’m numb to these events. I lost my passion and fire. I don’t think there’s anything left to do.”\n",

      "CONTENT : Throughout Chinese history, the reign of an imperial line was believed to follow a pattern known as the dynastic cycle. A strong, unifying leader establishes an empire that would rise, flourish but eventually decline, lose the “mandate of heaven” and be overthrown by the next dynasty.Similar to Europe’s “divine right of kings”, the mandate of heaven differed in that it did not unconditionally entitle an emperor to rule the Celestial Empire. While on the dragon throne, the “son of heaven” had total power over his subjects. But he did not have to be of noble birth and he could lose his heavenly mandate for being unworthy, unjust or plain incompetent. The right of the populace to rebel was implicitly guaranteed if the heavens were seen to be displeased. Natural disasters, famine, plague, invasion and even armed rebellion were all regarded as signs the mandate of heaven had been withdrawn.After the powerful peasant emperor Mao Zedong won a civil war in 1949, the Chinese Communist party attempted to dispel such beliefs as unscientific superstition. Since taking power in 2012, President Xi Jinping has encouraged a revival of some ancient traditions and beliefs.\n",

To say otherwise would be deceiving people,” Yen said, without giving a comparison figure for last year.He clarified that a figure of 4,132 air force missions this year, as provided in a ministry parliamentary briefing paper, included training and regular patrol missions.\n",

      "CONTENT : BEIJING — China’s foreign ministry firmly opposes executive orders announced by U.S. President Donald Trump banning U.S. transactions with the Chinese owners of messaging app WeChat and video-sharing app TikTok, Beijing said on Friday.Beijing will defend the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese businesses and the United States would have to bear the consequences of its actions, ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin told reporters during a daily briefing, without giving details.“The U.S. is using national security as an excuse and using state power to oppress non-American businesses. That’s just a hegemonic practice. China is firmly opposed to that,” he said.The U.S. executive orders, which will be effective in 45 days, come after the Trump administration announced its efforts to purge “untrusted” Chinese apps from U.S. digital networks and called WeChat, controlled by Tencent Holdings Ltd, and ByteDance’s TikTok “significant threats.”Wang said that the United States was sacrificing the interests of users and companies and engaging in political manipulation and oppression, adding that it “will only lose its moral high ground with a damaged image and a deficit of trust.” (Reporting by Cate Cadell Writing by Tony Munroe; Editing by John Stonestreet and Alexander Smith)\n",

The virus, originating in Wuhan at the end of last year, has spread to Chinese cities including Beijing and Shanghai, as well as the United States, Thailand, South Korea, Japan and Taiwan.The former Portuguese colony’s government said last week it issued prevention guidelines to schools and other social service institutions and enhanced temperature screening at maritime terminals and land-based checkpoints.Health authorities in neighboring Hong Kong said on Tuesday the city had no confirmed cases of people contracting the Wuhan virus.Coronaviruses are a family of viruses named because of the crown-like spikes on their surfaces that cause respiratory illnesses ranging from the common cold to the deadly Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).

The app, which has since seen millions of downloads, is not available on the Apple store just yet.While such proxy apps are not new in China, where a virtual private network (VPN) service is typically needed to allow domestic users passage to sites such as Google or Facebook, the arrival of Tuber suggests a slight lowering of the Great Firewall.While welcomed by internet users in China, some complained about the app’s slowness. References to sensitive political issues such as the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown and the Hong Kong protests were also censored in part, according to Reuters checks.Users of the app must also register with personal information such as their identity card numbers and real names, while being warned against flouting state interests and going against the country’s socialist system.Qihoo 360 could not immediately be reached for comment.

      "CONTENT : PARAMARIBO — China’s embassy to Suriname on Friday accused U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo of “smearing” Beijing, after Washington’s top diplomat critiqued Chinese companies’ business practices during the first stop on a four-country South America tour.In a joint appearance with newly elected Surinamese President Chan Santokhi on Thursday, Pompeo contrasted “the quality of the products and services of American private companies” with Chinese companies, which he said often do not compete on a “fair and equitable basis.”“We’ve watched the Chinese Communist Party invest in countries, and it all seems great at the front end and then it all comes falling down when the political costs connected to that becomes clear,” Pompeo said.His comments came after a string of oil discoveries off the coast of Suriname, whose trade ties with China grew under the small South American country’s former President Desi Bouterse, a military strongman who oversaw an economic collapse and lost a re-election bid to Santokhi earlier this year.China lent and invested heavily in resource-rich Latin America during the decade-long commodities boom that largely came to a close in 2014. The Trump administration has sought to highlight the heavy debts and economic deterioration those ties have left for close Chinese trade partners like Venezuela and Ecuador.In its statement, the Chinese embassy to Paramaribo said, “any attempt to sow discord between China and Suriname is doomed to fail.“We advise Mr. Pompeo to respect facts and truth, abandon arrogance and prejudice, stop smearing and spreading rumors about China,” the embassy said.Santokhi told reporters on Thursday that Suriname’s relationship with China was not a topic of conversation in his meeting with Pompeo.“It is not a question of making choices,” he said.

      "CONTENT : BEIJING — Chinese budget carrier Spring Airlines is leveraging its low-cost position to attract customers with cheap fares as the country’s domestic aviation market recovers, pursuing an aggressive expansion strategy that could soon turn profitable.Domestic capacity at Shanghai-based Spring rose over 50% in September compared with a year earlier, while passenger traffic was up 47% and the airline’s load factor, or percentage of seats filled, neared 90% as it redirected planes from closed international markets. Spring’s market share has doubled from 2% a year ago to 4%, according to broker Jefferies.The private airline’s success in the Chinese market, traditionally dominated by full-service state-owned carriers, could herald a wider global trend.Investors expect low-cost, domestic-focused carriers will be the first to recover from the pandemic as leisure travelers focus on value and corporate travel takes longer to recover.Japan Airlines Co Ltd has said it plans to bolster its low-cost operations, including its Japanese joint venture with Spring, while sources said ANA Holdings Inc is weighing whether to use budget carrier Peach for more flights.“We do see low-cost carriers (LCCs) rebounding the fastest out of all airlines across most regions, not just China,” BOCOM International analyst Luya You said. “The reasons are that LCCs can offer lower prices due to lower costs as well as fill their planes more efficiently than full-service carriers.”\n",

      "CONTENT : HONG KONG — Hong Kong opposition lawmakers, seen as representatives of moderate pro-democracy voices in the Chinese-ruled finance hub, are expected to formally tender their resignation on Thursday in protest against the dismissal of four of their colleagues.Their dramatic departure will remove a key avenue for dissent in Hong Kong, where Beijing’s move to introduce national security legislation on June 30 and COVID-19 restrictions have quashed the pro-democracy protests which started last year.The resignations are expected to be handed individually throughout the day at the Legislative Council, or Legco, in what is likely to be the swan song for the old guard of democrats.The younger generation of pro-democracy supporters prefer a more confrontational approach, although it is unclear whether hardline activists would pass authorities’ patriotic scrutiny to be able to challenge in future elections.“I never thought highly of the democrats, but now that they’ve all resigned we don’t even have anyone on our side with voting rights in Legco,” said 21-year-old student Jasmine Yuen on her way to classes.“One year ago I was so angry and I was out there at the protests.

      "CONTENT : TAIPEI — Taiwan’s air force scrambled jets for a second consecutive day on Saturday as multiple Chinese aircraft approached the island and crossed the sensitive midline of the Taiwan Strait, with the island’s government urging Beijing to “pull back from the edge.”Taiwan’s Defence Ministry said 19 Chinese aircraft were involved, one more than in the previous day, with some crossing the Taiwan Strait midline and others flying into Taiwan’s air defense identification zone off its southwest coast.It said China, which claims democratic Taiwan as its own territory, sent 12 J-16 fighters, two J-10 fighters, two J-11 fighters, two H-6 bombers and one Y-8 anti-submarine aircraft. According to a map the ministry provided, none got close to mainland Taiwan itself or flew over it.“ROCAF scrambled fighters, and deployed air defense missile system to monitor the activities,” the ministry said in a tweet, referring to the Republic of China Air Force, the formal name of Taiwan’s air force.Taiwan has complained of repeated incidents of Chinese aircraft near the island this year, and has regularly had to scramble its F-16s and other jets to intercept them.China had on Friday announced, at a news conference in Beijing about China’s U.N. peacekeeping efforts, combat drills near the Taiwan Strait and denounced what it called collusion between the island and the United States.\n",

      "CONTENT : HONG KONG — Former Liverpool and Real Madrid head coach Rafa Benitez has laid bare the difficulties foreign coaches face working in the Chinese Super League: a lack of understanding of the game among local players.Benitez saw his Dalian Pro side lose 2-0 to Tianjin Teda in the first leg of a playoff on Monday evening, and the Spaniard was left frustrated at not being able to influence the outcome as he would if he were coaching in Europe or elsewhere.“When you work with a team in Europe it’s totally different to when you work with a team in China,” he said.“In Europe, the understanding of the game is different and here it is more difficult… So it’s not what you want to do or what you can do – it’s what your players can do.”Benitez is one of numerous high-profile coaches brought in by Chinese clubs over the last decade to help lift the standard of the game in a country desperate to establish itself as a player on the global scene.But while China’s economy has improved remarkably over the last three decades and the nation’s international profile has increased significantly in other areas, in football China remains a minor player.It has only once qualified for the World Cup finals, in 2002, although club teams have had success on the regional level, with Guangzhou Evergrande twice winning the Asian Champions League in the last seven years.\n",

      "CONTENT : TAIPEI — Taiwan has spent almost $900 million this year on scrambling its air force against Chinese incursions, the island’s defense minister said on Wednesday, describing the pressure they are facing as “great.”China, which claims democratic Taiwan as its own territory, has stepped up its military activity near the island, responding to what China calls “collusion” between Taiwan and the United States.China has been angered at increased U.S. support for Taiwan, including visits by senior U.S. government officials and ramped up arms sales.In the past few weeks, Chinese fighter jets have crossed the mid line of the Taiwan Strait, which normally serves as an unofficial buffer zone, and flown multiple missions into Taiwan’s southwestern air defense identification zone.Speaking at parliament, Taiwan Defence Minister Yen De-fa said to the air force had scrambled 2,972 times against Chinese aircraft this year at a cost of T$25.5 billion ($886.49 million).“Recently the pressure has been great. To say otherwise would be deceiving people,” Yen said, without giving a comparison figure for last year.He clarified that a figure of 4,132 air force missions this year, as provided in a ministry parliamentary briefing paper, included training and regular patrol missions.\n",

      "CONTENT : WASHINGTON — The United States on Wednesday blacklisted 24 Chinese companies and targeted a number of individuals it said were part of construction and military actions related to disputed islands in the South China Sea.The U.S. Commerce Department said the two dozen companies played a “role in helping the Chinese military construct and militarize the internationally condemned artificial islands in the South China Sea.”The State Department, in a separate statement, said it would impose visa restrictions on Chinese individuals “responsible for, or complicit in,” such action and those linked to China’s “use of coercion against Southeast Asian claimants to inhibit their access to offshore resources.”The move marked the Trump administration’s latest efforts to crack down on companies whose goods may support Chinese military activities.The Chinese embassy in Washington did not immediately reply to a request for comment.The United States accuses China of militarizing the South China Sea and trying to intimidate Asian neighbors who might want to exploit its extensive oil and gas reserves. The United States has conducted multiple freedom of navigation operations by sending its warships through the area to assert the freedom of access to international waterways.\n",

They said they were organizing their own graduation after the university said it would be held online because of the risk of the novel coronavirus.“I want to pass on the spirit … so the next generation of students don’t forget what happened last year,” said Philip, a social sciences graduate who declined to give his last name.In November last year, campuses of CUHK and the Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) saw prolonged clashes between students and riot police, with protesters firing petrol bombs from catapults and using bows and arrows and police responding with water cannon, tear gas and rubber bullets.The PolyU campus was surrounded by police for more than a week, with some students staging dramatic escapes through sewers rather than hand themselves in to police.On Thursday, the students held black balloons and a banner reading “Happy graduation, CU rioters.” They chanted pro-democracy slogans and brandished the three-finger “Hunger Games” salute, in a nod to the gesture of defiance adopted by anti-government protests in Thailand.\n",

It describes it as the largest regional development project in China’s global Belt and Road infrastructure initiative.The company and the Cambodian government have repeatedly denied Western media reports that the project has military aims.In a statement announcing the blacklisting, the U.S. Treasury Department described the company as a Chinese state-owned entity, and said it had at one point falsely registered as Cambodian-owned to get land for the project.Projects funded by the company had “forced Cambodians from their land and devastated the environment, hurting the livelihoods of local communities.”“The United States is committed to using the full range of its authorities to target these practices wherever they occur,” Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in the statement.\n",

Travel restrictions imposed in recent weeks to slow the global coronavirus pandemic have deepened the effects of a ban last year on lucrative online gambling.But Kang is betting on a future beyond the pandemic, banking on the return of money from China to finish transforming the scrappy frontier town into a gleaming metropolis.In a sign of his confidence, Kang’s casino has installed gold urinals.“This city is just starting, there is a lot of potential,” says Kang, 60. “I love it. Sihanoukville gives you a feeling of freedom and no control.”For Kang and others, the city is like the China of several decades ago – with all of the promise and none of the competition.

      "CONTENT : SAO PAULO — São Paulo’s Butantan Institute biomedical center on Thursday received 1 million doses of a Chinese COVID-19 vaccine developed by Sinovac Biotech Ltd that is undergoing late-stage testing by the institute at 16 locations in Brazil.The consignment of CoronaVac vaccine will be packaged and labeled at Butantan’s facilities pending regulatory approval. Butantan said it expected Sinovac to publish efficacy results from its vaccine trials by Dec. 15.Brazil’s Senate later on Thursday approved a presidential decree that appropriates 2 billion reais ($388 million) to buy the vaccine being developed by AstraZeneca and Oxford University. The lower chamber did so on Wednesday.The funds will go to the federal biomedical center Fiocruz to buy and later produce the British vaccine in Brazil.São Paulo Governor João Doria told reporters that immunizations in his state would begin in January, which means the state would begin vaccinations ahead of the national plan, slated to start in March.“We are not going to wait for March and we are not going to bury more Brazilians just to wait, when we could be saving more than 60 thousand lives as of January,” Doria said.Earlier on Thursday, Doria had said the state would receive 6 million doses of the Chinese vaccine this month, with another 40 million doses by Jan. 15.\n",

But in an internal letter to staff on Monday seen by Reuters, the company’s founder and CEO Zhang Yiming said the firm had started talks with a tech company it did not identify to clear the way “for us to continue offering the TikTok app in the U.S.”\n",

      "CONTENT : Our cookbook of the week is The Food of Sichuan by Fuchsia Dunlop, a James Beard Award-winning specialist in Chinese cuisine. To try a recipe from the book, check out: Mapo tofu, fish-fragrant eggplants and soup noodles with ground pork topping.Rich tones and revitalizing flavours permeate Fuchsia Dunlop’s The Food of Sichuan (W.W. Norton & Company, 2019). From the deep scarlet tinge of mapo tofu to the characteristic orange-red colour of fish-fragrant eggplants, the regional Chinese cuisine holds the power to simultaneously “restore the body” and “soothe the heart.”“It’s a really warm, generous and joyful cuisine,” says Dunlop. “It’s so much more than just heat and spice — it’s very varied and subtle.”Equal parts delicate and fiery, the cuisine of the southwestern Chinese province was little-known in the West when Dunlop wrote the first edition of the book (Land of Plenty, 2001) nearly two decades ago. The Food of Sichuan, an updated version, contains roughly 70 new recipes — with an emphasis on the classics — and benefits from the vast knowledge she’s gained in the intervening years.\n",

      "CONTENT : For a few hours Monday, scientists held their breath as they watched a nearly 20-ton piece of space debris from a Chinese rocket fall through the sky and pass over Los Angeles and New York City, uncontrolled. The speed at which the debris — the fourth-largest to return to Earth uncontrolled — was travelling made it hard for scientists to guess where the debris would ultimately crash. “It was travelling very fast horizontally in the atmosphere and it’s hard to predict where it would come down,”Jonathan McDowell, astronomer at the Harvard-Smithsonian Centre for Astrophysics, toldCNN. Ultimately, the debris was recorded splashing down in the Atlantic Ocean, just off the west coast of Mauritania in northwest Africa. A few pieces of the debris were also reportedly strewn over two African villages on the Ivory Coast. No casualties were recorded from the incident. The debris was the empty core stage of a Chinese Long March 5B (CZ-5B) rocket, which was successfully launched on May 5, spent several days in orbit as part of its mission before re-entering Earth’s atmosphere.\n",

While a small number of cases have been confirmed in more than 10 countries, no fatalities have been reported elsewhere.The total number of confirmed cases in China rose about 30% to 2,744, about half of which were in Hubei.Li, the most senior leader to visit Wuhan since the outbreak began, went to the city to inspect the ongoing efforts to contain the epidemic and spoke with patients and medical staff, China’s government said in a statement.China’s cabinet on Sunday said it would extend the week-long Lunar New Year holiday by three days to Feb. 2 in a bid to slow the spread of the virus. The Lunar New Year is usually a time for millions of Chinese to travel but many have had to cancel their holiday plans due to virus-related travel restrictions.\n",

      "CONTENT : BEIJING — An influential former Chinese property executive and critic of President Xi Jinping has been ousted from China’s ruling Communist Party, a notice from the Beijing district government showed Thursday.Ren Zhiqiang, the former chairman of state-controlled property developer Huayuan Real Estate Group, had called Xi a “clown” over a speech he made in February about government efforts to battle the coronavirus.Ren went missing in March, three of his friends told Reuters at the time. Beijing’s municipal anti-corruption watchdog later said he was under investigation for a “serious disciplinary violation.”In a notice on Thursday night, the watchdog said Ren had been ousted from the Chinese Communist Party because he was in “severe violation of discipline and law.”It accused Ren of “losing faith,” “not being aligned with the party on important matters of principle,” “vilifying the image of party and country” and being disloyal and dishonest to the party.According to the notice, Ren also used official funds on golf expenses, used office and residential spaces provided for free by businessmen, and unlawfully earned huge profits.Ren’s “unlawful gains” have been confiscated and he will be charged in court, the notice said.The notice made no mention of the article in which Ren also said a lack of free press and speech had prevented the coronavirus outbreak from being tackled sooner, causing the situation to worsen.Ren, who gained the nickname “Cannon Ren” for previous critiques posted on social media, was put on probation from the party for a year in 2016 as part of a punishment for publicly criticizing government policy.

The State Department has accused China of subjecting Muslims to torture and abuse.China has denied mistreatment and says the camps provide vocational training and help fight extremism.U.S. officials previously told Reuters that since late 2018 they had weighed sanctions against Chinese officials over Xinjiang but refrained because of trade and diplomatic considerations.\n",

      "CONTENT : WASHINGTON — The United States on Wednesday blacklisted 24 Chinese firms and targeted individuals it said were part of construction and military actions in the South China Sea, its first such sanctions move against Beijing over the disputed strategic waterway.The U.S. Commerce Department said the two dozen companies played a “role in helping the Chinese military construct and militarize the internationally condemned artificial islands in the South China Sea.”Separately, the State Department said it would impose visa restrictions on Chinese individuals “responsible for, or complicit in,” such action and those linked to China’s “use of coercion against Southeast Asian claimants to inhibit their access to offshore resources.”Companies blacklisted by the Commerce Department include Guangzhou Haige Communications Group, several firms that appear to be related to the China Communications Construction Co, as well as Beijing Huanjia Telecommunication, Changzhou Guoguang Data Communications, China Electronics Technology Group Corp and China Shipbuilding Group.It was the latest U.S. move to crack down on firms whose goods may support Chinese military activities and comes in the run up to the Nov. 3 U.S. elections, in which both President Donald Trump and rival Joe Biden have been sharply critical of China.\n",

      "CONTENT : NEW DELHI — Seeking to end a dangerous military standoff in the western Himalayas, India and China are formulating a plan that involves creating no-patrol zones, pulling back tanks and artillery, and using drones to verify the withdrawal, Indian officials say.Tensions have run high since June, when at least 20 Indian soldiers were killed after being attacked by Chinese troops using rocks and clubs. Indian officials say the Chinese troops had intruded across the disputed border in a remote valley. China said the Indian soldiers’ actions had been provocative.Since then, the nuclear armed Asian neighbors have deployed tens of thousands of troops on the rugged frontier between India’s Ladakh region and the Chinese-held Tibetan plateau, raising the risk of further confrontation even while looking for ways to de-escalate.After months of fitful progress, the two sides are discussing a staggered disengagement from the high-altitude desert where temperatures have dipped to 18 degrees below Celsius, three Indian government officials said.“We have a firm plan for disengagement on the table, it is being internally discussed on both sides,” said one of the officials, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the situation.\n",

The two payments it missed, due in October and December, were worth more than 300 million euros.Mediapro’s founder Jaume Roures said in October the company was working to find an agreement over its broadcasting rights after LFP issued Mediapro with a formal notice to honor the first payment, worth 172 million euros ($208.58 million) payment.As a result, the Telefoot channel launched by Mediapro in August in France will cease broadcasting, the newspapers reported.LFP was not immediately available for comment. A spokesman for Mediapro declined to comment over the details of the agreement but confirmed Telefoot will cease broadcasting from Dec. 23.

This year’s military spending represented about 2.4 percent of gross domestic product.“We are strengthening our army to deter any aggressor, we have no intention to wage any … conflicts,” Vucic told reporters after the exercise.For the first time, Serbia demonstrated the use of CH-92A combat drones, the first such deployment of Chinese unmanned aerial vehicles in Europe. It received six such drones in June.Beijing sees Serbia as part of its Belt and Road Initiative, aimed at opening new foreign trade links for Chinese companies that have invested billions of euros, mainly in soft loans for infrastructure and energy projects.\n",

Suspected infection cases are quarantined at medical facilities,” the report added.On Feb. 2, Vietnam’s labor ministry asked businesses and employers not to let Chinese workers return to work in Vietnam.Vietnam declared a public health emergency over the epidemic on Feb. 1 and has banned all flights to and from China, where nearly 1,400 people have died from the virus.

      "CONTENT : SIHANOUKVILLE — *Photo essay: https://reut.rs/3avL9X4When casino owner Kang Qiang looks out the window of his 20th floor office in this city on the remote Cambodian coast, he sees construction cranes sitting idle.The Chinese-funded gambling enclave of Sihanoukville has suffered a double blow. Travel restrictions imposed in recent weeks to slow the global coronavirus pandemic have deepened the effects of a ban last year on lucrative online gambling.But Kang is betting on a future beyond the pandemic, banking on the return of money from China to finish transforming the scrappy frontier town into a gleaming metropolis.In a sign of his confidence, Kang’s casino has installed gold urinals.“This city is just starting, there is a lot of potential,” says Kang, 60. “I love it. Sihanoukville gives you a feeling of freedom and no control.”For Kang and others, the city is like the China of several decades ago – with all of the promise and none of the competition. The current idle is only a blip.\n",

This year’s military spending represented about 2.4 percent of gross domestic product.“We are strengthening our army to deter any aggressor, we have no intention to wage any … conflicts,” Vucic told reporters after the exercise.For the first time, Serbia demonstrated the use of CH-92A combat drones, the first such deployment of Chinese unmanned aerial vehicles in Europe. It received six such drones in June.Beijing sees Serbia as part of its Belt and Road Initiative, aimed at opening new foreign trade links for Chinese companies that have invested billions of euros, mainly in soft loans for infrastructure and energy projects.\n",

Suspected infection cases are quarantined at medical facilities,” the report added.On Feb. 2, Vietnam’s labor ministry asked businesses and employers not to let Chinese workers return to work in Vietnam.Vietnam declared a public health emergency over the epidemic on Feb. 1 and has banned all flights to and from China, where nearly 1,400 people have died from the virus.

      "CONTENT : KISUMU — The coronavirus pandemic has handed Kenyan fishermen an unexpected boon – a rush of customers who now shun imported Chinese frozen filets in favor of freshly caught fish from Lake Victoria.Kenya bought $23.2 million worth of frozen fish from China in 2018, according to the International Trade Center, almost all of its fish imports. Fishermen have long complained that the cheap imports were strangling local trade.The coronavirus has slowed Chinese imports. Nervous customers have turned to local fish. But Kenya will soon face shortages unless imports from China resume; it produces just over a third of what it consumes.Kenyan fishermen like 38-year-old Maurice Misodhi, whose skin has been weathered by the sun and wind during two decades on the water, have had a bumper month. Based at Dunga Beach in Kisumu, customers want every fish he catches.Misodhi says the Chinese lockdown seemed to have dried up imports of cheaper Chinese fish.\n",

The Chinese Foreign Ministry did not directly address FireEye’s allegations but said in a statement that China was “a victim of cybercrime and cyberattack.” The U.S. Office of the Director of National Intelligence declined comment.\n",

      "CONTENT : OTTAWA — Canada on Monday criticized remarks by the Chinese ambassador to Ottawa last week about Hong Kong protesters, in the latest round of a long-running diplomatic dispute tied to the arrest of a Huawei Technologies Co Ltd executive in Vancouver.Although the dispute centers on Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou, a Chinese citizen arrested in late 2018 on a bank-fraud warrant issued by U.S. authorities, the ambassador’s comments were about granting asylum to Hong Kong pro-democracy protesters.At a news conference on Thursday, Ambassador Cong Peiwu warned Canada against granting asylum to protesters because he said they were “violent criminals” who threatened the “health and safety” of the 300,000 Canadian passport holders living in Hong Kong.Many Canadian media interpreted the comments as a threat to Canada’s citizens.On Friday, the leader of the main opposition Conservative Party, Erin O’Toole, called on Cong to retract the comments and publicly apologize or go home, and the Toronto Sun newspaper echoed that in an editorial on Saturday.Speaking in parliament on Monday, Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland said the remarks were “not appropriate in any way of diplomatic relations between two countries.”\n",

China claims Taiwan as its territory, to be brought under Beijing’s control by force if necessary.Taiwan’s ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) has begun a renewed push for the legislation, ahead of presidential and parliamentary elections on Jan. 11, and it could be passed before the end of the year.Taiwan’s main opposition party, the Kuomintang, which favors close ties with China, has condemned the proposed legislation as a “political tool” of Tsai and her DPP to gain votes while trying to paint them as Chinese Communist Party agents.\n",

He was also charged with wire fraud and making false statements.Angwang is accused in court documents of reporting to Chinese consulate officials about the activities of Chinese citizens in the New York City area and assessing potential intelligence sources within the local Tibetan community, court documents charge.According to the criminal complaint, Angwang told his handler within the Chinese government that he wanted to get promoted within the NYPD so that he could assist the People’s Republic of China and bring “glory to China.” (Reporting by Mohammad Zargham in Washington and Dan Whitcomb in Los Angeles; Editing by Leslie Adler and Jonathan Oatis)\n",

Along with 58 other Chinese apps, including Tencent Holdings Ltd’s WeChat and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd’s UC Browser, it was banned in India this week following a border clash with China.“I can confirm that the Chinese government has never made a request to us for the TikTok data of Indian users,” Mayer wrote, adding that data for Indian users is stored in servers in Singapore. “If we do ever receive such a request in the future, we would not comply.”\n",

      "CONTENT : I met the late John Crosbie, whose state funeral was Thursday, just once. It was so long ago it was at a big GATT meeting in Montreal — remember the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade? — when the WTO was just a twinkle in international trade bureaucrats’ eyes. We were all waiting for a lunch to begin. He looked a little lost so I helped him get to where he was supposed to be going.

      "CONTENT : OTTAWA — Canada on Monday criticized remarks by the Chinese ambassador to Ottawa last week about Hong Kong protesters, in the latest round of a long-running diplomatic dispute tied to the arrest of a Huawei Technologies Co Ltd executive in Vancouver.Although the dispute centers on Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou, a Chinese citizen arrested in late 2018 on a bank-fraud warrant issued by U.S. authorities, the ambassador’s comments were about granting asylum to Hong Kong pro-democracy protesters.At a news conference on Thursday, Ambassador Cong Peiwu warned Canada against granting asylum to protesters because he said they were “violent criminals” who threatened the “health and safety” of the 300,000 Canadian passport holders living in Hong Kong.Many Canadian media interpreted the comments as a threat to Canada’s citizens.On Friday, the leader of the main opposition Conservative Party, Erin O’Toole, called on Cong to retract the comments and publicly apologize or go home, and the Toronto Sun newspaper echoed that in an editorial on Saturday.Speaking in parliament on Monday, Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland said the remarks were “not appropriate in any way of diplomatic relations between two countries.”\n",

Beijing believes Tsai, who won re-election last month, wishes to push the island’s formal independence.\n",

China claims Taiwan as its territory, to be brought under Beijing’s control by force if necessary.Taiwan’s ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) has begun a renewed push for the legislation, ahead of presidential and parliamentary elections on Jan. 11, and it could be passed before the end of the year.Taiwan’s main opposition party, the Kuomintang, which favors close ties with China, has condemned the proposed legislation as a “political tool” of Tsai and her DPP to gain votes while trying to paint them as Chinese Communist Party agents.\n",

He was also charged with wire fraud and making false statements.Angwang is accused in court documents of reporting to Chinese consulate officials about the activities of Chinese citizens in the New York City area and assessing potential intelligence sources within the local Tibetan community, court documents charge.According to the criminal complaint, Angwang told his handler within the Chinese government that he wanted to get promoted within the NYPD so that he could assist the People’s Republic of China and bring “glory to China.” (Reporting by Mohammad Zargham in Washington and Dan Whitcomb in Los Angeles; Editing by Leslie Adler and Jonathan Oatis)\n",

Fifteen medical personnel are among those infected.Wang, who conducted research on Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003, said he was receiving treatment and would receive an injection soon. He did not give details on how he may have been infected.“I don’t want everyone to put too much attention on my condition,” he told the channel.Wang told state media on Jan. 10 that the outbreak appeared to be under control, with most patients showing mild symptoms and some having been discharged.He could not be reached by Reuters on Tuesday.(Reporting by Tony Munroe and Sophie Yu; Additional reporting by Meg Shen and Twinnie Siu in Hong Kong; Editing by Angus MacSwan and Christian Schmollinger)\n",

That statement undercut conspiracy theories promoted by anti-China activists and some supporters of President Donald Trump who suggest it was developed in a Chinese government biological weapons laboratory.“The best experts so far seem to think it was man-made. I have no reason to disbelieve that at this point,” Pompeo said. When the interviewer pointed out that was not the conclusion of U.S. intelligence agencies, Pompeo backtracked, saying, “I’ve seen what the intelligence community has said.

      "CONTENT : I met the late John Crosbie, whose state funeral was Thursday, just once. It was so long ago it was at a big GATT meeting in Montreal — remember the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade? — when the WTO was just a twinkle in international trade bureaucrats’ eyes. We were all waiting for a lunch to begin. He looked a little lost so I helped him get to where he was supposed to be going. I was tickled, as one is, that when I introduced myself he seemed to know who I was, or at least had the good manners to pretend to. We chatted briefly and unmemorably. I was surprised that this most flamboyant of public speakers, one of his generation’s best political talkers, was clearly very shy, though of course it’s now common knowledge he was.As fans of free trade, all economists have a soft spot for John Crosbie, who put Canada-U.S. free trade at the centre of his Conservative leadership campaign in 1983. He came to grief in that campaign for his inability to speak French, which he underlined in bold with his characteristically logical but undiplomatic explanation that “I cannot talk to the Chinese people in their language, either” yet when he visited China he did just fine. Some Quebeckers — separatist ones — were probably quite happy to be compared with the nationals of a foreign country, since that’s what they soon hoped to be. Just about everyone else concluded this was not a good thing to say to, at or about your fellow countrymen.\n",

The move came after the number of cases of the new coronavirus reported in South Korea rose above 1,100.South Korea accounted for a quarter of Vietnam’s 18 million tourists last year – the biggest group after Chinese visitors, whose travel had already been curtailed because of the virus.In the southern resort of Nha Trang, beaches are empty, tour buses sit idle and many shops are shut down at what would normally be a busy season.“All the hotels around here are almost empty,” the owner of a hotel on Tran Phu Street in Nha Trang said by phone. “All the Chinese tourists are gone, and now South Korean tourists are too.”\n",

In the evening, foot traffic increased a little under the glow of the red lanterns strung across the thoroughfare, but remained far below normal levels.“The impact is tremendous,” 45-year old Ausana Akaradachakul told Reuters as she waited behind the counter for shoppers in her store selling postcards, straw bags, clothing and jewelry.“Only a few days after the news broke about the virus, the Chinese tourists were visibly few,” Akaradachakul said. “I think about 70% of them are gone.”The beach resort of Phuket is Thailand’s second most visited destination after Bangkok and is usually a big draw for visitors from China, who accounted for 11 million visitors last year, particularly around the Lunar New Year holiday.\n",

      "CONTENT : NEW DELHI — Seeking to end a dangerous military standoff in the western Himalayas, India and China are formulating a plan that involves creating no-patrol zones, pulling back tanks and artillery, and using drones to verify the withdrawal, Indian officials say.Tensions have run high since June, when at least 20 Indian soldiers were killed after being attacked by Chinese troops using rocks and clubs. Indian officials say the Chinese troops had intruded across the disputed border in a remote valley. China said the Indian soldiers’ actions had been provocative.Since then, the nuclear armed Asian neighbors have deployed tens of thousands of troops on the rugged frontier between India’s Ladakh region and the Chinese-held Tibetan plateau, raising the risk of further confrontation even while looking for ways to de-escalate.After months of fitful progress, the two sides are discussing a staggered disengagement from the high-altitude desert where temperatures have dipped to 18 degrees below Celsius, three Indian government officials said.“We have a firm plan for disengagement on the table, it is being internally discussed on both sides,” said one of the officials, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the situation.\n",

It is the first race canceled since 2011 when the Bahrain Grand Prix was called off over civil unrest.“The reality of today, in most other countries [away from China], the number of people affected is a handful,” F1 CEO Chase Carey said on Wednesday. “But we don’t know what it will be in a week or two.”Formula One said in an extended statement the possibility of rescheduling is being investigated, but the schedule will limit those options. The circuit will also consider postponing the Vietnam Grand Prix in Hanoi on April 5. Vietnam and China share a border.“Amid continued health concerns and with the World Health Organisation declaring the coronavirus as a global health emergency, Formula 1, together with governing body the FIA, jointly decided to accept the postponement request in order to ensure the health and safety of the traveling staff, championship participants and fans.“Formula 1 and the FIA will continue to work closely with the teams, race promoter, CAMF and the local authorities to monitor the situation as it develops, with all parties studying the viability of potential alternative dates for the Grand Prix later in the year should the situation improve.”–Field Level Media\n",

      "CONTENT : TAIPEI — Taiwan’s air force scrambled jets for a second consecutive day on Saturday as multiple Chinese aircraft approached the island and crossed the sensitive midline of the Taiwan Strait, with the island’s government urging Beijing to “pull back from the edge.”Taiwan’s Defence Ministry said 19 Chinese aircraft were involved, one more than in the previous day, with some crossing the Taiwan Strait midline and others flying into Taiwan’s air defense identification zone off its southwest coast.It said China, which claims democratic Taiwan as its own territory, sent 12 J-16 fighters, two J-10 fighters, two J-11 fighters, two H-6 bombers and one Y-8 anti-submarine aircraft. According to a map the ministry provided, none got close to mainland Taiwan itself or flew over it.“ROCAF scrambled fighters, and deployed air defense missile system to monitor the activities,” the ministry said in a tweet, referring to the Republic of China Air Force, the formal name of Taiwan’s air force.Taiwan has complained of repeated incidents of Chinese aircraft near the island this year, and has regularly had to scramble its F-16s and other jets to intercept them.China had on Friday announced, at a news conference in Beijing about China’s U.N. peacekeeping efforts, combat drills near the Taiwan Strait and denounced what it called collusion between the island and the United States.\n",

General Assembly begins Thursday with some 53 heads of state, 39 heads of government and 38 ministers due to make pre-recorded video statements, including U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar and China’s Foreign Minister Wang Yi.A senior U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the special session of the 193-member General Assembly should have been held earlier, that it had been “pre-engineered to serve China’s purposes” and complained that questions at panel discussions on Friday would be restricted.China would use the setting to its advantage, the official said, adding, “I expect them to make a very, very effective propaganda play out of these two days.”A spokesperson for China’s mission to the United Nations in New York said the U.S. “politicization of the issue is not in the interest of the international community.”Without naming the United States, the spokesperson said: “If certain a country insists, it will once again find itself isolated and end in failure.

      "CONTENT : WASHINGTON — The United States said on Monday it will start treating four major Chinese media outlets as foreign embassies, alleging they are mouthpieces for Beijing, in a move that is likely to further sour already fraught ties between the world’s top two economies.David Stilwell, the senior U.S. diplomat for East Asia, told reporters the designation would affect China Central Television, the China News Service, the People’s Daily and the Global Times, and reflected their real status as “propaganda outlets” under the control of the Chinese Communist Party.“The Communist Party does not just exercise operational control over these propaganda entities, but it has full editorial control over their content,” Stilwell said in a teleconference with reporters.China’s embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Plans for the new media outlet designations were first reported by Reuters earlier this month.\n",

One of the sources said a Vietnamese vessel was also tagging the West Capella.The area is close to waters claimed by both Vietnam and Malaysia as well by China, through its sweeping claim to most of the South China Sea within its U-shaped ‘nine-dash line’ that is not recognized by its neighbors or most of the world.The United States has accused China of taking advantage of the distraction of the coronavirus pandemic to advance its presence in the South China Sea.\n",

Even North Korea is banning Chinese people from entering,” wrote the anonymous author of the petition, adding that even a temporary ban would help stop the virus from spreading too widely.\n",

      "CONTENT : PHUKET — The narrow laneways and pastel-colored shophouses of Phuket Old Town are usually bustling with Chinese tourists during the Lunar New Year holiday, but travel bans and local fears about coronavirus have largely emptied the streets this year.Just a handful of tourists, many wearing face masks, strolled through the area during daylight hours this week. In the evening, foot traffic increased a little under the glow of the red lanterns strung across the thoroughfare, but remained far below normal levels.“The impact is tremendous,” 45-year old Ausana Akaradachakul told Reuters as she waited behind the counter for shoppers in her store selling postcards, straw bags, clothing and jewelry.“Only a few days after the news broke about the virus, the Chinese tourists were visibly few,” Akaradachakul said. “I think about 70% of them are gone.”The beach resort of Phuket is Thailand’s second most visited destination after Bangkok and is usually a big draw for visitors from China, who accounted for 11 million visitors last year, particularly around the Lunar New Year holiday.\n",

It is the first race canceled since 2011 when the Bahrain Grand Prix was called off over civil unrest.“The reality of today, in most other countries [away from China], the number of people affected is a handful,” F1 CEO Chase Carey said on Wednesday. “But we don’t know what it will be in a week or two.”Formula One said in an extended statement the possibility of rescheduling is being investigated, but the schedule will limit those options. The circuit will also consider postponing the Vietnam Grand Prix in Hanoi on April 5. Vietnam and China share a border.“Amid continued health concerns and with the World Health Organisation declaring the coronavirus as a global health emergency, Formula 1, together with governing body the FIA, jointly decided to accept the postponement request in order to ensure the health and safety of the traveling staff, championship participants and fans.“Formula 1 and the FIA will continue to work closely with the teams, race promoter, CAMF and the local authorities to monitor the situation as it develops, with all parties studying the viability of potential alternative dates for the Grand Prix later in the year should the situation improve.”–Field Level Media\n",

U.S. President Donald Trump claimed credit for the British decision.“The West must urgently unite to advance a counterweight to China’s tech dominance,” Tobias Ellwood, chairman of the defense committee, said. “We must not surrender our national security for the sake of short-term technological development.”The committee did not go into detail about the exact nature of the ties but said it had seen clear evidence of Huawei collusion with “the Chinese Communist Party apparatus.”Huawei said the report lacked credibility.“It is built on opinion rather than fact. We’re sure people will see through these groundless accusations of collusion and remember instead what Huawei has delivered for Britain over the past 20 years,” a Huawei spokesman said.When asked about the committee’s comments, Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said that some in the UK should think before they speak, and that the legitimate interests of Chinese companies were being damaged.\n",

      "CONTENT : TOKYO — Japan is “seriously concerned” about the move by China’s parliament to go forward with national security legislation for Hong Kong that observers fear could endanger its special autonomy and freedoms, the foreign ministry said on Thursday.In a rare statement issued minutes after the security bill was approved, Japan also called Hong Kong an “extremely important partner,” underscoring close economic ties and people-to-people exchanges.“Japan is seriously concerned about the (Chinese parliament’s) decision…,” the ministry statement said.“It is the long-standing policy of Japan to attach great importance to upholding a free and open system which Hong Kong has been enjoying and the democratic and stable development of Hong Kong under the ‘One Country Two System’ framework.”Japan’s foreign ministry summoned Beijing’s ambassador to Tokyo to convey its concern over the situation and said it would carefully observe further developments in Hong Kong.The Chinese government’s security law for the city is fueling fears that Beijing is imposing its authority and eroding the high degree of autonomy the former British colony has enjoyed under the ‘One Country Two Systems’ formula since it returned to Chinese rule in 1997.China says the legislation is aimed at tackling secession, subversion, terrorism and foreign interference in the city but the plan, unveiled in Beijing last week, has triggered the first big protests in Hong Kong for months.

I hope for his immediate release.”Kenney referred to Lee in that tweet, and in another tweet from 2015, as his “longtime friend” and posted a photo of the two of them smiling together.Shocked to learn that my longtime friend Martin Lee, founder of the Hong Kong Democratic Party, was arrested today together with many of #HongKong’s most prominent citizens.

      "CONTENT : It has long been the focus of swirling coronavirus speculation, but now Chinese health authorities have said that the wet market in Wuhan, central China, was not the source of the first COVID-19 outbreak.Animals from the market were tested by officials at the Chinese Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, the Daily Mail reports, and found not to contain the novel coronavirus. Instead, officials say that rather than the outbreak’s Ground Zero, the Wuhan market was likely the source of a “superspreader” event during the virus’ early stages.China had earlier offered that the market was the virus’ presumed epicentre; it was where 41 of the initial cases were discovered before it was shuttered on Jan. 1. Competing with the wet market theory, U.S. officials have suggested, without providing evidence, that the virus first escaped from the Wuhan Institute of Virology, a laboratory not far from the market itself at which coronaviruses are studied.\n",

They said Team Canada would not participate if the event went ahead this year.But Wei Jizhong, the former general secretary of the Chinese Olympic Committee and a vice president of the Olympic Council of Asia, believes China will not publicly withdraw and will instead stick to the line presented by the International Olympic Committee (IOC).“The Chinese Olympic Committee will follow the IOC,” Wei told the South China Morning Post in Hong Kong.

An announcement could come as early as Friday, the sources said, requesting anonymity because the matter is confidential.ByteDance and the U.S. Treasury Department, which chairs the government panel that has been reviewing ByteDance’s ownership of TikTok, declined to comment.Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said on Wednesday that TikTok was under a national security review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States and that he would be making a recommendation to President Donald Trump this week.\n",

      "CONTENT : EDMONTON — The Chinese consulate general in Calgary has publicly criticized Alberta Premier Jason Kenney for “interfering in China’s internal affairs” after the premier  tweeted his support for a friend, a Chinese democracy activist, arrested on the weekend in Beijing’s escalating crackdown on democracy-protest organizers in Hong Kong.On Saturday, after learning of the apprehension of Martin Lee, the 81-year-old founder of Hong Kong’s Democratic party, along with several other activists, Kenney tweeted that he was “shocked to learn” of the arrest. “Martin is the elder statesman of Hong Kong democracy. I hope for his immediate release.”Kenney referred to Lee in that tweet, and in another tweet from 2015, as his “longtime friend” and posted a photo of the two of them smiling together.Shocked to learn that my longtime friend Martin Lee, founder of the Hong Kong Democratic Party, was arrested today together with many of #HongKong’s most prominent citizens. Martin is the elder statesman of Hong Kong democracy. I hope for his immediate release. pic.twitter.com/zU1orKhUSt\n",

      "CONTENT : It has long been the focus of swirling coronavirus speculation, but now Chinese health authorities have said that the wet market in Wuhan, central China, was not the source of the first COVID-19 outbreak.Animals from the market were tested by officials at the Chinese Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, the Daily Mail reports, and found not to contain the novel coronavirus. Instead, officials say that rather than the outbreak’s Ground Zero, the Wuhan market was likely the source of a “superspreader” event during the virus’ early stages.China had earlier offered that the market was the virus’ presumed epicentre; it was where 41 of the initial cases were discovered before it was shuttered on Jan. 1. Competing with the wet market theory, U.S. officials have suggested, without providing evidence, that the virus first escaped from the Wuhan Institute of Virology, a laboratory not far from the market itself at which coronaviruses are studied.\n",

The Trump administration has sought to highlight the heavy debts and economic deterioration those ties have left for close Chinese trade partners like Venezuela and Ecuador.\n",

The delivery was the first in Latin America.Maduro in September proposed administering the Russian coronavirus vaccine to nearly 15,000 candidates in upcoming legislative elections so that they could campaign safely.Venezuela has strengthened diplomatic ties with Russia amid an aggressive sanctions program by the United States meant to force Maduro from office.In August, Russia licensed a vaccine for COVID-19 after less than two months of human testing, an achievement celebrated by Moscow but questioned by several experts.But Russia is so confident in its COVID-19 vaccine that it will shoulder some of the legal liability should anything go wrong, rather than requiring buyers to take on the full risk, the head of the state fund bankrolling the project told Reuters.In Venezuela there are more than 87,000 coronavirus cases and about 747 deaths, according to official data. But medical associations say the number of infections is likely higher. (Reporting by Deisy Buitrago and Sarah Kinosian; Editing by Cynthia Osterman)\n",

Reuters could not independently verify the authenticity of the list.Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian, asked about the group’s report at a daily briefing in Beijing, said it was not worth refuting.

      "CONTENT : The upcoming 5G is the next-generation wireless internet technology that will be used around the world for faster and better communication.Huawei is not the only provider — other companies provide it, too. The problem for the Americans is that they don’t trust Huawei — it was created with Chinese Government funding, and under Chinese law must do the government’s bidding, which means it could be forced to supply information to the government.And if sovereign governments use Huawei, then the argument goes that government secrets will be more vulnerable.In particular, the American government reportedly is saying that it will not share intelligence secrets with Canada, perhaps its closest ally, if we let Huawei in the door, because it maintains that those secrets would become known to the Chinese government.That stands to reason.\n",

Reuters could not independently verify the authenticity of the list.Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian, asked about the group’s report at a daily briefing in Beijing, said it was not worth refuting.

      "CONTENT : A museum in France has delayed its Genghis Khan exhibition after an attempt by the Chinese Government to censor certain words and materials surrounding the showcase.The exhibition was a planned collaboration between the Château des ducs de Bretagne and the Inner Mongolia Museum, a regional museum in Hohhot, China. The Inner Mongolia Museum is focused on the traditions and the history of the Mongolian people, including the life of the 13th century emperor Genghis Khan.But the history museum, Château des ducs de Bretagne in Nantes, pushed back when Chinese authorities called for certain words, including “Genghis Khan,” “empire” and “Mongol,” to be removed from the exhibition, Agence France-Presse reports. Chinese authorities later asked for control over exhibition brochures, legends and maps, the museum said.“We decided to stop this production in the name of the human, scientific and ethical values that we defend,” museum director Bertrand Guillet said in a statement.The museum called the modifications proposed by the Chinese Bureau of Cultural Heritage a censorship of the initial project, and an attempt at a “biased rewriting aimed at completely eradicating Mongolian history and culture for the benefit of a new national story.”Ethnic Mongolians across Inner Mongolia, a province of northern China, have seen repeated attempts from Beijing to suppress their language and culture. In September, a plan to institute Mandarin-only lessons sparked protests across the province.\n",

The government has stressed that it is a purely peaceful initiative.In 2003, China became the third country to put a man in space with its own rocket after the former Soviet Union and the United States.

It also banned vehicles from the streets for the duration of testing, unless delivering essential items.Chinese embassy officials in Myanmar have held talks via teleconference with the country’s authorities to beef up joint efforts for disease control and prevention, the embassy said on its website.Chinese officials have said areas on the Myanmar border should put the fight against the disease on a wartime footing.(Interactive graphic tracking global spread of coronavirus: open https://tmsnrt.rs/3aIRuz7 in an external browser.)(Reporting by Liangping Gao and Ryan Woo; Editing by Clarence Fernandez)\n",

      "CONTENT : HONG KONG — Hong Kong has arranged four charter flights to bring back 533 of its residents from the Chinese province of Hubei, the center of the coronavirus outbreak, about a month after countries around the world began evacuating their citizens.Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam said the flights would return on Wednesday and Thursday and those coming back would be quarantined for 14 days upon arrival.Various countries including the United States, France, Germany and South Korea began evacuating hundreds of their citizens in late January or early February.More than 3,800 Hong Kong residents in more than 30 cities in Hubei, of which Wuhan is capital, had asked the government of the Chinese-ruled, semi-autonomous city for help, creating a logistics headache for the government.“We do not feel that we have delayed the return of Hong Kong people stranded in Hubei,” Lam told reporters at her weekly news conference.\n",

      "CONTENT : MUMBAI — Fantasy gaming company Dream11 will be the main sponsor of the Indian Premier League for its 2020 edition, paying the league 50% less for the privilege than its previous backer, Chinese smartphone maker Vivo, league chairman Brijesh Patel said on Tuesday.Vivo had secured the IPL sponsorship rights for 2018-2022 for nearly 22 billion rupees ($293 million) but pulled out of this year’s tournament amid a backlash against Chinese firms in India following a clash on the two countries’ border in June in which 20 Indian soldiers were killed.Patel told Reuters that Dream11 had submitted a winning bid of 2.22 billion rupees ($29 million), compared with the 4.4 billion Vivo had been paying annually to the Indian cricket board, which owns the popular Twenty20 tournament.“There were three bids in all,” Patel, the chairman of the IPL governing council, said by phone.The franchise-based Twenty20 league will be played in the United Arab Emirates from Sept. 19 after India decided it could not host it this year due to the novel coronavirus pandemic.Finding a new lead sponsor for the IPL in just a few weeks had been seen as a test of cricket’s status for brands in India.The much lower amount agreed on reflects the impact of the pandemic on both the economy and sport, which has been massively disrupted all around the world.

China Unicom Americas has a nearly two-decade old authorization to provide international telecommunications services to and from the United States.The FCC asked the executive branch agencies “whether and how (China Unicom Americas) is subject to the exploitation, influence, and control of the Chinese government, and the national security and law enforcement risks associated.” It also asked “whether mitigation measures could address any identified concerns.”The FCC letter asked the executive branch agencies to respond by Nov. 16.In April, the Justice Department and other federal agencies urged the FCC to revoke China Telecom’s authorization.The three Chinese companies’ U.S. units have urged the FCC not to revoke the authorizations.\n",

Overall, 1,300 Kazakhs remain in China, Nuryshev said, half of them tourists visiting resorts in Hainan.Out of those who have already returned from China, four people have been hospitalized with suspected respiratory infections and are being tested, healthcare minister Yelzhan Birtanov told the same briefing.

      "CONTENT : GUWAHATI — The Indian Army has asked its Chinese counterpart if five civilians who went missing from an eastern border state days ago were in their custody, an Indian military spokesman said on Monday.Relations between the nuclear-armed Asian giants have hit a multi-decade low since clashes at their western Himalayan border in June that killed 20 Indian soldiers.Both sides have since stepped up monitoring of their largely unsettled 3,488 km (2,167 miles) border.The five missing men are from the Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh, which is also claimed by China that calls it South Tibet, and the Indian Army said it told China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) about the five on Saturday.“We spoke with them on the hotline and told them that it’s suspected that some people have crossed across to your side and we will be grateful if you could hand them over back, as per what we do normally,” Lieutenant Colonel Harsh Wardhan Pande, a spokesman for India’s defense forces, told Reuters.“There is no earmarked line going through the forest or the mountains, so they keep moving here and there. So they might have gone there. It’s a very normal thing.”He said they were yet to hear back from the Chinese.A Chinese foreign ministry spokesman said at a daily briefing that he was not aware of the situation.Separately, a Tibetan member of an Indian special forces unit who died days ago in a mine blast near the site of a border flare-up with Chinese troops in the western Himalayas was cremated on Monday. His death gave a rare glimpse into a little-known group of elite, high-altitude warriors drawn mainly from Tibetan refugees in India. (Reporting by Krishna N.

She said Douyin aimed to help them double that income over the next year.Douyin’s surge comes as TikTok faces a possible ban in the United States by the Trump administration, which wants ByteDance to sell TikTok’s U.S. operations.U.S.-listed Oracle Corp said on Monday it would team up with ByteDance, which could help keep TikTok operating in the United States.Like TikTok, Douyin allows users to watch short videos and livestreams and make in-app purchases.It is currently one of the most popular social media apps in China and its growth is seen as indicative of TikTok’s potential evolution.\n",

      "CONTENT : BEIJING/SHANGHAI — China accused the United States on Monday of whipping up panic over a fast-spreading coronavirus with travel restrictions and evacuations as Chinese stocks plunged on the first day back from the extended Lunar New Year holiday.The death toll in China from the newly identified virus, which emerged in Wuhan, capital of the central province of Hubei, rose to 361 as of Sunday, up 57 from the previous day, the National Health Commission said.The World Health Organization (WHO) last week declared the flu-like virus a global emergency and it has since spread to 23 other countries and regions, with the first death outside of China reported on Sunday, that of a 44-year-old Chinese man who died in the Philippines after traveling from Wuhan.Wuhan and some other cities remain in virtual lockdown with travel severely restricted, and China is facing increasing international isolation.\n",

      "CONTENT : China warned on Thursday that a “forced decoupling” of its economy with India, following a Himalayan border clash last month that killed 20 Indian soldiers, would hurt both countries.The Chinese ambassador said China was not a strategic threat to India and that the “general structure that we can’t live without each other remains unchanged.”The statement came after New Delhi’s recent moves to ban or sideline Chinese business interests in one of the world’s biggest markets, even as the border remains tense with many more troops on the ground than usual.“China advocates win-win cooperation and opposes a zero-sum game,” Ambassador Sun Weidong wrote on Twitter. “Our economies are highly complementary, interwoven and interdependent. Forced decoupling is against the trend and will only lead to a ‘lose-lose’ outcome.”Officials of the nuclear-armed neighbors have been talking regularly to de-escalate the border standoff after the June 15 clash in the Galwan Valley of India’s Ladakh region when the Indian officials said soldiers were beaten to death with rocks and clubs.Indian officials say Chinese troops have intruded on to its side in the remote western region and have only partially withdrawn despite the talks. China says it has not breached the disputed border and has asked India to restrain its frontline troops.Analysts say the worst fighting between the giant countries in decades is likely to push India closer to the United States, both strategically and in trade.China and India fought a brief border war in 1962 and China is a close ally of India’s long-time foe, Pakistan.

That statement undercut conspiracy theories promoted by anti-China activists and some supporters of President Donald Trump who suggest it was developed in a Chinese government biological weapons laboratory.“The best experts so far seem to think it was man-made. I have no reason to disbelieve that at this point,” Pompeo said. When the interviewer pointed out that was not the conclusion of U.S. intelligence agencies, Pompeo backtracked, saying, “I’ve seen what the intelligence community has said.

      "CONTENT : HONG KONG — Chinese authorities have arrested at least 10 people after intercepting a boat off the coast of the southern province of Guangdong, the provincial Coast Guard Bureau said in a post on its social media site.Hong Kong media, citing unidentified sources, said 12 people from the former British colony were arrested while sailing to Taiwan where they planned to apply for political asylum.It was not clear what law they would be charged with violating but, if confirmed, it would be a rare instance of Chinese authorities arresting people from Hong Kong trying to leave the city.The Guangdong Coast Guard said on its social media platform late on Wednesday the people on the boat were arrested on Aug. 23.Two of the detained were surnamed Li and Tang, it said. It did not provide further details and could not be reached for comment.Hong Kong media identified one of those on the vessel as Andy Li, who media said was recently arrested under a sweeping national security law imposed by Beijing on its freest city on June 30.Chris Tang, the Chinese-ruled city’s police chief, said at a press conference he had not received any information from mainland authorities regarding the arrests.In Taipei, the China-policy making Mainland Affairs Council did not confirm the media report, but said those who come to Taiwan via illegal means will face criminal charges, and reiterated the government’s pledges to give “humanitarian assistance” to Hong Kong protesters.The new security legislation, opposed by many in Hong Kong, punishes what Beijing broadly defines as subversion, secession, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces with up to life in prison.The Hong Kong government, police and security bureau did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

      "CONTENT : A British diplomat leapt into a river in southwest China to rescue a drowning student over the weekend, Britain’s embassy in Beijing and Chinese state media said.Stephen Ellison, the 61-year-old British consul-general in Chongqing, jumped into the water at a scenic spot in the municipality on Saturday after spotting the struggling female student, who had fallen in by accident, China’s official Xinhua news agency reported.A video https://twitter.com/ukinchina/status/1328309479595798530 of the incident posted on the British embassy’s Twitter account shows a woman drifting face-down in the water as onlookers scream in panic, before the diplomat takes off his shoes, plunges in and swims to her aid.A lifebelt is then tossed into the river, enabling people on the bank to drag Ellison and the student to safety.“Thanks to the rescue, the student soon resumed breathing and regained consciousness,” Xinhua said, citing the local authorities, without naming the woman.The British embassy said everyone is “immensely proud” of Ellison.Sino-British ties have been strained in recent months over China’s decision to impose a new national security law to quell pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong, which London handed back to Beijing in 1997 after 156 years of British rule.Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian praised Ellison’s “heroic behavior.”“I want to give him a big thumbs up,” he said during a daily media briefing on Tuesday in Beijing.China on Nov. 5 barred non-Chinese travelers from countries including Britain from entering amid surging coronavirus cases.

      "CONTENT : WASHINGTON — The U.S. Treasury Department on Tuesday imposed sanctions on a Chinese national whom it accused of trafficking fentanyl to the United States.Taotao Zhang, a chemist and chemical supplier, had shipped illicit synthetic opioids to the United States, Treasury said in a statement. The Treasury also blacklisted Hong Kong-based Allyrise Technology Group Co, Limited, of which Zhang is director, accusing it of being a front-company for his financial transactions.Fentanyl is a cheap opioid painkiller 50 times more potent than heroin that has played a major role in an opioid crisis in the United States, where more than 28,000 synthetic opioid-related overdose deaths were recorded in 2017.U.S. officials say China is the main source of illicit fentanyl. President Donald Trump has accused Chinese President Xi Jinping of failing to meet promises to help stop the flow of the drug into the United States, a charge Beijing rejects.“The United States remains committed to protecting vulnerable Americans by targeting individuals peddling this deadly drug,” Treasury Deputy Secretary Justin Muzinich said.Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in a separate statement called on Beijing to accelerate efforts to “regulate its chemical industry and reduce the diversion of precursors into the international black market.”“The United States continues to seek cooperation with the PRC to tackle this supply chain threat,” Pompeo said.Tuesday’s action freezes any U.S. assets of Zhang and the Hong Kong-based company and generally bars Americans from dealing with them.The Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control said it coordinated the move with the U.S. attorney’s office for New Jersey and the Drug Enforcement Administration.(Reporting by Daphne Psaledakis; editing by Grant McCool and Leslie Adler)\n",

      "CONTENT : HONG KONG — Chinese authorities have arrested at least 10 people after intercepting a boat off the coast of the southern province of Guangdong, the provincial Coast Guard Bureau said in a post on its social media site.Hong Kong media, citing unidentified sources, said 12 people from the former British colony were arrested while sailing to Taiwan where they planned to apply for political asylum.It was not clear what law they would be charged with violating but, if confirmed, it would be a rare instance of Chinese authorities arresting people from Hong Kong trying to leave the city.The Guangdong Coast Guard said on its social media platform late on Wednesday the people on the boat were arrested on Aug. 23.Two of the detained were surnamed Li and Tang, it said. It did not provide further details and could not be reached for comment.Hong Kong media identified one of those on the vessel as Andy Li, who media said was recently arrested under a sweeping national security law imposed by Beijing on its freest city on June 30.The security legislation, opposed by many in Hong Kong, punishes what Beijing broadly defines as subversion, secession, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces with up to life in prison.The Hong Kong government, police and security bureau did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Taiwan has proved a popular destination for Hong Kong people aiming to leave their city as Beijing tightens its grip, with the self-ruled island’s President Tsai Ing-wen pledging to help those who arrive.

      "CONTENT : BEIJING — China will encourage the people of Taiwan to join it in opposing the island’s independence and promoting China’s “reunification,” Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said on Friday, a move likely to worsen Beijing’s poor relations with Taipei.China describes Taiwan as its most sensitive and important territorial issue, and has never renounced the use of force to bring what it views as a wayward Chinese province under its control.Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen, speaking in Taipei on Wednesday at the inauguration for her second term in office, said Taiwan cannot accept becoming part of China under its “one country, two systems” offer of autonomy, strongly rejecting China’s sovereignty claims.Li, in his work report at the start of the annual meeting of China’s parliament, said his country would “resolutely oppose and deter any separatist activities seeking Taiwan independence.”\n",

She says Taiwan is an independent country called the Republic of China, its official name.In a statement, Taiwan’s Defence Ministry said Chinese J-11 fighters and H-6 bombers flew into the Bashi Channel to the south of Taiwan, then out into the Pacific before heading back to base via the Miyako Strait, located between Japan’s islands of Miyako and Okinawa, to the northeast of Taiwan.“During this period, the national military appropriately used air reconnaissance aircraft and air defense forces in accordance with combat readiness regulations,” it said.\n",

They declined to identify themselves to Reuters.Among protesters was a group of supporters of the Falun Gong spiritual group, which is banned in China. Tao Peng, 48, stood silently holding banners calling for an end to communism.\n",

      "CONTENT : As China in March became the first major country to recover from the coronavirus outbreak that spread from the central city of Wuhan, its officials kicked off another campaign: to heal its tattered international image.President Xi Jinping held a flurry of phone calls with world leaders to promise aid. More than 170 Chinese medical experts were dispatched to Europe, Southeast Asia and Africa. State media outlets flooded the Internet with photos of Chinese masks arriving in 100 countries and stories questioning the epidemic’s origins. Ambassadors flooded international newspapers with op-eds hailing the sacrifices Beijing made to buy time for other countries without acknowledging how the outbreak erupted in the first place.One month later, that campaign has yielded mixed results. In many cases, it has outright backfired.In Britain, a parliamentary committee on foreign relations urged the government to fight a surge in Chinese disinformation. Officials in Germany and at least one state – Wisconsin – exposed quiet outreach attempts from Chinese officials hoping to persuade them to publicly praise China.\n",

      "CONTENT : BEIJING — Chinese military drills off Taiwan’s southwest coast last week were a “necessary action” to protect China’s sovereignty, Beijing said on Wednesday, after Taiwan complained the large-scale air and naval exercises were a serious provocation.China, which claims democratic Taiwan as its own, has stepped up military activities near the island, in what Taiwan views as intimidation to force it to accept Chinese rule.Taiwan’s denounced the two days of exercises last week, which it said took place in Taiwan’s air defense identification zone, between mainland Taiwan and the Taiwan-controlled Pratas Islands. Taiwan says China sent advanced Su-30 and J-10 fighters to participate.Offering China’s first public explanation for the exercises, Ma Xiaoguang, spokesman for China’s Taiwan Affairs Office, said Taiwan was a “sacred” and inseparable part of China.“The relevant combat training activities by the People’s Liberation Army were a necessary action aimed at the current security situation in the Taiwan Strait and to safeguard national sovereignty,” Ma told a news conference.In an apparent reference to the United States, Taiwan’s main arms supplier and strongest international supporter, Ma said the drills were also aimed at “the interference of foreign forces” and Taiwan independence activities, not Taiwan’s people.\n",

      "CONTENT : MOSCOW — Russia said on Monday it had stepped up patrols to stop people hunting marmots near its border with China and Mongolia after the countries reported possible cases of bubonic plague, which can be carried by the animals.Authorities in Bayan Nur, a city in the Chinese region of Inner Mongolia, issued a warning on Sunday after a hospital reported a suspected case of the deadly disease.The Chinese region forbade the hunting and eating of the large rodents and asked the public to report any suspected cases, as well as any sick or dead marmots.Neighboring Mongolia also reported two cases of bubonic plague linked to people eating marmot meat in its western Khovd province last week.Authorities in Russia’s Altai region, which borders Kazakhstan, China and Mongolia, said officials were patrolling the area to enforce a ban on hunting marmots and to warn people about the dangers, TASS news agency reported.The local branch of Rospotrebnadzor, the consumer health watchdog, said the cases across the border did not pose a threat to people in Altai, TASS reported.The bubonic plague, known as the “Black Death” in the Middle Ages, is a highly infectious and often fatal disease that is spread mostly by rodents. Bubonic plague outbreaks have become increasingly rare.(Reporting by Gabrielle Tétrault-Farber; Editing by Tom Balmforth and Andrew Heavens)\n",

With Chinese experts concluding that the virus cannot be eradicated, government officials are focused on keeping infections to a manageable level to avoid catastrophic surges that overwhelm hospitals.This balancing act between letting people return to normal life while keeping infections at a low level is one that governments around the world, including the hardest-hit nations like Italy and the U.S., will have to try to master. Even with tools that others don’t have — powerful state surveillance and control of people’s movements — China doesn’t have a full picture, nor any guarantee of success.\n",

One of the things we’re looking forward to coming up (this weekend) is getting the people we love together to eat a lot, and having dumplings of all kinds,” Margaret (Mei) Li says, laughing. “We had lots of dumpling parties growing up and when you walk up to someone with a big plate of dumplings, there’s just universal joy.

Beijing has not renounced the use of force to bring the democratic island under its control.“Looking on the long-term trend, China appears to be gradually stepping up its military preparedness, especially in air or on the waters near Taiwan,” Wu told reporters.“What China is doing now is continuing to ramp up preparedness to solve the Taiwan issue,” he said.“The threat is on the rise.”Beijing routinely says such exercises are nothing unusual and are designed to show the country’s determination to defend its sovereignty.Taiwan’s defense ministry in June reported eight incidents of intrusion of Chinese military planes in its air defense identification zone, in which Taiwan jets gave radio warnings to usher the intruders out of the airspace.Wu said such intrusions “happened almost every day” in June and were “much more frequent” than what the government had disclosed to the public. He said China has also made several “simulated” military attacks on Taiwan.\n",

Beijing denied the allegations.The FBI recently has interviewed visa holders suspected of having undeclared Chinese military affiliations in more than 25 American cities, the Justice Department said.“These members of China’s Peoples Liberation Army applied for research visas while hiding their true affiliation with the PLA,” the statement quoted Assistant Attorney General John Demers as saying. “This is another part of the Chinese Communist Party’s plan to take advantage of our open society and exploit academic institutions.”\n",

      "CONTENT : GUANGZHOU — Coronavirus infections in China may be over by April, its senior medical adviser said on Tuesday, but the death toll passed 1,000 and the World Health Organization warned of a “very grave” global threat.As the epidemic squeezed the world’s second-biggest economy, Chinese firms struggled to get back to work after the extended Lunar New Year holiday, hundreds of them saying they would need loans running into billions of dollars to stay afloat.Company layoffs were beginning despite assurances by President Xi Jinping that widespread sackings would be avoided, as supply chains for global firms from car makers to smartphone makers ruptured.China’s foremost medical adviser on the outbreak, Zhong Nanshan, said numbers of new cases were falling in some places and held out hope the epidemic may peak this month.“I hope this outbreak or this event may be over in something like April,” added Zhong, 83, an epidemiologist who won fame for his role in combating an outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome in 2003, in an interview with Reuters.\n",

      "CONTENT : BEIJING/SHANGHAI — China’s radiant male skincare market has a fresh shine: A raft of domestic startups is tapping global investors for funds, with ambitions to rival giants like L’Oreal in a billion-dollar business serving image-conscious millennial men like Hou Junru.The 24-year-old Shanghai education worker got into skincare as a student and splurged more than $1,000 on creams and lotions in e-commerce firm Alibaba’s giant Nov. 11 Singles Day promotion. “My need is to keep the skin moist and look pale,” said Hou.It’s a priority shared by many of his peers, influenced by the spread of social media and South Korean pop culture that embraces a softer version of masculinity. Already the biggest in the world, the Chinese men’s facial skincare market is forecast to hit 12.5 billion yuan ($1.90 billion) this year – and expand 50% to 18.5 billion yuan in 2025, research firm Mintel estimates.Market research provider Euromonitor International estimates the men’s skincare business in China, excluding post-shave products, was last year already more than three times the size of the U.S. market in dollar terms and more than twice the size of South Korea – with value growth through 2024 seen easily outstripping both.\n",

      "CONTENT : WASHINGTON — U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is planning to travel to Hawaii to meet with Chinese government officials, Politico reported on Friday, citing two unnamed sources.Pompeo, who has been vocal in criticizing China on a range of issues from the origins of the coronavirus pandemic to its Hong Kong policy to the treatment of its ethnic and religious minorities, was planning the trip “quietly” and the arrangements were not finalized, Politico said.The U.S. State Department and the Chinese embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Relations between the world’s two biggest economies have deteriorated in recent months, and U.S. President Donald Trump has said he could even sever relations.Pompeo said last month that China could have prevented the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people around the world by being more transparent about the coronavirus and accused it of refusing to share information.He said last month Chinese plans to impose national security laws on Hong Kong would be the “death knell” for the former British colony’s autonomy.
