      "CONTENT : Chinese authorities have been trying for three years to reverse the devastating imbalances of their one-child policy and coax couples to have more children.They’ve told couples that it’s their patriotic duty to have two babies. They’ve dangled tax breaks and housing subsidies. They’ve offered to make education cheaper and parental leave longer. They’ve tried to make it more difficult to get an abortion or a divorce.None of this has worked. China’s birthrate remains stubbornly low, creating a demographic crisis that could hinder economic growth for decades to come.But now, an economics professor at Fudan University in Shanghai has come up with another — and, unsurprisingly, controversial — solution: allow women to have multiple husbands, and they’ll have multiple babies.\n",

      "CONTENT : NEW DELHI — India is considering a plan to build a 10 gigawatts (GW) hydropower project in a remote eastern state, an Indian official said on Tuesday, following reports that China could construct dams on a section of the Brahmaputra river.The river, also known as the Yarlung Tsangbo in China, flows from Tibet into India’s Arunachal Pradesh state and down through Assam to Bangladesh. Indian authorities are concerned Chinese projects could trigger flash floods or create water scarcity.“The need of the hour is to have a big dam in Arunachal Pradesh to mitigate the adverse impact of the Chinese dam projects,” T.S. Mehra, a senior official in India’s federal water ministry, told Reuters.“Our proposal is under consideration at the highest level in the government,” Mehra said, adding the Indian plan would create a large water storage capacity to offset the impact of Chinese dams on flows.Diplomatic relations between India and China are at a nadir, with troops locked in a border face-off in the western Himalayas for months.Some analysts warned that damming the Brahmaputra could potentially develop into another flashpoint, as Beijing’s dam building activities moved closer to the Indian border.\n",

      "CONTENT : Tomorrow, Canada marks a grim milestone. For two years, Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor will have been held hostage in China simply for being Canadian.While Canadians are rightfully concerned about the fate of our two wrongfully imprisoned citizens, China’s hostage diplomacy has awoken the Canadian public to a far larger reality. A realignment in geopolitics has taken place over the last 40 years, and Canada has been late to heed its warnings.For 40 years the great opening of China’s free market has not gone as we had hoped. And for the past 30 years, since tanks rolled into Tiananmen Square, the Western world has chosen to hope that things would get better.To this day, every business, public or private, remains subject to the strategic objectives of the Chinese state. This may not have been a big deal when China produced mainly low-tech goods like shoes and toothbrushes, but it has dramatic implications today as Chinese tech firms export facial recognition technology and surveillance drones. All Chinese firms are required by law to collaborate with Chinese intelligence agencies. Yes, that includes mining TikTok videos and feel-good apps for data. And it certainly concerns Huawei building our digital future.\n",

Everything should be under consideration to defend Canada and Canadians – including a boycott of the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics,” he said in an email.Chong pointed out that it is an option where this country has some leverage. “Canada is a winter sports powerhouse.

      "CONTENT : WASHINGTON — The United States on Wednesday slapped sanctions on Wan Kuok Kai, the leader of China’s 14K Triad organized crime group and a member of the Chinese Communist Party’s Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference, the U.S. Treasury said.The sanctions also apply to three entities headed by Wan, who is also known as “Broken Tooth,” the Treasury Department said in a statement.The U.S. government also designated two other individuals from Liberia and the Kyrgyz Republic to face sanctions.Treasury said it targeted Wan for his activities at the helm of the 14K Triad, saying the Chinese organized crime group was engaged in drug trafficking, illegal gambling, racketeering, human trafficking, and a range of other criminal activities.Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFCA) also designated three entities owned or controlled by Wan – the World Hongmen History and Culture Association, based in Cambodia; Dongmei Group, based in Hong Kong; and the Palau China Hung-Mun Cultural Association, based in Palau.It said the World Hongmen group had managed to co-opt elite figures in Malaysia and Cambodia, continuing a “pattern of overseas Chinese actors trying to paper over illegal criminal activities by framing their actions in terms of China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI)” and other major initiatives of the CCP.Treasury also designated Raimbek Matraimov, a former deputy of the Kyrgyz Customs Service, who it said had been involved in a customs scheme in which at least $700 million was laundered from the Kyrgyz Republic.In Africa, it designated Harry Varney Gboto-Nambi Sherman, now a prominent lawyer, Liberian senator and head of the Liberian Senate Judiciary Committee, who was indicted but later acquitted for his role in a bribery scheme in Liberia.

He is also a vice chairman of the National People’s Congress standing committee, the permanent body of the country’s rubber stamp parliament, which imposed a national security law for Hong Kong in June.AmCham, which represents major U.S. businesses in China, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday.China’s foreign ministry and the U.S. embassy in Beijing also did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n",

Its foreign ministry said on its website on Tuesday that Chinese vice foreign minister Zheng Zeguang had summoned the acting representative in the U.S. embassy to express “solemn protest and strong condemnation.”Zheng also threatened “reciprocal” retaliation from China.“U.S. barbaric actions will only invoke the intense anger of the Chinese people against anti-China forces in the United States and cause 1.4 billion Chinese people, including our compatriots in Hong Kong, to full recognize the U.S. devious intentions and strengthen the resolve of the Chinese government in implementing the Hong Kong National Security Law,” he said.Earlier on Tuesday, China’s Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office and Chinese foreign ministry’s office of the commissioner to Hong Kong issued separate condemnations of the U.S. sanctions.

      "CONTENT : WASHINGTON — U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Wednesday accused China of taking “incredibly aggressive action” in a recent clash with India over a disputed section of the nuclear-armed neighbors’ border, saying the incident could not be assessed in isolation.On the night of June 15, Chinese forces and Indian troops fought for hours with rods and clubs, resulting in a dramatic escalation that left 20 Indian soldiers killed, with some falling to their deaths in the freezing waters of the Galwan river in the western Himalayas.On Monday, Indian government sources said China began pulling back troops from along the border with India, after weeks of talks between senior military officials on how to ease tensions. China has yet to confirm whether it suffered casualties but the Indian deaths were the highest along the border in more than five decades.“The Chinese took incredibly aggressive action and the Indians have done their best to respond to that,” Pompeo said in a news conference at the State Department. “I put this in the context of General Secretary Xi Jinping and his behavior throughout the region, throughout the world,” he said.\n",

While such missions happen regularly, for China to talk about them publicly is unusual.China’s Defence Ministry said the U-2 flew without permission over a no-fly zone in the northern military region where live fire drills were taking place, “seriously interfering in normal exercise activities.”This could easily have caused a misunderstanding or misjudgement or an “unexpected incident,” the ministry added.“It was an act of naked provocation, and China is resolutely opposed to it, and have already lodged stern representations with the U.S. side.”In a statement, the U.S. military said a U-2 flight was conducted in the Indo-Pacific region and it was “within the accepted international rules and regulations governing aircraft flights.”“Pacific Air Forces personnel will continue to fly and operate anywhere international law allows, at the time and tempo of our choosing,” the U.S. military said in the statement.\n",

While such missions happen regularly, for China to talk about them publicly is unusual.China’s Defence Ministry said the U-2 flew without permission over a no-fly zone in the northern military region where live fire drills were taking place, “seriously interfering in normal exercise activities.”This could easily have caused a misunderstanding or misjudgement or an “unexpected incident,” the ministry added.“It was an act of naked provocation, and China is resolutely opposed to it, and have already lodged stern representations with the U.S. side.”In a statement, the U.S. military said a U-2 flight was conducted in the Indo-Pacific region and it was “within the accepted international rules and regulations governing aircraft flights.”“Pacific Air Forces personnel will continue to fly and operate anywhere international law allows, at the time and tempo of our choosing,” the U.S. military said in the statement.\n",

      "CONTENT : JAKARTA/HANOI — The coronavirus outbreak has stoked a wave of anti-China sentiment around the globe, from shops barring entry to Chinese tourists, online vitriol mocking the country’s exotic meat trade and surprise health checks on foreign workers.The virus, which originated in China, has spread to more than a dozen countries, many of them in Southeast Asia which has sensitive relations with China amid concerns about Beijing’s vast infrastructure spending and political clout in the region and sovereignty disputes in the South China Sea.Authorities and schools in Toronto, Canada, were moved to warn against discrimination towards Chinese Canadians, while in Europe there was anecdotal evidence of Chinese residents facing prejudice in the street, and hostile newspaper headlines.“Orientalist assumptions plus political distrust plus health concerns are a pretty powerful combination,” said Charlotte Setijadi, and anthropologist who teaches at Singapore Management University.\n",

Other exercises are also happening in the Yellow Sea and South China Sea.The ministry added that the U.S. move ran counter to China-U.S. rules on behavior at sea and in the air and international norms.\n",

      "CONTENT : Canada and like-minded Western-style democracies are engaged in a “values war” with China, “whether we like it or not,” according to report released on Monday by an association of U.K. Conservative MPs known as the China Research Group.The report, written by veteran British diplomat Charles Parton, makes clear that the U.K. needs a new structure to deal with China – something that is patently true of Canada too.When François-Philippe Champagne was appointed global affairs minister last year, he was briefed by his department that Beijing has “demonstrated readiness and ability to use aggressive political and economic measures to punish Canada…and to propagate norms of international relations inimical to Canada’s interests.”A review of the existing “comprehensive engagement” policy was set in motion, with the minister promising a new prism through which to view the relationship by the end of this year.\n",

      "CONTENT : BEIJING — The death toll from a mysterious flu-like virus in China climbed to six on Tuesday as new cases surged beyond 300 and authorities fretted about the added risk from millions of Chinese traveling for the Lunar New Year holiday.Round the world, airports tightened screening of travelers from China as officials confirmed the coronavirus strain is contagious between humans.The World Health Organization (WHO) called a meeting for Wednesday to consider declaring a global health emergency.The outbreak, which began in the central city of Wuhan, also sent shivers through financial markets as investors recalled the fallout from China’s Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2002/2003 that it initially covered up.The SARS coronavirus killed nearly 800 people then.“We’ll stay at home during the holiday. I’m scared as I remember SARS very well,” said Zhang Xinyuan, who had been bound from Beijing for the Thai resort of Phuket before she and her husband decided to cancel their air tickets.\n",

      "CONTENT : YANGON — China’s President Xi Jinping will visit Myanmar on Friday to ink massive infrastructure deals and extend influence in a neighbor whose ties with the West were frayed by accusations that it conducted genocidal policies against ethnic Rohingya Muslims.Making his first visit to the Southeast Asian country as leader, and the first of any Chinese president in 19 years, analysts say Xi will bid to revive stalled multi-billion-dollar infrastructure projects central to his flagship Belt and Road Initiative described as a “21st century Silk Road.”He is scheduled to meet state counselor Aung San Suu Kyi and army chief Min Aung Hlaing in the capital Naypyitaw, as well with the heads of minor political parties.The two countries have had a historically sometimes fraught relationship, with many in Myanmar suspicious of the tremendous sway China holds over its smaller neighbor.Relations have warmed since China avoided joining in the international condemnation of Myanmar after a military campaign in 2017 forced more than 730,000 Rohingya to flee across the border to Bangladesh.\n",
