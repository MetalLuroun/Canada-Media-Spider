      "CONTENT : Pope Francis is a living paradox. On some issues, such as women’s choice and the Catholic clergy abuse crisis, he often seems to live in a cloud of detachment. On LGBTQ equality, he advances two paces, then retreats one. But on so much else he is a genuine revolutionary, shaming other world leaders with his radicalism. That’s revealed abundantly in this new book, a discussion between the 83-year-old Jorge Bergoglio and British Catholic journalist Austen Ivereigh.The book is a form of trilogy, concluded with an epilogue, and at heart is an account of what the pontiff envisages for the post-COVID world. The three sections — “A Time to See,” “A Time to Choose” and “A Time to Act” — are drawn directly from the Latin American Catholic approach to societal problems.The virus itself, he argues, presents both a crisis and an opportunity; the latter for us to embrace community and care genuinely about our neighbours. He dismisses the idea that there is some form of conspiracy behind the pandemic, which will provoke some on the right of his church who have led campaigns against lockdowns and mask-wearing. Indeed, Catholic conservatives and traditionalists will not be at all happy with the book, confirming their suspicions that Francis is simply not their man.In anticipating the world with vaccines and restored health, he emphasizes that injustice will remain. He speaks explicitly of the Uighurs in China: “I think often of persecuted peoples: the Rohingya, the poor Uighurs, the Yazidi.” That may seem innocuous, but it’s a public defiance of Chinese government policy and Beijing will not be pleased.Similarly, he condemns the racism that exists in the United States, and praises the demonstrations that followed the killing of George Floyd. He makes a juxtaposition here that is clearly intentional, comparing Black Lives Matter with anti-lockdown protestors who “are victims only in their own imagination: those who claim, for example, that being forced to wear a mask is an unwarranted imposition by the state, yet who forget or do not care about those who cannot rely, for example, on social security or who have lost their jobs.” Of the protests against racism, however, he says that those Catholics who don’t participate set “a bad example, losing the sense of solidarity and fraternity with the rest of their brothers and sisters.”Francis also gives his backing to some sort of universal income, although he’s not clear as to the specifics, and re-emphasizes the sinful nature of economic exploitation and poverty. That’s nothing new from a man obviously formed in Jesuit social teaching, but what is surprising is his statement when asked why he appointed six women to the Vatican’s Council for the Economy. “I chose these particular women because of their qualifications,” he says, “but also because I believe women in general are much better administrators than men,” partly because they have experience in their homes.It’s one of those papal statements that make us cringe just a little. It’s encouraging that women have been given more influence in certain areas of the Vatican, but the reasoning seems somewhat archaic. There was a time when it was thought that Francis might allow married clergy or women to be ordained as deacons, but on both he has disappointed.Anecdotal and personal, the book is an insight into a religious leader yearning for a better, more gospel-drenched world. Whether that world, or even the Catholic Church, will listen is another issue altogether.\n",

      "CONTENT : NEW DELHI - India on Friday rejected a Chinese allegation that it is responsible for high tensions along their disputed border.Indian External Affairs Ministry spokesman Anurag Srivastava said the six-month standoff between the two countries’ armies “has been a result of the actions of the Chinese side, which has sought to effect a unilateral change in the status along the Line of Actual Control in Eastern Ladakh.”Srivastava was responding to a statement by Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying in Beijing on Thursday that “the rights and wrongs of what has happened in the China-India border area are very clear and the responsibility lies squarely with the Indian side.”Hua also said that China is firmly committed to safeguarding its sovereignty. “We hope that India will work with China in the same direction and do more things conducive to solidarity, co-operation and common development,” she said.The standoff between the Asian giants erupted into a fierce brawl in May and worsened into hand-to-hand combat on June 15 with soldiers using clubs, stones and fists, leaving 20 Indian troops dead. China is believed to also have suffered casualties, but has not given any details.The countries have held a series of talks on ending the standoff without any breakthrough.\n",

      "CONTENT : In one scene from the Lifetime TV movie, “A Sugar & Spice Holiday,” a co-worker says to Suzy, an Asian American architect in Los Angeles: “I didn’t know if Christmas was a big deal where you’re from.”Retorts Suzy: “I’m from Maine.“A lot of viewers of a cozy Christmas film might just shrug off the insinuation that Suzy is somehow not American. But for an Asian audience, that brief exchange is a knowing reminder that microaggressions don’t take a holiday. They especially haven’t in the wake of the pandemic, which has triggered anti-Asian racism and terms like “Chinese virus” and “kung flu.”“I think it’s great timing for us for this movie to be coming out now during the pandemic with the perception of the Asian culture and the ‘flu’ and all,” Canadian actor Jacky Lai, who plays Suzy, told The Associated Press. “I really do hope that this (movie) — with our faces — is able to hopefully be welcomed by people into their homes and see us as just your American/Canadian friends.”“A Sugar & Spice Holiday,” premiering Sunday, may be the first feel-good TV Christmas flick to feature a mostly Asian ensemble. It’s one of several projects where cable channels are demonstrating a desire for inclusion this yuletide season. The shift comes a year after the Hallmark Channel dropped an ad that included a same-sex couple. The fallout pointed to an overall diversity problem in the genre with not just the LGBTQ community, but communities of colour. Recent months of racial unrest only added to the conversation within the entertainment industry about representation.Tia Maggini, vice-president of Lifetime Original Movies, says it was a coincidence that screenwriter Eirene Donohue, who is Asian American and had worked with the them before, came to them with the story pitch.“It was exciting to be presented with this particular point of view that has been long overdue for the Christmas movie genre,” Maggini said in a statement. Most important: The movie itself was actually funny and “full of Christmas heart.”Indeed, the rom-com has all the warm, familiar holiday movie tropes. Suzy returns to the small town where she grew up for Christmas, is persuaded to revive her baking skills for a local gingerbread house competition and is assisted by her former high school crush (Tony Giroux).Her father is played by veteran actor Tzi Ma. Despite a year filled with high profile film roles in “The Farewell“ and “Mulan,” Ma didn’t hesitate to join a Lifetime movie.“It was the first time a Chinese American family was featured on a Christmas story,” Ma said in an email. “Lifetime has a tremendous Asian American following. It’s a way to say thank you to them.”In Hollywood, it can often feel like studios only cast Asians in narratives where there’s some kind of hardship or East-meets-West struggle. And with TV holiday movies, they’re almost nonexistent. Meanwhile, there are white actors who have made a baker’s dozen of them. Like any other group, Giroux says, Asians deserve to see themselves in lighthearted fare regularly.“I think it’s so important to have all sorts of stories with any culture — for them to have exposure to the stories of struggle but it’s such a delight to see something lighter, to see aspects of culture that aren’t surrounded with times of difficulty,” Giroux says.Giroux, who is Canadian, is also looking forward to queuing up a movie where his grandparents can see themselves.“I’m really excited for them to see a story that covers part of their story. My grandparents immigrated here from China from in the ‘50s,” Giroux says. “That’s why being part of this project is telling a story that I’m really a part of.”Lai grew up loving romantic comedies. She remembers unexpectedly getting emotional watching “Crazy Rich Asians,” the first major Hollywood studio film with an all-Asian cast in 25 years.“You hear people say there hasn’t been a movie like this in 25 years. You hear those things. But it’s not until I sat in the theatre and watched someone who looked like me on screen who wasn’t a ninja or a nerd but someone just like me. I remember the way it felt,” Lai says. ”I am so excited that there’s another movie like that and hopefully we bring joy and open some minds with this movie and more opportunities.“The movie is lovingly sprinkled with Chinese American nuances on script and screen. These include a photo of Suzy’s deceased grandma flanked by incense sticks and the entire family eating with chopsticks. And it is definitely the only Christmas movie to feature both gingerbread and stinky tofu, a beloved Chinese dish known for its pungent smell.“I love that we were able to kind of include a lot of nice details. ... It’s really a romantic comedy where the characters happen to be Asian American,” says Jennifer Liao, the director. “It’s nice to make an Asian American movie that’s not necessarily completely frontloaded with having to carry the weight of cultural identity issues and things like that.”“Sugar & Spice” is not the only holiday movie expanding the definition of who can lead these kinds of flicks. A handful of networks, including Lifetime and Hallmark, have a Christmas-themed movie on their slate featuring a same-sex pairing. Tony winner Ali Stroker, who uses a wheelchair, stars in Lifetime’s “Christmas Ever After.”Does Liao feel pressure as “the first” even on such an innocuous project to bring in a sizeable audience? “I feel like the pressure is more to deliver something that I and everybody else worked on can be proud of. That was really no. 1,” Liao says.Lai doesn’t see the point of getting caught up in things like ratings.“I think that it is really, really nice to hear when someone says ‘I got to see someone who looks like me on screen.’ That will never get old,“ Lai says. “We get more responses like that — for me, the movie did its purpose.”___Terry Tang reported from Phoenix and is a member of The Associated Press’ Race and Ethnicity team.

This file will be updated throughout the day. Web links to longer stories if available.11:40 a.m.: Prince Edward Island will begin vaccinating frontline health-care workers and long-term care staff against COVID-19 on Wednesday.Chief public health officer Dr. Heather Morrison says the province expects its initial 1,950 doses of the Pfizer vaccine to arrive early next week, and a clinic will be set up at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Charlottetown.Morrison says because of specific handling requirements set out by Pfizer, the immunizations must take place near where the doses are received and stored.She says appointments for the shots must be booked, and those eligible will be contacted by phone over the next few days.The province is reporting no new cases of novel coronavirus for the fourth consecutive day.The Island currently has 12 active cases.11:25 a.m.: The Northwest Territories is reporting five new cases of COVID-19, all in Yellowknife.Chief public health officer Dr. Kami Kandola says four cases are in the same household and are related to travel outside the territory. The other case is related to international travel.Anyone self-isolating since Nov. 30 is asked to get tested after a wastewater surveillance program found undetected COVID-19 in Yellowknife.The N.W.T. has five active cases and 15 recovered cases of COVID-19.11:20 a.m.: Health Canada has not yet approved Moderna’s version of the COVID-19 vaccine, but Canada’s chief public health officer says the federal government is already including it in its distribution plan.Dr. Theresa Tam says that like the Pfizer vaccine approved this week, doses will be distributed across Canada on a per-capita basis.But territories said they would prefer to skip out on the first shipment of Pfizer vaccine, due to how fragile it is and how complicated to deliver to remote communities.So Tam says they will receive a greater proportion of Moderna’s vaccine to make up for that gap and also to avoid having to travel to remote communities more frequently than needed.11:10 a.m.: Quebec is reporting 53 additional deaths linked to COVID-19 as well as 1,713 new infections in its latest figures.The Health Department says six of the deaths occurred in the previous 24 hours, 36 occurred between Dec. 4 and Dec. 9 and the others were at earlier or unknown dates.Hospitalizations rose to 871, an increase of 23, and there were 10 more patients in intensive care, for a total of 123.Premier Francois Legault and Health Minister Christian Dube will hold a news conference this afternoon in Quebec City.11:05 a.m.: Ontario is reporting an additional 151 new cases in public schools across the province Friday morning, bringing the total in the last two weeks to 1,694 and 6,217 overall since school began.In its latest data released Friday morning, the province reported 125 more students were infected for a total of 1,398 in the last two weeks; since school began there have been an overall total of 4,212.The data shows there are 26 more staff members infected for a total of 293 the last two weeks — and an overall total of 915.There are 878 schools with a reported case, which the province notes is 18.19 per cent of the 4,828 public schools in Ontario.Eleven schools in the province are currently closed due to COVID-19, one more than the day before. The data doesn’t indicate where they are.There is a lag between the daily provincial data at 10:30 a.m. and news reports about infections in schools. The provincial data on Friday is current as of 2 p.m. Thursday. It doesn’t indicate where the place of transmission occurred.The Toronto District School Board updates its information on current COVID-19 cases throughout the day on its website. As of 9:30 a.m. on Friday, there were 439 students infected, 90 staff and 645 resolved cases.The Toronto Catholic District School Board also updates its information on its website. As of 10 a.m. Friday, there were 83 schools with at least one active case. There are 127 active student cases and 18 staff, with a total of 490 resolved cases.Epidemiologists have told the Star that the rising numbers in the schools aren’t a surprise, and that the cases will be proportionate to the amount of COVID that is in the community.11 a.m.: In Ontario’s long-term care homes, 604 residents currently have COVID-19 and 29 new deaths have been reported today.The province says 131 of its 626 long-term care homes are experiencing an outbreak.11 a.m.: Nunavut is reporting 16 new cases of COVID-19.All are in the community of Arviat, bringing the total number of active cases there to 56.There are no other active cases in the territory.So far 189 people have recovered.10:50 a.m.: Federal Health Minister Patty Hajdu says the COVID-19 vaccine doses headed to Canada will be divided among provinces and territories on a per-capita basis, meaning according to the number of residents.She says the federal government is setting aside an additional allotment of vaccine doses for First Nations people living on reserve, where health care is a federal responsibility.For other Indigenous people, including Metis, First Nations and Inuit living in urban areas, they will be considered as part of the provincial population and given access to the vaccine in an equitable way.The National Advisory Committee on Immunization recommends that adults in Indigenous communities where infection can have disproportionate consequences should be one of the priority groups.Hajdu says she expects those recommendations be applied at the provincial level too.10:41 a.m.: Locally, there are 469 new COVID-19 cases in Toronto, 386 in Peel, 205 in York Region and 106 in Windsor-Essex County. There are 1,753 more resolved cases.10:40 a.m.: With lockdown looking imminent in York Region, mayors and regional councillors are asking the province for one more week in the Red Zone and a change to provincial restrictions on restaurants and gyms.York Region council heard from the medical officer of health Thursday that the region has “hit the sweet spot” in tackling virus spread with increased enforcement, heightened controls, good case management, contract tracing and outbreak control.But, Dr. Karim Kurji said, “our seven-day metrics don’t look good” and it appears the province is poised to lock things down.10:40 a.m.: Canada’s chief public health officer Dr. Theresa Tam says the forecast for the number of COVID-19 cases next January is lower than it was two weeks ago.She says that is because more stringent measures in Manitoba and British Columbia appear to have been helping control the spread of the novel coronavirus in those provinces.Still, Canada is forecast to reach 12,000 daily new cases of COVID-19 by the beginning of January, which would bring increased rates of hospitalization and deaths following this rise.The Star’s Jacques Gallant has more details.10:25 a.m.: Chief public health officer Dr. Theresa Tam says that ongoing high rates of infections in wider communities leads to more and bigger outbreaks and spread within high-risk settings.That includes hospitals, schools, correctional facilities, shelters and long-term care homes.She says preventing these outbreaks in long-term care facilities requires individuals and public health authorities working together because once COVID-19 get into a home it is harder to stop its spread.10:20 a.m.: Canada’s chief public health officer says there are now more than 73,200 active COVID-19 cases in Canada, up from about 52,000 just three weeks ago.Dr. Theresa Tam says despite more than 440,000 cases since the start of the pandemic in Canada, just over one per cent of Canadians have tested positive for COVID-19 so far.She says that is an important reminder the vast majority of Canadians remain susceptible to infection.10:20 a.m.: New federal forecasts say all large provinces need to strengthen their COVID-19 response “now” to slow the spread of the virus.Updated modelling indicates that Canada remains on a “rapid growth trajectory,” with daily cases expected to cross the 10,000 mark later this month.The data suggests infections continue to climb in many provinces, with rates rising precipitously in Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba.10:15 a.m.: Health Minister Patty Hajdu says the arrival of COVID-19 vaccines will help fight the COVID-19 pandemic but the worrying increase in cases means Canadians need to buckle down to keep from spreading the illness.She says staying in, wearing masks when out and using the federal government’s COVID Alert app are still the best things to do.Especially over Christmas holidays, Hajdu says Canadians need to keep apart to save lives.10:05 a.m.: Ontario is reporting 1,848 new cases Friday, and 45 more deaths which is a second-wave high.The seven-day average is at a new high of 1,872 cases daily, or 90 weekly per 100,000, the Star’s Ed Tubb reports.There are 235 people in ICU, which is also a second-wave high.Labs report a record 63,051 completed tests and 3.2 per cent positivity.10 a.m.: New modelling of the COVID-19 pandemic from the Public Health Agency of Canada says the country is still on a “rapid growth trajectory” as cases of the illness increase.The projections released today anticipate at least 90,000 more diagnoses by Christmas Day, and potentially as many as 135,000.They also forecast between 1,300 and 1,800 more deaths in the next two weeks.The health agency says the curve can be bent downward if Canadians reduce their contacts with others to only the essentials, but if we keep on as we are, the pandemic will continue to get worse in Canada.10 a.m. (updated): A group of religious leaders in Windsor, Ont., say they are pausing in-person services as COVID-19 infections rise in the city.Current restrictions in the region allow religious services to fill 30 per cent of a room’s capacity with physical distancing.But more than a dozen church leaders say in an open letter that they are suspending in-person worship and moving services online in light of the situation.“We love to gather and worship together on Sunday morning, but our faith is so much more than one day a week, and we consider it an honour to lay down our privileges for the sake of our neighbours and larger community,” said the letter, which was posted online Thursday afternoon.Rev. Robert Clifford of All Saints’ Anglican Church and Rev. Rielly McLaren of the Windsor Mennonite Fellowship authored the letter that was co-signed by a larger group of clergy representing local churches.9:35 a.m. (updated): Australia on Friday cancelled a roughly $750 million US plan for a large order of a locally developed coronavirus vaccine after the inoculation produced false positive test results for HIV in some volunteers participating in a trial study.Of the dozens of coronavirus vaccines being tested worldwide, the Australian one was the first to be abandoned. While its developers said the experimental vaccine had appeared to be safe and effective, the false positives risked undermining trust in the effort to vaccinate the public.Prime Minister Scott Morrison on Friday said that his government would compensate for the loss of 51 million doses it had planned to buy from the Australian consortium in part by increasing orders of vaccines made by AstraZeneca and Novavax. The government has said it plans to begin inoculating citizens by March.8:38 a.m.: Greek authorities say bookshops and hairdressers can reopen as of next Monday, while all other retail stores, entertainment venues, restaurants, bars and cafes will remain shut throughout the Christmas period under the country’s second lockdown.Government spokesman Stelios Petsas said Friday that despite five weeks of lockdown measures, coronavirus infections remain high, piling pressure on the country’s health system. Intensive care units are at 83% of their capacity nationwide, with the number increasing to 91% in the hard-hit northern city of Thessaloniki, Greece’s second largest urban centre.Petsas said a curfew currently in place from 9 p.m. to 5 a.m. will be reduced by one hour as of Sunday night, when it will start at 10 p.m. every night until Jan. 7. Authorities have no intention of amending this for New Year’s Eve or Christmas Eve, he said.8:11 a.m.: With COVID-19 forcing more and more restrictions to public facilities it is going to be financially difficult for communities to sustain their public services such as rinks and curling rinks.To help fulfill the platform promise the Government of Saskatchewan announced that the Community Rink Affordability Grant program (CRAG) will officially open on Monday, December 14, 2020, to provide funding for community-owned indoor skating and curling rinks.“In reinstating the Community Rink Affordability Grant, we are helping communities keep ice rinks accessible and affordable across Saskatchewan,” Parks, Culture and Sport Minister Laura Ross said. “We are ensuring that when rinks and the activities held at them are safely re-opened, they can continue to support the health and wellness of communities and contribute to local resident’s quality of life.”The program will provide $2,500 a year per indoor ice surface to help cover the costs of operating rinks in villages, towns and cities. The grant may be used to offset the cost of rink operations, minor capital upgrades or to outfit the facility with COVID-19 related expenditures. It is expected that more than 600 ice surfaces in nearly 400 communities will be eligible to receive this support.“We are grateful to the Government of Saskatchewan for recognizing the escalating costs communities are facing in order to operate and maintain their rinks,” Saskatchewan Parks and Recreation Association President TJ Biemans said. “These facilities are integral to the vitality and wellbeing of our communities, with this funding coming at a time when that has never been more necessary.”To learn more and register for CRAG on or before March 12, 2021, to complete the online form found on the Saskatchewan Parks and Recreation Association’s website at www.spra.sk.ca/crag.7 a.m.: Colleges can’t count on a coronavirus vaccine to save the spring semester.Because young, healthy students are at the back of the line for shots, dorms that are already lightly populated are unlikely to fill up soon. That threatens revenue and creates risk for investors who financed a decadeslong building boom.A vaccine could end the financial pain, though colleges will have to wait for their share. “We have seen overwhelming interest from all sectors, and higher education is no exception,” said Laurie Forlano, Virginia’s deputy commissioner for population health.The education economy in the U.S. is a high-stakes competition for universities and students alike. Many young people take towering loans to finance college and graduate school, creating a transactional relationship with schools, which woo them with expensive amenities. That’s created a vast market for investors: more than $280 billion in college and university debt in the municipal and corporate markets.Even as some schools aim to bring back more people in the spring, including Harvard and Princeton, the pandemic has choked off the pipeline of students and their payments for tuition, room and board that support operations and the debt.6:59 a.m.: Hong Kong has secured delivery of 15 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines, with the first million to arrive as early as January, the city’s leader said Friday.Hong Kong chief executive Carrie Lam said the city has reached agreements for 7.5 million doses each from Sinovac and Pfizer/BioNTech. As each person needs two doses, the 15 million would be enough to cover the city’s population, she said.At-risk people, such as the elderly and staff in nursing homes and in healthcare, will be given priority, she said at a news conference.“Our target is that within 2021, free vaccines will be provided to Hong Kong residents so that our lives will return to normal as soon as possible, so that we can resume cross-boundary activities and business activities gradually,” Lam said.She said Hong Kong is also negotiating with AstraZeneca and another manufacturer with the goal of securing a total of 30 million doses. Then, “if one type of vaccine proves to be problematic we have another alternative. And the amount of procurement will be twice the population of Hong Kong,” she said.The city is currently facing a surge in cases and has tightened social distancing measures. It has reported 7,378 infections, including 114 deaths.5:57 a.m.: Conspiracy theories, including those propagated by the once-fringe QAnon movement, have gained traction as the COVID-19 pandemic fuels fear, social and economic insecurity, and mistrust in authorities, experts in Canada say.The reach and visibility of QAnon have grown as its followers’ beliefs mix with misinformation and debunked claims related to the pandemic, said Amarnath Amarasingam, a fellow with the Global Network on Extremism and Technology and a professor in the school of religion at Queen’s University.It’s hard to say where the discredited QAnon belief system begins and ends, he said, describing it as a multi-faceted conspiracy theory that’s become increasingly overarching since the first so-called “Q drop,” a post by an anonymous user called Qon the online forum 4chan in late 2017.QAnon draws on and fuels an array of beliefs, he said, from anti-Semitism to white nationalism to the idea that U.S. President Donald Trump is secretly working to take down a cabal of corrupt, Satan-worshipping liberal eliteswho are abusing and trafficking children for sex.It’s so absurd it should be the perfect conspiracy theory to ignore, said Amarasingam.But Trump’s refusal to denounce QAnon has pushed it into the mainstream, where its ideas are being cherry-picked and sprinkled throughout various movements, including those opposing public health rules aimed at fighting the spread of COVID-19, he said.5:56 a.m.: Ontario is expected to provide an update today on its plans to rollout the COVID-19 vaccine.The province has said that it will begin immunizations with its first shipment of 6,000 doses on Tuesday.Retired gen. Rick Hiller says University Health Network in Toronto and the Ottawa Hospital will administer the first shots to health-care workers.An additional 90,000 doses of the Pfizer vaccine expected later this month in the province are to be provided to 13 hospitals across Ontario.Hillier says the province also expects to receive between 30,000 and 85,000 doses of the Moderna vaccine by the new year, pending its approval by Health Canada.The province is also expected to announce additional restrictions for regions in the province as case counts rise.5:54 a.m.: The federal government says the largest mass immunization effort in Canadian history could begin as early as next week. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says Ottawa expects to receive up to 249,000 doses of the COVID-19 vaccine developed by pharmaceutical giant Pfizer and German partner BioNTech. Health Canada has approved its use. The second vaccine in line for approval in Canada is from Moderna. The Canadian military will have a role to play in vaccine distribution. Various provinces have started spelling out their plans as well. Here’s a look at what they’ve said so far.5:53 a.m.: The owner of a bluefin tuna exporting company in eastern Prince Edward Island has offered up two freezers to the provincial government as public health officials prepare to vaccinate Islanders against COVID-19.Jason Tompkins, owner of One Tuna in North Lake, P. E. I, said in an interview Thursday he has loaned two of his laboratory-grade freezers to the province to store the recently approved Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine.The vaccine needs to be kept at a frosty -70 C, according to Pfizer, whose vaccine got the green light from Health Canada on Wednesday.The freezers on loan average about -87 C, Tompkins said.“I know that they’re not something that everyone just has laying around,” he said. “If we can do anything to help out, it’s kind of our duty.”He said he emailed P.E.I.’s chief public health officer Dr. Heather Morrison to offer up the freezers when he learned the Pfizer vaccine was being considered for approval in Canada.After discussion with Morrison’s team about the suitability of the equipment, the province picked the freezers up earlier this week.One Tuna usually uses each of the freezers to store up to 500 pounds of tuna loin, Tompkins said, but the season for the large fish recently ended, freeing up the equipment.The Island expects to get its first shipment of 1,950 vaccines next week, Morrison said Tuesday, and the province will administer the doses to priority groups including residents and staff of long-term care homes, health-care workers and adults in Indigenous communities.She said Islanders will begin to get vaccinated the day after the doses arrive.The tuna season doesn’t start up until July, Tompkins said, so the freezers are on loan to the government until then.“We had the availability of the equipment and we’re a small island and a big community, and you do what you can to help out,” he said.5:52 a.m.: Calls grew Friday for tougher lockdown measures in Germany as the country’s disease control centre reported record daily increases in both coronavirus cases and deaths.The Robert Koch Institute said the country’s 16 states reported 29,875 new cases of COVID-19, breaking the previous daily record of 23,679 cases reported the day before.The number of deaths from the virus rose by 598, to a total of 20,970. The previous daily record of deaths was 590, set on Wednesday.“The only chance we have to get in control of the situation is a lockdown, but it needs to be immediate,” Interior Minister Horst Seehofer told Der Spiegel magazine. “If we wait until Christmas, we’ll have to continue fighting these numbers for months.”Under current restrictions implemented at the beginning of November as numbers were growing exponentially, restaurants, bars, leisure and sports facilities have been closed and hotels are closed to tourists, but schools and non-essential shops have remained open.The numbers had plateaued — but at high daily levels — and have again been rising in recent days.That prompted Chancellor Angela Merkel this week to call on state governments, which are responsible for imposing and lifting restrictions, to consider closing schools early before Christmas and other measures.“We are in a decisive, perhaps the decisive, phase of fighting the pandemic,” she said.5:49 a.m.: The coronavirus pandemic is a “wake up call” for governments to invest more in health care, says Adar Poonawalla, CEO of the Serum Institute of India, the world’s largest manufacturer of vaccines.The Serum Institute has taken on a vital role as the largest company licensed to manufacture the Oxford University-AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine. It is increasing its production capacity by the end of 2021 to over 2.5 billion doses a year to cope with future disease outbreaks, Poonawalla said in a telephone interview with The Associated Press.Poonawalla’s company now has an annual capacity of 1.5 billion doses. That is more than the billion doses that China, home to the most vaccine makers in the world, says it manufactures in a year.Looking beyond the pandemic, he said he anticipates more diseases jumping from animal to human hosts, driving huge demand for vaccines, so the extra capacity is likely to be useful in coming decades.“I think (the demand) is going to keep growing even more exponentially, compared to the last five or ten years,” Poonawalla said Wednesday.Loss of forests and human incursions into wild habitats create more opportunities for such pathogens to make the jump. That was true of COVID-19 and other illnesses such as SARS, MERS and HIV-AIDS.Existing research indicates that India, with its high population density and biodiverse forests, is among the most likely places for the emergence of such new diseases.For now, the Serum Institute is focused on the coronavirus. It has committed to supplying the Oxford University-AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine to developing nations through COVAX, an ambitious global initiative to distribute COVID-19 vaccines to countries worldwide.5:48 a.m.: The pharmaceutical companies Sanofi and GlaxoSmithKline said Friday that their experimental COVID-19 vaccine did not appear to work well in older adults, a significant setback to their late-stage clinical trial that was previously expected to begin in the United States in December.Instead, the companies said they planned to test a modified version of their vaccine in a smaller trial beginning in February. Rather than compare their candidate with a placebo, they said, it could be tested against a vaccine expected to be authorized by regulators for emergency use soon.The Sanofi vaccine is one of six that were selected by Operation Warp Speed, the federal government’s effort to quickly bring a vaccine to market. The companies negotiated a $2.1 billion agreement with the United States to provide 100 million doses.5:46 a.m.: Bahrain has announced plans to give the public free coronavirus vaccines, as Saudi Arabia said it approved an inoculation by Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech to fight the pandemic.The island nation of Bahrain, off the coast of Saudi Arabia, made the vaccine pledge in an announcement published late Thursday by its state-run Bahrain News Agency.“A safe vaccine will be provided free of charge to all citizens and residents within the kingdom,” the statement said, without elaborating on which vaccine it would offer.Bahrain plans to inoculate everyone 18 years and older in the kingdom at 27 different medical facilities, hoping to be able to vaccinate 10,000 people a day. Bahrain, an island in the Persian Gulf home to the U.S. Navy’s 5th Fleet, has a population of around 1.5 million people.A week ago, Bahrain said it had become the second nation in the world to grant an emergency-use authorization to the Pfizer vaccine after the United Kingdom.The Pfizer shots, a so-called “mRNA vaccine,” contain a piece of genetic code that trains the immune system to recognize the spiked protein on the surface of the virus. To be vaccinated, a person receives two shots over 21 days.In the time since, Bahrain has not responded to questions from The Associated Press, including on Friday. Pfizer told the AP that the details of its sales agreement with Bahrain, including the “timing of delivery and the volume of doses,” were confidential and declined to comment.Bahrain had already granted emergency-use authorization for a Chinese vaccine made by Sinopharm and has inoculated some 6,000 people with it. That vaccine is an “inactivated” shot made by growing the whole virus in a lab and then killing it.Friday 5:44 a.m.: An influential panel of independent scientists endorsed a COVID-19 vaccine developed in record time by Pfizer Inc. and its partner, BioNTech, and urged the Food and Drug Administration to make it available for use in the U.S.If the FDA agrees and grants emergency use authorization — a widely expected action that could come as soon as Friday — it would mark a turning point in a pandemic that has claimed more than 292,000 American lives and is still getting worse.Once authorization is secured, states and territories will be able to place their orders for the coveted vaccine. Millions of doses could be administered to health care workers and nursing home residents within a matter of days.The FDA advisory committee voted 17-4 Thursday in favour of recommending the experimental vaccine for use in people ages 16 and up. One committee member abstained.The vote came after the panel of independent experts heard hours of testimony on the vaccine’s development and testing, along with discussion of the logistical and ethical issues raised by a decision to approve its use in the midst of a public health emergency.Several members expressed discomfort with having to assess the vaccine on such a compressed schedule. But they also acknowledged that the experimental vaccine’s unexpectedly strong performance, as well as the relentless pace of the coronavirus’s spread, left them little choice but to wave it on.“It isn’t a question of when you know everything, it’s a question of when you have enough” information to declare that a vaccine is worth a try, said Dr. Paul A. Offit, a vaccinologist at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia who voted in favour of emergency use authorization.“We have clear evidence of benefit,” Offit added. “All we have on the other side is theoretical risk.”Read Thursday’s coronavirus news.\n",

      "CONTENT : BEIJING - U.S. financial news service Bloomberg said Friday that Chinese authorities have detained one of its Beijing-based news assistants on what they said was suspicion of endangering national security.Bloomberg reported that Chinese citizen Haze Fan was seen being taken from her apartment building accompanied by security officers in plain clothes at about noon on Monday, shortly after her last contact with her editors.It quoted a Chinese government statement as saying Fan was detained by the Beijing branch of the National Security Bureau “according to relevant Chinese law on suspicion of engaging in criminal activities that jeopardize national security.”China permits Chinese citizens to work only as translators, researchers and assistants for foreign news organizations, not as registered journalists able to report independently. China’s own media are almost entirely state owned and tightly controlled, and the country has long been one of the leading jailers of journalists.Bloomberg said it has been seeking information about Fan’s whereabouts from the Chinese government and from China’s embassy in Washington, D.C.It said its parent company, Bloomberg LP, was informed Thursday that she was being held on suspicion of endangering national security, a vaguely defined charge that can lead to lengthy detention with little recourse to legal assistance.“We are very concerned for her, and have been actively speaking to Chinese authorities to better understand the situation. We are continuing to do everything we can to support her while we seek more information,” a Bloomberg spokesperson was quoted as saying in the report.Fan began working for Bloomberg in 2017 after stints with a number of other foreign news organizations in China, the company said.China has detained news assistants in the past over reports that angered the ruling Communist Party, and authorities have also sought to punish foreign media more generally by limiting their operations, expelling journalists or issuing them only short-term visas.China this year expelled journalists from The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal and other American outlets amid complaints over content and moves by the U.S. to send home dozens of Chinese journalists working for state media.Bloomberg saw its business in financial information suffer in China several years ago in apparent retaliation for its reporting on the personal financial dealings of leading Chinese officials.\n",

      "CONTENT : BEIJING - China’s sales of SUVs, minivans and sedans rose by double digits in November as the country recovered from the coronavirus pandemic, but were below pre-virus levels for the year, an industry group reported Friday.Sales in the industry’s biggest global market rose 11.6% over a year earlier to 2.3 million, according to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers. Total vehicle sales, including trucks and buses, rose 12.6% to 2.8 million, holding steady at October’s growth rate.From January to November, passenger vehicle sales were off 7.6% from the same period of 2019, at 17.8 million. Sales of commercial vehicles rose 20.6% to 4.7 million.Full-year auto sales are on track to decline for a third year after hitting a peak in 2017.China, where the pandemic began in December, became the first country to reopen its economy after the disease was declared under control in March.November sales of all-electric and gasoline-electric hybrid vehicles more than doubled, rising 104.9% over a year earlier. Sales in the first 11 months of 2020 edged back above pre-virus levels, rising 3.9% over a year earlier.Auto demand already was weak before China closed factories and dealerships in February to fight the coronavirus. Consumers are uneasy about slowing economic growth and a tariff war with Washington.That hurts global automakers that are looking to China to propel sales growth and are spending heavily to develop electric vehicles under pressure to meet Chinese government sales quotas.\n",

      "CONTENT : MOSCOW — Authorities in Moscow are expanding the COVID-19 vaccination program to include those in the retail and service sector.Last weekend, Moscow opened 70 vaccination facilities to start delivering Russian-designed Sputnik V vaccines to thousands of doctors, teachers, and municipal workers.Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin says a new shipment of the vaccine is due to arrive shortly, allowing the city officials to expand the immunization effort to those working in the retail and services sector starting next week.Russia’s nearly 2.6 million confirmed cases is the fourth-largest caseload in the world behind the United States, India and Brazil. The government task force has recorded 45,893 virus-related deaths since the start of the outbreak.___THE VIRUS OUTBREAK:The head of the FDA says his agency has told Pfizer it “will rapidly work” to grant emergency use of its COVID-19 vaccine following a positive recommendation by government advisers. Many FDA observers predict action by Saturday ahead of a Sunday meeting by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Federal officials plan to allocate the first 6.4 million doses of the vaccine to states based on their population. Shots could begin within days for U.S. health care workers and people in nursing homes.— Germany sees record daily virus infections and deaths, calls grow louder for tougher lockdown.— ICU workers struggle find a balance, acknowledging the vast amounts of deaths they have witnessed but trying to keep their own mental health intact— UN boss: Potential vaccines must be used for global public good___Follow AP’s coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/coronavirus-pandemic and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak ___HERE’S WHAT ELSE IS HAPPENING:BOSTON — A study published by the journal Science says as many as 300,000 COVID-19 cases around the world can be traced to a two-day biotech meeting at a hotel in downtown Boston last February.The study published Thursday says the meeting of Biogen managers resulted in 100 people returning home with the coronavirus who spread it to 29 states and Australia, Slovakia and Sweden.The study estimates the conference is responsible for about 1.6% of all cases in the United States. It tracked the unique genetic signatures of the virus that could be traced to the Boston event.The lead author was Jacob Lemieux, an infectious disease doctor at Massachusetts General Hospital, but more than 50 researchers were credited.“If there is a public health message here, it is that the conditions that enable these types of massive super-spreading events to occur are still with us,” Lemieux told The Boston Globe.Biogen says in a statement it hoped the study would “continue to drive a better understanding of the transmission of this virus and efforts to address it.”___HARTFORD, Conn. — A judge has ordered the release of 17 inmates from a federal prison in Connecticut by Saturday, saying government officials have been too slow in moving medically vulnerable prisoners to home confinement or furlough during the coronavirus pandemic.U.S. District Judge Michael Shea in Hartford issued the order Thursday night as part of a lawsuit by inmates at the Federal Correctional Institution in Danbury.A settlement of the lawsuit in July requires the federal Bureau of Prisons to promptly identify prisoners who are low security risks and have a greater chance of developing serious complications from the virus and release them to home confinement.The settlement calls for prisoners to be released within 14 days of approval. But lawyers for the inmates say some have been waiting nearly three months. The inmates’ attorneys say they are representing about 450 medically vulnerable prisoners at Danbury, which houses about 1,000 male and female inmates.The Bureau of Prisons says 30 Danbury inmates and two staff members are infected the coronavirus. Since the pandemic began, one inmate has died.___WASHINGTON — The head of the Food and Drug Administration says his agency has told Pfizer that it “will rapidly work” to grant emergency use of its COVID-19 vaccine following a positive recommendation by government advisers.The FDA decision will kickstart an unprecedented vaccination campaign needed to eventually defeat the virus. The FDA’s greenlight of the vaccine, co-developed with BioNtech, was practically assured after the positive vote by agency advisers a day earlier.The FDA’s brief statement came less than an hour after President Donald Trump tweeted directly at FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn, complaining that FDA “is still a big, old, slow turtle.”FDA staff have repeatedly said they expect to issue a decision within days of Thursday’s meeting. Many FDA observers predict action by Saturday ahead of a Sunday meeting by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.The panel of CDC advisers will vote on who should get priority for the initial shots. Federal officials plan to allocate the first 6.4 million doses of the vaccine to states based on their population.___LONDON — Britain is shortening the mandatory self-isolation period for people arriving from overseas and those who come into contact with confirmed coronavirus cases.The government says starting Monday they will have to quarantine for 10 days rather than 14. The change was agreed by the chief medical officers of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.It comes amid concerns that many people are not following instructions to self-isolate.England’s deputy chief medical officer, Jenny Harries says reducing the period to 10 days was a “reasonable balance between managing the risk to the public but allowing us not to intrude on their lives.”The rule for passengers applies to arrivals from everywhere except a list of “safe” countries that have low levels of the virus.___ROME — Italy’s interior minister doesn’t have the coronavirus after all.The interior ministry says Luciana Lamorgese received a false positive result after a molecular test Monday. That result had forced her to leave a Cabinet meeting as it was under way and raised concern about possible contagion within the government.Subsequent tests Wednesday and Thursday were negative. The ministry says the original test, done as part of a periodic control, gave an erroneous result.Italy has seen a strong resurgence of the coronavirus this fall that has spread throughout the country.___BERLIN — Switzerland’s government is ordering restaurants, bars, shops and leisure facilities in most regions to close early as it faces a resurgence in coronavirus infections.President Simonetta Sommaruga says the requirement to close at 7 p.m. will take effect at midnight Friday and run though Jan. 22.There will be exceptions for regions where the coronavirus reproduction rate is below 1 and the infection rate below the national average for seven days, where opening until 11 p.m. will be allowed.Sommaruga says action is needed because infections are rising quickly in most Swiss regions, but “we want to prevent a lockdown.”Lockdowns in one shape or another have been imposed in many other European countries. Health Minister Alain Berset says the Swiss restrictions are “very moderate” and residents must respect them to avoid tougher measures.___MANHATTAN BEACH, Calif. — California health officials are urging the state’s residents to stay home as much as possible because of a coronavirus surge taxing the state’s hospitals.But the most recent stay-at-home order allows Californians to do many more activities than the March shutdown that made the state a model on how to respond to the virus. People have been buying Christmas trees, shopping for groceries and hitting the gym since the orders took effect Monday in Southern California and much of the Bay Area and Central Valley.On Thursday, the state set a one-day record of 220 deaths. Los Angeles County Health Director Barbara Ferrer is warning of catastrophic consequences if more people don’t heed orders to stay home and within their own household members.She says hospitals are becoming overwhelmed and may result in “severely ill patients not able to get the care they need.”___PARIS — Even for hospital staff for whom death is a constant, witnessing the loss of a fellow human being to COVID-19 is a churn of emotions.At the Paris hospital that recorded the first virus death outside Asia, nurses and paramedics in the intensive care unit have their own coping mechanisms. Some use meditation. Others try to remain detached.But in treating the critically sick, they also become involved emotionally. Some mourn the dead by performing the final washing of their bodies. They also have an in-house psychologist to turn to. They sometimes come to her in a rage or in tears, in need of her hot tea and understanding.___LONDON — Drugmakers GlaxoSmithKline and Sanofi say their potential COVID-19 vaccine won’t be ready until late next year as they seek to improve the shot’s effectiveness in older people.The companies say early-stage trials showed the vaccine produced an “insufficient” immune response in older adults, demonstrating the need to refine the product so it protects people of all ages.GSK and Sanofi, based in London and Paris, respectively, say they were confident of the vaccine’s ultimate success due to positive results from other tests.In adults 18 to 49, the vaccine produced an immune response comparable to patients who had recovered from COVID-19, the companies say.___NEW DEHLI — Serum Institute of India, the world’s largest manufacturer of vaccines, is increasing its production capacity by the end of 2021 to over 2.5 billion doses a year to cope with future disease outbreaks.Serum Institute CEO Adar Poonawalla told The Associated Press in an interview that the coronavirus pandemic is a “wake up call” for governments to invest more in health care.Poonawalla’s company has an annual capacity of 1.5 billion doses. That is more than the billion doses that China, home to the most vaccine makers in the world, says it manufactures in a year.The Serum Institute has a vital role as the largest company licensed to manufacture the Oxford University-AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccines. Poonawalla says he anticipates more frequent outbreaks and increasing spread of animal-related diseases to humans___ATHENS, Greece — Greek authorities say bookshops and hairdressers will be allowed to reopen beginning Monday but all other retail stores, entertainment venues, restaurants, bars and cafes will remain shut throughout the Christmas period as part of the country’s second lockdown.A mandatory quarantine for travellers arriving in Greece will be cut on Dec. 18 to three days from the previously announced 10 but a 10 p.m.-5 a.m. curfew will be in place throughout the holiday season.Government spokesman Stelios Petsas said that despite five weeks of lockdown measures, coronavirus infections remain high, putting pressure on the country’s health system. Intensive care units were at 83% of their capacity nationwide, and at 91% of capacity in the hard-hit northern city of Thessaloniki, Greece’s second largest urban centre.Churches will be allowed to open to the faithful only on Christmas Day and Epiphany on Jan. 6, with limits on the number allowed inside according to church size.Greece has registered more than 121,000 confirmed cases and 3,370 deaths.___GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip — The Hamas militant group has imposed a second lockdown in the Gaza Strip to contain a worsening coronavirus outbreak in the isolated and impoverished territory, home to more than 2 million Palestinians.Residents have been ordered to remain at home on Friday and Saturday, a brief period that appears unlikely to significantly alter the outbreak’s trajectory. A nighttime curfew has been in place since August.Authorities are reluctant to impose more sweeping measures because the economy is already suffering from an Israeli and Egyptian blockade imposed when Hamas seized power from rival Palestinian forces in 2007. Israel says the blockade is needed to keep Hamas from importing arms.The blockade, and strict quarantine measures, delayed the arrival of the coronavirus, but the first cases of local transmission were detected in August. Some 27,000 infections have been reported since then, including 175 deaths.Gaza’s health system has been hollowed out by the blockade and years of conflict, and experts have warned that a major outbreak could overwhelm hospitals.___WASHINGTON — A U.S. government advisory panel has endorsed widespread use of Pfizer’s coronavirus vaccine, putting the country just one step away from launching an epic vaccination campaign against the outbreak that has killed close to 300,000 Americans.Shots could begin within days, depending on how quickly the Food and Drug Administration signs off, as expected, on the expert committee’s recommendation. First in line for the vaccinations would be health care workers and nursing home residents. Widespread access to the general public is not expected until the spring.“This is a light at the end of the long tunnel of this pandemic,” declared Dr. Sally Goza, president of the American Academy of Pediatrics.In a 17-4 vote with one abstention, the government advisers concluded that the vaccine from Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech appears safe and effective for emergency use in adults and teenagers 16 and over.___BERLIN — Calls were growing Friday for tougher lockdown measures in Germany as officials report record daily coronavirus cases and deaths.The Robert Koch Institute said the country’s 16 states reported 29,875 new cases of COVID-19, breaking the previous daily record of 23,679 cases reported the day before.The number of deaths from the virus rose by 598, to a total of 20,970. The previous daily record of deaths was 590, set on Wednesday.Germany’s states are responsible for imposing and lifting restrictions, and Chancellor Angela Merkel earlier this week urged action, saying “we are in a decisive, perhaps the decisive, phase of fighting the pandemic.”Restaurants, bars, leisure and sports facilities are currently closed in Germany and hotels are closed to tourists, but schools and nonessential shops remain open.Merkel has called on state governments to consider closing schools early before Christmas and is expected to meet with governors soon to discuss possible new measures. Several states have already announced new restrictions on their own.___SEOUL, South Korea — South Korea is expanding the use of rapid tests and deploying hundreds of police officers and soldiers to help with contact tracing.Senior Health Ministry official Yoon Taeho says rapid antigen tests at emergency rooms, intensive-care units and remote-area hospitals will be covered by the national health insurance starting Monday, which would cost recipients about 8,000 won ($7) for each test.Antigen tests and another form of rapid testing based on saliva samples will also be available at designated coronavirus testing sites in the Seoul metropolitan area, where officials are temporarily providing free tests to anyone, regardless of whether they have symptoms or clear reasons to suspect infection.Yoon said the country will also deploy more than 800 police officers, soldiers and civil servants to support contact tracing efforts in the capital area.The Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency on Friday reported another 689 new coronavirus cases.___NEW DELHI — India has recorded 29,398 new coronavirus cases in the past 24 hours, a continuing downward trend. It had reported 31,521 new cases a day earlier.Single-day cases have remained below the 50,000 mark for more than a month now.India reported another 414 deaths in the past 24 hours, raising the overall death toll to 142,186, according to the Health Ministry. India’s coronavirus tally since the pandemic began is 9.7 million cases, second behind the U.S.___CANBERRA, Australia — Australia’s prime minister says his government will not rush approval of Pfizer’s coronavirus vaccine because he wants Australians to have confidence in the product.Prime Minister Scott Morrison said Friday that Australia is in a different position to Britain, which has given emergency approval to the roll out, and to the United States, which is near final approval for the vaccine’s use.Morrison says he wants Australians to have “absolute full confidence that when it gets the tick, they can get the jab.”The government expects the Australian regulator to approve the vaccine produced jointly by Pfizer and BioNTech by late January. The Australian roll out is expected to be underway by March.Meanwhile, Australian researchers say they have abandoned development of the University of Queensland vaccine because it produced false positive results on HIV tests. It’s one of five potential vaccines the Australian government had signed contracts with developers.___SANTA FE, N.M. — New Mexico health officials have issued orders that could limit nonessential surgeries and prepare for rationing of other medial services as the coronavirus pandemic strains resources and personnel at hospitals and intensive care centres.One of the orders from the state Department of Health allows hospitals and acute-care facilities to limit surgeries. The second changes liability standards for emergency medical providers as the state prepares for possible triage procedures that might limit care to some individuals.Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham said the orders go into Friday and will last until at least Jan. 4.___OKLAHOMA CITY -- Some Oklahomans who lost wages due to the coronavirus pandemic will receive $400 from the state starting next week.Oklahoma Employment Security Commission Director Shelley Zumwalt said Thursday the one-time payments will be going to to over 120,000 Oklahomans.Zumwalt says the agency received permission from the Federal Emergency Management Agency to distribute Lost Wage Assistance funds to anyone who received $100 in benefits from any claim type and certify their employment was affected by the coronavirus pandemic during the week of Sept. 6-12.___TOPEKA, Kan. — Kansas does not plan to send personal information to the federal government about residents who receive coronavirus vaccines, though it has signed a data-use agreement with the CDC.A spokeswoman for the Kansas Department of Health and Environment said Thursday in a text to The Associated Press that it signed a data-use agreement with the CDC “a while ago” but it “won’t be providing any identifying information.”The CDC’s standard agreement calls for collection of data about vaccine recipients, including a person’s name, address and birthday. The CDC says the information will help determine how vaccines are distributed, monitor their safety and effectiveness, and identify places that are under-vaccinated.The chief of the state health department said earlier this week that Kansas officials worry that sending personal information could discourage people from getting vaccinated.___CAIRO — Egypt has received its first shipment of a Chinese coronavirus vaccine, which was tested in the United Arab Emirates and is said to be 86% effective.The shipment by Chinese state-owned pharmaceutical giant Sinopharm landed at Cairo’s international airport from the UAE on Thursday.A health ministry statement says the government will first vaccinate health care workers, particularly those who deal with COVID-19 cases.Egypt is the Arab world’s most populous country and it has seen an increase in confirmed coronavirus infections in recent weeks amid warnings by the government about a second wave of the pandemic. Egypt reported 445 newly confirmed coronavirus infections Thursday and 22 deaths from COVID-19, bringing the country’s overall tally to 120,147 cases, with 6,854 deaths.___HARRISBURG, Pa. — Pennsylvania is halting school sports and other extracurricular activities, ordering gyms, theatres and casinos to close and banning indoor dining at restaurants in response to the worsening pandemic.A day after telling Pennsylvanians of his own COVID-19 diagnosis, Gov. Tom Wolf announced the widely expected clampdown Thursday. He said it aims to slow the accelerating spread of the coronavirus and prevent hospitals from becoming overrun.“We all hoped it would not come to this,” Wolf said at a virtual news conference, but “we need to slow the spread to save lives.”The restrictions include a 10-person cap on indoor gatherings, a 50-person limit for outdoor gatherings and capacity restrictions at retail stores. They take effect Saturday and run through until Jan. 4.___TORONTO — Canada’s most populous province will begin administering COVID-19 vaccinations at hospitals in Toronto and Ottawa on Tuesday.Ontario Premier Doug Ford says a small number of doses are expected to arrive in the province in the coming days.Canada’s health regulator approved the vaccine by U.S. drugmaker Pfizer and Germany’s BioNTech vaccine on Wednesday.Ford says health care workers in long-term care homes and other high-risk settings will be the first to receive the vaccines.___\n",

      "CONTENT : DUBAI, United Arab Emirates - Bahrain has announced plans to give the public free coronavirus vaccines, as Saudi Arabia said it approved an inoculation by Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech to fight the pandemic.The island nation of Bahrain, off the coast of Saudi Arabia, made the vaccine pledge in an announcement published late Thursday by its state-run Bahrain News Agency.“A safe vaccine will be provided free of charge to all citizens and residents within the kingdom,” the statement said, without elaborating on which vaccine it would offer.Bahrain plans to inoculate everyone 18 years and older in the kingdom at 27 different medical facilities, hoping to be able to vaccinate 10,000 people a day. Bahrain, an island in the Persian Gulf home to the U.S. Navy’s 5th Fleet, has a population of around 1.5 million people.A week ago, Bahrain said it had become the second nation in the world to grant an emergency-use authorization to the Pfizer vaccine after the United Kingdom.The Pfizer shots, a so-called “mRNA vaccine,” contain a piece of genetic code that trains the immune system to recognize the spiked protein on the surface of the virus. To be vaccinated, a person receives two shots over 21 days.In the time since, Bahrain has not responded to questions from The Associated Press, including on Friday. Pfizer told the AP that the details of its sales agreement with Bahrain, including the “timing of delivery and the volume of doses,” were confidential and declined to comment.Bahrain had already granted emergency-use authorization for a Chinese vaccine made by Sinopharm and has inoculated some 6,000 people with it. That vaccine is an “inactivated” shot made by growing the whole virus in a lab and then killing it.The United Arab Emirates on Wednesday described the Sinopharm vaccine as 86% effective, but provided few details and answered no questions. It marked the first public release of information on the efficacy of that shot.Earlier Thursday, Saudi Arabia’s Food and Drug Authority said it had registered the Pfizer vaccine “so that health authorities in the kingdom can then import and use the vaccine.”The kingdom said it based its decision on information given by Pfizer on Nov. 24, without elaborating. Pfizer on Nov. 18 said its vaccine is 95% effective.A major challenge for the Pfizer shot in the Mideast remains the weather, however. The vaccines must be stored and shipped at ultra-cold temperatures of around minus 70 degrees Celsius (minus 94 degrees Fahrenheit).Saudi Arabia said its Health Ministry later would announce plans on how it would distribute the vaccine in the kingdom, the biggest Gulf Arab state, with a population of 34 million people.Egypt received its first shipment of the Sinopharm vaccine on Thursday via the United Arab Emirates.\n",

      "CONTENT : WILMINGTON, Del. - President-elect Joe Biden’s historically challenging transition to power is suddenly becoming even more complicated.A federal investigation into the finances of Biden’s son Hunter threatens to embolden congressional Republicans, who have already shown little willingness to work with the incoming president or even acknowledge his clear victory in last month’s election. For sure, it will complicate Senate confirmation hearings for Biden’s yet-to-be-named attorney general, who could ultimately have oversight of the investigation into the new president’s son.It all raises the prospect of even deeper dysfunction in a capital that is already struggling to address the nation’s most pressing crises, including a surging pandemic whose daily death tolls are beginning to surpass the devastation of the Sept. 11 attacks. Republicans, particularly those eyeing presidential runs in 2024, are making clear they will press Biden on the issue.“Joe Biden needs to pledge today that he will co-operate with the federal investigation and answer any questions under oath,” Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., said Thursday, “and that if he is sworn in as president, no federal investigator or attorney working on the Hunter Biden criminal case will be removed.”Hunter Biden has long been a source of worry for his father’s campaign and was the subject of repeated unsupported accusations by President Donald Trump and his allies. But news of the probe, which was revealed on Wednesday and scrutinizes some of Hunter Biden’s Chinese business dealings and other transactions, caught most of his father’s staffers by surprise.The president-elect had no public appearance Thursday as he moved forward with filling out his administration. But the investigation threatens to destabilize a transition that has prioritized a methodical rollout of Cabinet selections, White House hires and policy goals — all meant to guarantee momentum when Biden takes office and immediately has to grapple with a surging pandemic and shaky economy.Most notably, the probe casts a spotlight on one of Biden’s most important choices: his attorney general.Alabama Sen. Doug Jones and federal appeals court judge Merrick Garland have emerged as the leading contenders, three people familiar with the matter told The Associated Press this week. But dynamics could shift, as any Biden choice now will be scrutinized for any perceived loyalty to the president-elect and bias in any probe of his son.Both Garland and especially Jones have longtime ties to Biden.The president-elect himself is not a subject of the investigation. And Biden aides believe that because other Hunter Biden stories have blown over, this will, too. They note that a tax fraud investigation pales in comparison to Trump’s refusal to concede the election or to the pandemic that has killed more than 290,000 Americans.Biden is expected to announce more Cabinet picks, but not attorney general, on Friday.Trump’s initial public response was surprisingly muted, just a pair of tweets about a Fox News segment on the story Wednesday night. But privately, he demanded to know why the investigation was not revealed ahead of Election Day, accusing officials of deliberately stalling in order to help Biden’s chances, according to two Republicans familiar with the conversations but not authorized to discuss them publicly.Other Republicans, including possible presidential contenders, were anything but shy in piling on.“If there were ever circumstances that created a conflict of interest and called for a special counsel, I think those circumstances are present here,” Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas said Thursday. “The Biden family has been trading on Joe Biden’s public office for 50 years. Do we really think that that will change if Joe Biden becomes president, the highest office in the land?”Some of Trump’s children have also faced some legal questions.Donald Trump Jr. was scrutinized in special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia probe for the 2016 meeting he had with a Kremlin-connected lawyer. And Ivanka Trump was recently deposed by investigators from the District of Columbia attorney general’s office as part of its lawsuit alleging the misuse of inaugural funds.The Hunter Biden investigation is the latest in a series of politically charged inquiries that the Justice Department has grappled with in the past five years, following probes into Hillary Clinton’s email use and the Trump campaign’s ties to Russia.Regardless of the facts of the investigation, a new Justice Department will likely feel compelled to assert its independence from the White House following allegations that its actions were overly politicized during the Trump administration. Biden has said he will play no role in department investigative decisions.“There are plenty of people that are going to have their hands in this one, but I think it’s really going to be driven by the new administration’s push to have total independence on any investigation,” said former Justice Department prosecutor Michael Weinstein, a New Jersey defence lawyer.“I think that’s going to be paramount,“ he added. ”They are going to bend over backwards to make sure that they do the contrary to the current administration — which is independence, let the investigation takes its course.”In this case, though, there is no perfect outcome for Biden.A protracted criminal investigation that results in an indictment would be a major distraction and then some as the new president tries to implement his agenda. But if the Justice Department decides against bringing charges, officials will feel pressure to explain their steps and reassure the American public the inquiry was done in a competent and thorough way.Federal investigators served a round of subpoenas on Tuesday, including to Hunter Biden, according to a person familiar with the investigation who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss an ongoing probe.The federal investigation, centring on potential tax crimes, had been going on at least a year before Biden announced his candidacy. Investigators did not reach out in the weeks prior to voting because of a department policy surrounding elections that prohibits overt investigative acts.Biden, fiercely protective of his own family, was said to be, in a statement released by his transition, “deeply proud of his son, who has fought through difficult challenges, including the vicious personal attacks of recent months, only to emerge stronger.”Biden struck a similarly defiant tone throughout the campaign whenever questions emerged about his son, which they frequently did. When Trump assailed Hunter Biden as a drug user during the first presidential debate in Cleveland, his father acknowledged that Hunter had had past substance abuse issues but added, “He’s worked on it. I’m proud of him. I’m proud of my son.”The spotlight on Hunter Biden intensified in the election’s final weeks, after Trump and his attorney Rudy Giuliani pushed unsubstantiated claims about his foreign business dealings. Those were based in part on New York Post reporting on a laptop that supposedly once belonged to Hunter Biden and was abandoned at a Delaware repair shop.Hunter Biden had joined the board of Ukrainian gas company Burisma in 2014, around the time his father, then the vice-president, was helping conduct Obama administration foreign policy with Ukraine. But, in a subsequent report, Senate Republicans did not produce any evidence that the hiring influenced U.S. policies.Joe Biden largely refused to even acknowledge the laptop controversy. His son, meanwhile, kept almost completely out of the public eye during the nearly 18 months his father was running for president.One of the few times he was seen was on stage outside the convention centre in Wilmington, Delaware, as his father was surrounded by joyous family members following his speech declaring victory in the presidential election. Hunter Biden, and his baby son, were right in the middle.___Tucker and Weissert reported from Washington. Additional reporting by Associated Press writer Mike Balsamo in Washington.\n",

      "CONTENT : OTTAWA - In his darkest moments, Michael Kovrig draws strength from knowing that his fellow Canadians and people around the world are working to free him and Michael Spavor from their respective Chinese prison cells.As much as that matters, Kovrig’s wife Vina Nadjibulla says he is also subjecting himself to a strict regimen to strengthen his mind and body because he views that as the key to his survival. She says that not only is Kovrig determined to survive his ordeal, he wants to reclaim his freedom better and stronger than when he lost it.Kovrig and Spavor are marking two years in separate Chinese prisons, on what Canada and dozens of its Western allies say are trumped-up espionage charges in retaliation for the RCMP’s December 2018 arrest of Chinese high-tech executive Meng Wanzhou on a U.S. extradition warrant.Canada’s ambassador to China, Dominic Barton, one of the few outsiders to see them, said this week Kovrig and Spavor are anything but broken men, and that seeing how they’ve endured their captivity was inspiring.“Mr. Spavor and Mr. Kovrig, and their families, have shown truly remarkable perseverance in the face of an unimaginable situation,” Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Thursday.Kovrig is “marshalling every ounce of his willpower and strength” to cope with his difficult situation, Nadjibulla said in an interview this week. “He says that knowing that Canadians care, knowing that the world cares, and people are fighting for his release, makes him feel stronger, and keeps hope alive,” she said, drawing on letters that he has written in captivity.“He hopes that he will be able to come out from this experience not only having survived it, but with a commitment, with resolve to rebuild his life better, to contribute even more to society.”A statement from Global Affairs on Thursday to The Canadian Press said that Canadian Embassy officials in Beijing spoke directly with Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs officials to clarify a media report earlier in the morning that suggested the two Michaels had gone on trial in China.The statement said that “contrary to what has been reported in the media this morning, there has been no development in the cases of Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor.”The statement also said that “the confusion was caused by an inaccurate characterization of the process made by the Chinese MFA spokesperson.” The Canadian Press also reached out, through intermediaries, to request interviews with Spavor’s friends and family but was unsuccessful. Spavor worked as an entrepreneur in the Chinese city of Dandong, where he is imprisoned near the North Korean border.Kovrig was most recently an analyst with the International Crisis Group in Washington and before that he was a member of Canada’s diplomatic corps, a career-focused on preventing deadly conflicts.“He hopes that he can continue to do that, and he can rejoin the broader conversation in the world with life and not just continue to be isolated and cut off in the way that he is,” said Nadjibulla. She said Kovrig is devouring books from the meditations of stoic philosopher Marcus Aurelius, to St. Paul’s Letter to the Romans, to Tolstoy’s “War and Peace,” to Nelson Mandela’s “Long Walk to Freedom.” He’s reread one of his pre-prison favourites, “Antifragile: Things That Gain From Disorder” by Nassim Nicholas Taleb, because it contains a key message for him.“It essentially posits that it’s important to cultivate an ability to not only survive traumas or disruptions but to become better and stronger as a result. So, this idea of building back better. I know it’s very much on the minds of many of us as we recover from the pandemic,” she said.Kovrig is also drawing on stoic philosophical teaching that, among other things, calls for the transformation of “fear into prudence, pain into information,” said Nadjibulla. Kovrig has added “anger into determination and grievance into resolve” to that philosophy.He has been drawn to St. Paul’s Letter to the Romans, the sixth book of the New Testament, “which says suffering produces endurance, endurance produces character, character produces hope. And Michael is doing everything possible to keep hope alive,“ said Nadjibulla.Kovrig is subjecting himself to a strict physical regimen, forever on the move in his small cell striving to walk the equivalent of five kilometres daily because he knows his mind cannot thrive if his body is not strong, said Nadjibulla.Robert Malley, Kovrig’s boss at the International Crisis Group, says his imprisoned colleague can hold the plank, a core body exercise of endurance, for 18 minutes. In solidarity, Crisis Group colleagues recently had a plank competition but the closest anyone got was seven minutes. They’re also walking 7,000 steps a day, the equivalent of five kilometres.Malley said he and his colleagues are in awe of Kovrig’s discipline.“None of us can be prepared for that, unless you’re in the military and you’re told this could happen. But he seems to have had all of the reflexes, instincts that are necessary,” said Malley.When Kovrig is released one day his colleagues hope stories of their attempts to replicate some of his exercises will help him heal and, perhaps, bridge the gap growing between them and him, said Malley.Kovrig only found out the scope of the global pandemic during Barton’s on-site virtual visit in October — his first contact with Canadian diplomats since January because Chinese authorities wouldn’t allow any contact due to COVID-19, said Nadjibulla.He was shocked at the pandemic’s scale and compared it to a zombie apocalypse and the movie “Contagion.”Kovrig is also aware that he is one of “two Michaels” and understands that both he and Spavor “are caught in this bigger situation,” she said. It’s not a topic that can be discussed during the now-resumed 30-minute consular visits.Nadjibulla said she was happy to hear that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau spoke to U.S. president-elect Joe Biden about the two Michaels in their recent conversation. Trudeau refused to discuss the content of that conversation last week, or whether Biden might revisit the Justice Department’s attempted extradition and prosecution of Meng.If the U.S. withdrew its charges, Meng could go free, and that might give China reason to free the two Michaels.“Our Michael and Michael Spavor are caught in a bigger geopolitical struggle,” Nadjibulla said. “They’re pawns in a bigger political game involving the U.S., China and Canada. And they have been in the situation for two long years, for no other reason than being Canadian citizens.”This report by The Canadian Press was first published Dec. 10, 2020.\n",

      "CONTENT : CANBERRA, Australia — Australia’s prime minister says his government will not rush approval of Pfizer’s coronavirus vaccine because he wants Australians to have confidence in the product.Prime Minister Scott Morrison said Friday that Australia is in a different position to Britain, which has given emergency approval to the roll out, and to the United States, which is near final approval for the vaccine’s use.Morrison says he wants Australians to have “absolute full confidence that when it gets the tick, they can get the jab.”The government expects the Australian regulator to approve the vaccine produced jointly by Pfizer and BioNTech by late January. The Australian roll out is expected to be underway by March.___THE VIRUS OUTBREAK:U.S. experts are convening to decide whether to approve the Pfizer vaccine. Food and Drug Administration advisers are scrutinizing the company’s data for any red flags or oversights. If approved, shots could begin within days for health care workers and people in nursing homes.U. S. lawmakers are trying to hammer out a COVID-19 relief bill. That comes as US jobless claims jumped to 853,000 amid a resurgence of the virus. More than 19 million people rely on some type of unemployment benefit, and unless Congress acts soon, nearly half will lose that aid in just over two weeks.___Follow AP’s coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/coronavirus-pandemic and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak ___HERE’S WHAT ELSE IS HAPPENING:WASHINGTON — A U.S. government advisory panel has endorsed Pfizer’s coronavirus vaccine, in a major step toward an epic vaccination campaign that could finally conquer the outbreak.The Food and Drug Administration is expected to follow the recommendation issued Thursday by its expert advisers.The group concluded that the shot appears safe and effective against the coronavirus in people 16 and older.A final FDA decision is expected within days. Shots would then begin for health care workers and nursing home residents. Widespread access to the general public is not expected until the spring.___SANTA FE, N.M. — New Mexico health officials have issued orders that could limit nonessential surgeries and prepare for rationing of other medial services as the coronavirus pandemic strains resources and personnel at hospitals and intensive care centres.One of the orders from the state Department of Health allows hospitals and acute-care facilities to limit surgeries. The second changes liability standards for emergency medical providers as the state prepares for possible triage procedures that might limit care to some individuals.Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham said the orders go into Friday and will last until at least Jan. 4.___CANBERRA, Australia — Australian researchers say they have abandoned development of a potential coronavirus vaccine because it produced false positive results on HIV tests.A statement said Friday that the University of Queensland vaccine that was to be manufactured at Australian biopharmaceutical company CSL’s Melbourne headquarters proved safe and produced a “robust response” to the virus during initial trials.But it said the researchers and the government agreed not to proceed further because of the false positive result of some HIV tests due to a protein contained in the potential vaccine.It was one of five potential vaccines on which the Australian government had signed contracts with developers.___OKLAHOMA CITY -- Some Oklahomans who lost wages due to the coronavirus pandemic will receive $400 from the state starting next week.Oklahoma Employment Security Commission Director Shelley Zumwalt said Thursday the one-time payments will be going to to over 120,000 Oklahomans.Zumwalt says the agency received permission from the Federal Emergency Management Agency to distribute Lost Wage Assistance funds to anyone who received $100 in benefits from any claim type and certify their employment was affected by the coronavirus pandemic during the week of Sept. 6-12.___TOPEKA, Kan. — Kansas does not plan to send personal information to the federal government about residents who receive coronavirus vaccines, though it has signed a data-use agreement with the CDC.A spokeswoman for the Kansas Department of Health and Environment said Thursday in a text to The Associated Press that it signed a data-use agreement with the CDC “a while ago” but it “won’t be providing any identifying information.”The CDC’s standard agreement calls for collection of data about vaccine recipients, including a person’s name, address and birthday. The CDC says the information will help determine how vaccines are distributed, monitor their safety and effectiveness, and identify places that are under-vaccinated.The chief of the state health department said earlier this week that Kansas officials worry that sending personal information could discourage people from getting vaccinated.___CAIRO — Egypt has received its first shipment of a Chinese coronavirus vaccine, which was tested in the United Arab Emirates and is said to be 86% effective.The shipment by Chinese state-owned pharmaceutical giant Sinopharm landed at Cairo’s international airport from the UAE on Thursday.A health ministry statement says the government will first vaccinate health care workers, particularly those who deal with COVID-19 cases.Egypt is the Arab world’s most populous country and it has seen an increase in confirmed coronavirus infections in recent weeks amid warnings by the government about a second wave of the pandemic. Egypt reported 445 newly confirmed coronavirus infections Thursday and 22 deaths from COVID-19, bringing the country’s overall tally to 120,147 cases, with 6,854 deaths.___HARRISBURG, Pa. — Pennsylvania is halting school sports and other extracurricular activities, ordering gyms, theatres and casinos to close and banning indoor dining at restaurants in response to the worsening pandemic.A day after telling Pennsylvanians of his own COVID-19 diagnosis, Gov. Tom Wolf announced the widely expected clampdown Thursday. He said it aims to slow the accelerating spread of the coronavirus and prevent hospitals from becoming overrun.“We all hoped it would not come to this,” Wolf said at a virtual news conference, but “we need to slow the spread to save lives.”The restrictions include a 10-person cap on indoor gatherings, a 50-person limit for outdoor gatherings and capacity restrictions at retail stores. They take effect Saturday and run through until Jan. 4.___TORONTO — Canada’s most populous province will begin administering COVID-19 vaccinations at hospitals in Toronto and Ottawa on Tuesday.Ontario Premier Doug Ford says a small number of doses are expected to arrive in the province in the coming days.Canada’s health regulator approved the vaccine by U.S. drugmaker Pfizer and Germany’s BioNTech vaccine on Wednesday.Ford says health care workers in long-term care homes and other high-risk settings will be the first to receive the vaccines.___GREENVILLE, S.C. — Vice-President Mike Pence has travelled to South Carolina to talk about coronavirus vaccines, as cases are rising in the state.Pence participated in a roundtable discussion with Gov. Henry McMaster and local leaders about two vaccines, both likely to receive FDA approval for use in the next week.Pence says the government’s virus task force has “cut no corners in the development of this vaccine. We have cut red tape.”State health officials plan to give vaccines first to health care workers and nursing home patients. Federal officials hope to have the vaccine available to the general public by the end of June.South Carolina is averaging nearly 2,500 new cases a day, about 600 more than at the summer peak.___OKLAHOMA CITY — Tulsa’s airport says it will begin offering coronavirus testing to current and recent passengers.The airport board has approved the testing inside an airport terminal beginning Jan. 4 for people who are flying or have flown in the previous three days.Costs will range from $70 for a rapid antigen test to $185 for a full respiratory test.The State Department of Health reported 2,460 new cases of the virus and 35 more deaths on Thursday.___MISSION, Kan. — The U.S. has set records for deaths and hospitalizations.The U.S. recorded 3,124 confirmed deaths on Wednesday, the highest one-day total yet, according to Johns Hopkins University. That’s more than the toll of 2,977 killed on Sept. 11, 2001.More than 106,000 Americans are hospitalized.Until last week, the peak was 2,603 deaths on April 15, when New York City was the epicenter of the nation’s outbreak.The pandemic has killed more than 290,000 people in the U.S., with more than 15 million confirmed infections.___LONDON — British authorities plan to test all secondary school-age children in southeast England for coronavirus to try to curb surging infection rates.Health Secretary Matt Hancock says the mass testing will cover parts of London and the neighbouring areas of Essex and Kent counties. Children ages 11 to 18 will be tested whether or not they have symptoms.Hancock says the testing will be done so schools could stay open, “because that is both right for education and for public health.”Hancock says infections are starting to rise in some areas after falling during a four-week national lockdown in England that ended Dec. 2. The virus is spreading fastest among older children, health officials say.Britain has confirmed more than 63,000 coronavirus-related deaths, the highest in Europe.___CONCORD, N.H. — New Hampshire House Speaker Dick Hinch has died from COVID-19, a medical examiner ruled Thursday following his unexpected death.The 71-year-old Hinch, who was sworn in as leader of the newly Republican-led Legislature only a week ago, died Wednesday.He was starting his seventh two-year term in the state House. He previously served as majority leader for the 2016-17 session and as minority leader when Democrats were in control the last two years.___LOS ANGELES — Ellen DeGeneres says she has tested positive for the coronavirus but is “feeling fine right now.”Production on her daytime talk show has been paused until January, producer Telepictures said in a statement that followed DeGeneres’ Thursday announcement.In an Instagram post, DeGeneres says anyone who was in close contact with her has been notified and she’s following “all proper CDC guidelines.”___BOSTON — Massachusetts’ highest court says Gov. Charlie Baker didn’t overstep his authority with orders to close businesses and limit gatherings to control the spread of the coronavirus.The Supreme Judicial Court on Thursday rejected a challenge brought on behalf of a group including salon owners, pastors and a private school. They accused the Republican of exercising “legislative police power” by declaring a state of emergency.Baker announced this week that Massachusetts would tighten some restrictions as cases rise. The court rejected the lawsuit’s argument that the governor’s actions infringe on due process and free assembly.___JOHANNESBURG — South Africa Health Minister Zweli Mkhize says the country is seeing a dramatic rise in coronavirus cases.South Africa recorded 6,700 new cases on Wednesday, the most since August.Mkhize warned that hospital capacities could be overwhelmed in some regions.South Africa’s surge highlights that a new wave of the disease is sweeping across the continent, according to the head of the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.___HONOLULU — Hawaii expects to receive 80,000 doses of coronavirus vaccine in December for health care workers and residents of long-term care facilities.The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports the state Department of Health made its initial trial order with Pfizer for 4,875 doses. The December order will be used to provide the priority group with the first of two doses, which require a minimum 28 days in between injections. The vaccine will be free.Meanwhile, Hawaii’s biggest surfing competition has started amid concerns about the spread of the coronavirus among fans.Hawaii Public Radio reports the Billabong Pipe Masters Oahu’s North Shore will run through Dec. 20.

      "CONTENT : WASHINGTON - President-elect Joe Biden is set to nominate Katherine Tai to be the top U.S. trade envoy, according to two people familiar with his plans.Tai, who is chief trade counsel for the House Ways and Means Committee, will be tapped as the U.S. Trade Representative, according to the two people, who spoke Wednesday on condition of anonymity because they weren’t authorized to speak publicly about it.The role is a Cabinet position, and the Senate will vote on whether to confirm Tai for the position. Biden’s selection of Tai, who is Asian American, reflects his promise to choose a diverse Cabinet that reflects the makeup of the country.Fluent in Mandarin Chinese, Tai earlier oversaw China trade enforcement for the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, setting U.S. strategy in trade disputes with China. Biden’s trade representative will inherit a trade war with China, put on pause by an interim trade pact in January that left many of the hardest issues unresolved and U.S. taxes remaining on $360 billion in Chinese imports.As the top trade staffer at Ways and Means, Tai handled negotiations last year with the Trump administration over a revamped North American trade deal. Under pressure from congressional Democrats, Trump’s trade team agreed to strengthen the pact to make it easier for Mexican workers to form independent unions and demand better pay and benefits -- decreasing the incentives for U.S. firms to move south of the border to take advantage of cheap and compliant labour.The administration also dropped from the new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement what Democrats considered a giveaway to pharmaceutical companies that could have kept drug prices high.Tai is considered a problem-solving pragmatist on trade policy, which often breaks down into an ideological divide between free traders and protectionists. In a letter to Biden on Nov. 24, California Democratic Rep. Judy Chu, chair of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, and nine other female House members praised Tai’s “experience and diplomatic abilities’’ and said she is “uniquely qualified’’ to deal with Canada and Mexico on the USMCA and with U.S.-China trade tensions.“Katherine would be the first Asian American and the first woman of colour to serve in this role, breaking barriers and clearing the way for others to follow,” Chu added in a statement Wednesday.Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., ranking member on the finance committee, called Tai “an inspired choice” for the position.“Ms. Tai has the experience she needs to succeed as USTR, and her record of getting wins for American workers demonstrates she knows how to champion the values that matter to U.S. families,” Wyden said. “She worked closely with me and my staff to craft the strongest ever protections for American workers in a trade agreement, and pass them into law with bipartisan support.”He urged Senate Republicans to quickly confirm her.\n",

      "CONTENT : BEIJING - China’s government on Thursday slapped more taxes on wine from Australia, stepping up pressure in a bitter diplomatic conflict over the coronavirus, territorial disputes and other irritants.China, Australia’s biggest export market, already has blocked imports of its wine, barley, beef and other goods since the Australian government expressed support for a probe into the origin of the coronavirus pandemic that began in China last December.The Chinese Ministry of Commerce said an investigation begun in August concluded Australia improperly subsidizes wine exports, hurting Chinese producers. The ministry said importers will be required to pay a deposit of 6.3% to 6.4%, effective Friday, pending a final ruling.That is on top of taxes of more than 200% imposed earlier on Australian wine, which the country’s trade minister said would make it unsellable in China.China’s foreign ministry has demanded Australia take unspecified steps to repair relations.Beijing increasingly uses access to its populous market as leverage to extract concessions from its neighbours and increase its strategic influence.Chinese leaders were irked by Australia’s decision to pursue a mutual defence treaty with Japan, which Beijing sees as a strategic rival, and to join Asian governments and the United States in objecting to China’s claims to most of the South China Sea, one of the world’s busiest trade routes.___Chinese Ministry of Commerce: www.mofcom.gov.cn\n",

      "CONTENT : WASHINGTON - Seventy-five years after World War II ended, Congress is honouring thousands of Chinese Americans who served the United States in the war, earning citations for heroism — including the Medal of Honor — despite discrimination that included limits on numbers allowed in the U.S.Nearly 20,000 people of Chinese ancestry served in the U.S. military during World War II, including about 40 per cent who were not U.S. citizens due to laws such as the Chinese Exclusion Act. That law made it illegal for Chinese labourers to immigrate to America and limited the Chinese population in the U.S. for more than 60 years.Chinese Americans served in all major branches of the military, including the so-called Flying Tigers, the 14th Air Service that flew missions in the China-Burma-India Theater. For their service to the nation during the war, Chinese-American veterans were honoured at a Congressional Gold Medal ceremony Wednesday.“Despite coming from different backgrounds, Chinese-American service members fought alongside their fellow Americans with a shared love for their country,’’ said Rep. Mark Takano, D-Calif., chairman of the House Veterans Affairs Committee.Chinese Americans “flew bomber missions over Europe, served on our ships in the Pacific, stormed the beaches of Normandy and fought in the Battle of the Bulge and helped liberate Central Europe,’’ Takano said during an online ceremony Wednesday. The ceremony was originally scheduled in April but postponed because of the coronavirus pandemic.“With this honour, we are telling a more complete story of the people who fought for the United States during World War II and the personal and systemic challenges they faced.,’’ Takano said.Among those honoured posthumously Wednesday were former U.S. Sens. Hiram Fong and Daniel Akaka, both of Hawaii. Fong, a Republican, served in the Army Air Force, while Akaka, a Democrat, was in the Army Corps of Engineers, stationed in the Northern Mariana Islands.Army Capt. Francis B. Wai, who was awarded the Medal of Honor, the highest military award given by the United States, also was recognized as a Gold Medal recipient. He was killed while saving fellow soldiers during an attack in the Philippines.One of those honoured Wednesday was Elsie Chin Yuen Seetoo, whose nursing studies in Hong Kong were interrupted when the U.S. entered the war after the attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941.Born in California and now 102, she served as a nurse in China and India. “About that time, the U.S. Army also came through, desperately needing English-speaking nurses,” she told KHON-TV in Hawaii in an interview last month.Chin enlisted.“I was the only Chinese-American nurse stationed there back then. Sometimes a smallpox case that nobody wanted to handle happened. I would be the target for cases like that,” she said.She and other Chinese Americans “answered the call to duty when our country faced threats to our freedom,? Chin said in a videotaped presentation at Wednesday’s ceremony. ”We have waited a long time for this moment. I hope our perseverance and our commitment and hard work will further inspire our young people to serve this wonderful country.?\n",

      "CONTENT : Killaloe -- In an era of store closures in small towns, the expansion of a well-established business is a cause for celebration. Started by Alice Power in 1993, Grandma’s Pantry, the small health food store in Killaloe with the peace sign on the façade, has long served loyal customers who stock up on their healthy, often local and sometimes unique, product lines. Grandma’s Pantry offered ‘healthy and local’ long before healthy and local were marketing buzzwords. Lecithin, tofu, apple cider vinegar and exotic spices, which were standard ingredients in the back-to-the-lander’skitchen, weren’t available in nearby grocery stores. The shelves of Grandma’s Pantry carried products from Stephano’s Bakery near Killaloe, vitamins and medicines from St. Francis Herb Farm in nearby Brudenell, salad makings from Go-Greens in Brudenell, Algonquin Teas and Opeongo Mountain Soaps. More than a shopping destination, Grandma’s Pantry was a well-loved Killaloe spot where customers visited with friends around the bulletin board promoting events and workshops in the alternative community. On Saturday, the business took a big step forward with a major expansion just across the street into the large space once occupied by tractors and trucks where Harold Hartwig sold and fixed farm machinery. In more recent years it was the home of Killaloe Sports Plus. On the weekend it was unveiled to a large crowd of delighted onlookers as the new location for the store. Bright, spacious and inviting, it is the new home of Grandma’s Pantry. “I’m the third ‘Grandma,’,” Melissa Tremback said. Originally from New Brunswick, she and husband Brook Tremback of Killaloe bought the business in 2014 from Grandma number two, Irene Gunn (Omkaro). The Trembacks envisioned a large bright space which would allow expansion into other product lines and more room for the growing numbers of shoppers. “My husband Brook is the general manager for Zuracon Construction,” Ms. Tremback explained. “He had the resources to do the renovations. I had the ideas. I think we’re a good team.” Fifteen hundred square feet of high-ceilinged bright industrial style space now has well-spaced steel shelving, a wall of glass refrigerators and freezers, warm wooden counters at the check-out and polished concrete floors. The expansion of shelf space allows room for a bulk food section where customers can refill their containers of shampoo, laundry soap and household cleaners. Candles, salt lamps and the popular Opeongo Mountain Soaps are displayed near the long shelves of St. Francis Herb Farm products and other lines of vitamins, tinctures and health- oriented supplements. A popular and innovative touch is the self-serve Kombucha station with its draft style taps where customers can buy a refillable one litre bottle with a choice of two Kombucha flavours from Artizen Kombucha in Perth. Kombucha, an ancient fermented Chinese drink of tea, sugar and a yeast and bacteria culture, previously unknown outside of health food circles, has exploded into the mainstream as a slightly fermented, crisply refreshing alternative to sugary juices and soda drinks. Plans for expansion were well underway before COVID-19 hit in March but the pandemic brought a boost to the business as customers stocked up on bulk ingredients. “More and more customers were thinking local. Our flour orders were unbelievable,” she said. “We were so blessed that we were able to stay open through the lockdown.” The store relies heavily on organic and local where possible. “Seventy-five to eighty per cent of our products are organic and or local,” she said. “We source a lot of products from our local farmers and growers as well as the Ontario Natural Food Co-op. We carry local honey, breads, nutritional supplements, soaps and candles, and garden produce in season.” Local Production While the expansion of Grandma’s Pantry has been in the works for some time as those passing by in Killaloe watched the ongoing construction, it was not the only new venture for the entrepreneurial couple, and it is likely not the last. In January of 2020, the Trembacks purchased Engine House Coffee Roastery and The Mix Company. Both were Eganville-based businesses with a loyal customer base. The Mix Company, which has a full product line up of 60 gluten-free mixes for home cooks, has a dedicated manufacturing facility on the second floor of the newly-renovated building. The Mix Company has long been a wholesale supplier of gluten-free products to other shops in the Ottawa Valley. Engine House Coffee Roastery supplies 11 different coffees with fair trade and organic pedigrees. As well as supplying coffee for the store, the Trembacks have plans to showcase the coffee line in a coffee shop planned for the original store space across the street. “That’s our next project,” Ms. Tremback says. “We hope to serve soups and sandwiches as well as have a location for workshops and classes and other food and health-centred events.” She also has more plans, which include showcasing the railway station connection since the old train station was close by in the past and Engine House is a good link for now, but those plans are still several years away. For now, there is a lot of excitement and anticipation around the new Grandma’s Pantry with its expanded product line and much larger space. Five employees staff the store which is open seven days a week. “I love what I do,” Ms. Tremback said. “I’m social and I love interacting with the customers and I’ve gotten to know so many of them.” As well as in-store sales, Grandma’s Pantry is currently developing its own website with online shopping capacity. Their products are also available online through “Mrs. Grocery”. The shop has a presence on Facebook and Instagram and recently hosted a popular contest to name its new light roast coffee. As befits a community-oriented business, local tie-dye artist Ri Povey, whose son, Sage helped with the renovations on the new store, won the contest with her suggestion of Boxcar Brew.\n",

      "CONTENT : WASHINGTON - The Justice Department is investigating the finances of President-elect Joe Biden’s son, including scrutinizing some of his Chinese business dealings and other transactions, a person familiar with the matter told The Associated Press on Wednesday.The revelations put a renewed spotlight on questions about Hunter Biden’s financial history, which dogged his father’s successful White House campaign and were a frequent target of President Donald Trump and his allies. They also come at a politically delicate time for the president-elect, who is weighing his choice to lead an agency that is actively investigating his son.The tax investigation was launched in 2018, the year before the elder Biden announced his candidacy for president. Hunter Biden confirmed the existence of the investigation on Wednesday, saying he learned about it for the first time the previous day.“I take this matter very seriously but I am confident that a professional and objective review of these matters will demonstrate that I handled my affairs legally and appropriately, including with the benefit of professional tax advisors,” he said in a statement.It isn’t clear which entities or business dealings might be tied up in the probe, though the person with knowledge of the matter said at least some of focus was on his past work in China. Federal investigators served a round of subpoenas on Tuesday, including one for Hunter Biden, according to another person familiar with the investigation.Investigators did not reach out until recently because of Justice Department practice against taking overt investigative actions in the run-up to an election, one of the people said. The people familiar with the investigation insisted on anonymity to discuss an ongoing probe.Hunter Biden has a history of international affairs and business dealings in a number of countries. Trump and his allies have accused him of profiting off his political connections, and have also raised unsubstantiated charges of corruption related to his work in Ukraine at the time his father was vice-president and leading the Obama administration’s dealings with the Eastern European nation.Late Wednesday, Trump tweeted a quote from New York Post columnist Miranda Devine claiming, “10% of voters would have changed their vote if they knew about Hunter Biden.”Biden is actively assembling his Cabinet, but is yet to name a nominee to lead the Justice Department. That person could ultimately have oversight of the investigation into the new president’s son if it is still ongoing when Biden is sworn in on Jan. 20.The transition team said in a statement, “President-elect Biden is deeply proud of his son, who has fought through difficult challenges, including the vicious personal attacks of recent months, only to emerge stronger.”The revelations could also add weight to Trump’s broad accusations that Biden was weak on China. Trump took a tough line on China during the campaign as he tried to deflect blame for the coronavirus. Biden has rejected the characterization that he was weak and said that, unlike Trump, he would rebuild global coalitions to check China’s power.A New Yorker profile on Hunter Biden last year detailed some of his business work in China, including how he accompanied his father on a 2013 trip to Beijing, where he met with a business associate. He also acknowledged having received a diamond from a Chinese energy tycoon interested in liquified natural gas projects.He downplayed the idea that the gift could have been intended to affect his father’s policy. He told the magazine he gave the diamond to an associate.“What would they be bribing me for? My dad wasn’t in office,” he said.Hunter Biden has been caught up in controversies before. While his father was vice-president, Hunter joined the Naval Reserve and was discharged after testing positive for cocaine in his system, later revealing a yearslong struggle with addiction.He also joined the board of Ukrainian energy company Burisma in 2014, sparking concerns about the perceptions of a conflict of interest given the elder Biden was deeply involved in U.S. policy toward Ukraine. An investigation by the Republican-led Senate did not identify any policies that were directly affected by Hunter Biden’s work.In the weeks before the election, Trump supporters used the existence of a laptop they said was connected to Hunter Biden — and the emergence of someone who maintains he had business discussions with him — to raise questions about Joe Biden’s knowledge of his son’s activities in Ukraine and China. The president-elect has said he did not discuss his son’s international business dealings with him and has denied having ever taken money from a foreign country.The laptop surfaced publicly in October when The New York Post reported on emails that it said had come from Hunter Biden’s laptop and that it said it received from Rudy Giuliani, Trump’s personal lawyer.A third person familiar with the matter said the tax investigation does not have anything to do with the laptop.In a CNN interview last week, President-elect Biden addressed the business dealings of his son Hunter and his brothers, pledging that they would avoid any perceived conflicts of interest during his time in office.“My son, my family will not be involved in any business, any enterprise that is in conflict with or appears to be in conflict, where there’s appropriate distance from the presidency and government,” Biden said.___Lemire reported from Wilmington, Del.

      "CONTENT : LONDON - Britain’s Home Secretary met with exiled Hong Kong pro-democracy activist Nathan Law Wednesday to discuss the situation in the Chinese territory as well as new British immigration policies intended to help people wishing to leave the city amid concerns about Beijing’s tightening grip.Priti Patel was the first British Cabinet minister to meet with Law, who fled his hometown before a warrant for his arrest was issued by Beijing.“The United Kingdom will stand by the people of Hong Kong and keep our promise to protect and uphold their freedoms,” Patel said in a statement after the meeting.Britain announced in July that it would offer a special route to citizenship for up to 3 million Hong Kongers eligible for the British National Overseas passport. Authorities stressed that Britain would uphold its historic duty to the former British colony after Beijing imposed a sweeping new national security law in the city.Activists, former lawmakers and a media tycoon have been arrested under the law, which critics say is the boldest move yet by Beijing to crack down on the civil liberties promised to Hong Kong when it returned to Chinese rule in 1997.People from Hong Kong currently can come to the U.K. for six months without a visa. Under the new policy, all those eligible for the BNO passport will have the right to live and work in the country for five years.Beijing has criticized the U.K.’s offer and complained of British interference in its domestic affairs.Law said the policy “means a lot to Hong Kong people” because it “helps them to live free from political persecution.”Also at the meeting was Beatrice Li, sister of activist Andy Li, who was among 12 people detained in China since August after attempting to flee to Taiwan.“We thank the Home Secretary, and hope that the U.K. will do more in the face of the total destruction of our way of life,” she said.\n",

      "CONTENT : WASHINGTON - Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Wednesday accused U.S. universities of caving to Chinese pressure to blunt or bar criticism of the Chinese Communist Party. The attack, which included identifying two university administrators by name, comes as the Trump administration seeks to cement its anti-China policies before leaving office in January.Pompeo took aim at universities across the U.S., claiming they refused to address the Trump administration’s concerns about China’s attempts to influence students and academics. He specifically called out the president of MIT, alleging he refused to host Pompeo’s speech, and a senior official at the University of Washington over a case involving a Chinese student.Both universities swiftly and emphatically denied the charges.Pompeo defended the Trump administration’s tough stance on China in remarks at the Georgia Institute of Technology. The speech came less than a month before Georgia’s two critical run-off races that will determine control of the Senate.“Americans must know how the CCP is poisoning the well of our higher education for its own ends, and how those actions degrade our freedoms and our national security. If we don’t educate ourselves, we’ll get schooled by Beijing,” he said. “They know that left-leaning college campuses are rife with anti-Americanism, and present easy target audiences for their anti-American messaging.“Pompeo has been a champion of the administration’s hardline stance on Chinese policies in Taiwan, Tibet, Hong Kong, the western region of Xinjiang and the South China Sea, and he has made similar pronouncements before. He has imposed multiple layers of sanctions on Chinese officials; restricted visas for Chinese diplomats, journalists and academics; and lobbied other countries to reject Chinese high-tech communications.But his comments on Wednesday were striking in that he named the two American university officials as complicit in alleged Chinese malfeasance.Pompeo said he had initially wanted to give his Georgia Tech speech at MIT, but the president of the renowned scientific institution, Rafael Reif, had turned him down for fear of offending Beijing.“MIT wasn’t interested in having me give this speech on their campus,“ Pompeo said. “President Rafael Reif implied that my arguments might insult their ethnic Chinese students and professors.”MIT spokeswoman Kimberly Allen rejected Pompeo’s assertion, saying the university declined to host the speech because of coronavirus restrictions. She said several other prospective high-level events had also been rejected.Reif “had real concerns that a high-level visit might not only draw crowds but suggest to students that MIT was not taking its own rules seriously,” she said. “President Reif verbally conveyed MIT’s decision — based on a commitment to the health of our students and our surrounding community — with his deep regrets.”Pompeo also criticized Sarah Castro, the University of Washington’s director of federal relations, for allegedly refusing to help Vera Zhou, a student of Chinese origin who had been detained in China in 2017, so as not to jeopardize a “multimillion-dollar deal” between the university and Beijing.“Now, thank God, Vera was eventually released, and returned to the U.S,” Pompeo said of the student. “But no thanks to the University of Washington, and no thanks to its deal with China.”A statement from university spokesman Victor Balta called Pompeo’s remarks a “shameful” and “outrageous” deflection by an administration that took “no effective action” on behalf of Zhou.“That the Secretary of State would think a university has more power in this situation than the United States government is bizarre,” he said. “That he would single out a staff member by name is unbecoming of the office and his statement is flatly wrong.”The university has no record of contact from the State Department regarding any negotiation with China, Balta said, and officials don’t know what “multimillion-dollar deal” Pompeo was referencing. He added that, as of this quarter, Zhou is again enrolled at the university.___Collin Binkley in Boston contributed.\n",

      "CONTENT : Local shoppers visiting downtown Haliburton stores could secure themselves a Christmas windfall this festive season by participating in the BIA’s annual Buy In and Win contest. The annual event is shifting gears this year. Ordinarily, the winner, and one guest, would be sent off on an all-inclusive Caribbean vacation, but the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic meant contest organizers had to go back to the drawing board and think up a whole new prize this time around. “This year, participants will have a chance to win $1,500 in gift certificates that can be used at any BIA business,” said Angelica Ingram, BIA administrator. “It’s kind of a neat transition, in my opinion. This is a more accessible prize for most people, and is something that more people can be excited about, because not everyone can travel, and not everyone likes to travel.” To be entered, all you have to do is visit any participating Haliburton BIA store. While the idea behind the event, Ingram says, is to help support the local business community, participants do not have to make a purchase to fill out and submit a ballot. All entrants must be 19 years of age or older. The contest launched on Nov. 20 and will run until Dec. 23. According to Ingram, there is no limit on the number of ballots a single resident can submit. “People can fill out as many ballots as they want. They can submit 100 times if they visit 100 different places, or go to the same place 100 times,” Ingram said. There are more than 120 different businesses within the Haliburton BIA borders, featuring both big-name box stores, and long-tenured family businesses. Ingram said that people are often shocked when they learn there are so many businesses operating in the downtown core. “We really do have more businesses here than people think. When I tell people the number, they can’t believe it. They don’t realize there are that many businesses in Haliburton,” Ingram said. “The BIA area goes all the way from the street lights by (Haliburton Highlands Secondary School), all the way up Highland St. past the LCBA, then across to the arena on the east side and (Win Yeung) Chinese restaurant to the west.” She added, “There are a lot of hidden businesses that are run out of people’s homes, or are maybe not right on the main street, but are still valuable members of the local business community.” In recent years, the BIA has worked alongside its member businesses to extend shopping hours and organize special one-night events in the lead up to Christmas. Due to the pandemic, many individuals felt it wouldn’t be wise encouraging so many people to congregate in one area at a specific time, so all the proverbial eggs were pushed into the Buy In and Win basket. Given the struggles many local businesses have endured this year, Ingram hopes area residents will rally behind their favourite stores and support them during their time of need. “It’s been a hard year for a lot of small businesses. Dealing with the shutdown in the spring, and a lot of quiet months since then. A lot of people are very cautious not to leave their homes, and are doing as minimal amount of shopping as they can right now. There have been a lot of abrupt changes to shopping practices everywhere, and Haliburton is no exception,” Ingram said. “If you’re a big box store and you have a couple of bad months, you’re probably going to weather it just fine and come out the other end. For a small mon and pop shop, that’s not always the case. If they have a few employees, and a couple of months of very low sales, that can make or break you. For somewhere like Haliburton, that could be one whole family’s livelihood good, so I think it’s important to keep that in mind when shopping locally,” she continued. “These businesses have supported the community, a lot of them over a number of years. Now it’s our turn to help support them as much as possible,” Ingram finished. The draw to determine the winner of this year’s Buy In and Win event will take place at noon on Dec. 23, live on the air on 93.5 Moose FM. \n",

      "CONTENT : WASHINGTON - The Trump administration on Tuesday escalated steps to rein in Iran’s activities in the Middle East and North Korea’s efforts to evade international sanctions with new penalties against both nations and proxies.As it winds down its term, the administration announced that it had imposed sanctions on Iran’s envoy to Yemen’s Houthi rebels, Hasan Irlu, and Al-Mustafa International University for recruiting fighters for the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps to foment instability in Yemen and in Syria.In a separate statement, the Treasury Department said it also was imposing sanctions on six Chinese and Vietnamese companies and four ships for selling and transporting North Korean coal in violation of U.N. sanctions.The moves come as the administration seeks to step up pressure on governments it opposes in various parts of the world before President-elect Joe Biden takes office in January.The penalties freeze any assets the targets may already have in or that enter U.S. jurisdictions and bar Americans from doing business with them. Several of those identified for the North Korean violations are already subject to U.S. sanctions. The measures may also subject third country companies and individuals to U.S. sanctions if they are found to be engaging in transactions with them.\n",

      "CONTENT : RABAT, Morocco - Morocco is gearing up for an ambitious COVID-19 vaccination program, aiming to vaccinate 80% of its adults in an operation starting this month that’s relying initially on a Chinese vaccine that has not yet completed advanced trials to prove it is safe and effective.The first injections could come within days, a Health Ministry official told The Associated Press. Facing a public skeptical about the vaccines’ safety and effectiveness, medical experts and health officials have appeared on television in recent weeks to promote the COVID-19 vaccines and encourage Moroccans to get immunized.While Britain began its vaccination program Tuesday with the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and the U.S. and European Union are racing to approve a series of Western-made vaccines, other governments are looking to use vaccines from China and Russia.The World Health Organization has said new vaccines should first be tested in tens of thousands of people to prove they work and don’t cause worrisome side effects before being rolled out broadly. But the U.N. health agency also says it’s is up to individual countries to decide whether there is an urgent domestic need to use a vaccine shot, even without such data.Morocco is battling a resurgence in virus infections, with the number of recorded deaths from the virus surpassing 6,000. The North African kingdom is pinning its hopes on two vaccine candidates, one developed by China’s Sinopharm and the other by Britain’s Oxford University and AstraZeneca.The Sinopharm vaccine has been approved for emergency use in a few countries and the company is still conducting late-stage clinical trials in 10 countries. The AstraZeneca vaccine is still in advanced trials in countries including Britain and the U.S. and hasn’t been approved yet.Morocco’s government seeks to vaccinate 80% of its adults, or 25 million people, as soon as the vaccines are approved by domestic regulators. Priority will go to medical staff and other front-line workers, as well as the elderly.It will start with the Sinopharm vaccine, which was tested on 600 Moroccans as part of clinical trials this autumn. Morocco has ordered 10 million doses of the vaccine.The initial deliveries will come from China, but Morocco also plans to produce the vaccine locally, Abdelhakim Yahyan, a senior official at the Ministry of Health, told the state-owned news agency MAP.Health Minister Khalid Ait Taleb said Morocco is seeking vaccines from several sources because COVID vaccines are a scarce commodity and a single manufacturer’s production capacity is too limited to meet the needs of the whole world.In the Moroccan trial of the Sinopharm vaccine, carried out in Casablanca and the capital Rabat from August through November, healthy volunteers received two separate doses of the vaccine. In the advanced trial, volunteers either received the vaccine or a placebo. According to the health minister, early results have proven the vaccine to be “safe and effective” with no severe side effects reported.However, some Moroccans have taken to social media to question the safety of the vaccine, with some noting that China was the original epicenter of the pandemic or questioning how effective it will be.Sinopharm’s shot relies on a tested technology, using a killed virus to deliver the vaccine, similar to how polio immunizations are made. Leading Western competitors, like the vaccine made by Oxford and AstraZeneca, use newer, less-proven technology to target the coronavirus’ spike protein.In China, the state-owned Sinopharm subsidiary CNBG has given the vaccine to 350,000 people outside its clinical trials, a top CNBG executive has said.Critics in Morocco have also expressed concerns that citizens might be forced to take the vaccine, but the health minister insisted that COVID-19 vaccinations will not be mandatory and will be free.Prime Minister Saad-Eddine El Othmani has sought to reassure the vaccine-hesitant about the robustness of the country’s regulatory process for vaccine approval, saying that no corners have been cut in making sure the Chinese vaccine is safe to administer.Morocco’s mass immunization operation will include 2,888 vaccination stations and the deployment of mobile units to vaccinate people at factories, offices, campuses and prisons. The health ministry said it would mobilize over 12,000 health professionals as well as the military to ensure rapid distribution.The vaccine will be available in a first phase to those at highest risk of contracting the virus: health professionals, security personnel, essential workers at vital sectors and people suffering from chronic diseases.No exact date has been set for the rollout, but the health minister said “we are doing our best to get it started in mid-December.”Separately, Morocco is expected to be among 92 low- and middle-income countries supported by Covax, an international effort to ensure that vaccine supplies reach developing countries, if the group meets its funding targets, according to the World Health Organization.___AP Medical Writer Maria Cheng contributed from London.___Follow AP’s coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/coronavirus-pandemic and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak \n",

      "CONTENT : Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam says social distancing measures will be tightened as cases of the coronavirus continue to surge, with a ban on nighttime dining and more businesses ordered to close.Lam said at a regular news conference Tuesday that there will be a ban on dine-in services at restaurants after 6 p.m., and venues such as massage parlours, beauty salons and gyms will be closed temporarily. She did not specify when the measures will take effect.“We all need to be mentally prepared about more measures to be rolled out,” Lam said, adding that there was “no choice” given the current virus situation in the city.Hong Kong is grappling with the latest surge of coronavirus infections, with nearly 1,200 new cases in the last two weeks after a three-month lull.Many of the cases in the recent surge have been linked to outbreaks in dance studios across the city, with Hong Kong ordering those who have visited stipulated venues to undergo mandatory testing. Clusters have also been found at a department store, a public housing estate and construction sites in the city.Hong Kong has reported a total of 6,976 cases, including 112 deaths.In other developments in the region:— South Korea says it plans to secure around 84 million doses of coronavirus vaccines for a mass immunization program that officials hope will allow the country to restore some level of normalcy by mid-to-late 2021. Health Minister Park Neung-hoo said Tuesday that the doses would cover 44 million people in a population of about 51 million. The shots will be delivered first to medical professionals, essential workers and people most at risk from COVID-19, including senior citizens and residents at long-term care facilities, starting possibly within the first half of next year, although officials didn’t provide a specific timetable. While the vaccines will begin to arrive in South Korea in February or March, Park said officials will take a cautious approach in administrating them and could spend two or three months reviewing the vaccination results of other countries and evaluating safety risks. Still, the country expects to vaccinate half its population at some point “not too late” in 2021, Park said.— Authorities have ordered mass coronavirus testing and locked down some locations in the southwestern Chinese city of Chengdu following the detection of two new virus cases there. Chengdu health officials identified the cases as a 69-year-old woman, who’s condition is listed as serious, and her 71-year-old husband, who has yet to show symptoms. Officials at a Monday night news conference said they are still investigating the source of the infection in Sichuan province’s capital and largest city, which has been relatively unscathed by the pandemic. Five locations in Chengdu’s Ludu district have been sealed off, including a hospital, a school and a wholesale market, and more than 21,000 people had been tested as of Monday evening, the government said.— Australia says it will extend its ban on international cruise ships and on Australians leaving the country except under exceptional circumstances for another three months until March. The extension means the human biosecurity emergency declaration will last for at least a year despite COVID-19 cases declining in the nation. Australia has imposed some of the most severe border restrictions in the world since the pandemic began, requiring most of its citizens and permanent residents to apply for a permit and prove exceptional circumstances if they need to leave the country. Health Minister Greg Hunt said Tuesday that the departure ban was “very hard for Australians.” Australia is a nation of 26 million people. Latest government figures showed there were only 1,618 active COVID-19 cases, with 30 patients in hospitals. In all states but the former hot spot Victoria, most of the infections were acquired overseas rather than from community transmission within Australia.— Three coronavirus vaccine developers -- AstraZeneca, Pfizer Inc. and Bharat Biotech -- have applied for emergency approval for their use in India, health officials said Tuesday. Serum Institute of India, which is the world’s largest vaccine manufacturer and is licensed to make the Oxford University -AstraZeneca vaccine in India, has applied for an emergency use license based on phase-three trials in India and other countries, the officials said at a news conference. The Indian company Bharat Biotech has applied for a license for its experimental inactivated virus vaccine without completing phase-three trials. According to Indian rules for accelerated approval of vaccines, a company can be granted a license if regulators are “satisfied with the risk-benefit ratio,” said Balram Bharagava, head of the Indian Council of Medical Research. Pfizer has applied for permission to import its experimental mRNA vaccine for sale and distribution without clinical trials in India, the officials said. The company said in a statement that it would supply the vaccine “only through government contracts based on agreements with respective government authorities” after approval. This vaccine needs to be stored at very cold temperatures, which India’s existing infrastructure is unlikely to be able to provide.___Follow AP’s coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/coronavirus-pandemic and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak \n",

On Saturday night, police in Southern California arrested nearly 160 people, many of them not wearing masks, at a house party in Palmdale that was held without the homeowner's knowledge.9:50 p.m.: Marc Garneau Collegiate Institute will be closed to students and staff as of Wednesday, as advised by Toronto Public Health, Toronto District School Board said in a tweet on Tuesday.This is the third TDSB school to declare a COVID-19 outbreak and shut down.According to the TDSB COVID-19 advisory, 14 new student cases were confirmed at Marc Garneau CI, as of Tuesday at 8:30 p.m. No staff cases have been reported.Read the full story from Zena Salem here. 9:35 p.m.: Florida's Department of Health on Tuesday confirmed 7,985 additional cases of COVID-19, bringing the state's known total to 1,073,770. Also, 96 new resident deaths were announced, bringing the statewide resident toll to 19,378.Two new non-resident deaths were also announced, bringing the non-resident toll to 249.Florida's total case count is the third highest in the country, after California and Texas, according to The New York Times database of U.S. cases.9:04 p.m.: The federal government says the largest mass immunization effort in Canadian history could begin as early as next week. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says Ottawa expects to receive up to 249,000 doses of the COVID-19 vaccine developed by pharmaceutical giant Pfizer and German partner BioNTech. Its approval is said to be imminent. The second vaccine in line for approval in Canada is from Moderna. The Canadian military will have a role to play in vaccine distribution. Various provinces have started spelling out their plans as well. Click here to see what they’ve said so far.8:53 p.m.: British Columbia has recorded 566 new cases of COVID-19, which the provincial health officer and health minister say is the \"start of encouraging trends\" in the progression of the virus.However, Dr. Bonnie Henry and Adrian Dix say the number of new cases and hospitalizations due to serious illness are still high, requiring health orders and restrictions to stay in place.They say 352 people with the illness are being treated in hospital, with 74 of them in intensive care.Sixteen more people have died, for a total of 543 fatalities in the province.Premier John Horgan says on Twitter that about 4,000 high-risk people in B.C. will be immunized by the end of next week.Henry is set to provide details of B.C.'s vaccine rollout plan on Wednesday.8:45 p.m.: Canada’s top public health officials said Tuesday that the most vulnerable long-term-care residents, those who are not mobile, might not be first to get inoculated despite topping the priority list. Only those who can get to the initial 14 centralized distribution sites at hospitals identified by provinces will get early doses.Most Canadians still face waiting up to six months — according to a timeline the prime minister offered last week — before a vaccine will be widely available, and that’s “optimistic” according to public health officials.And provinces have still uncertain vaccine rollout plans, with details quickly evolving.Read the full story by reporter Tonda MacCharles here: Vaccines will be here soon. But health officials warn it will be a long time before it’s safe to relax COVID-19 controls8:26 p.m.: The influential sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un lambasted South Korea's foreign minister for questioning the North’s claim to be coronavirus free, warning Wednesday of potential consequences for the comments.South Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha said over the weekend that it’s hard to believe North Korea’s claim that there has been no virus outbreak on its soil. She added that the North has been unresponsive to South Korea’s offer for co-operation to jointly tackle the pandemic.The North Korean leader's sister, Kim Yo Jong, responded in a statement carried by state media.“It can be seen from the reckless remarks made by her without any consideration of the consequences that she is too eager to further chill the frozen relations between North and South Korea,” she said.7:23 p.m.: India’s Health Ministry has announced that some COVID-19 vaccines are likely to receive licenses in the next few weeks and outlined an initial plan to immunize 300 million people.Health officials said Tuesday that three vaccine companies have applied for early approval for emergency use in India: Serum Institute of India, which has been licensed to manufacture the AstraZeneca vaccine, Pfizer Inc., and Indian manufacturer Bharat Biotech.“Some of them may get licensed in the next few weeks,” federal Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan said.India says its initial immunization plan revolves around three priority groups: 10 million health care workers, 20 million front-line workers such as the police and military, and 270 million other people either above age 50 or who have diseases that make them more vulnerable to COVID-19's effects.7:08 p.m.: For weeks, Alberta Premier Jason Kenney has preached personal responsibility as COVID-19 cases in his province have climbed.On Tuesday, it was a question about whether he would take responsibility — for Alberta’s pandemic situation — that drew his ire.“That sounds a lot more like an NDP speech than a media question,” Kenney said, speaking to Sammy Hudes, a reporter from the Calgary Herald. “I reject the entire premise of your question.”The question, about whether Kenney would take ownership of an approach that seems not to have worked from a health perspective, came at the tail end of an announcement by the premier of new public health measures in a province that has long-resisted them. It prompted an irritated-looking Kenney to recount his early calls to close the borders, and provide the free masks through fast-food drive-thus.His approach has been “balanced,” Kenney said, at a time when “folks ... are doing drive-by smears on Alberta.”Click here to read more from the Star’s Alex Boyd.6:35 p.m.: Reporters Jennifer Yang and Kate Allen join “This Matters” to discuss what the cases reveal about COVID spread in Toronto, why lockdowns are a “blunt instrument” of containment and why some health experts argue paid sick leave is key to solving the problem.Listen to this episode and more at “This Matters” or subscribe at Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Google Podcasts or wherever you listen to your favourite podcasts.See more here: Why the second wave is worse for BIPOC, low-income people again6:30 p.m.: A senior official with the Saskatchewan Health Authority says the province's health-care system won't be able to cope if the recent growth in COVID-19 cases continues.Dr. Julie Kryzanowski's presentation to more than 100 physicians at a virtual town hall last week has been posted online.She told the town hall that in the last week officials had recorded exponential growth in infections, outbreaks, hospitalizations and deaths.\"We do know that with this rate of growth it's not sustainable for our health system and continues to stress our capacity,\" doctors heard, hours after the health authority announced it was diverting up to 60 staff to respond to the surge.5:39 p.m.: North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper unveiled a modified stay-at-home order on Tuesday that requires the state’s roughly 10.5 million residents to remain off the streets between 10 p.m. and 5 a.m.The executive order set to take effect on Friday orders bars, restaurants, entertainment venues and personal care businesses closed by 10 p.m., though grocery chains and some retailers that sell groceries will be allowed to operate within the seven-hour window.On-site alcohol sales at bars must end by 9 p.m.Travel to and from work between 10 p.m. and 5 a.m. is still permitted, as is travel to get food, gas, medical care or social services.Cooper hinted at further restrictions if spread does not slow.The order will remain in effect until Jan. 8.5:21 p.m.: Canada's chief public health officer says the first doses of Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine are likely to be given only to people who can physically be at one of the 14 delivery sites identified by provincial governments for the first arrivals of the vaccine.Dr. Theresa Tam said at a briefing Tuesday that it is a \"rapidly evolving situation\" but acknowledged this will make it difficult to get long-term care residents vaccinated first.\"It's true you cannot move residents very easily from a long-term care centre to a vaccine site,\" she said. \"That's just the reality.\"It is not clear how this jibes with some provincial plans, including in Quebec, where the health minister said Monday the government intends to ship its first vaccine doses to two long-term care homes.The Pfizer vaccine, being produced in partnership with Germany's BioNTech, is in the final stages of review by Health Canada, which is expected to issue a decision this week. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Monday if the approval comes as expected, Canada will receive the first doses next week, and up to 249,000 doses by the end of the month.5:20 p.m.: Ontario will give people who complete their COVID-19 shots proof of vaccination in case they need it to travel, to work or to go to the movies, Health Minister Christine Elliott says.With the first vaccine shipment expected this month, Elliott promised a new public communications campaign to educate people on all aspects of the vaccinations, including why it’s important to get them and potential side effects.There will also be a system to keep track of who gets the first primer shot to make sure they return for the booster a few weeks later.While the vaccine will be voluntary, Elliott said Ontarians should be aware it may become a requirement for travel on airplanes, employment and other activities where there is close contact with others, given the highly contagious nature of the virus.Read the full story by Toronto Star reporter Rob Ferguson here: Had your COVID-19 vaccine? Ontario will give you a card to prove it5:10 p.m.: There is extremely high public awareness of the upcoming COVID-19 vaccines, but governments must do more to explain the medications, a new poll suggests.The Campaign Research survey for the Toronto Star found 92 per cent of Ontarians knew about at least one of the vaccines.Four-fifths — 82 per cent — had heard of both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines while eight per cent had just heard about Pfizer’s and two per cent about Moderna’s with just seven per cent not knowing about either.“Awareness is high. Almost everybody is tuned in to the fact the vaccines are coming,” Campaign Research principal Nick Kouvalis said Tuesday.Campaign Research polled 1,001 people across Ontario from last Tuesday through Thursday using Maru/Blue’s online panel.It is an opt-in poll, but for comparison purposes, a random sample of this size would have a margin of error of plus or minus three percentage points, 19 times out of 20.Read the full story here by the Toronto Star’s Queen’s Park Bureau Chief Robert Benzie: Vaccination awareness is high but governments have some explaining to do, poll finds5:05 p.m.: As Quebec deals with rising COVID-19 cases and increased pressure on its health-care system, Premier François Legault said Tuesday his government isn't ruling out implementing further restrictions.Legault told reporters the province is continuing to discuss the situation daily with public health officials, but no firm decisions have been made on stronger lockdown measures.\"We follow the situation every day,\" Legault said. \"We don't exclude any additional measures, but I don't want to speculate on what those measures could be.\"The province reported 1,564 new COVID-19 cases and 36 additional deaths linked to the novel coronavirus Tuesday. A dozen of those deaths occurred in the past 24 hours while 22 occurred in the first six days of December, according to the province's Health Department.Hospitalizations increased by 17 to reach 835, with nine more patients in intensive care for a total of 114. There are currently 14,853 active COVID-19 cases in the province.4:56 p.m.: The Saskatchewan government has delayed the release of its vaccination distribution program because of a power outage.Premier Scott Moe and health officials were set to detail how and when residents could start getting inoculated against COVID-19.Moe has said his province is ready to receive Pfizer's vaccine, pending approval from Health Canada.He has said among the first to be vaccinated would be health workers and residents living in long-term care.4:50 p.m.: Nova Scotia unveiled a broad outline of its COVID-19 vaccine plan Tuesday, as the number of new cases from an ongoing outbreak remained in the single digits.Dr. Robert Strang, chief medical officer of health, said Nova Scotia would receive 1,950 doses of Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine for an initial test run beginning next Tuesday.\"We will be using these first almost 2,000 doses to immunize front-line acute care health-care workers in the central zone (Halifax) who are most directly involved in the COVID response,\" Strang told reporters at a briefing in Halifax.He said that included people who work with patients in intensive care units and emergency rooms, hospital COVID units and long-term care regional care units.2:23 p.m.: Manitoba health officials are reporting 245 new COVID-19 cases and 13 additional deaths.The five-day test positivity rate remains high at 13 per cent.Chief public health officer Dr. Brent Roussin says restrictions on public gatherings and many business activities must continue.2:10 p.m.: The Manitoba government is loosening some of its COVID-19 restrictions on public gatherings and businesses.Starting Saturday, drive-in services at churches and other venues will be allowed, as long as people attend only with members of their household and remain in their vehicles.A Winnipeg church filed a Charter of Rights and Freedoms challenge against the ban on drive-in services last week, and lost a bid for a temporary lifting of the rule until the case could be heard.The province is adding thrift stores and acupuncture services to the list of essential businesses that can operate.It has also added school supplies and seasonal holiday decorations to essential goods that can be sold in-store instead of through curbside pickup or online.2:03 p.m.: Nova Scotia is reporting seven new cases of COVID-19 today, and now has 78 active cases.Health officials say two cases are in the western health zone and are close contacts of previously reported cases, while one is in the northern zone and is related to travel outside of Atlantic Canada.Four cases are in the central zone, which includes Halifax — two are close contacts of previously reported cases, one is connected to Shannon Park Elementary School in Dartmouth and one is under investigation.No one is currently in hospital.1:52 p.m.: Public health officials in New Brunswick are reporting five new cases of COVID-19 Tuesday.Four of the cases are close contacts of previously confirmed cases and are self-isolating.They involve a person in their 30s in the Saint John zone, two people under 19 in the Fredericton area and a person in their 40s in the Fredericton area.The fifth case is a person in their 70s in the Fredericton zone related to international travel and is self-isolating.1:50 a.m. The NFL says there were 18 new confirmed positive COVID-19 tests among players and 27 among other personnel in the latest round of testing, which concluded Saturday.The weeklong program included 16,475 tests administered to 2,427 players and 25,194 given to 4,585 team personnel.Since testing began in August, 173 players and 297 other personnel have been confirmed positive cases out of more than 757,000 tests given.1:45 p.m.: Premier Jason Kenney is to speak to Alberta’s COVID-19 situation later Tuesday following his chief medical officer of health saying that recent restrictions to contain the skyrocketing spread of the novel coronavirus are failing.The mayors of the two largest cities have already warned that they will use whatever emergency powers they have to bring in their own added measures if the province fails to act.Kenney introduced somewhat tighter public-health orders two weeks ago to try to rein in the number of COVID-19 cases, but kept stores, waterparks, bars, casinos and restaurants open.He did ban extended gatherings in private homes.On Monday, Dr. Deena Hinshaw said the measures have stopped the numbers from getting worse, but have failed to bend the curve downward, so tougher restrictions are needed.Alberta has more than 20,000 active cases with 609 people in hospital — 108 of them receiving intensive care — and daily death counts in the double digits for much of the last week.1:40 p.m.: The Manitoba government is loosening some of its COVID-19 restrictions on public gatherings and businesses.Starting Saturday, drive-in services at churches and other venues will be allowed, as long as people attend only with members of their household and remain in their vehicles.A Winnipeg church filed a Charter of Rights and Freedoms challenge against the ban on drive-in services last week, and lost a bid for a temporary lifting of the rule until the case could be heard.The province is also adding thrift stores and acupuncture services to the list of essential businesses that can operate.It has also added school supplies and seasonal holiday decorations to essential goods that can be sold in-store instead of through curbside pickup or online.Other rules, including a five-person limit on public gatherings and restrictions on visitors in private homes, remain in place.Chief public health officer Dr. Brent Roussin says Manitoba's ongoing high number of daily COVID-19 cases and their effect on the health- care system require that restrictions continue.The new rules are to last until early January — Roussin says an exact date has not yet been set.1:33 p.m.: Yukon is reporting a new case of COVID-19 and it's the only active case outside Whitehorse.Chief public health officer Dr. Brendan Hanley says the infection is related to a Whitehorse case and there is no risk to the public.Hanley also extended the territory's state of emergency for another 90 days, allowing ministerial orders to continue that support the health, safety and economic well-being of Yukoners.The latest order issued says all Yukon residents visiting bars and restaurants in the territory must sign in with their name and contact information to help with contact tracing.Premier Sandy Silver also says officials are working on vaccine storage and distribution.Silver says he is scheduled to speak with the prime minister later this week for more details on Yukon's vaccination plan.There are 10 active cases of COVID-19 in Yukon.1:30 p.m.: Public health officials have declared a COVID-19 outbreak linked to a church in Kingston, Ont.The Kingston, Frontenac and Lennox and Addington Public Health unit says there are nine cases directly linked to Third Day Worship Centre.Dr. Kieran Moore, the health unit’s medical officer, says there are 15 additional cases involving close contacts of the initial cases.The health unit says it continues to investigate the outbreak and is taking steps to prevent further transmission.It says it has contacted members of the church deemed high risk, and those exposed are isolating at home.The church says in a statement that it has moved to online services until further notice.1:17 p.m.: There is one new case of COVID-19 in Newfoundland and Labrador and officials say the infection is related to travel.The patient is a man in his 50s who returned to the province from work in the Northwest Territories.Meanwhile, health officials are still trying to chase down the source of an infection announced over the weekend.The case affects a person in the central region of the province, where the town of Harbour Breton has been on partial lockdown since Sunday.1:15 p.m. Health officials on Prince Edward Island say they are ready to administer the COVID-19 vaccine when the first shipment of the vaccine arrives next week.Chief medical officer of health Dr. Heather Morrison says — pending approval by Health Canada — the province will begin to administer the Pfizer vaccine to priority groups, including residents and staff of long-term care homes, health-care workers and adults in Indigenous communities.Morrison says she expects to receive 1,950 doses in the first shipment, and the clinic will have to be held at the storage location because the Pfizer vaccine must be kept frozen.She says they’ll be able to start administering the doses the day after the vaccine arrives.Morrison says shipments of the Moderna vaccine — which is easier to transport across the province — should arrive in a few weeks.There were no new cases of COVID-19 in Prince Edward Island reported Tuesday, and there are currently 13 active cases in the province.12:53 p.m. The Canadian junior hockey team says it will resume its selection camp on Tuesday after completing a 14-day quarantine.The camp was suspended on Nov. 26 after two players and one non-core staff member tested positive for COVID-19.The world junior hockey championship is scheduled to start on Dec. 25.The nine other international teams are scheduled to arrive by charter flight Dec. 13. Exhibition games are planned for Dec. 20-23.Hockey Canada’s vice-president of events, Dean McIntosh, insists stringent protocols and testing required for international players to enter Edmonton’s “bubble” will make the world junior championship safe to proceed.12:45 p.m.: The first doses of Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine will only be given to patients at one of the 14 sites where the doses are initially being delivered.Dr. Theresa Tam, Canada’s chief public health officer, says the plan is to move the doses as little as possible.She acknowledged that will make it more difficult to vaccinate residents of long-term care homes, who cannot easily be moved to other sites.Pfizer’s vaccine against the virus that causes COVID-19 has to be stored at extraordinarily cold temperatures with specialized boxes and equipment.12:35 p.m.: Canada’s chief public health officer Dr. Theresa Tam says the average number of COVID-19 deaths in Canada each day in the last week topped 92 people, up from a seven-day average of 87 deaths a day on Monday.There are also now nearly 2,700 people in hospital being treated for COVID-19, and one in five of them are in intensive care.12:24 p.m. Premier Doug Ford is disputing an independent watchdog’s report that found Ontario is sitting on $12 billion in cash — money that opposition parties say should be used to fight the pandemic.The province’s Financial Accountability Office said the government had $12 billion that was not allocated at the end of the second quarter Sept. 30, but Ford countered that all but $2.6 billion has now been earmarked.It is available in the event of unexpected expenses, particularly as the COVID-19 vaccine is about to be distributed and administered to millions of Ontarians in the coming weeks and months, the premier said.“We actually have some money in contingency ... because as we went through this pandemic we’ve seen things pop up,” he told the legislature’s daily question period.Read the full story from Rob Ferguson12:22 p.m. As Quebec deals with rising COVID-19 cases and increased pressure on its health-care system, Premier François Legault said Tuesday his government isn’t ruling out implementing further restrictions.Legault told reporters the province is continuing to discuss the situation daily with public health officials, but no firm decisions have been made on stronger lockdown measures.“We follow the situation every day,” Legault said. “We don’t exclude any additional measures, but I don’t want to speculate on what those measures could be.”The province reported 1,564 new COVID-19 cases and 36 additional deaths linked to the novel coronavirus Tuesday. A dozen of those deaths occurred in the past 24 hours while 22 occurred in the first six days of December, according to the province’s Health Department.12 p.m.: The new COVID-19 vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna seem to be remarkably good at preventing serious illness. But it’s unclear how well they will curb the spread of the coronavirus.That’s because the Pfizer and Moderna trials tracked only how many vaccinated people became sick with COVID-19. That leaves open the possibility that some vaccinated people get infected without developing symptoms and could then silently transmit the virus — especially if they come in close contact with others or stop wearing masks.If vaccinated people are silent spreaders of the virus, they may keep it circulating in their communities, putting unvaccinated people at risk.More details here.11:50 a.m.: U.S. health regulators say in their initial review that the vaccine from Pfizer is 95 per cent protective against COVID-19.The review posted online Tuesday by the Food and Drug Administration offers the world the first detailed look at the evidence behind the shot, which was co-developed with BioNTech.The FDA review comes before a Thursday meeting where a panel of independent experts will scrutinize the data and vote on whether to recommend use of the vaccine. The vote isn’t binding but the FDA usually follows the group’s guidance. A U.S. decision to allow use of the vaccine is expected within days.If given the green light, the first recipients would be health care workers and nursing home residents, according to plans laid out by each state.11:50 a.m.: India’s Health Ministry announced Tuesday that some COVID-19 vaccines are likely to receive licences in the next few weeks and outlined an initial plan to immunize 300 million people.Health officials said three vaccine companies have applied for early approval for emergency use in India: Serum Institute of India, which has been licensed to manufacture the AstraZeneca vaccine, Pfizer Inc., and Indian manufacturer Bharat Biotech.“Some of them may get licensed in the next few weeks,” federal health secretary Rajesh Bhushan said.India says its initial immunization plan revolves around three priority groups: 10 million health care workers, 20 million front-line workers such as the police and military, and 270 million other people either above age 50 or who have diseases that make them more vulnerable to COVID-19’s effects.The Health Ministry has previously set a target of August 2021 for immunizing these people.India’s population is nearly 1.4 billion.11:40 a.m.: Nova Scotia will receive 1,950 doses of Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine for an initial test run next week.In an emailed statement, Health Department spokeswoman Marla MacInnis says the province will also be participating in a dry run this week with the federal government, Dalhousie University and the vaccine manufacturer.The exercise is to test shipping, delivery, tracking and storage but will not include actual vaccine.MacInnis says the idea is to prepare the province in advance of getting its initial allotment next week.She says much of the planning for the vaccine remains in the early stages of development, and the department is encouraging Nova Scotians to continue to adhere to public health protocols.Last week, chief medical officer of health Dr. Robert Strang said that so far, Nova Scotia has one ultralow-temperature freezer to store the vaccine at the tertiary care teaching hospital complex in Halifax.Strang said the freezer has been validated and cleared and is ready to accept the initial shipment of vaccine from the federal government.He said the province was also getting another through Ottawa that will operate out of a central depot for vaccines at the public health office in Halifax.Premier Stephen McNeil also said that the province had identified other freezers in the private sector and was in the process of procuring them.11:25 a.m.: As Quebec deals with rising COVID-19 cases and increased pressure on its health-care system, Premier François Legault says his government isn’t ruling out implementing further restrictions.Legault told reporters today the province is continuing to discuss the situation daily with public health officials, but no firm decisions have been made on stronger lockdown measures.The province introduced limits for the number of shoppers allowed in stores and malls last week.Legault is urging companies to allow for work from home, noting that when the government announced its now cancelled holiday gathering plan, many companies agreed to allow for remote work between Dec. 17 and Jan 4.Also, elementary and high schools will switch to distance learning next week as previously announced.Nearly 65 per cent of active outbreaks in the province are in schools or the workplace, with elder care homes also a problem area.11:16 a.m.: A vaccine developed by the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca Plc provided protection against severe COVID-19 in a peer-reviewed study, though more analysis will be needed to see how well it works in older people, among those at highest risk in the pandemic.The 10 cases of hospitalization seen in the trial all occurred among those given a placebo, suggesting the shot prevents the worst symptoms, according to the results published Tuesday in The Lancet medical journal. Yet the vaccine’s efficacy couldn’t be assessed in older age groups because there weren’t enough infections, the data show.Because older adults were recruited to the studies later than younger ones, “they’ve had less time for cases to accrue in those age groups and for us to be able to measure an efficacy signal,” said Andrew Pollard, director of the Oxford Vaccine Group. “The evidence we have so far on the immune response very much suggests that it’s likely to be similar levels of protection across the ages.”The report sheds more light on the strengths and shortcomings of the inoculation following weeks of confusion surrounding the late-stage trial, but still leaves unanswered questions about its potential role fighting a contagion that has killed more than 1.5 million people. Still, even if the vaccine can’t match the efficacy delivered by front-runners Pfizer Inc. and Moderna Inc., it is expected to be cheaper and easier to deploy far and wide.11:12 a.m.: Business, Paul Greco admits, has been booming.In the month or so since Pfizer announced the world’s first successful COVID-19 vaccine, sales of the ultra-low-temperature freezers needed to store it have taken off.“We basically sold as many in the two weeks after Pfizer’s announcement as we would all year. We’re sold out and waiting for our next shipment,” said Greco, president of Schomberg-based 360 Medical, the Canadian distributor of Haier Biomedical, a Chinese manufacturer of medical devices.The Star’s Josh Rubin has the full story.11:10 a.m.: Quebec is reporting 1,564 new COVID-19 cases and 36 additional deaths linked to the novel coronavirus.The provincial health department says 12 of those deaths occurred in the past 24 hours while 22 occurred in the first six days of December.Hospitalizations increased by 17 to reach 835, with nine more patients in intensive care for a total of 114.Given the rising indicators, Premier François Legault told reporters today the province hasn’t ruled out stricter lockdown measures and urged Quebecers to follow public health rules. 11:07 a.m.: In Ontario’s long-term care homes, 673 residents currently have COVID-19 and five new deaths have been reported today.The province says 116 of its 626 long-term care homes are experiencing an outbreak.11:05 a.m.: A long-term-care home in Etobicoke is working to contain a COVID-19 outbreak that caused 117 residents and 58 staff members to test positive for the virus, toronto.com reports.Twelve residents of Westside Long Term Care Home at 1145 Albion Rd. in the Thistletown neighbourhood have died of the virus since Toronto Public Health declared a virus outbreak at the Revera Inc.-operated home on Nov. 12.“We offer our most sincere condolences to the families and friends of the people we have lost to the pandemic,” Dr. Rhonda Collins, Revera’s chief medical officer, said in a Dec. 4 statement.As of Friday, 81 residents and 50 staff members have active cases of COVID-19 at the 242-bed home, Revera reported.“The residents are in isolation in their rooms. The staff members are in self-isolation at home,” Dr. Collins said in a statement.10:40 a.m.: Ontario is reporting an additional 333 cases in public schools across the province, bringing the total in the last two weeks to 1,581 and 5,736 overall since school began.In its latest data released Tuesday morning, the province reported 278 more students were infected for a total of 1,306 in the last two weeks; since school began there have been an overall total of 3,813.The data shows there are 55 more staff members infected for a total of 274 the last two weeks — and an overall total of 835.There are 853 schools with a reported case, which the province notes is 17.67 per cent of the 4,828 public schools in Ontario.Eleven schools are closed because of an outbreak, one more than the previous day, and the highest number to date. The data doesn’t indicate where they are.There is a lag between the daily provincial data at 10:30 a.m. and news reports about infections in schools. The provincial data on Tuesday is current as of 2 p.m. Monday. It doesn’t indicate where the place of transmission occurred.The Toronto District School Board updates its information on current COVID-19 cases throughout the day on its website. As of 5 p.m. on Monday, there were 421 students infected, 85 staff and 562 resolved cases.The Toronto Catholic District School Board also updates its information on its website. As of 8:10 a.m. Tuesday, there were 80 schools with at least one active case. There are 115 active student cases and 18 staff.Epidemiologists have told the Star that the rising numbers in the schools aren’t a surprise, and that the cases will be proportionate to the amount of COVID that is in the community.10:24 a.m. Ontario’s fiscal watchdog says the province had $12 billion in unspent reserve funds by the end of September.The Financial Accountability Officer says in a report today that the money was earmarked for three contingency funds, including two related to pandemic spending.The FAO says the $12 billion is $2.7 billion more than his office said the government had unspent in reserves by Aug 26.The Ontario budget says that if the money remains unspent in the reserves by the end of the fiscal year it will be used to reduce the deficit and provincial debt.The government has been criticized by opposition politicians for sitting on billions in reserve funds, which they say it has been slow to spend during the pandemic.Premier Doug Ford’s office says the provincial budget delivered last month shows that 80 per cent of the reserve funds have been allocated.10:13 a.m. (updated): Ontario is reporting 1,676 new cases of COVID-19 today, and 10 new deaths due to the virus.Health Minister Christine Elliott says 588 new cases are in Toronto, 349 in Peel Region, and 141 cases are in York Region.The province says it has conducted 39,198 tests since the last daily report.In total, 794 people are hospitalized in Ontario due to COVID-19, including 219 in intensive care.The province is also reporting that 132 people are on ventilators in hospital.The latest figures bring the total of COVID-19 cases in Ontario to 130,910, with 3,808 deaths, and 110,951 cases resolved.10 a.m. The Dutch public health institute on Tuesday reported a “worrying rise” in the number of coronavirus infections in the last week, as the government prepared to announce whether it will allow any relaxations over the Christmas holidays of its partial lockdown.The health institute said the number of new confirmed COVID-19 cases rose by more than 9,000 to 43,103 in a week. More people were tested in the last week due to a change in the rules for access, but the percentage of positive tests also rose from 11.1 per cent to 11.6 per cent.In the same week, the number of confirmed COVID-19 deaths dropped from 406 to 338. The nationwide death toll since the pandemic first swept into the Netherlands is approaching 10,000.The number of nursing homes with at least one confirmed COVID-19 case also rose, with 100 homes recording a confirmed case over the last week, up from 77 the week before.The Netherlands has been in a partial lockdown since mid-October, when the country was recording some of Europe’s highest infections rates. The closures of all bars and restaurants along with restrictions on the number of people who could gather at home and outdoors brought the infection rate down, but the decline has stagnated in recent weeks.8:40 a.m. The coronavirus vaccine made by Pfizer and BioNTech provides strong protection against COVID-19 within about 10 days of the first dose, according to documents published Tuesday by the Food and Drug Administration before a meeting of its vaccine advisory group.The finding is one of several significant new results featured in the briefing materials, which span 53 pages of data analyses from the agency and from Pfizer. Last month, Pfizer and BioNTech announced that their two-dose vaccine had an efficacy rate of 95 per cent after two doses administered three weeks apart. The new analyses show that the protection starts kicking in far earlier.What’s more, the vaccine worked well regardless of a volunteer’s race, weight or age. While the trial did not find any serious adverse events caused by the vaccine, many participants did experience aches, fevers and other side effects.On Thursday, FDA’s vaccine advisory panel will discuss these materials in advance of a vote on whether to recommend authorization of Pfizer and BioNTech’s vaccine.Pfizer and BioNTech began a large-scale clinical trial in July, recruiting 44,000 people in the United States, Brazil and Argentina. Half of the volunteers got the vaccine, and half got the placebo.New coronavirus cases quickly tapered off in the vaccinated group of volunteers about 10 days after the first dose, according to one graph in the briefing materials. In the placebo group, cases kept steadily increasing.The vaccine’s swift impact could benefit not just the people who get it but the country’s strained hospitals, curbing the flow of new patients into intensive care units.8:30 a.m. Toronto residents are tired of the constraints imposed by COVID-19, but still strongly support public health restrictions needed to control the spread of the virus, according to a poll conducted for Toronto Public Health.The Ipsos Reid online survey of 1,201 people conducted during the last week of October, before the second lockdown took effect on Nov. 23, found that 56 per cent of respondents reported being tired of COVID-19 precautions and 39 per cent were angry/frustrated.Despite that, 43 per cent strongly supported the idea of a second lockdown and 40 per cent were somewhat supportive, putting total support for continuing restrictions at 83 per cent.Read the full story from Francine Kopun8 a.m. As cases of COVID-19 continue to rise in hot spots in the province, experts are once again warning that hospitals may have to cancel elective surgeries in order to cope.There are parts of the province — Mississauga, Etobicoke and North York — where nearly 25 per cent of patients in intensive care have COVID-19, said Anthony Dale, president and CEO of the Ontario Hospital Association.Although hospitals still have beds available, Dale said the province’s intensive care units typically operate close to capacity, which means a surge of COVID-19 patients might push them over the edge and threaten elective surgeries once again, similar to what occurred during the first wave.If elective surgeries are cancelled, “it’s people who need cancer and cardiac care and other kinds of elective activity that risk paying a price here,” he said.Read the full story from the Star’s Patty Winsa and Kenyon Wallace7:45 a.m. Under pressure to remove Belarus as co-host of next year’s men’s world championship, the International Ice Hockey Federation said Tuesday a working trip to Minsk was cancelled because its top two officials have become infected with COVID-19.The governing body said president René Fasel and general secretary Horst Lichtner both tested positive for the virus ahead of travelling to meet Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko.Lukashenko has described hockey as “an ideology” in Belarus, and has played the sport with Russian President Vladimir Putin.The authoritarian leader of Belarus was suspended by the IOC on Monday from Olympic activities, including the Tokyo Games, during an investigation into athletes’ claims they have faced discrimination for protesting against his re-election.The Belarus Olympic Committee, led by Lukashenko since the 1990s, seemed to have violated the Olympic Charter, the IOC said.The IOC urged stakeholders to follow its decision to break off talks with Belarus about hosting sports events and meetings.In a statement Tuesday, Fasel referred to “safety issues that are affecting preparations” for the 2021 hockey worlds, which are set to open in May in Belarus and Latvia.The Latvian government called on the Zurich-based IIHF to move games from Minsk after Lukashenko’s disputed election win in August. However, Fasel said the planned meeting with Lukashenko was to explore “what steps are being taken to ensure that the tournament can be held safely and in co-operation with co-hosts Latvia.”7:35 a.m. Less than 20 days from Christmas and two weeks into a lockdown, Toronto’s top doctor was not certain about the current measures being lifted even after the holidays.Dr. Eileen de Villa continued implore residents to stay apart through December and New Year’s and not gather for dinners, parties and other celebrations — apart from those that already live together, and for those that live alone, one exclusive household.“In our own lives, risky in-home festivities will easily make things worse and already I’m as worried now by what may happen in January as I am about the rest of this month,” de Villa told reporters Monday at a regular briefing.Read the full story from the Star’s Jennifer Pagliaro7:30 a.m. It’s only going to get worse for Canadians who are already feeling stretched at the grocery store, with food prices set to rise in 2021 due in no small part to COVID-19.The 11th annual Food Price Report, a collaboration between Dalhousie University, the University of Guelph, the University of Saskatchewan and the University of British Columbia, predicts that food prices will rise by three to five per cent next year, outpacing general inflation.The annual cost of groceries for the average Canadian family will go up by five per cent in 2021 — by almost $700, the largest dollar increase the report has yet predicted. That figure doesn’t include restaurant spending and groceries purchased through e-commerce.Read the full story from the Star’s Rosa Saba5:54 a.m.: The federal government says the largest mass immunization effort in Canadian history could begin as early as next week. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says Ottawa expects to receive up to 249,000 doses of the COVID-19 vaccine developed by pharmaceutical giant Pfizer and German partner BioNTech. Its approval is said to be imminent. The second vaccine in line for approval in Canada is from Moderna. The Canadian military will have a role to play in vaccine distribution. Various provinces have started spelling out their plans as well. Here’s a look at what they’ve said so far.5:52 a.m.: The Saskatchewan government is to reveal today details of its rollout plan for the COVID-19 vaccine.Premier Scott Moe says the province has ultracold storage in place to receive the Pfizer vaccine, which is pending Health Canada approval, with the first doses expected to arrive next week.The premier says his Saskatchewan Party government will start vaccinations “as quickly as physically possible.”He says health-care workers and long-term care residents will be first in line to get a shot.Moe says vaccinations will happen in phases determined by health officials, as more doses will become available in the new year.The government says getting a COVID-19 vaccine will not be mandatory, but a communications plan will be part of the distribution.5:51 a.m.: The Assembly of First Nations is planning to urge the federal Liberal government to do more to deal with the disproportionate impact the COVID-19 pandemic is having on their communities in a virtual version of its annual general assembly today.Ontario Regional Chief RoseAnne Archibald says the pandemic has hit First Nations communities hard, but they have also long dealt with inequitable treatment in Canada.She says Canada has an opportunity to take big steps toward improving the situation through programs, services and funding as the country rebuilds its economy.Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is set to address the general assembly, which was originally scheduled to take place in Halifax this summer but put off due to COVID-19.5:50 a.m.: Germany’s eastern state of Saxony has become the country’s hot spot for coronavirus infections, with the number of newly confirmed cases per 100,000 inhabitants reaching almost 320 in a week.According to figures published by Germany’s disease control centre Tuesday the nationwide rate is currently less than half that in Saxony, at about 147.The Saxony-based daily Freie Presse reported that the state government is considering tightening pandemic restrictions from Monday.5:49 a.m.: Shares in China’s biggest online health care platform rose 50 per cent in their Hong Kong stock market debut Tuesday, reflecting investor enthusiasm for the fledgling industry as the country emerges from the coronavirus pandemic.JD Health, an arm of JD.Com Inc., China’s biggest online retailer, sells medications, hospital care packages and online consulting by doctors.Chinese internet companies increasingly offer health services in a society where hospitals are crowded and distribution of drugs and medical supplies outside major cities is uneven. Online consulting with Chinese-speaking physicians is popular with families from China who live in the West or in developing countries.Other competitors include e-commerce giant Alibaba Group’s Alibaba Health; Baidu Health, run by search giant Baidu.com Inc.; and WeDoctor, run by Tencent Holding, operator of the popular WeChat messaging service.The coronavirus pandemic has boosted demand for Chinese online platforms.Investors have “high hopes for this kind of companies to develop in China,” said Jackson Wong, asset management director for Amber Hill Capital Ltd. in Hong Kong.5:48 a.m.: Should I wipe down groceries during the pandemic?Experts say it’s not necessary for most people.The coronavirus spreads mainly through the respiratory droplets people spray when talking, coughing, sneezing or singing. It’s why health experts stress the importance of wearing masks and social distancing.Experts still recommend cleaning surfaces — especially frequently touched spots that infected people might have recently touched. That will also help reduce risk from other germs that haven’t gone away in the pandemic.People caring for those at risk for severe illness if infected might also want to take the precaution of wiping down any packages.But experts say to keep things in perspective. The virus is fragile and doesn’t survive easily outside the body for long, they note. Tests finding it on surfaces might just be detecting traces of the virus, not live virus capable of infecting people. Early studies finding it could linger on surfaces for days were conducted under laboratory conditions; the virus likely couldn’t survive that long in real life.5:47 a.m.: Australia is extending its ban on international cruise ships and on Australians leaving the country except under exceptional circumstances for another three months until March.The extension announced Tuesday means the human biosecurity emergency declaration will last for at least a year despite COVID-19 cases declining in the isolated nation.Australia has imposed some of the most severe border restrictions in the world since the pandemic began, requiring most of its citizens and permanent residents to apply for a permit and prove exceptional circumstances if they need to leave the country.Australia is a nation of 26 million people. Latest government figures showed on Monday there were only 1,618 active COVID-19 cases, with 30 of those infected in hospitals.Thousands of Australians have missed out on funerals, weddings and the births of relatives because of the travel ban which is designed to prevent travellers from bringing with virus home.5:46 a.m.: Before Pfizer’s coronavirus vaccine was proved highly successful in clinical trials last month, the company offered the Trump administration the chance to lock in supplies beyond the 100 million doses the pharmaceutical maker agreed to sell the government as part of a $1.95 billion deal over the summer.But the administration, according to people familiar with the talks, never made the deal, a choice that now raises questions about whether the United States allowed other countries to take its place in line.While two vaccines, including Pfizer’s, have proved to be highly effective against COVID-19, and a third also appears at least moderately effective, supplies are shaping up to be scarce in the coming months as infections, hospitalizations and deaths surge to new highs. And while Pfizer is now negotiating with the administration to provide more of its vaccine, people familiar with the talks say the company cannot guarantee that it will be able to deliver more than the initial 100 million doses — enough to inoculate 50 million people since its vaccine requires two shots — before perhaps next June.After it signed its federal contract in late July, Pfizer went on to seal deals with other governments, including the European Union, which last month finalized an agreement to acquire 200 million doses from Pfizer and its German partner, BioNTech. On Tuesday, Britain will begin inoculating its population with the vaccine.5:45 a.m.: President-elect Joe Biden’s choices for his health care team point to a stronger federal role in the nation’s COVID-19 strategy, restoration of a guiding stress on science and an emphasis on equitable distribution of vaccines and treatments.With Monday’s announcement of California Attorney General Xavier Becerra as his health secretary and a half dozen other key appointments, Biden aims to leave behind the personality dramas that sometimes flourished under President Donald Trump. He hopes to return the federal response to a more methodical approach, seeking results by applying scientific knowledge in what he says will be a transparent and disciplined manner.“We are still going to have a federal, state and local partnership,” commented Dr. Georges Benjamin, executive director of the non-profit American Public Health Association. “I just think there is going to be better guidance from the federal government and they are going to work more collaboratively with the states.”In a sense, what Biden has is not quite yet a team, but a collection of players drafted for key positions. Some have already been working together as members of Biden’s coronavirus advisory board. Others will have to suit up quickly.By announcing most of the key positions in one package, Biden is signalling that he expects his appointees to work together, and not as lords of their own bureaucratic fiefdoms.Tuesday 5:41 a.m.: U.K. health authorities are rolling out the first doses of a widely tested and independently reviewed COVID-19 vaccine, starting a global immunization program that is expected to gain momentum as more serums win approval.The first shot will come Tuesday at one of a network of hospital hubs around the country where the initial phase of the U.K. program will be rolled out on what has been dubbed “V-Day.”Public health officials are asking the public to be patient because only those who are most at risk from COVID-19 will be vaccinated in the early stages. Medical staff will contact patients to arrange appointments, and most will have to wait until next year before there is enough vaccine to expand the program.“I think there’s every chance that we will look back on ... (Tuesday) as marking a decisive turning point in the battle against coronavirus,” said Simon Stevens, the CEO of England’s National Health Service.The first 800,000 doses are going to people over 80 who are either hospitalized or already have outpatient appointments scheduled, along with nursing home workers. Others will have to wait their turn.Read Monday’s coronavirus news.\n",

      "CONTENT : BEIJING - China lashed out at the U.S. on Tuesday over new American sanctions against Chinese officials for their actions in Hong Kong, along with the sale of more U.S. military equipment to Taiwan, moves touching on two of the most sensitive issues in the increasingly contentious relationship between the nations.The foreign ministry summoned Washington’s top diplomat in China to express “strong indignation and strong condemnation.“The U.S. actions “seriously violated the basic norms of international relations, seriously interfered in China’s domestic politics, seriously damaged China-U.S. relations, are arrogant, unreasonable and vile,“ Vice Foreign Minister Zheng Zeguang was quoted as telling Deputy Chief of Mission Robert Forden.Foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying also condemned the new sanctions levelled against 14 officials in the standing committee of China’s legislature, which passed a sweeping Hong Kong National Security Law earlier this year.China will “take resolute and forceful countermeasures and resolutely defend its sovereignty, security and development interests,“ Hua said at a daily briefing.The State Department on Monday said the 14 officials will be banned from travelling to the U.S. or accessing the U.S. financial system over actions in Hong Kong seen as squelching free speech and opposition politics.It also announced the approval of a $280 million sale of advanced military communications equipment to Taiwan.China passed the National Security Law as part of a campaign to impose tighter control and drive foreign political influence from Hong Kong, a former British colony that was handed back to China in 1997 with a promise it could retain its relatively liberal political, legal and economic systems for 50 years.Harsh suppression of months of increasingly violent anti-government protests last year led to unyielding enforcement of the law, including the arrest of leading government opponents and the expulsion of four opposition members of the Legislative Council. That prompted the rest of the opposition bloc to resign en masse, while Washington levelled sanctions at leading figures in both the Hong Kong government and related Chinese government departments.In his comments to Forden, Zheng said U.S. expressions of concern for democracy, human rights and autonomy in Hong Kong were merely cover for its real goals of spreading chaos in the territory and stifling China’s stability and development.That, he said, proved Washington was the “black hand“ behind disorder in Hong Kong, repeating a frequent Chinese accusation rejected by the U.S.The U.S. Embassy in Beijing described the meeting as a chance to express U.S. concern over the National Security Law.Forden “noted that Beijing has used the law repeatedly to suppress freedom of expression and assembly in Hong Kong and to arrest Hong Kong residents who have raised peacefully their concerns over Beijing’s oppressive policies,“ the embassy said in a statement on its website.The dispute over Hong Kong comes as China is upping military and diplomatic pressure on Taiwan, a self-governing island democracy that Beijing claims as its own territory, to be annexed by force if necessary.Hua demanded the U.S. cancel its latest arms sale to Taiwan and said China would make a “proper and necessary response.”President Donald Trump’s administration has incensed Beijing with 11 separate arms sales and closer military and political ties with the island.China has responded with stepped-up military flights and wargames near Taiwan and pledged to punish U.S. companies involved in arms deals with the island. It has sought to poach Taiwan’s dwindling number of diplomatic allies while blocking the island from participating in international medical, economic and other organizations, demanding that President Tsai Ing-wen first recognize that the island is Chinese territory.Taiwan’s government welcomed the sale of U.S. military equipment, saying it showed Washington is honouring its commitment to bolster the island’s defences.“Taiwan has been at the receiving end of such military threats on a daily basis,” Tsai told reporters. “Only through engagement and by working together can we tackle the threats and challenges that beset our region and the world.”The U.S. earlier imposed sanctions on Chinese officials implicated in abuses against Muslim minority groups in the northwestern region of Xinjiang. It has also gone after Chinese companies as part of a feud over trade and alleged pilfering of intellectual property, last week adding China’s biggest maker of processor chips and a state-owned oil giant to a blacklist that limits access to American technology and investment.Earlier this year, the U.S. also forced the closure of the Chinese consulate in Houston — prompting China to shutter the U.S. consulate in the southwestern city of Chengdu — and last week, it cut the duration of U.S. visas for members of China’s ruling Communist Party and their family members from 10 years to one month.The Trump administration appears to be using Taiwan, Hong Kong and other issues to heighten the level of confrontation in China-U.S. relations, said Su Hao, professor of international relations at China Foreign Affairs University.“Trump would like to see a formation of a solidified structure of China-U.S. relations that will make it difficult for (President-elect Joe Biden) to make changes,” Su said.Trump may view the increased toughness toward China as a legacy of his time in office, said Diao Daming, associate professor in the School of International Studies at Beijing’s Renmin University.“This is hurting bilateral relations, harming the interests of the countries and their citizens, and failing to meet the expectations of international society,” Diao said.\n",

Restrictions on travellers coming from abroad still are in place and visitors to public buildings are checked for fever.JD Health raised about $3.8 billion by selling 20% of the company to public shareholders.It was Hong Kong’s second-biggest stock offering this year behind parent JD.Com, which has shares traded in New York and raised $4.5 billion in June when it joined the Hong Kong exchange.The ruling party is encouraging use of online health services to reduce the burden on hospitals.JD Health said it plans to expand its online pharmacy and develop “smart healthcare solutions” supported by artificial intelligence to work with physicians.The company says it had 72.5 million active users in June, up 30% from a year earlier.The industry might face tougher competition once the coronavirus is brought under control and patients have more offline options, Wong said.“If vaccines are very effective and people start going out again, the growth of these online service providers might not be as high,” he said. “That would be the biggest risk for this kind of company.”___Associated Press journalists Alice Fung in Hong Kong and Sam McNeil in Beijing contributed to this report.___JD Health (in Chinese): https://jiankang.jd.com \n",

      "CONTENT : KATHMANDU, Nepal - China and Nepal jointly announced a new official height for Mount Everest on Tuesday, ending a discrepancy between the two nations.The new height of the world’s highest peak is 8,848.86 metres (29,031.7 feet), which is slightly more than Nepal’s previous measurement and about four meters (13 feet) higher than China’s.Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi and his Nepalese counterpart, Pradeep Gyawali, simultaneously pressed buttons during a virtual conference and the new height flashed on the screen.The height of Everest, which is on the border between China and Nepal, was agreed on after surveyors from Nepal scaled the peak in 2019 and a Chinese team did the same in 2020.There had been debate over the actual height of the peak and concern that it might have shrunk after a major earthquake in 2015. The quake killed 9,000 people, damaged about 1 million structures in Nepal and triggered an avalanche on Everest that killed 19 people at the base camp.There was no doubt that Everest would remain the highest peak because the second highest, Mount K2, is only 8,611 metres (28,244 feet) tall.Everest’s height was first determined by a British team around 1856 as 8,842 metres (29,002) feet.But the most accepted height has been 8,848 metres (29,028 feet), which was determined by the Survey of India in 1954.In 1999, a National Geographic Society team using GPS technology came up with a height of 8,850 (29,035 feet). A Chinese team in 2005 said it was 8,844.43 metres (29,009 feet) because it did not include the snow cap.A Nepal government team of climbers and surveyors scaled Everest in May 2019 and installed GPS and satellite equipment to measure the peak and snow depth on the summit.Chinese President Xi Jinping visited Nepal later that year and the leaders of the two countries decided that they should agree on a height.A survey team from China then conducted measurements in the spring of 2020 while all other expeditions were cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic.Nepal’s climbing community welcomed the end of confusion over the mountain’s height.“This is a milestone in mountaineering history which will finally end the debate over the height and now the world will have one number,” said Santa Bir Lama, president of the Nepal Mountaineering Association.China’s official Xinhua New Agency quoted Xi as saying the two sides are committed to jointly protecting the environment around Everest and co-operating in scientific research.For China, the announcement appeared to be as much about politics as geography. China has drawn Nepal ever closer into its orbit with investments in its economy and the building of highways, dams, airports and other infrastructure in the impoverished nation.That appears to serve China’s interests in reducing the influence of rival India, with which it shares a disputed border, and Nepal’s role as a destination for refugee Tibetans.The Xinhua report said nothing about the technical aspects but heavily emphasized the joint announcement’s geopolitical weight.China and Nepal will establish an “even closer community of a shared future to enrich the countries and their peoples,” Xinhua quoted Xi as saying.\n",

      "CONTENT : CANBERRA, Australia - The Australian Parliament on Tuesday gave the government power to cancel deals struck with foreign nations by lower levels of government that conflict with the national interest, despite China warning against disrupting co-operation.An agreement signed by Australia’s second-most populous state, Victoria, with Beijing’s Belt and Road Initiative to build trade-related infrastructure is among 135 deals with 30 countries that the government argues need to be reviewed.“We didn’t agree with it in the first place, still don’t agree with it, and no doubt decisions on that will be made in due course,” Treasurer Josh Frydenberg told reporters, referring to the Victoria deal.The laws allow the federal government to review and scrap state, territory, local council and public university deals with other nations.Foreign Minister Marise Payne can assess arrangements between governments or public universities and foreign governments to check if they align with foreign policy goals.When the new federal power was proposed in August, the Chinese foreign ministry cautioned against disrupting “successful pragmatic co-operation” with Victoria.“Australia should see two sides’ co-operation under the BRI in an objective and reasonable manner and not set obstacles artificially for normal exchanges and co-operation,” foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said in Beijing.Bilateral relations have since deteriorated further, with Chinese officials announcing on Monday that Queensland state abattoir Meramist had become the sixth Australian meat exporter suspended from trading with China. No reasons were given.China last month added wine to the growing list of Australian goods barred or restricted from its markets in a trade war against Australia over disputes including its support for a probe into the origin of the coronavirus.Earlier, China stopped or reduced imports of Australian coal, barley, seafood, sugar and timber after Australia supported calls for a probe into the origin of the pandemic, which began in China late last year.A diplomatic war of words recently erupted between Australia and China over a fake image that had been tweeted by a Chinese official.Prime Minister Scott Morrison expressed indignation and anger at the tweet, which depicted a grinning Australian soldier holding a bloodied knife to an Afghan child’s throat.The post took aim at alleged unlawful killings and abuses by Australian soldiers during the conflict in Afghanistan.The Australian government created new powers to veto foreign deals as lawmakers become increasingly sensitive about Chinese political and economic influence.In August, Australian regulators blocked a Chinese company’s purchase of Japanese brewer Kirin’s Australian beverage unit as “contrary to the national interest.”In 2018, Australia passed sweeping national security laws that ban covert foreign interference in domestic politics. Beijing protested that the laws were prejudiced against China and poisoned Chinese-Australian relations.Payne, the Australian foreign minister, said a task force would be created within her department to review international agreements under the new law.“The legislation is necessary to appropriately manage and protect Australia’s foreign relations and the consistency or our nation’s foreign policy,” she said in a statement.\n",

      "CONTENT : Hong Kong police on Tuesday arrested eight pro-democracy activists over their role in an unauthorized protest last summer, widening a crackdown on dissent in the semi-autonomous Chinese city.The arrests, which included several former lawmakers, are tied to a July 1 demonstration in which thousands defied a protest ban and rallied on the streets against a national security law imposed on the city by Beijing the day before.Former pro-democracy lawmakers Wu Chi-wai, Eddie Chu and Leung Kwok Hung were arrested at their homes on charges related to organizing and participating in the protest, according to Facebook posts on their respective pages.Hong Kong police said in a statement that eight men aged between 24 and 64 had been arrested for inciting, organizing and taking part in an unauthorized assembly.Traditionally, a protest march is held every year on July 1 — the day Hong Kong was handed from British to Chinese control in 1997 — but this year’s protest was banned with authorities citing the health risks from the pandemic.Hong Kong and Beijing have increasingly clamped down on dissent in the city since the introduction of the national security law, which was aimed at curbing months of political unrest and protests against the government.The crackdown has led to accusations that Beijing is violating the autonomy it promised Hong Kong would have following the 1997 handover. It also has triggered warnings the ruling Communist Party is damaging Hong Kong’s appeal as a global business centre and one of Asia’s most dynamic cities.More than 370 people were arrested on July 1, with at least 10 arrested under the national security law.In August, the U.S. imposed sanctions on 11 officials from mainland China and Hong Kong, including Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam, for undermining the city’s autonomy. The U.S. sanctioned another 14 Chinese officials on Tuesday for undermining the city’s democratic processes.\n",

      "CONTENT : Sir Wilfrid Laurier, Canada’s seventh Prime Minister, may soon be stepping down - from his banknote, that is. Laurier, whose visage has graced the five dollar bill for nearly 50 years, is set to be replaced within the next few years. In January, the Bank of Canada announced it would launch a public consultation to “select an iconic Canadian” to appear on the bill’s next version. A poll conducted by Angus Reid Institute indicated Atlantic Canadians were more supportive of redesigning the bill than those in any other region of the country, with three-quarters of east coast residents indicating they supported the concept. Albertans were the least supportive of changing the bill with only 56 per cent indicating support. There are eight nominees to replace Laurier, a list released by an independent federal advisory council. They are: • Pitseolak Ashoona: A Inuit artist known worldwide for revealing traditional Inuit life in the Arctic through her work. • Onondeyoh (Frederick Ogilvie Loft): A Mohawk chief and First World War veteran and Indigenous rights advocate who founded the first pan-Canadian Indigenous organization in 1918. • Robertine Barry (“Françoise”): The first female French-Canadian journalist, she was an advocate for women’s suffrage and equality and other social justice issues. • Binaaswi (Francis Pegahmagabow): A World War One veteran, he is the most decorated Indigenous soldier in Canadian history who advocated for the advancement of Indigenous rights. • Won Alexander Cumyow: He is the first known Chinese-Canadian to be born in Canada and used his own language skills to bridge divides between English-speaking and Chinese-speaking communities in Vancouver. • Terry Fox: He ran across Canada to raise money for the fight against cancer after losing his own leg to the disease. After running for 143 days, the cancer returned, ending his Marathon of Hope. He died shortly before his 23rd birthday. Millions have been raised since through the annual charitable runs in his name. • Lotta Hitschmanova: A Canadian humanitarian who founded the Unitarian Service Committee of Canada. One of the country’s first international development agencies, it sent supplies to war-torn Europe. • Isapo-muxika (Crowfoot): A chief of the Siksika First Nation, well known for his involvement in Treaty Number 7, and effective advocacy and leadership. Of the eight candidates, Terry Fox was the preferred choice by 57 per cent of Canadians who responded to the poll. Fox ran through Moncton on his Marathon of Hope and a path through Riverfront park is named in his honour. Binaaswi, also known as Francis Pegahmagabow, – the most highly decorated Indigenous soldier in Canadian history -- was the second most popular choice. A quarter of those in Atlantic Canada indicated Binaaswi would be their choice. Isapo-muxika (Crowfoot) was the third most popular choice, picked by 19 per cent of Canadians, and Atlantic Canadians. Respondents read a brief biography of each candidate before being asked to indicate their preferred candidates. Respondents could indicate either one or two as their favourite. The Angus Reid Institute conducted this online survey from November 12-16, among a representative randomized sample of 1,578 Canadian adults who are members of Angus Reid Forum. For comparison purposes only, a probability sample of this size would carry a margin of error of +/- 2.5 percentage points, 19 times out of 20. The survey was self-commissioned and paid for by Angus Reid. Results of this poll will not necessarily influence decision-making around who should be the new face of the five-dollar bill. \n",

      "CONTENT : BEIJING — Authorities have ordered mass coronavirus testing and locked down some locations in the southwestern Chinese city of Chengdu following the detection of two new virus cases there.Chengdu health officials identified the cases as a 69-year-old woman, who’s condition is listed as serious, and her 71-year-old husband who has yet to show symptoms.Officials at a Monday night news conference said they are still investigating the source of the infection in Sichuan province’s capital and largest city that has been relatively unscathed by the pandemic. However, samples taken at the couple’s apartment showed the presence of the virus in seven different locations, including on door knobs, light switches and food in the refrigerator, indicating a “high degree of contamination,” Zhu Xiaoping, heady of the provincial coronavirus task force was quoted as saying in a government news release.Five locations in Chengdu’s Ludu district have been sealed off, including a hospital, a school and a wholesale market and more than 21,000 people tested as of Monday evening, the government said.China reported a total of 12 new cases on Tuesday, including the two in Chengdu and 10 brought from outside the country, bringing China’s total to 86,646 with 4,634 deaths. Hospitals are treating 280 people for COVID-19 while another 219 people are being monitored in isolation after testing positive for the virus without showing symptoms.—-THE VIRUS OUTBREAK:— Health officials warn Americans not to let their guard down— UK gears up for coronavirus vaccination program watched around the world— Citing low virus rates in schools, New York City reopens schools again— Biden picks Calif. Attorney General Xavier Becerra to lead HHS, pandemic response— Senator says Trump, McConnell likely to back COVID-19 relief— Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani in hospital after positive COVID-19 test___Follow AP’s coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/coronavirus-pandemic and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak ___HERE’S WHAT ELSE IS HAPPENING:___TALLAHASSEE, Fla. — Florida authorities investigating an alleged hack into the state’s emergency response system raided the home Monday of a woman fired earlier this year from her job as COVID-19 data curator.Florida Department of Law Enforcement said that Rebekah Jones, who was fired for unauthorized public comments about the data in May, has been under investigation since early November when someone illegally accessed the state’s emergency alert health system.Jones was fired from her post in May after she raised questions about Florida’s COVID-19 data. She had been reprimanded several times and was ultimately fired for violating Health Department policy by making public remarks about the information, state records show.Since her firing, she has lit up social media with posts criticizing Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis and his state agencies. For months, she has tried to promote herself as a victim who was fired for telling the truth, although there is no evidence that supports her claims.Early in the pandemic, Jones wrote blog posts and reached out to media outlets and researchers sowing doubt about the credibility of the data now that she is no longer in that role. She said Health Department managers urged her to manipulate information to paint a rosier picture and that she pushed back. The data was crucial as the governor was trying to make highly controversial decisions on whether to reopen Florida’s economy.State health officials strenuously deny any issue with the information’s accuracy.Agents served the search warrant on her Tallahassee home after receiving a complaint from the Department of Health regarding unauthorized access to its emergency alert system, according to a statement from FDLE.“Agents believe someone at the residence on Centerville Court illegally accessed the system,” spokeswoman Gretl Plessinger said in a statement.___ALABAMA - Alabama on Monday set a record of more than 2,000 COVID-19 patients in state hospitals as some facilities began to postpone non-emergency procedures amid staff shortages.There were 2,079 patients in state hospitals with COVID-19 — the first time the number topped 2,000 since the pandemic began, according to state numbers from the Alabama Department of Public Health. Dr. Don Williamson, the former state health officer who now heads the Alabama Hospital Association, said at least three hospitals have begun to postpone non-emergency procedures amid staff shortages.“My real concern is I still don’t see anything to break the spread between now and getting through Christmas. That’s my real concern, and frankly I’m increasingly frustrated about why it is so difficult for individuals to be willing to wear masks,” Williamson said.“The election’s over. It should no longer be political. People are dying, and we can do better than this.”Williamson said staffing availability is a major concern. He said some facilities have as many as 100 staff members out with COVID-19.___HARRISBURG, Pa. — Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf warned Monday that the coronavirus is running rampant throughout the state and could soon force overwhelmed hospitals to begin turning away patients.Wolf calls it a “dangerous, disturbing scenario” that will become reality if people don’t take steps to slow the spread. He said additional pandemic restrictions might be on the way but did not elaborate on what his administration might be considering while also acknowledging the ones already in place have not worked.Wolf said the unchecked spread of the virus in all regions of the state means that resource-sharing agreements among hospitals could soon begin to break down and force them to begin rationing care.Still, the governor all but ruled out a return to the kinds of statewide restrictions he imposed in the spring, when schools were closed, thousands of businesses deemed non-essential were shut down, and all 12.8 million Pennsylvanians were under a stay-at-home order.___ATLANTA — The number of confirmed and suspected coronavirus infections has soared more than 70% in Georgia in the week ended Monday as hospitals continue to sound alarms about their ability to absorb new COVID-19 patients and a few schools give up in-person instruction for the remaining two weeks before Christmas holidays begin, with all students learning at home until 2021.The last week has seen a rapid takeoff in new infections, with the state averaging more than 5,000 confirmed and suspected cases each day as of Monday. Even just the confirmed cases, based off molecular PCR tests, are now above the high set on July 24.More than 2,500 COVID-19 patients were hospitalized Monday statewide. That’s below the summer peak of 3,200, but more than double the most recent low point in mid-October.Despite the rapid rise, Georgia still ranks only 44th among the states for the most new cases per capita in the past 14 days, because cases are spreading so rapidly everywhere else. Still, the Georgia Department of Public health rates 60% of Georgia’s counties as having high transmission.Georgia is likely to record its 10,000th confirmed or suspected death from COVID-19 sometime this week. On Monday, the death total stood at 9.851. The state passed 500,000 confirmed or suspected infections on Sunday.___NASHVILLE, Tenn. — A Tennessee lawmaker has been hospitalized with COVID-19 after attending a House Republican caucus meeting nearly two weeks ago.Rep. David Byrd was flown by helicopter over the weekend to a Nashville hospital. The 63-year-old lawmaker attended the House GOP caucus meeting with nearly 70 lawmakers on Nov. 24 and also participated in a House GOP overnight retreat the weekend prior.Byrd is at least the second lawmaker to be hospitalized after contracting the virus. Republican Rep. Mike Carter was hospitalized earlier this year for COVID-19.Byrd had attracted scrutiny for more than a year over allegations by three women of sexual misconduct three decades ago when he was a high school teacher and their basketball coach. He was never charged.___LAS VEGAS — Officials have reported that the number of people hospitalized in Nevada with COVID-19 has more than doubled over the last month.The Nevada Hospital Association reported Monday that hospitalized coronavirus patients increased to 1,617 statewide from Nov. 6 to Dec. 6 as the state continues experiencing a surge. That’s up from 692, a rise of more than 230%.Nevada COVID-19 response director Caleb Cage says officials expect the number of reported cases to continue rising because of gatherings over Thanksgiving. Cage says that will likely increase the number of hospitalizations.Nevada has reported 170,587 COVID-19 cases and 2,319 deaths during the pandemic.___JERUSALEM — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office has announced plans for a nighttime curfew during the upcoming Hanukkah holiday to contain a COVID-19 outbreak.The curfew is set to go into effect on Wednesday, on the eve of Hanukkah. It says commercial activities will be banned and intercity travel will be limited.An announcement Monday night said the measure, approved by the advisory coronavirus cabinet, still requires approval from the Cabinet.Israel has already imposed two lockdowns this year and is still emerging from the latest set of restrictions imposed in September. In recent days, the number of daily confirmed cases has sharply climbed.Also Monday, President Reuven Rivlin said the first doses of the coronavirus vaccine are expected to arrive in the country in the coming days.___LITTLE ROCK, Ark. — Gov. Asa Hutchinson announced plans Monday for a series of community meetings across Arkansas to address the growing surge of coronavirus cases.Hutchinson’s office said that the governor will have meetings this week in Benton, Springdale and Jonesboro, followed by additional meetings in other cities next week. The governor also planned to give a speech Thursday night for a statewide audience.Hutchinson said last week that he’s considering requiring state approval for smaller indoor events. Under the state’s current COVID-19 restrictions, indoor events with more than 100 people expected must have a plan approved beforehand by the state.But overall, the Republican governor has resisted calls for widespread restrictions, such as stricter capacity requirements on indoor dining, which has been recommended by the White House Coronavirus Task Force.Arkansas’ rolling average number of daily new virus cases has increased by 21% over the past two weeks, according to researchers at Johns Hopkins University. One in every 205 people in Arkansas tested positive in the past week, researchers said.___BATON ROUGE, La. — Louisiana’s health department has loosened its coronavirus quarantine guidance for schools and workplaces to match the latest recommendations from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.The guidelines suggest people who’ve come in close contact with someone infected with the novel coronavirus can resume normal activity after 10 days if no symptoms have emerged, or seven days if they test negative. That’s down from 14 days.The state Department of Education is expected to give public school systems the green light to follow the relaxed quarantine rules.But the health department is sticking to a 14-day recommendation for prisons and nursing homes where people live together in tight quarters.___NEW ORLEANS — New Orleans may be in store for stricter coronavirus restrictions next week.Mayor LaToya Cantrell said in Monday social media posts that cases are on the rise in the city. Cantrell said that if the numbers don’t look better in one week, more restrictions will be needed.There’s been a sharp increase in the percentage of tests with positive results. The seven-day average, as reported by the city, has gone from around 1% in early November to 3.6% as of Sunday.Cantrell didn’t provide details on what the tighter rules might entail.Restrictions are already tight in a city famous for its hospitality industry and night life. Indoor social gatherings are limited to 75 people and outdoor gatherings to 150 people. Restaurants are limited to half their indoor capacity and bars to 25%, and alcoholic beverage sales end at 11 p.m. Indoor live entertainment remains off-limits.___COLUMBIA, S.C. — With new COVID-19 cases reaching record levels in South Carolina, a teacher group is asking districts to go back to all virtual teaching until this second spike in the virus can be flattened.The plea was given more emotional weight over the weekend after the death of 50-year-old third grade teacher Staci Blakely from COVID-19. Her family asked the school district to announce her death publicly to remind people how serious the disease can be, District Superintendent Greg Little said in a statement.Blakely was a 28-year teaching veteran who was diagnosed with the novel coronavirus on Nov. 11. No one else in her classroom has been infected, the district said.At least four school districts in South Carolina have returned to all virtual learning. Nearly a quarter of the state’s districts are teaching in person every day.When averaged out over seven days, South Carolina is seeing about 2,300 new COVID-19 cases a day. That’s more than during the July peak that saw the state among the nation’s leaders in coronavirus spread.___BERLIN — A panel of medical experts in Germany is recommending that nursing home residents, people over 80 and certain medical personnel in acute and elderly care should receive coronavirus vaccines first when they become available.A draft recommendation released Monday defines some 8.6 million people who would receive a vaccine first. That’s over 10% of the German population.According to the 62-page document, only once those groups have been immunized and if vaccines are still limited should other high risk groups receive the shot.The draft, which still needs to be approved, has a total of six categories grouped according to their risk of serious illness from COVID-19 and the likelihood they might expose others. Teachers belong to the fourth category, while people working in key positions of government, in critical infrastructure and in small stores are in the fifth.All other healthy individuals under 60 — an estimated 45 million people in the country of 83 million — would be last in line for a vaccine.The expert panel says people who have recovered from confirmed infection with COVID-19 do not need to get immunized.___DES MOINES, Iowa — Iowa posted another 35 deaths from the novel coronavirus on Monday, continuing the high level of deaths related to the pandemic.The seven-day rolling average of daily deaths in Iowa has risen over the past two weeks from 29 deaths per day on Nov. 22 to 45 deaths per day on Sunday, according to researchers at Johns Hopkins University.State health officials reported on Monday 912 new cases in the previous 24 hours. State data indicates new case trends have slowed with the average number of daily new cases decreasing by nearly 37% in the past two weeks.Although slowing, the virus spread remains high in Iowa. There were 1,083 new cases per 100,000 people in Iowa over the past two weeks, which ranks 16th in the country for new cases per capita. One in every 195 people in Iowa tested positive in the past week.State data also show positive trends with fewer hospitalized patients at 898 on Monday and fewer people admitted in the previous 24 hours.___VILNIUS, Lithuania — Lithuania’s government began advising people on Monday only to leave home for serious reasons, banned private parties of more than two families, and tightened requirements in shopping centres.The government also directed almost all public sector employees to work from home, after initial measures failed to stop the spread of COVID-19.Shops are urged not to have short-term sales promotions and to have no more than five people stand in a line. Also, only one person per family is recommended to go shopping.People in the southernmost Baltic country will have to celebrate Christmas under the new regulations, which will last until at least the end of the month.A country of almost 3 million, Lithuania managed to curb the first COVID-19 wave but now faces one of the highest surges in Europe per capita with 76,036 total cases and 637 deaths, most of those registered in the last two months.\n",

      "CONTENT : TAIPEI, Taiwan - Chinese vaccine company Sinovac announced Monday that it is planning to complete a new facility to double its annual vaccine production capacity to 600 million doses by the end of the year, while also securing a $500 million investment in a boost to its COVID-19 vaccine development efforts.The company is currently conducting the last stage of clinical trials for its vaccine candidate in Brazil, Turkey and Indonesia and is among the frontrunners of China’ s vaccine efforts. China has at least five COVID-19 vaccine candidates running late stage clinical trials across more than a dozen countries.Sino Biopharmaceutical Ltd., a pharmaceutical conglomerate, bought a 15% stake in Sinovac for an investment of $500 million. The funds will allow the company to “improve our vaccine sales capabilities, expand in Asia markets, develop and access new technologies, and most importantly, accelerate our efforts to help combat the global pandemic,” Sinovac CEO Yin Weidong said in a statement.On Sunday, 1.2 million doses of its experimental vaccine arrived in Indonesia and are expected to be approved for use soon.Sinovac’s candidate is a two-dose inactivated vaccine, an old-school technology in which a live virus is killed and then purified. It can be stored at 2 to 8 C (36 to 46 F), within the range of a normal refrigerator, unlike some other vaccines candidates that require far lower temperatures.Sinovac’s experimental vaccine is currently approved for emergency use in China, although it has not yet obtained final market approval. Under emergency use, it has been distributed to groups the Chinese government deemed suitable, including front-line medical workers and border personnel.The latest public data from the company, published in the science journal Lancet, showed its candidate produced lower levels of antibodies in people than those who have recovered from COVID-19.\n",

This file will be updated throughout the day. Web links to longer stories if available.The latest news on COVID-19 developments in Canada (all times Eastern):12:30 a.m: It’s only going to get worse for Canadians who are already feeling stretched at the grocery store, with food prices set to rise in 2021 due in no small part to COVID-19.The 11th annual Food Price Report, a collaboration between Dalhousie University, the University of Guelph, the University of Saskatchewan and the University of British Columbia, predicts that food prices will rise by three to five per cent next year, outpacing general inflation.The annual cost of groceries for the average Canadian family will go up by five per cent in 2021 — by almost $700, the largest dollar increase the report has yet predicted. That figure doesn’t include restaurant spending and groceries purchased through e-commerce.“It’s going to be a tough year,” said Sylvain Charlebois, a professor in food distribution and policy at Dalhousie University and the report’s lead author.Read the full story from Rosa Saba here. 12:30 a.m.: In the throes of COVID-19’s first wave in Toronto in April, Dr. Meb Rashid remembers a single phone call delivering the results of a 60-person testing sweep at a refugee shelter.Before the tests were done, six residents were flagged by a symptom screen, so some positive test results wouldn’t have been a shock. But when Rashid heard that 25 of the 60 were infected — a whopping 41.6 per cent positivity rate — he was floored.“It was time to pause,” he said, “and then to scramble.”Once the outbreak was over, Rashid and a group of medical workers examined what happened. In their new study — shared exclusively with the Star — they revealed that a dozen residents who weren’t caught by the initial symptom screen, but tested positive, had at least some signs of illness that were caught by an assessment the next day.The findings, the research team said, highlight the need to screen for a diverse slate of symptoms. The study also calls for wider access to testing for shelter residents.Read the full story from Victoria Gibson here. 12 a.m.: U.K. health authorities are rolling out the first doses of a widely tested and independently reviewed COVID-19 vaccine, starting a global immunization program that is expected to gain momentum as more serums win approval.The first shot will come Tuesday at one of a network of hospital hubs around the country where the initial phase of the U.K. program will be rolled out on what has been dubbed “V-Day.”Public health officials are asking the public to be patient because only those who are most at risk from COVID-19 will be vaccinated in the early stages.“I think there’s every chance that we will look back on ... (Tuesday) as marking a decisive turning point in the battle against coronavirus,” said Simon Stevens, the CEO of England’s National Health Service.The first 800,000 doses are going to people over 80 who are either hospitalized or already have outpatient appointments scheduled, along with nursing home workers. Others will have to wait their turn.10:15 p.m.: While the number of active cases in the Maritime provinces has dropped slightly, Premier Andrew Furey confirmed Monday that Newfoundland and Labrador will continue to opt out of the Atlantic bubble at least until the new year.P.E.I. decided last week to extend its decision to stay out of the isolation-free zone for the time being.P.E.I. announced a number of recoveries Monday, bringing its total active cases to 14. Nova Scotia and New Brunswick have 88 and 81 active cases, respectively.Newfoundland announced eight new cases over the weekend, but none on Monday, bringing its number of active cases to 28.“There will not be any changes to Dr. (Janice) Fitzgerald’s special measures order regarding travel from within the Atlantic provinces. The same goes for the borders in Labrador,” Furey said during Monday’s COVID-19 video briefing, referring to the province’s chief medical officer of health.9 p.m.: Vaccines are on their way.The prime minister declared as much Monday at a news conference in which he revealed that Canada is expecting 249,000 doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine this month, weeks earlier than anticipated.Federal officials had originally said we’d be getting six million total doses of that vaccine and another from Moderna between January and March, but that shipments would not arrive until the new year.The Canadian government has spent months (and somewhere in the neighbourhood of a billion dollars) locking down advance-purchase agreements for seven different vaccine candidates, but still, supplies are going to be scarce, at least at first.So who gets it? What’ll it be like? Who is first?The Star’s Alex Boyd helps answer some of your biggest vaccine questions here.9 p.m. (Updated): Nursing-home residents in Ontario are at risk of missing out on the first COVID-19 vaccines because of “stability” concerns in transporting the Pfizer vaccine once it arrives, provincial officials say. The caution came as Premier Doug Ford revealed who is first in line for injections and Ontario set its third record high for new cases in as many days with 1,925 more people testing positive for the virus.As expected, the first phase of shots will go to residents, staff and essential caregivers at nursing homes, retirement homes and other congregate settings, health-care workers such as hospital employees, Indigenous communities and adults receiving home health care for chronic conditions.The second phase for the rest of the population is not expected to begin until April, with priorities for who will get injections to be set later, and will take six to nine months. The plan is to do injections at central sites, requiring people to travel to them.That’s why nursing-home residents may have to wait a few weeks for the next and more stable vaccine from Moderna. It all depends on final guidance from Pfizer, said Ontario Health Minister Christine Elliott. Read the full story from Rob Ferguson here. 9 p.m.: COVID-19 restrictions in British Columbia have been extended to Jan. 8 as the transmission and community spread of the illness remain high, said provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry.The rules that were set to expire after two weeks have had an impact on case numbers, she said, but B.C. has not yet reached a point where the restrictions can be loosened.The ongoing restrictions will save lives, said Henry, after announcing another 35 people have died, pushing the death toll in B.C. to 527.There were 2,020 new cases of the illness detected between Friday and Monday, including 1,362 in the hard-hit Fraser Health region. Henry said the Interior and Northern health regions are also recording increases.B.C. has confirmed 9,380 active infections.9 p.m.: The bylaw is clear on homeless encampments in Toronto: Illegal.Which has not prevented the mushrooming of tent clusters across the city, particularly since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic 10 months ago, writes Rosie DiManno. Sixty-nine camps, 423 tents, plus 18 known locations in transportation right-of-ways — beneath overpasses, tracts of land where the public has rights to cross, and the like.That’s according to new interim figures on Shelter Access Data Indicators and Trends, presented Monday to the city’s economic, community and development committee, with dozens of deputants stacked up to speak at the virtual city hall meeting. More specifically, to demand a moratorium on encampment evictions.Encampments are profoundly unsafe. They’re ugly. Their very presence is an indictment of Toronto’s ongoing and escalating homelessness crisis. And yet, I cannot disagree with the moratorium chorus arising from advocates, ever-so-earnest do-gooders, street preachers and streets nurses, enablers, homeless-huggers — the whole righteous congregation of activists who endlessly shame the city for its purported cold heart, a dearth of compassion for the most unfortunate souls amongst us.Read Rosie DiManno’s full column here. 7:35 p.m.: As cases of COVID-19 continue to rise in hot spots in the province, experts are once again warning that hospitals may have to cancel elective surgeries in order to cope.There are parts of the province — Mississauga, Etobicoke and North York — where nearly 25 per cent of patients in intensive care have COVID-19, said Anthony Dale, president and CEO of the Ontario Hospital Association.Although hospitals still have beds available, Dale said the province’s intensive care units typically operate close to capacity, which means a surge of COVID-19 patients might push them over the edge and threaten elective surgeries once again, similar to what occurred during the first wave.Read on for the Star’s weekly roundup of key figures in the province’s fight against COVID-19, including a look at how regions that saw their restrictions tightened Monday are faring, along with expert commentary.Read the breakdown from Patty Winsa and Kenyon Wallace here. 6 p.m.: Deputy ministers are officially named by the prime minister, but there’s no doubt Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland had a hand in Michael Sabia’s appointment as the top fiscal policy bureaucrat — an unconventional choice that has left many on Parliament Hill either ecstatic or puzzled, writes Star Columnist Heather Scoffield. By all accounts, he has been on speed-dial with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau throughout the pandemic, not just in his capacity at the infrastructure bank but as a voice of reason and deep experience.He will bring fresh thinking, energy and connections to the Department of Finance as he becomes the top civil servant designing the recovery, with up to $100 billion in hand to revitalize Canada’s economy.He will also invite suspicion from the opposition. By convention, civil servants are nearly invisible to the public, speaking truth to power from their protected perches in the bureaucracy. Sabia has a high profile, well-known and sometimes provocative views, and he knows his way around Liberal circles. Read Heather Scoffield’s column here. 5:55 p.m.: Alberta is reporting 1,735 new cases of COVID-19.The daily number is down slightly from yesterday, when it was 1,836.The province also says another 16 residents have died from the novel coronavirus.It says 609 people are in hospital, with 108 in intensive care.5:55 p.m.: Monday was one of the most hopeful days since the COVID-19 pandemic upended our lives, but also one of the most worrisome.The source of the hope is obvious: hundreds of thousands of doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine are to start arriving in Canada next week. If all goes as planned, it looks like the first Canadians to be vaccinated will get their shots before Christmas.The government said “up to” 249,000 doses of the Pfizer vaccine will arrive by the end of December, enough to vaccinate half that number of people (it takes two doses to provide protection against COVID). It’s barely a start toward immunizing the entire population of 37 million, but it is a start. And nine long months into the pandemic, that counts for a very great deal.But Monday was also a worrisome day, and the source of the worry was obvious as well. As Trudeau was announcing the early arrival of the Pfizer vaccine, others were reporting numbers that make it all too clear that this disease is far from done.Read the full Star editorial here. 5:11 p.m.: Less than 20 days from Christmas and two weeks into a lockdown, Toronto’s top doctor was not certain about the current measures being lifted even after the holidays.Dr. Eileen de Villa continued implore residents to stay apart through December and New Year’s and not gather for dinners, parties and other celebrations — apart from those that already live together, and for those that live alone, one exclusive household.“In our own lives, risky in-home festivities will easily make things worse and already I’m as worried now by what may happen in January as I am about the rest of this month,” de Villa told reporters Monday at a regular briefing.But when asked directly if the lockdown, which began Nov. 23, will continue beyond December, de Villa said it is “too early to make pronouncements around how long our restrictions should be in place.”“I think what is well within scope for all of us is to really think very seriously about the changes we need to make to our routine holiday celebrations and festivities, as difficult as that is.”Read the full story from Jennifer Pagliaro here. 5 p.m.: Toronto residents are tired of the constraints imposed by COVID-19, but still strongly support public health restrictions needed to control the spread of the virus, according to a poll conducted for Toronto Public Health.The Ipsos Reid online survey of 1,201 people conducted during the last week of October, before the second lockdown took effect on Nov. 23, found that 56 per cent of respondents reported being tired of COVID-19 precautions and 39 per cent were angry/frustrated.Despite that, 43 per cent strongly supported the idea of a second lockdown and 40 per cent were somewhat supportive, putting total support for continuing restrictions at 83 per cent.A full 90 per cent of respondents agreed with the statement: “We need to take whatever measures are necessary to control the spread of COVID-19 and reduce the number of deaths.”Read the full story from Francine Kopun here. 4:30 p.m.: A vaccine has been a hope for many locked in, exhausted people grappling with this ongoing, terrible pandemic and now, at last, today we learned an option for vaccination is a lot closer than we thought.During the pandemic, there has been a lot of buzz, curiosity and questions around vaccines and we have one of Health Canada’s top doctors to shed light.Dr. Supriya Sharma is chief medical adviser at Health Canada and is overseeing the team working on vaccine approvals. Today, she’s joins “This Matters” to talk about how COVID-19 vaccines are being assessed and what it will be like to take one.Check out today’s episode of This Matters here. 3:30 p.m.: Quebec says the first doses of COVID-19 vaccine could be administered in the province as early as next week.Health Minister Christian Dube says the province plans to give its first doses of the Pfizer vaccine to about 2,000 people in long-term care homes.Dube says Quebec also expects to receive enough Pfizer vaccines between Dec. 21 and Jan. 4 to vaccinate between 22,000 and 28,000 people over that period.3:08 p.m.: Nova Scotia is reporting eight new cases of COVID-19 and now has 90 active cases.Health officials say four of the new cases are in the Halifax area, including a case reported at Ian Forsyth Elementary School in Dartmouth.The other three cases are close contacts of previously reported cases.Two other cases are reported in the western zone, including one at Berwick and District School and one related to travel outside of Atlantic Canada, while the remaining two cases are in the eastern zone.One of the eastern zone cases is travel-related while the other is under investigation. 2:30 p.m. (updated): Ontario says the first phase of its COVID-19 vaccination rollout will see vulnerable seniors, their caregivers, and health-care workers among the first to receive the shot.Premier Doug Ford says in addition to those groups, adults in Indigenous communities, retirement homes, and recipients of chronic home health-care will also be priority groups.Retired Gen. Rick Hiller, who is leading Ontario’s vaccine task force, says the province will receive 2.4 million doses during the first three months of 2021.The province may need to set up vaccination centres as it is still unsure of logistics surrounding the transportation of doses.Hillier says the vaccine will be more broadly available to the public starting in April, saying it will take between six to nine months to distribute across the province.He says the third and final phase of the plan would then see the vaccine available through places like pharmacies on a regular basis.2:15 p.m.: Toronto has 651 new COVID-19 cases, the city’s top doctor reported Monday.Dr. Eileen de Villa told reporters that there are 227 patients in the hospital, with 57 in the ICU. The case count is so high, she says, that “it’s a very, very serious concern.”She said she doesn’t want to contemplate what the case counts would have been without a lockdown.2 p.m. Dozens of public health and economics experts called on Quebec Monday to institute a temporary COVID-19 lockdown this month as new infections surpassed 1,500 for the third straight day.More than 75 experts signed an open letter published in Montreal’s La Presse recommending that all non-essential businesses be closed for two weeks to stem the spread of the virus.Pierre-Carl Michaud, an economics professor at Universite de Montreal’s HEC business school and one of the signatories, said a December lockdown would do less damage to the economy than one in the new year.“We think it would be wise to synchronize a short lockdown — short but effective lockdown — with the holidays,” Michaud said in an interview.1:57 p.m. Manitoba is reporting 325 new COVID-19 cases and 12 additional deaths.Chief public health officer Dr. Brent Roussin says the health-care system continues to face a heavy workload and people must stay home as much as possible.Roussin is also urging snowbirds and other winter travellers to cancel all non-essential travel this season.1:55 p.m. Public Health officials in New Brunswick are reporting two new cases of COVID-19.The cases involve one person in their 40s in the Fredericton region and a person in their 70s in the Edmundston area.Both cases are self-isolating and under investigation.There are currently 81 active cases in the province and there have been 536 cases since the pandemic began.1:51 p.m. Halifax police have charged a gym in Bedford, N.S., for failing to comply with recently instituted COVID-19 rules.Officers say they received a call this morning about a facility that was staffed and had customers training inside, which goes against recent measures that ordered the closure of all fitness establishments in the region.The business, which was not named in the news release, was given a ticket for failing to adhere to the Emergency Measures Act, which carries a fine of $7,500.1:50 p.m.: The president of a hospital in Waterloo region says all three hospitals in the area are currently experiencing a COVID-19 outbreak, leading to a concern about the facilities’ ability to maintain services.Lee Fairclough, president of St. Mary’s General Hospital, says her facility declared an outbreak on Sunday that has been linked to five patients and two staff.Fairclough says she’s concerned about the surge of COVID-19 in the community and the current outbreaks at all three of Waterloo region’s hospitals.She says the situation has the potential to affect bed capacity and the ability to maintain services such as scheduled surgeries and other procedures.Waterloo public health officials declared an initial outbreak at the Grand River Hospital last month, and the hospital declared another outbreak on Monday.An outbreak at the region’s Cambridge Memorial Hospital was declared on Nov. 13.1:50 p.m. Newfoundland and Labrador public health officials say the Pfizer vaccine will be arriving in the province next week.Premier Andrew Furey says he expects 1,950 doses of the Pfizer vaccine to arrive in St. John’s next week, with another shipment expected later in the month.Furey says two thermal shippers for the vaccine should arrive in the province on Wednesday or Thursday of this week.In the meantime, Furey says the province will not be rejoining the so-called Atlantic bubble and all visitors to the province will be required to self-isolate for 14 days whether they’re from Atlantic Canada or not.1:44 p.m. One of the largest school divisions in Saskatchewan is moving to remote learning as classrooms deal with a spike in COVID-19 infections.Regina Public Schools says students will take classes from home next week, the final week before schools break for the holidays.It says students will continue learning remotely when the break ends on Jan. 4, and the plan is to have them to return to classrooms Jan. 11.The division say the change impacts all of its schools and students in all grades.Teachers, in the meantime, will continue working in schools.1:30 p.m. (to be updated): The first people to get COVID-19 vaccine in Ontario will be health-care workers, residents, staff, essential caregivers, and other employees of congregate living settings, adults in remote Indigenous communities, and those receiving chronic home health care.12:03 p.m. Three members of the Toronto Raptors organization tested positive for COVID-19 during the league-mandated testing period ahead of the NBA’s training camp, a statement released by the organization said. The members of the organization who tested positive, who were not named, are continuing to self-isolate away from the rest of the team. Followup testing has so far shown that there was no spread to the rest of the organization, the statement added.The Star’s Doug Smith has the story.11:44 a.m. (updated): Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says the largest mass immunization effort in Canadian history could begin as early as next week, as tough new measures to slow the spread of COVID-19 took effect in Prince Edward Island and Ontario hit a new daily infection record.Trudeau said Monday that by the end of December, Ottawa expects to receive up to 249,000 doses of the COVID-19 vaccine developed by U.S. pharmaceutical giant Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech.Health Canada approval is expected this week and first shipments are on track to arrive next week.Immunization requires two doses administered weeks apart, so the initial batch would be enough for nearly 125,000 Canadians.The vaccine, which must be stored in ultracold temperatures, is to be delivered to 14 sites across the country, with doses divvied up among the provinces on a per capita basis. Maj.-Gen. Dany Fortin, the former NATO commander in charge of the vaccine rollout, said it takes a day or two to thaw and prepare the vaccine.Ottawa has said previously that it aimed to immunize three million Canadians during the first three months of 2021, with vulnerable people, like seniors and certain health-care workers, first in line.The Star’s Tonda MacCharles has the story.11:10 a.m.: Ontario is reporting an additional 138 cases in public schools across the province, bringing the total in the last two weeks to 1,526 and 5,402 overall since school began.In its latest data released Monday morning, the province reported 109 more students were infected for a total of 1,252 in the last two weeks, since school began there have been an overall total of 3,531.The data shows there are 29 more staff members infected for a total of 273 the last two weeks — and an overall total of 783.There are 803 schools with a reported case, which the province notes is 16.63 per cent of the 4,828 public schools in Ontario.Ten schools were closed because of an outbreak, two more than the previous day — and the highest number reported so far. The data doesn’t indicate where they are. The data reported Monday is current as of 2 p.m. Friday and doesn’t include weekend reports and the source of transmission.The Toronto District School Board updates its information on current COVID-19 cases throughout the day on its website. As of 8 p.m. Sunday, there were 381 students infected, 84 staff and 523 resolved cases.The Toronto Catholic District School Board also updates its information on its website. As of 10:25 a.m. Monday, there were 62 schools with at least one active case. There are 91 active student cases and 13 staff.Epidemiologists have told the Star that the rising numbers in the schools aren’t a surprise, and that the cases will be proportionate to the amount of COVID that is in the community.11:10 a.m.: Nunavut is reporting three new cases of COVID-19.It says the infections are in Arviat, bringing that community’s active case total to 49.Located along the west coast of Hudson Bay, Arviat has been the worst hit by the pandemic since the territory recorded its first case in November.The community remains under lockdown measures.11:08 a.m.: Quebec is reporting 1,577 new cases of COVID-19 today and 22 additional deaths linked to the virus, three of which took place in the last 24 hours.Health officials say provincewide hospitalizations increased by 40 for a total of 818.Of those, 105 people are in intensive care, an increase of three compared to the day before.Quebec has now reported 153,176 COVID-19 cases and 7,277 deaths since the start of the pandemic.10:30 a.m. (updated): Ontario is reporting 1,925 new cases of COVID-19 today, and 26 deaths related to the virus.That’s a record high for new cases of the novel coronavirus in the province, topping yesterday’s daily total by one.Health Minister Christine Elliott says there are 601 new cases in Toronto, 512 in Peel Region, and 167 in York Region.She also says there are 1,412 more resolved cases since the last daily update and nearly 45,300 tests completed in that time.Today’s daily update brings Ontario up to a total of 129,234 COVID-19 cases, 109,402 resolved and 3,798 deaths.9:20 a.m. Premier Doug Ford is expected to make an announcement about Ontario’s COVID-19 vaccine plans this afternoon.Ford will be holding a news conference with General Rick Hillier, chair of the COVID-19 vaccine distribution task force.They will be joined by Health Minister Christine Elliott and Solicitor General Sylvia Jones at Queen’s Park.Elliott has said Ontario will receive 1.6 million doses of the new vaccine from Pfizer and 800,000 doses from Moderna in early 2021.8:40 a.m. Knowing that she’ll be spending Christmas alone, Sjoukje van Beek, a graduate student at the University of Victoria, recently tried to make her studio apartment feel a bit more homey. She went to the thrift store, picked up one four-dollar and one six-dollar Christmas tree, plus some festive garland.Normally, van Beek, 25, would be on a plane heading home to Waterloo, Ont., to enjoy the company of family and indulge in her mother’s Feast of the Seven Fishes cooking wizardry. But not this year.“I think I’m just sad. It’s a stressful time of year, in terms of exams. I’m excited to be done with that. But it’s ... sorry I’m going to start crying ...”She pauses to explain that her online classes at least afforded her a bit of human connection. Now, those have ended for the term.Read the full story from the Star’s Alex McKeen and Douglas Quan 8:33 a.m. Jan Willis found herself in Puerto Vallarta when COVID-19 was declared a worldwide pandemic in March. Before she could return to her native British Columbia, the 66-year-old was met with a flurry of cruise passengers, most of them sick with the virus.“I’m fairly certain that’s where I caught it,” Willis said.When she returned to her hometown of Victoria, her doctor told her to self-isolate immediately. Early on in the pandemic, there was no widespread testing and Willis was declared a presumptive case of COVID-19.Alongside physical symptoms, including lung issues, body pains and diarrhea, Willis also experienced psychiatric symptoms. The most severe, she said, was a hallucination she had of a cloud hanging above her a few weeks after her diagnosis, which then proceeded to enter her, causing a wave of sadness.Read the full story from the Star’s Nadine Yousif7:51 a.m. For a fleeting moment this summer, Kassandra Grainger lived indoors.She packed her things from Toronto’s Moss Park, and followed a path encouraged by city officials — accepting a space in a nearby hotel it was using as a shelter.Grainger said she’d been homeless since leaving an unhealthy relationship. Before coming to the park, she’d worried about sleeping places with enough visibility to be safe, noting that being in public places is an important consideration for homeless women living outside.“Anywhere where there’s a gathering, somewhere where other people can see me. That way, if something’s being done wrong to me, then hopefully somebody would’ve been able to help,” she said. “We have to, because we’re the vulnerable ones. We’re taken advantage of more than a man.”Read the full story from Victoria Gibson6:55 a.m.: Chinese vaccine company Sinovac announced Monday that it is planning to complete a new facility to double its annual vaccine production capacity to 600 million doses by the end of the year, while also securing a $500 million investment in a boost to its COVID-19 vaccine development efforts.The company is currently conducting the last stage of clinical trials for its vaccine candidate in Brazil, Turkey and Indonesia and is among the front-runners of China’s vaccine efforts. China has at least five COVID-19 vaccine candidates running late stage clinical trials across more than a dozen countries.Sino Biopharmaceutical Ltd., a pharmaceutical conglomerate, bought a 15% stake in Sinovac for an investment of $500 million. The funds will allow the company to “improve our vaccine sales capabilities, expand in Asia markets, develop and access new technologies, and most importantly, accelerate our efforts to help combat the global pandemic,” Sinovac CEO Yin Weidong said in a statement.On Sunday, 1.2 million doses of its experimental vaccine arrived in Indonesia and are expected to be approved for use soon.5:57 a.m.: Toronto District School Board announced on Sunday that Fraser Mustard Early Learning Academy, located in the Thorncliffe Park neighbourhood, will be closed for students and staff until Dec. 14.The early learning academy, which has around 650 students divided into 23 kindergarten classes as well as a daycare centre, was closed on the advice of Toronto Public Health to allow them “time to finish investigating and conducting additional COVID-19 testing,” a TDSB tweet read.This makes Fraser Mustard the second TDSB school currently closed due to students testing positive for COVID-19. The school has seven confirmed cases among students, with one case resolved, according to the TDSB dashboard.This closure comes soon after Thorncliffe Park Public School, an adjoining TDSB primary school, which was the first site of the province’s voluntary mass asymptomatic testing program, also closed due to climbing number of cases among staff and students.In Woodbridge, Father Bressini Catholic High School in the York Catholic District School Board has suspended in-person classes for two weeks, until Dec. 18.Read Akrit Michael’s full report.5:44 a.m.: Ontario’s auditor general is set to release her annual report Monday.Bonnie Lysyk’s report will detail 13 value-for-money audits and one review.Among them is an audit of virtual patient care in Ontario, which her office notes has ramped up in recent years — especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.Lysyk assessed the accessibility, equitability and cost-effectiveness of Ontario’s virtual care options.She’s also set to weigh in on the Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario, assessing whether it regulates sectors such as the province’s horse-racing industry and cannabis retail stores in line with legislative rules.The annual update comes less than two weeks after Lysyk released a special report into the province’s pandemic response, which found that it was slower and more reactive than that of other provinces.The governing Tories took issue with many parts of the report, with Premier Doug Ford dismissing it as “21 pages of inaccuracies” while accusing Lysyk of overstepping her authority.“Stick with looking for value for money, stick with the job that we hired you for,” he said.5:43 a.m.: British Columbia politicians return to the legislature today for a brief session after the October election that gave the New Democrat’s a majority government.Premier John Horgan says they’ll use the session to make good on an election promise to provide one-time, tax-free payments of $1,000 to eligible families and $500 to individuals to help people get through the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic.Horgan says he expects the session, which will start with a throne speech, will last about two weeks.The premier says the pandemic recovery payments will stimulate spending and help the B.C. economy.Interim Liberal Leader Shirley Bond says her Opposition members will push the New Democrats to address troubles beyond the pandemic recovery fund, especially on the issue of the province’s finances.Horgan’s New Democrats won 57 of the 87 seats in the legislature, while the Liberals lost more than a dozen seats, prompting Andrew Wilkinson to resign as leader.5:42 a.m.: Tighter public health restrictions come into effect in three Ontario regions today in a bid to stem the spread of COVID-19.Middlesex-London and Thunder Bay will move into the “orange” zone of the province’s colour-coded, tiered pandemic response plan.The Haliburton, Kawartha, Pine Ridge District Health Unit moves to the “yellow” category.The change to orange includes restrictions on visitors to long-term care homes and beefed up testing in the facilities.The change to yellow includes limiting events and social gatherings to 10 people indoors and 25 outdoors, while organized public events are limited to 50 people indoors and 100 outdoors.The measures will remain in place for at least 28 days.5:41 a.m.: One Atlantic province is introducing aggressive new public health rules today, as another loosens its COVID-19 restrictions.Prince Edward Island Premier Dennis King announced yesterday that the province would enter a two-week “circuit-breaker” lockdown today.The move is an effort to curb community spread of the novel coronavirus, as King says contact tracing has been difficult.New Brunswick, meanwhile, is lifting restrictions in Moncton and Fredericton thanks to a declining COVID-19 caseload.The two areas will return to the less restrictive “yellow” level of precautions.But officials in New Brunswick are reminding residents that the situation in other provinces remains grim, so it’s not yet safe to let loose.5:40 a.m.: Are you feeling tired and weary dealing with the same problems every day? You likely wake up thinking about COVID-19. Then you crawl out of bed and view the numbers on TV. Next, you gauge how you’ll cope for the next 24 hours.You know you have coronavirus burnout. You need some changes, but what can you do differently?In order to cope, while we’re all waiting to turn the corner, try focusing on the vaccine that’s coming. It’s the first real hope we’ve had in months. Then, get busy making some small changes in your life.“The pandemic is causing something akin to boredom on steroids,” says a psychologist we’ll call Thomas.Thomas goes on to explain it this way: “Eating chocolate pie over and over will make you sick. People need variety in their lives.”To pull yourself out of burnout mode, try these changes:— Keep a notebook of nice things to do for yourself. The list might include something as simple as going for a hike or driving in the country for a couple of hours. List affordable, achievable activities or rituals (such as calling old friends) you’ve neglected to do. Again, strive for variety.— Improve your environment. We all grow tired of our home decor, furniture, and yard landscaping. Do something simple such as painting some furniture, cleaning out your closets, or buying a gas firepit for your patio.— Make a contribution to a non-profit in your community. Volunteer to pack boxes of food for a food bank or design a webpage to help families connect with free medical care. Invest your time in something larger than yourself at least once a week.— Learn something you’ve neglected to pursue in the past. For example, pull out that guitar you bought years ago and learn some chords. Or, ask your daughter to teach you how to use technology to set up a group chat with your friends.Working harder and harder will not fix burnout. This just creates a feeling of spinning your wheels.5:39 a.m.: As the coronavirus epidemic worsens, U.S. health experts hope Joe Biden’s administration will put in place something Donald Trump’s has not — a comprehensive national testing strategy.Such a strategy, they say, could systematically check more people for infections and spot surges before they take off. The health experts say it would be an improvement from the current practice, which has professional athletes and students at elite universities getting routine tests while many other Americans stand in line for hours — if they get tested at all.“We have had no strategy for this virus. Our strategy has been no strategy,” said Dr. Michael Mina, a Harvard University researcher focused on use of testing to track disease.Some experts say the lack of such a system is one reason for the current national explosion in cases, hospitalizations and deaths.“If we’d had a more robust approach and testing was scaled up as one of the tools, I think much of this third surge would have been avoidable,” said Dr. Grant Colfax, director of the San Francisco Department of Public Health.There are differing opinions on what such a strategy should look like, but many experts say rapid and at-home tests should be used so Americans can check themselves and stay away from others if they test positive.The president-elect has endorsed that strategy, called for making testing free for all Americans, and said government experts at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other agencies should be empowered to co-ordinate the entire effort.“The reality is we’re not testing enough today,” Dr. Marcella Nunez-Smith, co-chair of Biden’s coronavirus advisory board, told The Associated Press this week.His transition team so far has not gone into further detail.5:37 a.m.: South Korea’s health minister said Monday that the Seoul metropolitan area is now a “COVID-19 war zone,” as the country reported another 615 new infections and the virus appeared to be spreading faster.The country has recorded more than 5,300 new infections in the past 10 days and Monday was the 30th day in a row of triple-digit daily jumps.Most of the new infections were detected in the Seoul metropolitan area where health workers are struggling to stem transmissions tied to various places, including restaurants, schools, hospitals and long-term care facilities.“The capital area is now a COVID-19 war zone,” Health Minister Park Neung-hoo said in a virus meeting, pleading for citizen vigilance.He said the country may have to further increase social distancing to prevent the resurgence in the capital area from “exploding into a major outbreak nationwide and collapsing the health-care system.”While South Korea managed to contain a major outbreak in its southeastern region in spring by channelling nationwide health resources and personnel, it’s less clear where the reinforcements will come if the virus wreaks havoc in the densely-populated capital area, where half of the country’s 51 million people live.While President Moon Jae-in’s government had been eager to tout the country’s previous gains against the virus, there’s criticism that it gambled on its own success by moving quickly to ease social distancing restrictions to the lowest level in October even as the virus was still spreading.5:36 a.m.: It’s back to school again for some New York City schoolchildren, weeks after the schools were closed to in-person learning because of rising COVID-19 infections.The city’s public school system, which shut down in-person learning earlier this month, will bring back on Monday preschool students and children in kindergarten through fifth grade whose parents chose a mix of in-school and remote learning. Special education students in all grades who have particularly complex needs will be welcomed back starting Thursday.Middle school and high school will remain all remote at least until after the holiday break, Mayor Bill de Blasio has said.De Blasio announced Nov. 18 that public school buildings would close because the city had crossed a threshold set earlier of 3 per cent of all the coronavirus tests performed over a seven-day period coming back positive.The rate of positive COVID-19 tests is now over 5 per cent, according to the city’s figures, but de Blasio has said it’s safe to reopen schools with beefed-up testing protocols — in part because few infections have been linked to the schools.“We have facts now for two straight months of extraordinarily low levels of transmission in our schools, our schools are clearly safer,” de Blasio said on WNYC radio on Friday. “This is what our health care leaders say. Our schools are safer than pretty much any place else in New York City. So, I really think everyone in the school community can feel secure because so many measures are in place to protect everyone.”5:34 a.m.: President Donald Trump says his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani has tested positive for the coronavirus, making him the latest in Trump’s inner circle to contract the disease that is now surging across the U.S.Giuliani was exhibiting some symptoms and was admitted Sunday to Georgetown University Medical Center in Washington, according to a person familiar with the matter who was not authorized to speak publicly.The 76-year-old former New York mayor has travelled extensively to battleground states in an effort to help Trump subvert his election loss. On numerous occasions he has met with officials for hours at a time without wearing a mask.Trump, who announced Giuliani’s positive test in a Sunday afternoon tweet, wished him a speedy recovery.“Get better soon Rudy, we will carry on!!!” Trump wrote.Giuliani did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but on Sunday evening he retweeted Trump’s announcement of his diagnosis. He also tweeted thanks to a conservative writer who had said he was praying for Giuliani.Giuliani attended a hearing at the Georgia Capitol on Thursday where he went without a mask for several hours. Several state senators, all Republicans, also did not wear masks at the hearing.Monday 5:32 a.m.: President-elect Joe Biden has picked California Attorney General Xavier Becerra to be his health secretary, putting a defender of the Affordable Care Act in a leading role to oversee his administration’s coronavirus response.Separately, Biden picked a Harvard infectious disease expert, Dr. Rochelle Walensky, to head the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.If confirmed by the Senate, Becerra, 62, will be the first Latino to head the Department of Health and Human Services, a $1-trillion-plus agency with 80,000 employees and a portfolio that includes drugs and vaccines, leading-edge medical research and health insurance programs covering more than 130 million Americans.Biden’s selection of Becerra was confirmed Sunday by two people familiar with the decision, who spoke on condition of anonymity ahead of a formal announcement anticipated Tuesday.Two people also anonymously confirmed the choice of Walensky. The post of CDC director does not require Senate confirmation.Becerra, as the State of California’s top lawyer, has led the coalition of Democratic states defending “Obamacare” from the Trump administration’s latest effort to overturn it, a legal case awaiting a Supreme Court decision next year.A former senior House Democrat, Becerra was involved in steering the Obama health law through Congress in 2009 and 2010. At the time he would tell reporters that one of his primary motivations was having tens of thousands of uninsured people in his Southern California district.Becerra has a lawyer’s precise approach to analyzing problems and a calm demeanour.But overseeing the coronavirus response will be the most complicated task he has ever contemplated. By next year, the U.S. will be engaged in a mass vaccination campaign, the groundwork for which has been laid under the Trump administration. Although the vaccines appear very promising, and no effort has been spared to plan for their distribution, it’s impossible to tell yet how well things will go when it’s time to get shots in the arms of millions of Americans.Becerra won’t be going it alone. Biden, who is expected to announce key health care picks as early as Tuesday, is taking a team approach to his administration’s virus response.Businessman Jeff Zients is expected to be named as Biden’s White House coronavirus co-ordinator. An economic adviser to former President Barack Obama, Zients also led the rescue of the HealthCare.gov website after its disastrous launch in 2013. And former Surgeon General Vivek Murthy, a co-chair of Biden’s coronavirus task force, is expected to return in a new role akin to the top medical adviser.But the core components of HHS are the boots on the ground of the government’s coronavirus response. The Food and Drug Administration oversees vaccines and treatments, while much of the underlying scientific and medical research comes from NIH. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention takes the lead in detecting and containing the spread of diseases. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services provides insurance coverage for more than 1 in 3 Americans, including vulnerable seniors, as well as many children and low-income people.Read Sunday’s coronavirus file.\n",

      "CONTENT : BEIJING - China’s politically sensitive trade surplus soared to a record $75.4 billion in November as exports surged 21.1% over a year earlier, propelled by American consumer demand.Exports to the United States rose 46% despite lingering tariff hikes in a trade war with Washington, customs data showed Monday.Total exports rose to $268 billion, accelerating from October’s 11.4% growth. Imports gained 5% to $192.6 billion, up from the previous month’s 4.7%.Chinese exporters have benefited from the economy’s relatively early reopening after the Communist Party declared the coronavirus pandemic under control in March while foreign competitors still are hampered by anti-disease controls.“Exports were much stronger than expected in November,” said Julian Evans-Pritchard of Capital Economics in a report.Forecasters say that surge is unlikely to last into 2021 once coronavirus vaccines are rolled out.“We expect export performance to be less impressive,” said Louis Kuijs of Oxford Economics in a report.China’s global trade surplus for the first 11 months of 2020 is $460 billion, up 21.4% from this time last year, already one of the highest ever recorded.Exports to the United States rose to $51.9 billion while imports of American goods gained 33% to $14.6 billion. The trade surplus with the United States swelled 52% over a year earlier to $37.3 billion.Beijing promised to buy more American soybeans, natural gas and other exports as part of the “Phase 1” agreement signed in January and aimed at ending a costly tariff battle over Chinese technology ambitions. China fell behind on meeting those commitments earlier in the year but is catching up as demand rebounds.The two governments agreed to postpone further planned tariff hikes on each other’s goods but most penalties already imposed on billions of dollars of imports stayed in place.Chinese imports are growing faster by volume than by value because demand has been chilled by the shutdown of travel and industry, driving prices lower.China is on track to become the only major economy to grow this year while activity in the United States, Europe and Japan falls.China’s economy shrank by 6.8% from a year earlier in the first three months of 2020 after factories, shops and offices were shut down to fight the virus. Growth rebounded to 3.2% in the second quarter and accelerated to 4.9% in the three months ending in September.Automakers and other large manufacturers are back to normal activity, helping to drive demand for imported iron ore, copper and other raw materials. Retail sales are back above pre-virus levels and rose 4.3% over a year earlier in October.Also in November, exports to the 27-nation European Union rose 8.6% over a year ago to $37.5 billion while imports of European goods gained 4.5% to $26.2 billion. China’s trade surplus with Europe widened by 20% to $11.3 billion.___General Administration of Customs of China (in Chinese): www.customs.gov.cn\n",

      "CONTENT : Hong Kong authorities arrested eight people Monday in connection with an unauthorized protest at a university campus last month, amid a widening crackdown on dissent in the semi-autonomous Chinese territory.The arrests were made in relation to a demonstration at the Chinese University of Hong Kong in which more than 100 people protested a decision to hold graduation ceremonies online. Such ceremonies are often used as a way for students to express political views.Some protesters had called for Hong Kong’s independence, and held up signs that read “Liberate Hong Kong, Revolution of our times,” which are considered to have secessionist notions and are outlawed under the city’s national security law.Police said they arrested eight people for an unauthorized protest and inciting secession, but did not specify who they were.“We only arrested those who were shouting slogans, displaying flags that involved some national security concerns,” Li Kwai-wah, senior superintendent of police of Hong Kong’s National Security Department, said at a news conference.Arthur Yeung, a graduate from the university who also ran in the city’s district council elections last year, is suspected to be among those arrested. A post on Yeung’s Facebook page said he was arrested at his home on Monday morning.Two district councillors, Isaac Lee and Eason Chan, were also arrested, according to posts on their respective Facebook pages.The eight arrested are currently being investigated by national security officers, according to local newspaper South China Morning Post, which cited unnamed sources.The arrests come as Hong Kong and Beijing have increasingly clamped down on dissent in the city, following Beijing’s imposition of a national security law in Hong Kong in June aimed at curbing months of political unrest and anti-government protests last year.The crackdown has prompted accusations that Beijing is violating the autonomy it promised when the former British colony was returned to China in 1997. It also has triggered warnings that the ruling Communist Party is damaging Hong Kong’s appeal as a global business centre and one of Asia’s most dynamic cities.In response, the U.S. has imposed sanctions on more than 10 Hong Kong and mainland Chinese officials, including Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam.Asked about a report that the U.S. might sanction more officials, a Chinese government spokesperson in Beijing said that China would respond to any U.S. action with countermeasures.“We have made it clear many times that China has always resolutely opposed and strongly condemned U.S. interference in China’s internal affairs and the so-called sanctions against Chinese personnel on the basis of the Hong Kong issue,” foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said.\n",

      "CONTENT : SEOUL, Korea, Republic Of - South Korea’s health minister said Monday that the Seoul metropolitan area is now a “COVID-19 war zone,” as the country reported another 615 new infections and the virus appeared to be spreading faster.The country has recorded more than 5,300 new infections in the past 10 days and Monday was the 30th day in a row of triple-digit daily jumps.Most of the new infections were detected in the Seoul metropolitan area where health workers are struggling to stem transmissions tied to various places, including restaurants, schools, hospitals and long-term care facilities.“The capital area is now a COVID-19 war zone,” Health Minister Park Neung-hoo said in a virus meeting, pleading for citizen vigilance.He said the country may have to further increase social distancing to prevent the resurgence in the capital area from “exploding into a major outbreak nationwide and collapsing the health-care system.”While South Korea managed to contain a major outbreak in its southeastern region in spring by channeling nationwide health resources and personnel, it’s less clear where the reinforcements will come if the virus wreaks havoc in the densely-populated capital area, where half of the country’s 51 million people live.While President Moon Jae-in’s government had been eager to tout the country’s previous gains against the virus, there’s criticism that it gambled on its own success by moving quickly to ease social distancing restrictions to the lowest level in October even as the virus was still spreading.Officials have moved to restore some restrictions in the capital area in in recent weeks, shutting down nightclubs, karaoke rooms and gyms, reducing in-person school classes and allowing restaurants to provide only deliveries and take-outs after 9 p.m.In other developments in the region:— Authorities have completed a third round of coronavirus tests in China’s northeastern city of Manzhouli, where three new cases were reported on Monday. The city government said testing of 200,745 people wrapped up on Saturday following two earlier rounds last month. No new positive cases were found and the three announced Monday were among those previously isolated as suspected cases, authorities said. Testing has been accompanied by travel restrictions and the quarantining of suspected cases and close contacts of those infected, as China strives to contain the outbreak in the city on the Russian border. China reported 15 new cases on Monday, 12 of them brought from outside. Hospitals are currently treating 281 people for COVID-19 while 231 people are being monitored after having tested positive for the virus while showing no symptoms. China doesn’t include asymptomatic cases in its virus tallies.— A Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson says the country is following the further spread of coronavirus in the U.S. with a “heavy heart.” The virus was first detected in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year and critics have accused the government of botching its initial response, setting off the pandemic that has killed more than 1.5 million people, including more than 282,000 in the U.S. China has rejected such accusations, saying it’s 76-day lockdown of Wuhan and other strict measures bought the rest of the world time to prepare. “We have taken the most comprehensive, stringent and thorough prevention and control measures, taking the lead in controlling the epidemic and resuming production,” Hua Chunying said at a daily ministry briefing on Monday. “In the meanwhile, we are also following with a heavy heart the reports on the development of the epidemic situation in the United States these days, and express our condolences and sympathy to the American people in their current difficult situation,” Hua said. Public compliance with prevention measures in China has been near-universal, allowing the country to all-but eliminate cases of local transmission. Hua said that success has boosted national self-confidence and pride, along with support for the ruling Communist Party.— Hong Kong reported 95 new virus cases on Sunday. Authorities have tightened restrictions on the city’s 7.5 million people, including limiting most social gatherings to just two people. The surge in cases has also led to the suspension of plans to open a “travel bubble” with Singapore, underscoring the impact the outbreak has had on the city’s economy.___Follow AP’s coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/coronavirus-pandemic and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak \n",

      "CONTENT : JAKARTA, Indonesia - Indonesia’s government said 1.2 million doses of a COVID-19 vaccine developed by China-based biopharmaceutical company Sinovac Biotech arrived in the country late Sunday.President Joko Widodo said in a televised address that another 1.8 million doses of the vaccine are expected to arrive in early January.“We are very grateful, thank God, the vaccine is now available so that we can immediately curb the spread of the COVID-19 disease,” Widodo said.The government is still waiting for millions of other doses of the Sinovac vaccine to arrive in the form of raw materials that will be further processed by state-owned pharmaceutical holding company PT Bio Farma.However, Widodo said that emergency use authorization from the country’s Food and Drug Control Agency is still needed for mass vaccinations to start.Indonesia is already co-operating with Sinovac in phase 3 clinical trials of its vaccine candidate, with tests being carried out on 1,620 volunteers in West Java’s Bandung city since August. The government also looked into partnerships with two other Chinese drug manufacturers, Sinopharm and CanSino Biologics.Penny Lukito, head of the Food and Drug Control Agency, estimated that the Sinovac vaccine would obtain emergency use authorization from the agency by the third or fourth week of January, after the agency evaluates interim results from the third-stage clinical trial.\n",

Kenneth Matos, suffered two fractured tibias. He was taken to Staten Island University Hospital.\"He just doesn't care about people's lives. That's what this comes down to,\" Bill Neidhardt, a spokesman for Mayor Bill de Blasio, said Sunday.\"He doesn't care if his pub spreads a deadly virus. He doesn't care if a uniformed officer is clinging for life on the hood of his car. It's truly horrible and unacceptable and the people of New York City will reject this disgusting way of thinking.\"The New York City Sheriff's Office had been conducting surveillance Saturday night on the bar, which has been a rallying point for people angry over COVID restrictions.5:15 p.m.: Nova Scotia is amending today's COVID-19 case count to add one more.Health officials say the latest patient is a student at an elementary school in Dartmouth, N.S.The affected school will now be closed until Dec. 10.4:30 p.m.: President Donald Trump said Sunday his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani has tested positive for the coronavirus.The 76-year-old former New York mayor has travelled extensively to battleground states in recent days and weeks in an effort to help Trump subvert his election loss. On numerous occasions he has met with local officials for hours at a time without wearing a mask.Trump, who confirmed Giuliani's positive test in a Sunday afternoon tweet, wished him a speedy recovery.“Get better soon Rudy, we will carry on!!!” Trump wrote.Giuliani attended a hearing at the Georgia Capitol on Thursday where he went without a mask for several hours. Several state senators also did not wear masks at the hearing. 4:15 p.m.: Prince Edward Island has announced a two-week circuit breaker in an attempt to gain control of rising COVID-19 cases.

Gyms, libraries, bingo halls and casinos will also be closed, retail stores must limit capacity to 50 per cent, and weddings and funerals will be limited to 10 people excluding officials. Organized gatherings, including faith services, will only be allowed to have 10 people, whether they are indoors or outdoors. Schools will remain open, except for four high schools in the Charlottetown area. 2:52 p.m.: Saskatchewan is reporting 415 new COVID-19 cases and four additional deaths. The province says that two of the people who died were in their 60s and were from Regina and the Far North zones, while the two others were in their 70s and were from the South zone. Their deaths bring the provincial total to 59 since the start of the pandemic. Saskatchewan reports there are 135 people in hospital with COVID-19, with 26 of those receiving intensive care.2:10 p.m.: Manitoba is reporting 383 new cases of COVID-19 as well as 14 new related deaths today.Health officials say many of the deaths were linked to outbreaks at care homes and involve patients who ranged in age from their 60s to their 90s.But the province says one was a man in his 20s who lived in the Winnipeg region. The government says 348 people are in hospital with COVID-19, and 43 of those are receiving intensive care. So far, there have been 395 COVID-19 deaths in Manitoba.1:54 p.m.: Nova Scotia is reporting four new cases of COVID-19, all of them in the province's central region.As of today, the province was dealing with 88 active cases, though no one with the virus has been admitted to hospital.One of the new cases is related to travel outside Atlantic Canada, and the three others remain under investigation.1:45 p.m.: Health officials in Newfoundland and Labrador are reporting four new cases of COVID-19, three of them men who recently returned to the province from Alberta.The fourth case involves a man from the central region who was a close contact of a previous case.The three travel-related cases include two men in their 40s, one of whom is not from Newfoundland and Labrador, and a third man in his 60s from the central region.The province now has 30 active cases of COVID-19, though 317 people have recovered from the virus.12:20 p.m. Quebec is reporting 1,691 new cases of COVID-19 today and 24 additional deaths linked to the virus.Public health officials say 10 of those deaths took place in the past 24 hours.The regions with the highest number of new infections are Montreal with 514; Monteregie south of Montreal, with 228; the Quebec City area with 143, and Lanaudiere, north of Montreal, also with 143.Quebec has now recorded 151,599 total cases and 7,255 deaths since the start of the pandemic.12:15 p.m. When Jenny Pitt-Clark first started hearing about COVID-19, like many Canadians, she began to stock up. But the expenses kept piling up. Printer ink was costly, and soon she needed more paper and pens. During a particularly challenging week, both of her monitors went kaput.That’s why she was relieved to hear that next year’s tax filing season will be a little less complicated for Canadians, with the government announcing in its Nov. 30 fiscal update a new work-from-home personal tax deduction of up to $400 for employees who have incurred “modest expenses” in 2020 due to remote working.Pitt-Clark is looking into the T2200, a tax form filled out by employers, which would allow her to deduct more than $400 worth of expenses. But if that doesn’t happen, at least she has the new $400 deduction to lean on, she said.Read the Star’s Rosa Saba’s story on how the deduction works, who it will benefit, and what else you need to know before next year’s tax season.11 a.m. Canada is poised to be the next country to deploy mass rapid testing for COVID-19 in a gambit that Harvard epidemiologist Michael Mina says could immediately stem the spread of the virus.As an epidemiologist and assistant professor at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, Mina has been leading research around COVID-19 testing throughout the pandemic.Rapid at-home testing could be a COVID-19 game changer, he said.Mina argues that government regulations should be changed to encourage manufacturers to develop the tests and public funding rolled out to assist companies with building them.Other countries have had success with or are moving to use rapid testing to control the spread of COVID-19. In Canada, some rapid-testing systems, which provide results in minutes, are approved and being widely used. But the tests aren’t approved for household use and top public health officials remain skeptical since, generally speaking, a faster test yields less accurate results. However, when it comes to an effective testing strategy, Mina says accuracy isn’t everything.Read the full story from the Star’s Kieran Leavitt.10:20 a.m. (updated) Ontario has reached a record high of new COVID-19 infections for the second consecutive day.The province logged 1,924 new cases in the past 24 hours, pushing above the 1,859 case record hit a day earlier.The province is also reporting 15 new deaths linked to the virus.Health Minister Christine Elliott says Toronto had the highest number of new cases at 504, while Peel logged 463 and York Region saw 198.There are 1,574 more resolved cases, while the number of active cases rose to 15,547.The number of patients in the province's hospitals decreased to 701, with 204 in intensive care.10:17 a.m. Six months ago, Apple and Google introduced a new smartphone tool designed to notify people who might have been exposed to the coronavirus, without disclosing any personal information. But for the most part, Americans haven't been all that interested.Fewer than half of U.S. states and territories — 19 in total — have made such technology widely available. And according to a data analysis by The Associated Press, the vast majority of Americans in such locations haven't activated the tool.Data from 16 states, Guam and the District of Columbia shows that 8.1 million people had utilized the technology as of late November. That's about one in 14 of the 110 million residents in those regions.9:35 a.m. The theft of 200,000 doses (or 75,000, depending on which story you read) of polio vaccine from the Micro-Biology and Hygiene Institute of Montreal more than six decades ago was then worth the princely sum of $50,000.More concerning, it upended a provincial vaccination effort trying mightily to slow one of Canada’s last polio epidemics; a storm that had already infected more than 500 and left 29 dead in Montreal alone. Police were sent scrambling, desperate to uncover the doses before they expired.With multiple candidates racing into the final stretch — Britain became the first country to authorize a vaccine for use this week — COVID-19 vaccines are about to become one of the hottest commodities on the planet. In seeking a distribution company, Canada’s government notes in its tender that doses must be trackable, and “safeguarded at all times as high value assets and high value targets for criminal elements.”Around the world, everything from dummy shipments to armed escorts and elaborate GPS tracking are being floated as potential security measures.Read the full story from the Star’s Alex Boyd on how we plan to keep COVID-19 vaccines safe.9:27 a.m. Pope Francis says the Christmas season provides reason for hope amid the difficulties of the coronavirus pandemic.During his Sunday blessing, Francis noted that the Vatican's Christmas tree had gone up last week in St. Peter's Square, and that work is underway to build the life-size Nativity scene next to it.Pointing to the tree from his studio window over the square, Francis said such symbols of Christmas “are signs of hope, especially in this difficult period.\"9:12 a.m. Each spring, near a south Florida seaside strip known as the Broadwalk, the grateful retailers and restaurateurs of Hollywood Beach gather for a two-day celebration of all things Canada.\"Canadafest\" has played out for nearly 40 years in the heart of a uniquely Canadian diaspora south of Fort Lauderdale, a way of saying thank you to the roughly 1.2 million people from north of the border who visit the state annually.COVID-19, of course, had other plans.It's just one illustration of the looming \"dark winter\" the pandemic has wrought in the United States, where the number of single-day deaths and new infections have blown past earlier peaks established in the spring.And in a part of the country that has come to embrace Canada's seasonal visitors as family, the health risks and cross-border travel restrictions are sure to amplify the pain.8:30 a.m. A new study, currently in pre-print and under peer review at a medical journal, shines a light on just how many long-term-care residents suffering from COVID-19 may have been denied the hospital care they desperately needed before death.The study by researchers at the University of Toronto and Public Health Ontario looks at the number of people with COVID-19 who were hospitalized before death and finds that in March and April, when hundreds of long-term-care homes in the province were experiencing outbreaks, just 15.5 per cent of nursing home residents with the virus were hospitalized before they died.This reached a high of 41.2 per cent in June and July when the first wave was ending. That compares to 81.4 per cent of people who lived in the community, a percentage that has held steady throughout the pandemic.Looking at the pandemic as a whole, from March to October, the trend was similar: overall, just 22.4 per cent of nursing home residents with COVID-19 were admitted to hospital before death, compared to 81.4 per cent for community residents.Read the full story from the Star’s Kenyon Wallace here.7:19 a.m. Italy had more than 21,000 daily coronavirus cases and added 662 deaths in the last 24 hours.The 21,052 new cases raised Italy’s total to nearly 1.6 million. There’s been 59,514 confirmed deaths, the second-highest toll in Europe behind Britain’s toll.This week, Italy’s Premier Giuseppe Conte signed a decree limiting travel between regions Dec. 21 to Jan. 6, national Epiphany Day holiday. Conte hopes that will prevent holiday vacations that could fuel contagion.7:15 a.m. The Oregon Medical Board has suspended the medical license of a doctor who said at a pro-Trump rally that he doesn’t wear a mask at his Dallas, Oregon, clinic.KGW-TV reported Friday that Dr. Steven LaTulippe also said at the November rally that he also encourages others not to wear masks.A state order requires health care workers to wear a mask in health care settings.The medical board voted this week to suspend LaTulippe’s license immediately due to concerns about patient safety.LaTulippe did not respond to a request for comment from KGW-TV and has previously declined to comment.7:07 a.m. South Korea says it’ll further toughen physical distancing rules as recent restrictions has failed to curb a viral resurgence that threatens the country’s health care system.Health Minister Park Neung-hoo said Sunday recently elevated distancing rules haven’t showed much effect. Park says South Korea could face a shortage of intensive care unit beds if the current level continues for one to two weeks.Under new restrictions effective Tuesday for three weeks, authorities will shut down karaoke rooms, fitness centres, indoor gyms and most of cram schools in the Seoul metropolitan area. Some high-risk facilities like nightclubs in the Seoul area have already been shut down.Events must be under 50 people in the Seoul area and sports matches will be held without fans.7:05 a.m. Eight people in the northern Chinese city of Manzhouli have coronavirus after everyone in the city was tested following the discovery of two locally acquired infections, the official Xinhua News Agency reported Sunday.Authorities conducted nucleic acid tests on 203,378 people in the city on the border with Mongolia in two rounds starting Nov. 22 and Nov. 27.The city had 24 locally acquired cases as of Sunday, Xinhua said. It said 1,239 people who had close contact with them were under medical observation.Sunday 7 a.m. Coronavirus infections in Russia hit a new record on Sunday, as the country’s authorities registered 29,039 new confirmed cases, the highest daily spike in the pandemic.Russia’s total of over 2.4 million reported infections remains the fourth largest caseload in the world. Russia has also reported 43,141 virus-related deaths.Russia has been swept by a resurgence of the virus this fall, with daily confirmed infections and deaths significantly exceeding those reported in the spring. Nevertheless, Russian authorities have rejected the idea of another nationwide lockdown or any widespread closures of businesses.On Wednesday, President Vladimir Putin ordered a “large-scale” vaccination against COVID-19 to begin in Russia with the domestically developed Sputnik V vaccine that is still undergoing advanced studies needed to ensure its safety and effectiveness. Doctors and teachers will be first in line to get inoculated, Putin said.Saturday 7:30 p.m.: The latest numbers of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Canada as of 7:30 p.m. ET on Saturday Dec. 5, 2020.There are 408,921 confirmed cases in Canada._ Canada: 408,921 confirmed cases (71,450 active, 324,882 resolved, 12,589 deaths).The total case count includes 13 confirmed cases among repatriated travellers.There were 6,352 new cases Saturday from 79,671 completed tests, for a positivity rate of 8.0 per cent.

      "CONTENT : I Am Ariel Sharon, by Yara El-Ghadban, translated by Wayne Grady, House of Anansi The English translation of El-Ghadban’s award-winning novel which was first published in Quebec in 2018. It is a journey into the mind of controversial Israeli prime minister Ariel Sharon, as he lies in a coma, which he does for eight years. During this time the women in his life surround him, talk to him and confront him — his mother, his wives, his nurse — demanding he face up to his part in Israel’s wars. El-Ghadban, who is Palestinian, lives in Montreal and, in French; this is the first of her three novels to be translated into English. Okay, Universe: Chronicles of a Woman in Politics, by Valérie Plante and Delphie Côté Lacroix, Drawn and Quarterly Political incumbents don’t always write books, but Montreal Mayor Plante is a special case — this graphic memoir becomes a celebration of Montreal, as well as her story. “Okay, Universe” chronicles her taking down an incumbent and becoming the first female mayor of Canada’s second largest city. The book is very much a collaborative effort with Governor-General Award winner Côté Lacroix, as well as two local publishers: one English and one French. In the end, it’s about how anyone can and should get involved in their community. White Ivy, Susie Yang, Simon and Schuster This debut novel from Chinese-American author Yang is making a splash, largely because it hits that sweet spot — it’s a good read and it’s got heft as it takes on issues such as class and race. Ivy Lin has a crush on her privileged classmate Gideon; she steals to acquire the trappings of a middle-class teen — but the deception catches up with her. About fitting in, the immigrant experience, and repercussions. Yang is incredibly accomplished: she gained her doctorate of pharmacy and founded a start-up teaching people to code. Better Luck Next Time, Kate Hilton, HarperCollins From the we-all-like-to-sit-down-with-a-good-entertaining-read-sometimes class of books, comes this commercial fiction from Toronto writer Kate Hilton about a family — specifically, the four daughters of a famous feminist icon, who are all in midlife, with all of its attendant drama: divorce, rebellious teenagers, careers in meltdown. Relatable family drama unfolds, told with plenty of humour. One Night Two Souls Went Walking, Ellen Cooney, Coffee House Press Other times, we want a novel to sink into, one that’s not comforting so much as it makes us feel and think about being in the world, about things like solace, and heartbreak and souls. This is Cooney’s 10th novel, about a young interfaith chaplain who is joined on her hospital rounds by a dog that may — or may not — be a ghost. \n",

      "CONTENT : TAIPEI, Taiwan - Provincial governments across China are placing orders for experimental, domestically made coronavirus vaccines, though health officials have yet to say how well they work or how they may reach the country’s 1.4 billion people.Developers are speeding up final testing, the Chinese foreign minister said during a U.N. meeting last week, as Britain approved emergency use of Pfizer Inc.’s vaccine candidate and providers scrambled to set up distribution.Even without final approval, more than 1 million health care workers and others in China who are deemed at high risk of infection have received experimental vaccines under emergency use permission. Developers have yet to disclose how effective their vaccines are and possible side effects.China’s fledgling pharmaceutical industry has at least five vaccines from four producers being tested in more than a dozen countries including Russia, Egypt and Mexico. Health experts say even if they are successful, the certification process for the United States, Europe, Japan and other developed countries might be too complex for them to be used there. However, China said it will ensure the products are affordable for developing countries and has been actively pursuing deals across the world.On Sunday, 1.2 million doses of the Chinese company Sinovac’s vaccine arrived in Indonesia, the government said.“We are very grateful, thank God, the vaccine is now available so that we can immediately curb the spread of the COVID-19 disease,” President Joko Widodo said.Within China, so far only one developer, China National Pharmaceutical Group, known as Sinopharm, said in November it applied for final market approval for use of its vaccine. Others have been approved for emergency use on people deemed at high risk of infection.“We must be prepared for large-scale production,” Vice Premier Sun Chunlan said during a visit Wednesday to developers, according to the official Xinhua News Agency.Sun, who has as overseen much of the country’s response, visited one of Sinopharm’s Beijing subsidiary companies, Sinovac and a research lab under the National Medical Products Administration, a regulatory agency that approves medical products for public use.The government has yet to say how many people it plans to vaccinate. Sun said plans call for vaccinating border personnel and other high-risk populations this month.The companies are using more traditional techniques than Western developers.They say unlike Pfizer’s vaccine, which must be kept frozen at temperatures as low as minus 70 degrees Celsius (minus 94 Fahrenheit), theirs can be stored at 2 to 8 C (36 to 46 F). The Chinese producers have yet to say how they might be distributed.Health experts question why China is using experimental vaccines on such a vast scale now that the outbreak is largely under control within its borders.Health officials previously said China will be able to manufacture 610 million doses by the end of this year and ramp up to 1 billion doses next year.The government of Jiangsu province, where the major city of Nanjing is located, issued a procurement notice for vaccines from Sinovac and Sinopharm on Wednesday for emergency use.Authorities in Sichuan province in the west, which has about 85 million people, announced Monday they were already buying vaccines. An official newspaper in Anhui province, southeast of Beijing, said a local residential committee issued a notice asking whether residents want a vaccine.The Sichuan and Anhui announcements said the vaccine, given in two shots, would cost a total of 400 yuan ($60).Vaccines from Sinovac and Sinopharm were approved for emergency use in July.In October, Zhejiang province south of Shanghai offered the public vaccination under emergency use authorization. It said people considered high-risk would get priority.In November, the Communist Party secretary for Sinopharm said almost 1 million people had received its vaccine.In September, Sinovac’s CEO said about 3,000 of its employees had taken their vaccine. He said the company provided tens of thousands of doses to the Beijing city government.Sinopharm has clinical trials under way in 10 countries including the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Jordan, Peru and Argentina with nearly 60,000 volunteers. It has built two facilities in China capable of producing 200 million doses per year.Sinovac has trials in Brazil, Turkey and Indonesia. Its most recent publicized data, a study in the science journal the Lancet, showed its candidate produced lower levels of antibodies in people than those who had recovered from COVID-19. The company projects it will be able to produce a few hundred million doses of the vaccine by February or March of next year.Another producer, CanSino, is testing in Russia, Pakistan and Mexico and pursuing partnerships in Latin American countries. Its vaccine, which has been used on an emergency basis with the Chinese military, uses a harmless adenovirus to carry genes into human cells to generate an immune response.A fourth company, Anhui Zhifei Longcom Biologic Pharmacy Co., is conducting final stage trials across China.___Associated Press video producer Olivia Zhang contributed to this report.\n",

      "CONTENT : The road to resolving the crisis in relations between Canada and China always lay through Washington.Canada detained Chinese telecom executive Meng Wanzhou at the request of U.S. authorities, as part of this country’s obligations under its extradition treaty with the United States. That led directly to the tit-for-tat arrest of two Canadians in China nine days later. It’s always been possible for the Trump administration to drop charges against Meng, or work out a deal that would allow her to return to China.So it comes as no great surprise to learn that, as the clock ticks down on this administration, efforts are reportedly underway to strike such a deal.The transition from one administration to another is the perfect time to settle such issues. As Donald Trump’s White House fades into history, there’s an opening for the U.S. justice department to wrap up this sorry episode while there’s a bit of a vacuum at the top.That would set the stage for freeing those two Canadians, the “two Michaels” who will have been imprisoned in atrocious conditions for exactly two years this coming week.The Trudeau government must do everything it can to insist that any deal that would set Meng free also leads to freedom for Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor — and quickly. Anything less would prolong a grave injustice for those men. And it would amount to Beijing spitting in the face of the Canadian government.Of course, China’s government has always insisted that the cases aren’t linked. According to them, it’s just a coincidence that nine days after Meng was detained in Vancouver the two Michaels were arrested in China. They were held for months without charges, but now face accusations of spying.It’s clear to everyone but the Chinese government that this is a lot of nonsense and the seizure of Kovrig and Spavor was a straightforward case of hostage-taking. There’s no evidence that the men were up to anything illicit, and their arrest fits a pattern of China manipulating its judicial system for transparently political purposes.But China is dug into its position that the cases aren’t connected. Freeing the Canadians immediately after a deal is reached between Meng and U.S. authorities (if that does happen) would amount to admitting the opposite. But keeping Kovrig and Spavor in prison would send Canada-China relations into an even deeper freeze.Canada has been caught in an impossible position ever since the U.S. demanded Meng’s extradition in 2018. Refusing to honour its treaty obligations to the United States was hardly an option; countries have extradition treaties because they are mutually beneficial. How would Canada feel if a suspected criminal fled south of the border and the Americans refused to help get him back?And once the Chinese decided to put the screws to Canada through the arrests of Kovrig and Spavor and a range of hoked-up economic measures, short-circuiting the judicial process and letting Meng free (which the justice minister could have done legally at any point) would have amounted to caving in to Beijing.There’s been a vocal lobby in this country to do just that. A parade of Chrétien-era Liberals, many with business connections to China, have argued that Ottawa should have long ago ended the entire affair by dropping the extradition case against Meng. In effect they accept the Chinese argument that it’s just a political manoeuvre by Washington.Doing that, however, would show Beijing it can pick off smaller countries one by one. Right now Australia is in its sights, and being subjected to outrageous pressure for bucking China on a range of issues.Far better for countries like Canada and Australia to stick together, and work with the incoming Biden administration to push back when China flouts international norms. And in the meantime, Ottawa must see that the two Michaels aren’t left to languish needlessly in China’s prisons.\n",

      "CONTENT : TANZANIA, Tanzania - The U.N. health chief declared Friday that positive results from coronavirus vaccine trials mean the world “can begin to dream about the end of the pandemic,” but he said rich and powerful nations must not trample the poor and marginalized “in the stampede for vaccines.”In an address to the U.N. General Assembly’s first high-level session on the pandemic, World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus cautioned that while the virus can be stopped, “the path ahead remains treacherous.”The pandemic has shown humanity at “its best and worst,” he said, pointing to “inspiring acts of compassion and self-sacrifice, breathtaking feats of science and innovation, and heartwarming demonstrations of solidarity, but also disturbing signs of self-interest, blame-shifting and divisions.”Referring to the current upsurge in infections and deaths, Tedros said without naming any countries that “where science is drowned out by conspiracy theories, where solidarity is undermined by division, where sacrifice is substituted with self interest, the virus thrives, the virus spreads.”He warned in a virtual address to the high-level meeting that a vaccine “will not address the vulnerabilities that lie at its root” -- poverty, hunger, inequality and climate change, which he said must be tackled once the pandemic ends.“We cannot and we must not go back to the same exploitative patterns of production and consumption, the same disregard for the planet that sustains all life, the same cycle of panic and meddling and the same divisive politics that fueled this pandemic,” he said.On vaccines, Tedros said, “the light at the end of the tunnel is growing steadily brighter,” but vaccines “must be shared equally as global public goods, not as private commodities that widen inequalities and become yet another reason some people are left behind.”He said WHO’s ACT-Accelerator program to quickly develop and distribute vaccines fairly “is in danger of becoming no more than a noble gesture” without major new funding.He said $4.3 billion is needed immediately to lay the groundwork for mass procurement and delivery of vaccines and a further $23.9 billion is required for 2021. That total, Tedros said, is less than one-half of 1 per cent of the $11 trillion in stimulus packages announced so far by the Group of 20, the world’s richest countries.U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres made a similar appeal for funding for the ACT-Accelerator at Thursday’s opening of the two-day General Assembly session. U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said Friday that Guterres is frustrated and would have liked see “a much much higher rate of investment by those countries who can.”Henrietta Fore, head of the U.N. children’s agency UNICEF, said, “When poor countries started to try to buy vaccines,” there were none available or the price was too high.UNICEF typically distributes 2 billion vaccine doses a year, she said, and once it can get COVID-19 vaccines, “We’re going to double that next year, so we need all hands on deck.”U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said three of the six vaccine candidates that the U.S. government has supported have reported promising data and “I have every reason to believe that more good news about vaccines and other countermeasures is on the way.”U.S. President Donald Trump has formally notified the U.N. of its withdrawal from WHO, which he has harshly criticized for its response to the pandemic and accused of bowing to Chinese influence.Azar criticized the lack of “transparent information sharing” about COVID-19 and WHO’s investigation of the virus’ origin. But he said he wanted health ministers to know they can count on U.S. co-operation to defeat the virus “with no strings attached,” and stressed that the U.S. “is providing to countries combating the virus more funding, equipment, and support than any other nation.”Despite years of warnings, WHO’s Tedros said, many countries were unprepared for the pandemic and assumed their health systems would protect their people. Many countries that have done best dealing with the crisis had experience responding to the outbreaks of SARS, MERS, HINI and other infectious diseases, he said.WHO has been sharply criticized for not taking a stronger and more vocal role in handling the pandemic.Tedros told the meeting that “clearly, the global system for preparedness needs attention.”He said a WHO commission established in September is reviewing international health regulations. WHO is also working with several countries on developing a pilot program in which countries agree to regular and transparent reviews of their health preparedness, he said.The pandemic also showed the need for a global system to share samples of viruses and other pathogens that cause disease to facilitate development of “medical counter-measures as global public goods” he said, welcoming Switzerland’s offer to use a high-security laboratory to manage a new biobank.Tedros also backed European Union chief Charles Michel’s proposal for an international treaty under which WHO would monitor the risks of emerging infectious diseases in animals for transmission to humans, ensure alerts of health risks, improve access to health care, and address financing needs. He said this would provide “the political underpinning” for strengthening the global health sector.The world spends $7.5 trillion on health every year, almost 10% of global GDP, Tedros said, but most of that money is spent in rich countries on treating disease rather than on “promoting and protecting health.”“We need a radical rethink on the way we view and value health,” he said.“If the world is to avoid another crisis on this scale,” Tedros said, “investments in basic public health functions, especially primary health care, are essential, and all roads should lead to universal health coverage with a strong foundation of primary health care.”___AP Medical Writer Linda A. Johnson in Fairless Hills, Pa., contributed to this report.\n",

      "CONTENT : WASHINGTON - The State Department said Friday that it would deny visas to Chinese citizens linked to overseas influence operations involving violence and other means of intimidation.Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the restrictions would apply to Chinese Communist Party officials or anyone else taking part in such propaganda or influence campaigns affiliated with the United Front Work Department.The United Front has been involved in efforts to put pressure on people outside China’s borders who raise concerns about human rights abuses in the Uighur region, Tibet and elsewhere. Its “coercive tactics” have included publicly releasing personal details about critics and their family members online as a means of intimidation, Pompeo said in announcing the new restrictions.The measure is intended to show that “those responsible for actions that contravene the rules-based international order are not welcome in the United States,” he said.The restrictions are the latest punitive measure taken against China’s leadership and economy in response to sharpening disputes over human rights, the coronavirus pandemic, trade, technology, Taiwan and a host of other issues.Chinese citizens would be denied a visa to enter the United States if they have taken part in United Front efforts using violence, threats or other means of pressure against overseas Chinese communities, academics or civil society groups in the U.S. or elsewhere to advance the “CCP’s authoritarian narratives and policy preferences,” the State Department said in a separate statement on the measure.It wasn’t immediately clear how many people would potentially be covered by the new restrictions.The move comes the same week that the U.S. announced plans to place new time limits on visas for members of the Chinese Communist Party and their families, cutting the time that the travel documents are valid from 10 years to one month.China responded to those restrictions by accusing the U.S. government of “an escalation of political suppression.“ Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said Thursday that the travel restrictions were “totally inconsistent with the U.S.’s own interests” and would damage America’s global image.\n",

      "CONTENT : Stevie Nicks closed a deal to sell a majority stake in her publishing catalogue late last month, on the heels of Fleetwood Mac’s “Dreams” hitting the Billboard charts for the first time since 1977.Music publisher Primary Wave purchased an 80 per cent interest in the copyrights, which are valued at about $100 million (all figures U.S.), according to people familiar with the deal.The deal, which includes hits “Edge of Seventeen,” “Rhiannon” and “Landslide,” highlights the soaring value of music in the streaming era. Nicks’ sale coincides with recent buzz around “Dreams” fuelled by a viral TikTok video of a man skateboarding while listening to the former No. 1 single. The song, written by Nicks, landed at No. 21 on the Billboard Hot 100 in October, logging its best-ever week of streams and download sales in the U.S.Nicks and Primary Wave plan to partner on marketing, branding and digital strategies to generate more revenue from her catalogue, according to the publisher. Outlets for music are rising in new corners of the digital world, from videogaming to social media to advertising.Over the past five years, owning the rights to music has become more valuable as revenue from music streaming has grown. Vivendi SA sold a 10 per cent stake in Universal Music Group to Chinese internet giant Tencent Holdings Ltd. for three billion euros, equivalent to $3.37 billion, late last year, valuing the world’s largest music company at more than $33 billion. Los Angeles-based investment firm Shamrock Capital Advisors LLC recently bought Taylor Swift’s early recording catalogue for over $300 million — about what celebrity talent manager Scooter Braun’s Ithaca Holdings LLC paid for the entirety of Ms. Swift’s former label, Big Machine Label Group LLC, a year and a half agoSongwriter catalogues, meanwhile, have been commanding sale prices that amount to 10 to 18 times their annual royalties, compared with eight to 13 times in earlier years, according to people involved in the deals.The coronavirus pandemic has fuelled the frenzy in part because music has proven to be a stable, recession-proof asset that produces returns largely untethered from the broader economy. Older hits, such as those found in Nicks’s catalogue, are commanding higher prices than they were pre-COVID-19, because they are generally perceived as the safest bet, thanks to a long record, and have seen a surge in streaming during the pandemic.“Stevie’s music, while exceptionally well known, is still very undercommericalized and undermarketed,” said Primary Wave chief executive Larry Mestel. “There’s enormous upside potential for her songs to be reinvigorated and introduced to youth culture.”Ms. Nicks laced up roller skates for her own version of the viral TikTok challenge. In the original, Idahoan Nathan Apodaca lip syncs to “Dreams” after sipping from a bottle of Ocean Spray Cran-Raspberry juice while longboarding down the street. The song and various copycat videos were then featured in a commercial by the social video platform.Such visibility generates powerful spurts of interest in older music, helping drive streams on music platforms such as Spotify Technology SA, YouTube and Apple Inc.’s Apple Music. Every time a song plays, that is revenue for the artist, or whoever owns the catalog’s rights.As part of the deal, Primary Wave will also market Nicks’s name and likeness, and form a joint venture that will allow her to sign new songwriters.Nicks is the only woman who has been inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame twice: first in 1998 as a member of Fleetwood Mac, and again last year as a solo artist.“Artists who are as talented and fortunate as Stevie to have such long and successful careers have the right to dictate the legacy of their music,” said Sheryl Louis, Nicks’ longtime manager, who helped negotiate the deal.\n",

      "CONTENT : DUBAI, United Arab Emirates - The island kingdom of Bahrain said it has become the second nation in the world to grant an emergency-use authorization for the coronavirus vaccine made by Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech.The state-run Bahrain News Agency made the announcement on Friday night, following an earlier announcement by the United Kingdom on Wednesday, making Britain the first in the world.“The confirmation of approval by the National Health Regulatory Authority of the kingdom of Bahrain followed thorough analysis and review undertaken by the authority of all available data,” the kingdom said.Bahrain did not say how may vaccines it has purchased, nor when vaccinations would begin. It did not respond to questions from The Associated Press. The Pfizer shots, a so-called “mRNA vaccine,” contain a piece of genetic code that trains the immune system to recognize the spiked protein on the surface of the virus.Pfizer later told the AP that the details of its sales agreement with Bahrain, including the “timing of delivery and the volume of doses,” was confidential and declined to comment.“We have developed detailed logistical plans and tools to support effective vaccine transport, storage and continuous temperature monitoring,“ Pfizer said. “Our distribution is built on a flexible just in time system which will ship the frozen vials to the point of vaccination.”The immediate challenge for Bahrain would be the conditions in which the vaccine must be kept. It must be stored and shipped at ultra-cold temperatures of around minus 70 degrees Celsius (minus 94 degrees Fahrenheit). Bahrain is a Mideast nation that regularly sees temperatures in the summer of around 40 C (104 Fahrenheit) with high humidity.Bahrain operates a state-owned carrier, Gulf Air, that could be used to transport the vaccine. In the nearby United Arab Emirates, the Dubai-based long-haul carrier Emirates has already said it is preparing its facilities to distribute vaccines at ultra-cold temperatures.The vaccine also requires two doses be given three weeks apart.Bahrain had already granted emergency-use authorization for a Chinese vaccine made by Sinopharm and has inoculate some 6,000 people with it. That vaccine, an “inactivated” shot made by growing the whole virus in a lab and then killing it, also is in use in the UAE. Pfizer’s vaccine does not contain the coronavirus itself.“The approval of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine will add a further important layer to the kingdom’s national COVID-19 response, which has strongly prioritized protecting the health of all citizens and residents during the pandemic,“ said Dr. Mariam al-Jalahma, the CEO of Bahrain’s National Health Regulatory Authority.BioNTech, which owns the vaccine, said it has so far signed deals to supply 570 million doses worldwide in 2021, with options to deliver 600 million more. It hopes to supply at least 1.3 billion in 2021.Bahrain, home to the U.S. Navy’s 5th Fleet, is a small island off the coast of Saudi Arabia in the Persian Gulf.With a population of 1.6 million, it has reported more than 87,000 cases and 341 deaths, according to the government. Over 85,000 people have recovered from the COVID-19 illness that is caused by the virus.The country is also home to a large expatriate population, with many low-paid labourers from Asia living in tight housing. In July, authorities told the AP they had moved 8,000 labourers to new accommodations, disinfected housing and implemented a rule requiring no more than five labourers per room, with about 3 metres (10 feet) of space for each one.The Bahraini government says it has conducted over 2 million coronavirus tests across the island. It initially blamed its higher per-capita infection rate on that.___Follow Jon Gambrell on Twitter at www.twitter.com/jongambrellAP.\n",

      "CONTENT : WASHINGTON - The U.S. trade deficit widened 1.7% in October to $63.1 billion. The politically sensitive gap in the trade of goods with China and Mexico grew.The gap between the goods and services the United States sold and what it bought abroad rose from $62.1 billion in September, the Commerce Department reported Friday. Exports rose 2.2% to $182 billion, led by sales of aircraft engines. Imports increased 2.1% to $245.1 billion on an uptick in shipments of auto parts.The deficit in the trade of goods with China rose 9% to $26.5 billion and the gap with Mexico rose 10% to $11.8 billion.So far this year, the overall gap in the trade of goods and services with the rest of the world has risen to $536.7 billion, up 9.5% from January-October 2019.President Donald Trump, who vowed to reduce the trade deficit, has imposed tariffs on foreign steel, aluminum and on $360 billion in Chinese products. It is unclear how much of Trump’s aggressive trade policies will be retained by President-elect Joe Biden.The coronavirus, however, has upended trade in services such as education and travel in which the United States runs persistent surpluses. U.S. services exports are down nearly 20% so far this year, and America’s trade surplus in services dropped in October to $18.3 billion, lowest since August 2012.The U.S. ran an October deficit of $81.4 billion in the trade of goods such as autos and appliances.\n",

The government also is talking with Russia about securing the vaccine developed there.Turkish Health Minister Fahrettin Koca told the official Anadolu news agency that he would work to convince people to get immunized by getting the Chinese shot himself as soon as Turkish authorities approve its use.Turkey also has ordered 1 million doses of the vaccine developed by U.S. drugmaker Pfizer and German company BioNTech. Erdogan said he spoke with BioNTech co-founder Ugur Sahin, who is of Turkish descent.Turkey is experiencing a surge in infections with confirmed cases hovering above 30,000 per day on a 7-day average. The country’s death toll since March has reached 14,316. A weekend lockdown, the first since the end of May, is set to begin Friday evening.\n",

      "CONTENT : The alarm sang at 4 a.m.I rose. I brushed. I put on the kettle. It was like preparing for an early a.m. flight — like one of those super-early Caribbean ones, where your best laid plans include trying to touch sand before noon (I remember those!) — except that, on this particular morn, the only voyage I was raring to make was to my laptop, currently perched on a chair in the living room, propped on top of seven cookbooks (including the new Barefoot Contessa one) for maximum video-conferencing vantage.Bienvenue to 2020, right?The minutes marched. Night thinned. There, in the shoals of barely there consciousness — halfway-point between the sea of sleep and the horizon of awake — I was psyching myself up to chat with the one, the only, Mariah Carey. And the 4:30 a.m. call time? No joke. The lady — proprietor of that five-octave range, the empress of this millennium Christmas — keeps vampire hours. And who were we to argue?Preparing to interview the songstress about her upcoming holiday bonanza, c/o Apple TV Plus — “Mariah Carey’s Magical Christmas Special” — I slipped back into my bedroom, mug in hand, to pick out a screen-friendly colour to don. My Dijon-coloured crewneck? Yes. Mariah would enjoy. Then, padding my way to my phone, I noticed … a message. Ms. “Then a Hero Comes Along” was running late. By about 30 minutes. Stay tuned.Well, of course. I half-expected this. Divas gonna diva … and I was honoured, to be honest.I shuffled. I sat. I decided, on a spur, to reorganize my shoe collection. I nursed some more tea. I toyed with some pages of the novel I was reading (“White Ivy.” Quite excellent. Savage. Sort of the Chinese-American female answer to Jay Gatsby and Tom Ripley!).30 minutes became an hour, which became more. I did not mind. It was Mariah! I fingered one of my windows looking out to Bloor, the tops of buildings still swathed in darkness.When I eventually signed on, I was taken to a virtual hospitality suite — not my first, it has been the celebrity junket m.o. this pandemic — which then led to another link taking me to yet another virtual waiting area. Mariah was out there! I could feel her.The morning bellied. Life flashed before me. I tapped through Instagram, getting a heads-up on what the British people I follow — hours ahead — were posting. I stopped at a photo of chickens in the Cotswolds. The clock nosing towards 5:45, a punchy publicist finally announced Mariah. The moment: akin to being on a flight that’s been sitting on the tarmac for too long finally aiming for air. I leaned forward, gave my best Zoolander. The legend smiled. She was beautiful. Her hair looked healthy.Exchanging pleasantries, as she filled me in on her special — expect: glamour and candy cane and marquee guests like Ariana Grande and JHud and Misty Copeland — I could not not mention the hour. “The vampire schedule really does work,” Mariah told me in a singsongy manner from her base in L.A. “Only way to do it. I would be half-asleep if we did it on the regular people schedule.” Her creative juices jog during these hours, she continued, confirming that she even wrote a song about her famed insomnia. “The song ‘Crybaby’ that I did with Snoop. It’s what it is about.” Veering the subject to Aspen — when I mentioned to Mariah that catching images of her on the slopes of that swanky winter wonderland has long been a Christmas tradition for me — her face assumed a knowingness. Will you be bringing some Aspen into your special? I asked. “That's an interesting question … I have been going there for a long time. And I have not gone anywhere else since I started (almost 20 years ago, every December).”Short answer: expect her special to be like the North Pole meets Aspen.Oh, and she confirmed that she and her nine-year-old twins are holidaying in Colorado this month, as per usual (in a safe way, of course). No shopping. Much less socializing. “We go into the hot tub. We roll in the snow,” she said.Monroe and Moroccan, her kids, are pretty good skiers now, as it happens, and also adept at snowboarding. Oh, and pssst: they have cameos in her Apple TV Plus special, too.“The kids have a big Christmas list,” she tossed off as an aside. “I really need to get on it.” On another note, I told her how cool was it seeing that video that went viral after the Biden victory last month, the one packed with a swirl of young people at a gas station spontaneously breaking out in dance to “All I Want for Christmas Is You.” Carey posted it too. “I am literally getting goosebumps as we talk about it right now. I did love that people did treat in a celebratory way — right before Christmas, yes … I loved that joy they were emoting. I felt like I was there with them.”It just goes to show how much that song’s become a cue for joy, I said.Mariah so close. Mariah so far.We talked about her much-praised memoir that came out this year (“The Meaning of Mariah Carey”). We talked about her secret alt-rock album she recorded in the ’90s (which she disclosed in said memoir). We talked about the 50-year-old’s abiding love for Marilyn Monroe. About the latter, the diva confirmed she owns her baby white piano, which she purchased in 1999: “There was sort of a shift when I first saw Marilyn and really understood to relate to someone you don’t know. She died before I was born. But I feel like I know her. It really was a shift in terms of me relating to an artist, to an iconic image, and a woman who was misunderstood on many levels. Someone (who read Mariah’s memoir) said it really helped them to understand me, in that they are a fan of me, but this was showing me as a fan of someone else.” “It was like a first kiss in reverse.” I quoted back a line from her memoir, in which she describes experiencing racism early in her life, as the child of a white woman and a Black man. A great line! Innocence lost, in other words. “Half the things just came up and I didn’t even remember,” she confessed, explaining her process with her co-writer. “Just talking. Usually in the dark.” (Yes, in the middle of the night!) “It was all very deep work.” Presto: an artist whose career spans some 30 years and who has sold more than 200 million records.Faster than you can say “Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la” Mariah had to split. “Nice talking to you, Shinan,” she said.Ditto, I motioned.Outside, it was still souped with black. A yawn stirred inside me. As good a time as any to reroute to bed.\n",

      "CONTENT : BEIJING - The U.S. government has stepped up a feud with Beijing over security by adding China’s biggest maker of processor chips and a state-owned oil giant to a blacklist that limits access to American technology and investment.Thursday’s announcement adds to steps taken by President Donald Trump against China since losing his reelection bid Nov. 3. Political analysts have said Trump was likely to take further action before President-elect Joe Biden takes office Jan. 20.The Pentagon added four companies including Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. and China National Offshore Oil Corp. to a list of entities deemed to be part of efforts to modernize the ruling Communist Party’s military wing, the People’s Liberation Army. That raises the total number of companies on the blacklist to 35.On Friday, the Chinese foreign ministry accused Washington of abusing national security arguments to handicap fledgling Chinese industrial competitors.“The actions of the U.S. side seriously violate the principle of market competition and the rules of international trade and economy that the U.S. side has always advocated,” said a ministry spokeswoman, Hua Chunying. “The U.S. side should stop abusing state power or generalizing the concept of national security to suppress foreign enterprises.”SMIC plays a leading role in the ruling party’s effort to reduce reliance on U.S. and other foreign technology by creating Chinese suppliers of processor chips and other components.That has taken on greater urgency after Washington blocked access to American chips and other technology for telecom equipment giant Huawei Technologies Ltd. and imposed curbs on other Chinese buyers. The White House also has blocked the use of U.S. technology by global vendors to produce chips for Huawei.CNOOC is the smallest of China’s three main state-owned oil producers.Political analysts expect little change in policy under Biden due to widespread frustration with China’s trade and human rights records and accusations of spying and technology theft.The 2.3 million-member PLA is one of the world’s biggest and best-armed militaries. It is spending heavily to develop nuclear submarines, stealth fighters, ballistic missiles and other advanced weapons.The Pentagon’s first list of 20 companies deemed to be PLA-linked in June included Huawei and video surveillance provider HikVision Digital Technology Co. Both say they never have taken part in military-related research.Also cited by the Pentagon in earlier lists are state-owned phone carriers China Telecom Corp. and China Unicom Ltd. and petrochemical, construction, aerospace, rocketry, shipbuilding and nuclear power equipment companies.\n",

      "CONTENT : WUHAN, China - In the early days in Wuhan, the first city struck by the virus, getting a COVID test was so difficult that residents compared it to winning the lottery.Throughout the Chinese city in January, thousands of people waited in hours-long lines for hospitals, sometimes next to corpses lying in hallways. But most couldn’t get the test they needed to be admitted as patients. And for the few who did, the tests were often faulty, resulting in false negatives.The widespread test shortages and problems at a time when the virus could have been slowed were caused largely by secrecy and cronyism at China’s top disease control agency, an Associated Press investigation has found.The flawed testing system prevented scientists and officials from seeing how fast the virus was spreading — another way China fumbled its early response to the virus. Earlier AP reporting showed how top Chinese leaders delayed warning the public and withheld information from the World Health Organization, supplying the most comprehensive picture yet of China’s initial missteps. Taken together, these mistakes in January facilitated the virus’ spread through Wuhan and across the world undetected, in a pandemic that has now sickened more than 64 million people and killed almost 1.5 million.China’s Center for Disease Control and Prevention gave test kit designs and distribution rights exclusively to three then-obscure Shanghai companies with which officials had personal ties, the reporting found. The deals took place within a culture of backdoor connections that quietly flourished in an underfunded public health system, according to the investigation, which was based on interviews with more than 40 doctors, CDC employees, health experts, and industry insiders, as well as hundreds of internal documents, contracts, messages and emails obtained by the AP.The Shanghai companies — GeneoDx Biotech, Huirui Biotechnology, and BioGerm Medical Technology -- paid the China CDC for the information and the distribution rights, according to two sources with knowledge of the transaction who asked to remain anonymous to avoid retribution. The price: One million RMB ($146,600) each, the sources said. It’s unclear whether the money went to specific individuals.In the meantime, the CDC and its parent agency, the National Health Commission, tried to prevent other scientists and organizations from testing for the virus with their own homemade kits. In a departure from past practice for at least two epidemics, the NHC told Wuhan hospitals to send virus samples — from which tests can be developed — only to central labs under its authority. It also made testing requirements to confirm coronavirus cases much more complicated, and endorsed only test kits made by the Shanghai companies.These measures contributed to not a single new case being reported by Chinese authorities between Jan. 5 and 17, even though retrospective infection data shows that hundreds were infected. The apparent lull in cases meant officials were slow to take early actions such as warning the public, barring large gatherings and curbing travel. One study estimates that intervention two weeks earlier could have reduced the number of cases by 86 per cent, although it’s uncertain whether earlier action could have halted the spread of the virus worldwide.When tests from the three companies arrived, many didn’t work properly, turning out inconclusive results or false negatives. And technicians were hesitant to use test kits that would later prove more accurate from more established companies, because the CDC did not endorse them.With few and faulty kits, only one in 19 infected people in Wuhan was tested and found positive as of Jan. 31, according to an estimate by Imperial College London. Others without tests or with false negatives were sent back home, where they could spread the virus.Days after he first started coughing on Jan. 23rd, Peng Yi, a 39-year-old schoolteacher, waited in an eight-hour line at a Wuhan hospital. A CT scan showed signs of viral infection in both his lungs, but he couldn’t get the test he needed to be hospitalized.When Peng finally got a test on Jan. 30, it turned out negative. But his fever wouldn’t drop, and his family begged officials for another test.His second test, on Feb. 4, turned out positive. It was too late. Weeks later, Peng passed away.“There were very, very few tests, basically none….if you couldn’t prove you were positive, you couldn’t get admitted to a hospital,” his mother, Zhong Hanneng, said in a tearful interview in October. “The doctor said there was nothing that could be done.”China was hardly the only country to grapple with testing, which varied widely from nation to nation. Germany, for example, developed a test that became the World Health Organization gold standard days after the Chinese government released genetic sequences on Jan. 12. But in the U.S., the CDC declined to use the WHO design and insisted on developing its own kits, which turned out to be faulty and led to even longer delays than in China.Other countries also had the benefit of learning from China’s experience. But China was grappling with a new pathogen, and it wasn’t yet clear how bad the pandemic would be or how many tests would be needed.“It was very early,” said Jane Duckett, a professor at the University of Glasgow examining the Chinese government’s response to the coronavirus. She said the government was “just trying to figure it out.”Still, the hiccups and delays in China were especially consequential because it was the first country to detect the virus.“Because you have only three companies providing testing kits, it kept the capacity of testing very limited,” said Yanzhong Huang, a senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations. “It was a major problem that led to the rapid increase in cases and deaths.”China’s foreign ministry and China’s top medical agency, the National Health Commission, did not respond to requests for comment.“We did a brilliant job, we worked so hard,” said Gao Fu, the head of China CDC, in a videoconference in July. “Unluckily, unfortunately, this virus we are facing, it’s so special.”__________None of the first three diagnostics companies tapped to make test kits for the biggest pandemic in a century were well-known in the industry. For one engineer from a Wuhan-based diagnostics firm, the Shanghai competitors popped out of nowhere “like bamboo shoots” – all the more so because his company had the factories and expertise to produce testing kits in the city where the virus was first detected.“We were surprised, it was very strange,” the engineer said, declining to be named to speak on a sensitive topic. “We hadn’t heard about it at all, and then suddenly there’s test kits from certain companies you have to use, and you can’t use ones from anyone else?”BioGerm was officially founded just over three years ago in a conference room, where the CEO mulled how to survive in a small and crowded market for test kits. GeneoDx had fewer than 100 employees, according to Tianyancha, a Chinese corporate records database – compared to competitors that employ hundreds or even thousands of staff.But what the companies lacked in resources or experience, they made up for in connections.Company posts, along with hundreds of internal emails and documents obtained by The Associated Press, show extensive ties between the three companies and top China CDC researchers in Beijing and Shanghai. Chinese regulators barred AP attempts to obtain credit reports on the companies, saying they were classified as “confidential enterprises” during the outbreak.Despite China’s efforts over the years to reform public health and push for open bidding in a competitive marketplace, medical companies still cultivate personal relationships with officials to secure deals, according to seven executives from different competitors. Under President Xi Jinping, China has cracked down on corruption, but industry insiders say a lack of firm boundaries between public and private in China’s health system can create opportunities for graft.It’s unclear whether the agreements between the China CDC and the three test kit companies violated Chinese law.They raise questions around potential violations of bribery laws, along with rules against abuse of authority, self-dealing and conflicts of interest, said James Zimmerman, a Beijing-based corporate attorney and former chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China. Even amid the uncertainty of the pandemic, “there is no excuse for the flow of cash from these companies to the CDC,” he said.Chinese bribery laws also state that any financial transaction has to be recorded and documented clearly. The AP was unable to ascertain whether the agreements between the CDC and the Shanghai companies were documented, but a CDC employee with access to some of the agency’s finances said there was no record of them.Despite the questions around bribery, other experts caution that the state may have designated the three companies to make test kits under special laws on the procurement of emergency goods during major natural disasters. The Chinese government is pushing to cultivate domestic companies focused on emergency response technologies, including test kits, to protect its national interest.“Things will be different in the middle of a crisis,” said Lesli Ligorner, a Beijing-based attorney specializing in anti-corruption law. “Anything affecting the national interest can be deemed to be of utmost importance for special regulations... I wouldn’t be so quick to rush to judgement.”China CDC guidelines state that the agency is responsible for maintaining a reserve of testing chemicals to screen for rare pathogens, but do not specify how to procure them. An AP search of CDC procurement bids did not turn up any records, even though some other emergency procurements were publicly documented.Funding for the China CDC has stagnated in recent years, and researchers there often earn far lower wages than in the private sector. Many employees have departed for private sector jobs over the past decade, draining its labs of talent.Among those who left was BioGerm’s founder, Zhao Baihui, the former chief technician of the Shanghai CDC’s microbiology lab. Emails and financial records obtained by the AP show that Zhao first started BioGerm’s predecessor through an intermediary in 2012, while she was still at the Shanghai CDC. In the next five years, she sold thousands of dollars’ worth of test kits to her own workplace through the intermediary even as she herself was at times in charge of purchasing, internal emails, records and contracts obtained by the AP show.After quitting the CDC in 2017, Zhao spearheaded lucrative contracts with government officials – such as one worth 400,000 RMB ($60,000) with Shanghai customs officials where her husband worked, and another worth 55,500 RMB ($8,400) with CDC officials in Shanghai’s Pudong district, the emails and contracts show. Zhao declined to speak when reached by phone, and did not respond to an emailed request for comment.Another of the three companies, GeneoDx, enjoyed special access because it is a subsidiary of the state-run firm SinoPharm, which is managed directly by China’s cabinet. Before the outbreak, GeneoDx largely imported kits and acquired foreign technology to expand its business rather than develop its own products, according to company posts and a China CDC employee familiar with its operations.In October 2019, GeneoDx co-organized an internal CDC training conference on emerging respiratory diseases in Shanghai. Tan Wenjie, the CDC official who ran the training, was later put in charge of developing test kits, according to an internal document the AP obtained. In November, the company won a contract to sell 900,000 RMB ($137,000) worth of test kits to Tan’s institute.GeneoDx did not respond to requests for comment or interviews. The National Health Commission did not respond to a request for a comment or an interview with Tan.Also in attendance at the invitation-only event was BioGerm, as well as other companies that used the conference to promote their products, blurring the line between the government and the private sector. China CDC staff were invited to join a BioGerm group on WeChat, a Chinese messaging application, which CEO Zhao later used to sell coronavirus test kits, according to a CDC employee and a screenshot seen by the AP.The last company, Huirui, is a longtime partner with Tan, the CDC official in charge of test kits. Its founder, Li Hui, coauthored a paper with Tan on coronavirus tests in 2012 and “jointly developed” a test kit for the MERS outbreak in 2015 with Tan’s institute.In an interview, CEO Li said the CDC routinely contracted with his company to make emergency testing chemicals. He said Tan’s lab at the China CDC had contacted him on Jan. 4 or 5 to make testing chemicals for the coronavirus based on CDC designs. He denied any personal relationship with Tan or any payments to the CDC.“We’ve been working with the CDC to respond to emerging new diseases for about ten years, not just for a day or two, it’s normal,” Li said.Their connections situated the three little-known companies in prime position in January, when a then-unknown pathogen was about to sweep the country and the world and change their fortunes._________The first step in making test kits is to get samples of the virus and decode its genetic sequence. This leads to test designs, essentially a recipe for the tests.In the past, such as with H7N9 in 2013, the China CDC sent test designs to laboratories across the country just days after identifying the pathogen. It also shipped along the chemical compounds needed – in effect the ingredients – for hospitals and CDC branches to mix their own test kits as soon as possible.At first it looked like the China CDC was using the same playbook this time. The CDC had found the genetic map, or genome, of the virus by Jan. 3. By the next day, under CDC official Tan, the Emergency Technology Center at its Institute for Viral Disease Control had come up with test designs.But this time, the government held back information about the genome and test designs. Instead, the China CDC finalized “technology transfer” agreements to give the test designs to the three Shanghai companies, according to four people familiar with the matter. The selection process was kept secret.The CDC did not have the authority to altogether prevent other scientists with competing agencies and companies from getting samples through back door routes and coming up with their own test recipes. But it tried to stymie such efforts and stop testing from being carried out.For example, Dr. Shi Zhengli, a renowned coronavirus expert at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, obtained patient samples on her own, found the genome from them and came up with a test by Jan. 3, according to a slideshow presentation she gave in March. But her lab fell under the jurisdiction of a competing agency to the CDC, the Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology. The CDC barred her from obtaining more samples and testing for cases.“There’s no open collaboration mechanism,” said a public health expert who often works with the China CDC, declining to be named for fear of damaging relations there. “Everyone wants their turf.”Provincial CDC staff were told that instead of testing and reporting cases themselves, they had to send patient samples to designated labs in Beijing for full sequencing, a complicated and time-consuming procedure. Otherwise, the cases would not be counted in the national coronavirus tally.“It was absolutely abnormal,” said a CDC lab technician, who declined to be identified out of fear of retribution. “They were totally trying to make it harder for us to report any confirmed cases.”In secret evaluations of test kits on Jan. 10, the CDC also approved only those from the three Shanghai companies, according to internal plans and instructions obtained by the AP.The Chinese government finally made its genomes public on Jan. 12, a day after another team published one without authorization. That opened the door for more companies to make their own test kits. However, China’s top health agency, the National Health Commission, still urged medical staff to buy the test kits from Huirui, BioGerm and GeneoDx that the CDC had validated, according to internal instructions obtained by the AP.The evaluations and selections of test kits were conducted with the knowledge and direction of China’s top health official, Ma Xiaowei, according to a CDC post on Jan. 13.On Jan. 14, Ma held an internal teleconference to order secret preparations for a pandemic, as AP earlier reported. After that, China’s health authorities relaxed the requirements to confirm cases and started distributing the CDC-sanctioned test kits. BioGerm began taking orders from provincial CDC staff across the country on WeChat, a Chinese social media application.“We’ve been entrusted by the national CDC to issue kits for you,” Zhao said, according to a screenshot of one of the group chats obtained by The Associated Press.“Quick! Give me, give me,” said one staffer in the Sichuan CDC.But the kits from GeneoDx kept showing inconclusive results, the CDC technician told the AP, and eventually her superior ordered her to toss them aside. The kits from Huirui were also unreliable, and the only ones that worked consistently were from BioGerm, she said.“The quality was not good. Bad, poor quality,” said a public health expert familiar with the matter, who declined to be identified to avoid damaging ties with the China CDC. “But because they had a collaboration with the (CDC) Institute for Viral Disease Control and… they paid a million yuan, they were on the list.”BioGerm’s test kits were more dependable in part because they used chemicals from Invitrogen, a subsidiary of U.S. biotech giant Thermo Fisher. Huirui and GeneoDx used their own mixes instead, with more unreliable results.Much larger competitors, including Chinese genetics giant BGI and Tianlong, developed their own kits in January, which were later found to be more effective than those made by the Shanghai companies. But those test kits weren’t endorsed by the China CDC.“No test protocol, no primers and probes, then of course there’s no way to confirm cases,” said another China CDC employee who declined to be identified for fear of retribution. “And then, all of a sudden, you tell all the CDCs: purchase from these companies, now go for it. Then – chaos and shortage. Valuable time wasted.”Chen Weijun, BGI’s chief infectious disease scientist, also said the early products recommended by the China CDC had “quality problems.” When asked why the China CDC selected the three Shanghai companies, Chen demurred.“You better ask the CDC this question,” said Chen, who collaborated with CDC researchers to publish the first paper on the virus. “But actually, everyone understands what’s going on, why this happened, right? You can reach your own conclusions, right?”____________A day after the first test kits finally arrived in Wuhan on Jan. 16, the case count began to rise again. But test kits were scarce. Some other cities in the same province didn’t get kits until Jan. 22, and even those were often flawed.Samples from 213 patients in February using GeneoDx tests suggested a false-negative rate of over 30 per cent, a study by Shenzhen doctors found. A March clinical trial report showed that among the test kits certified at the time, GeneoDx was the worst performer, followed by BioGerm. In general, the rate of false negatives for COVID tests varies widely, from 2% to more than 37%.Philippe Klein, a French doctor who treated foreign patients in Wuhan during the outbreak, estimated that about 20 per cent of the tests turned up false negatives. Still, he said, delays in producing accurate tests kits are natural at the start of an outbreak.“The Chinese did a lot in a short time,” Klein said. “It was a new test, so in the beginning, there was a lack of tests, of course.”On Jan. 22, the National Health Commission quietly removed the names of the three Shanghai companies from its coronavirus guide as preferred distributors. After the Chinese government ordered Wuhan shut down on Jan. 23, the three companies faced massive logistical hurdles to getting their tests in.On Jan. 26, officials set up a fast-track “green channel” for companies to get their test kits approved. The National Medical Products Administration approved test kits from seven companies, including BioGerm and GeneoDx but not Huirui. Li, Huirui’s CEO, said it was because his company was inexperienced in obtaining regulatory approvals for commercial tests.But it took time for other companies to ramp up production and ship tests in, leaving Wuhan struggling to meet demand into early February and depriving many residents of treatment.Peng died on Feb. 19. His mother now passes the days gazing blankly out her window, sobbing and lighting candles in his memory.“In the eyes of officials, he was like a grain of sand or a blade of grass. But in our home, he was our sky, he was our everything,” Zhong said. “Without him, we can never be happy again.”The same pandemic that killed Peng brought the Shanghai test kit companies and related scientists fame and fortune.In September, Tan, the China CDC researcher in charge of developing test kits, was appointed the inaugural director of a new National Novel Coronavirus Center. In a nationally televised ceremony, GeneoDx’s parent firm won plaudits from President Xi for “outstanding” contributions in the struggle against COVID-19, including developing a test kit.Huirui has expanded and is now selling commercial test kits for the first time — not in China, but in Latin America, CEO Li said. And the pandemic has allowed BioGerm to “stand out,” reaching its business targets much faster than planned, said top marketing executive Guo Xiaoling at a trade show in late August at a five-star hotel.“Because of the epidemic, 2020 has been a really special year,” Guo said. “The country and the economy suffered major damage. But for our nucleic acid diagnostics industry, this year has actually been a bonus.”___Associated Press journalists Emily Wang in Wuhan, Maria Cheng in London and Robert Bumsted in South Orange, New Jersey, contributed to this report.

      "CONTENT : BEIJING - China said Thursday its latest lunar probe has finished taking samples of the moon’s surface and sealed them within the spacecraft for return to Earth, the first time such a mission has been attempted by any country in more than 40 years.The Chang’e 5, the third Chinese probe to land on the moon, is the latest in a series of increasingly ambitious missions for Beijing’s space program, which also has a probe en route to Mars carrying a robot rover.The Chang’e 5 touched down Tuesday on the Sea of Storms on the moon’s near side, on a mission to return lunar rocks to Earth for the first time since 1976.The probe “has completed sampling on the moon, and the samples have been sealed within the spacecraft,” the China National Space Administration said in a statement.Plans call for the upper stage of the probe known as the ascender to be launched back into lunar orbit to transfer the samples to a capsule for return to Earth. The timing off its return was not immediately clear and the lander can last up to one moon day, or 14 Earth days, before plummeting temperatures would make it inoperable.Chang’e is equipped to both scoop samples from the surface and drill 2 metres (more than 6 feet) to retrieve materials that could provide clues into the history of the moon, Earth other planets and space features.While retrieving samples is its main task, the lander is also equipped to extensively photograph the area surrounding its landing site, map conditions below the surface with ground penetrating radar and analyze the lunar soil for minerals and water content.Chang’e 5’s return module is supposed to touch down around the middle of December on the grasslands of Inner Mongolia, where China’s crewed Shenzhou spacecraft have made their returns since China first put a man in space in 2003, becoming only the third country do so after Russia and the United States.Chang’e 5 has revived talk of China one day sending a crewed mission to the moon and possibly building a scientific base there, although no timeline has been proposed for such projects.China also launched Its first temporary orbiting laboratory in 2011 and a second in 2016. Plans call for a permanent space station after 2022, possibly to be serviced by a reusable space plane.While China is boosting co-operation with the European Space Agency and others, interactions with NASA are severely limited by concerns over the secretive nature and close military links of the Chinese program.While\n",

      "CONTENT : What happens to those who defend democratic values against authoritarian encroachment?In the U.S., you may be fired, as was Army Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, a key witness in President Donald Trump’s 2019-2020 impeachment probe. Or the president might declare you an “enemy of the people.” This odious branding befell Brad Raffensperger, Georgia’s Republican secretary of state, for his role in helping certify that President-elect Joe Biden carried his state. In Hong Kong, however, your fate is more dire.This was brought home to me in a powerful and important film about Denise Ho, the Hong-Kong born, Montreal-raised Cantopop singer, writer, and human rights activist. Entitled “Denise Ho: Becoming the Song,” the film premiers in Canada on TV Ontario on Dec. 5.Like many Hong Kongers, Ho’s parents emigrated to Canada, fearful that the “one country, two systems” pledge preserving Hong Kong’s democratic traditions, would not be honoured with the 1997 handover of Hong Kong from British to Chinese control. Growing up in Montreal, Ho not only absorbed the joie de vivre and artistic, multicultural vibe of the city, but also acquired a taste for democracy, and the creative freedom of expression it affirms.The film includes charming footage of Ho’s teenage performances in Montreal, with her recounting how she overcame her adolescent shyness and found a sense of herself as a singer and performer. Ho’s story subtly reveals the profound connection between artistic expression and political freedom. Incubated, as it were, in a liberal, democratic Canada, she brought those values back to Hong Kong to pursue her performance career. Ho’s deep-seated love for her coming-of-age city is palpable in the film when, overcome with emotion, she falters as she attempts to sing her hit tune, “Montreal.”As protege of her Cantopop idol, Anita Mui, Denise learned the Cantopop craft from her superstar mentor, dubbed the “Madonna of the East,” before Mui’s untimely death from cervical cancer in 2003. The film records Ho’s subsequent rise in Hong Kong’s pop culture scene, and her branching out to mainland China, which brought easy money and lucrative corporate sponsorships. But Ho hungered for something more than glitz and lucre. Encouraged by gay activist and performer Anthony Wong, she decided to come out publicly as a lesbian in 2012 as the Hong Kong legislative council debated protection for the LGBTQ community, and began to weave her sexuality into her music.But when Ho “came out” against the infringement of human rights and freedoms in Hong Kong, and was arrested during a public protest, her life radically changed. She was banned from mainland China, the provenance of over 80 per cent of her income, and her songs and social media accounts were all removed. Her sponsors, such as Lancome, abandoned her in 2016, compelling her to shift from dazzling stages to the street, performing in shops, streetcars, and laneways, and crowdfunding for her concerts.As Ho observes in the film, “I had all these themes of freedom and revolution in my songs, but I was only role-playing back then because it was only in my head. But then so many years later on, with what happened afterwards, it just became a reality show.”Why is Denise Ho’s story so important?This film provides a rare opportunity to celebrate someone speaking out for democratic values in Hong Kong, despite tremendous personal and professional losses. Ho’s remarkable blend of steel-edge courage and emotional vulnerability is an inspiring example. Ho’s story cogently demonstrates that a crisis in democracy in Hong Kong is an international crisis, inviting us to find ways to support the people of Hong Kong as they feel the heavy breath of authoritarian rule. (Many involved in the film were reluctant to speak with me fearing dangerous repercussions.)As the life stories of democratically minded whistleblowers in the United States and Hong Kong show, there can be a high price for defending your ideals.What can one person do about it? Watch this film.Correction - Dec. 3, 2020: This article was edited from a previous version that misstated Cantpop singer Anita Mui’s surname. \n",

      "CONTENT : This past summer of discontent against police has set the stage for Norm Lipinski, the new top cop in Surrey, who is vowing a slew of changes in one of Canada’s fastest growing and most culturally diverse cities. From more cops on bikes to walking the beat and welcoming soirees for new Canadians, Lipinski’s central goal revolves around creating a force that will police the plurality of Surrey with constant engagement and strident enforcement. “That will begin with creating a command structure that reflects the diversity of Surrey both in ethnicity and gender,” Lipinksi told NCM as he prepared for his new role that will begin later this month. “We can learn a lot from the anti-police sentiment that has swept many parts of the world this past summer, especially in the U.S. and from the great work of the RCMP has done in Surrey. But now is a time for change to remove tensions and rebuild confidence in police,” he said. “We can do it and build a more modern, inclusive, accountable, and community-based model,” said Lipinski, who brings 42 years of policing experience to Surrey, where close to half of residents are immigrants. Lipinski said the first order of business will be to hire a complement of senior staff and officers that will be reflective of the community with recruitment efforts targeting ethnic and Indigenous communities and women. The RCMP employs nearly three-quarters of B.C.’s 9,500 police with 18 per cent of its officers coming from visible minority groups and another five per cent comprising Indigenous persons. About 20 per cent of RCMP members across the country are women. While these numbers may be representative for rural communities, it is out of whack for places like Surrey, where 34 per cent of residents speak English as a secondary language and where females outnumber males in the general population. Statistics Canada said in a report last week that people designated as visible minorities report less confidence in police than non-visible minority people. Just over one-third (35 per cent) of Canadians belonging to population groups designated as visible minorities reported having a great deal of confidence in the police in 2019, compared with 44 per cent among non-visible minority people, the national number crunchers said. Confidence levels also varied among different visible minority groups. For example, Southeast Asian (25 per cent) and Chinese (26 per cent) Canadians were less likely to report a great deal of confidence in the police compared with non-visible minority people (44 per cent). Lipinski, a former assistant commissioner for the RCMP’s E-Division in B.C., said he will be reaching out to faith leaders, community groups, NGOs, neighbourhood associations and local media among others as he works on a strategic plan for the Surrey Police Force, which will have 1,150 employees — 805 police officers, 325 civilian positions and 20 Community Safety Personnel (CSP). Surrey currently is the only one of 19 major Canadian population centres with more than 300,000 people without a local police department. A self-described data geek, with a Master of Business Administration degree as well as a Bachelor of Laws degree, Lipinski plans to use the community consultations to draw up a delivery service model that will hinge on a $200 million budget annually. “If the data shows we can deliver better service by having officers out of their cars and walking the beat or on bikes, we will do it,” said Lipinski. The veteran cop also plans meet and greet sessions for immigrants and refugees as they settle in Surrey which is home to about a fifth of all new arrivals to B.C. “Our recruiting will be different, our tone will be different and our engagement will be different,” Lipinski added.\n",

      "CONTENT : SEOUL—The roughly $500-billion (all figures U.S.) home-appliance industry is making a hard pivot toward hygiene as the coronavirus pandemic shows no sign of moderating.LG Electronics Inc.’s refrigerators have been retrofitted with sterilizing ultraviolet lights previously used in its water purifiers, while Whirlpool Corp. has touted washing machines with built-in heating that removes germs and allergens from clothes. Samsung Electronics Co. is scooping up scientists who specialize in water and air quality, and Beko Electrical Appliances Co., a Turkish manufacturer, recently rolled out “HygieneShield,” a range of appliances such as refrigerators and ovens equipped with disinfection drawers. It is also offering a cleaning cabinet, a stand-alone appliance that resembles a microwave oven but is designed to disinfect everyday items such as wallets and mobile phones.According to Mark Choe, a senior vice-president at Samsung’s digital appliances business division, “all of our product development now is being done through the lens of hygiene.”Indeed, hygiene is driving the home-appliance industry’s extreme makeover. For decades, firms saw sales grow sluggishly, especially in lucrative markets in the U.S. and Western Europe, churning out a predictable cycle of dryers, ovens and microwave ovens. A push toward digitized “smart homes” failed to captivate consumers who saw little reason to track their milk levels through artificial intelligence or get text alerts when the laundry was done.But now, virus-weary buyers are perking up everywhere. Household appliances are breaking down faster than before with increased use as people shelter at home, and existing malfunctions have now become more intolerable. As travel remains limited because of the pandemic, wealthier consumers flush with cash are choosing to upgrade household products or splurge on new purchases.“The COVID-19 situation is not actually a crisis for us,” said Song Dae-hyun, the departing president of LG’s home appliances and air solutions division. “People now think of home as the safest area — and they’re using their appliances more because they’re at home.”Even with pandemic fatigue vexing virus-prevention efforts, two-thirds of global respondents polled in recent months prioritized staying home over leading a normal life, according to Gallup survey results released in mid-November.Months spent isolating in southern Spain prompted Jaime Gomez Moreno to look for a top-of-the-line upgrade to keep his four-bedroom home clean. In April, Gomez Moreno, a 31-year-old entrepreneur in the city of Cadiz, splurged on a roughly $600 robot vacuum cleaner made by China’s Xiaomi Corp. It not only swept away dust but also scrubbed his floors, he said.“I spent more money because it was the latest model,” Gómez Moreno said. “Certainly we went a little crazy to have the cleanest and, above all, sanitized house, without fingerprints, without viruses.”All the extra attention on the domestic front has also breathed new life into existing offerings. There are months-long backlogs for refrigerators and dryers in the U.S. Nationwide sales of kitchen appliances such as air fryers and slow cookers shot up 40 per cent from spring to the end of August, said the NPD Group, a market tracking firm.“There’s a new set of needs being created as we speak,” said Joe Derochowski, a home-industry analyst for NPD.Growth is most dramatic for products used in the kitchen and for cleaning. From mid-March to the end of August, sales of vacuum cleaners, fans, humidifiers and water filters grew 32 per cent from the year-earlier period, NPD said. Demand for washing machines with purifying steam functions grew 46 per cent during the May-to-August period, while sales of air-treatment appliances surged 23 per cent, according from GfK SE, a market researcher.Industry analysts forecast that the breakneck pace may slow somewhat next year as vaccine breakthroughs herald a potential end to the pandemic, though GfK forecasts demand for major home appliances will still grow by five per cent in the first half of 2021.“The pandemic has changed how consumers think about being at home,” said Norbert Herzog, an expert on major home appliances at GfK.For Samsung, Latin American vacuum-cleaner sales have more than tripled in the first half of the year from a year earlier. In its home country of South Korea, demand for a clothes steamer — about the size of a phone booth —has doubled, with advertisements now prominently pitching its disinfecting features.Haier Smart Home Co., the Chinese company that bought General Electric Co.’s appliance unit, tapped influencers to hawk products on live streams to juice online sales as the pandemic forced many physical stores to close. Domestic sales of its air conditioners rose 27 per cent in the third quarter, while dishwasher use in Europe soared by 24 per cent. In its most-recent quarter, Haier reported a 58 per cent rise in overseas operating profit.Amid the rising demand for hygiene appliances, LG is guaranteeing that some of its cleaning products with steam functions “kill over 99.9 per cent” of viruses” when sanitizing items like face masks. It is also starting to sell what it calls a new “wearable” air purifier. Worn over the face and made of plastic, the gadget has tiny motors that direct air through a pair of HEPA filters.“People are being educated on how important hygiene is, and how important cleanliness is,” said LG’s Mr. Song.Sanam Ijadi and her family are building a new home in Great Neck, N.Y. — and they are spending extra throughout their home because keeping the family safe and healthy is her top priority. Deliveries for many of the appliances she has ordered have been delayed for up to nine months due to backlogs, but the 43-year-old, who helps with her husband’s leather-manufacturing business, doesn’t expect life to return to normal for at least another year.“We decided to use higher quality because we wanted to use everything longer,” she said. “I do think it’s a change in your mindset.”Have you upgraded any appliances during the pandemic?Anyone can read Conversations, but to contribute, you should be registered Torstar account holder.

      "CONTENT : MAINZ, Germany - The email that arrived in the ancient German city of Mainz shortly before 1 a.m. in the morning marked a turning point in the global effort to deliver a reliable vaccine against the coronavirus pandemic - and for the little-known biotechnology company that helped develop it.BioNTech has at times been portrayed as the junior partner in U.S. pharmaceutical giant Pfizer’s race to get approval for the COVID vaccine a pandemic-weary world is desperately waiting for. In fact, the company’s use of gene technology to beat the virus was key to the rapid development of the vaccine that British regulators OK’d for emergency use early Wednesday.Founded twelve years ago, BioNTech specializes in harnessing so-called messenger RNA, or mRNA, to train the immune system to attack hostile invaders, from viruses to tumors. Until now, the technology had never been approved for a drug in humans, but the company’s founders said they immediately saw the potential when the virus first emerged early this year.“When we understood that this outbreak in China could become a global pandemic we felt the obligation to start vaccine development,“ BioNTech’s Chief Executive Ugur Sahin told The Associated Press in a recent interview.“We have technologies in place which allow us to make vaccines and evaluate candidates in an ultra-fast fashion,” he said.But Sahin, who came to Germany from Turkey with his parents as a young child, said he and his colleagues also understood they didn’t have the means to roll out mass trials of vaccine candidates with tens of thousands of participants, a key part of testing whether the shot would be both effective and safe.“It was very clear from the beginning that we need to to go into a collaboration,” said Sahin.He immediately reached out to Pfizer, with whom BioNTech had previously started work on a flu vaccine, and researchers at the two companies began working together even before commercial contracts had been signed.“This trust-based relationship is one of the key factors why we have been so fast, because it allowed allowed us to share data, to share information, to start to avoid any type of delay,” Sahin said.What followed was a flurry of activity as BioNTech and Pfizer raced rivals such as Johnson & Johnson, AstraZeneca and Moderna to become the first to get emergency authorization for a COVID vaccine. Unlike rivals in China and Russia, all of the companies have followed the established path of conducting trials in three stages, publishing results as they go along and submitting them to independent regulators for review.While authorities in the United States, Britain and the European Union indicated they would make a decision before the end of the year, it wasn’t clear who would be first until U.K. authorities announced they’d approved the BioNTech-Pfizer shot Wednesday.“It was (an email) very early this morning, in the early, early hours from the regulators saying we had received approval,” BioNTech’s Chief Commercial Officer, Sean Marett, told The AP.Marett, a softly spoken Brit with long experience in the pharmaceutical industry, said the company hasn’t had time to celebrate yet.“We’re too busy worrying about packing boxes for the U.K.,” he said, adding that the first shipments would likely hit the road in the coming 24 to 48 hours.Marett dismissed suggestions that British authorities might have taken shortcuts, saying they had asked “very, very deep questions and detailed questions, just like any other agency.”BioNTech hopes sales of the vaccine will more than cover the cost of development and production. Together with Pfizer and Chinese distributor Fosun Pharma it hopes to ship at least 1.3 billion doses of the COVID vaccine in 2021.“We’re a biotechnology company, loss-making, and of course we need to generate some money so we can keep in business,” he said.Marett said the company currently has 1,800 staff and expects to grow in the coming years, its focus will remain on pushing developing new drugs. Sahin, who co-founded BioNTech along with Ozlem Tureci, his wife, said that aside from the flu vaccine being developed with Pfizer the company is also already working with others on a dozen different shots including for HIV and tuberculosis.“BioNTech stands for Bio New Technologies, and that’s what fascinates us about what we can do, really use new technologies to address disease,” Marett told The AP. “We’ve hopefully demonstrated, at least with the first approval, that that approach may be useful to society.“___Jordans reported from Berlin.\n",

      "CONTENT : WELLINGTON, New Zealand - Australia’s economy grew by 3.3% in the third quarter, rebounding from its first recession in nearly three decades as it recovered from pandemic-related shocks, according to figures released Wednesday.Treasurer Josh Frydenberg told reporters the country still has a lot of ground to make up from the coronavirus downturn.“Australia’s recession may be over, but Australia’s economic recovery is not,” he said.Despite the latest quarterly rise, the economy contracted at a 3.8% annual pace. That’s after GDP fell by 0.3% in the first quarter and then by a record 7% in the second quarter.“But the Australian economy has demonstrated its remarkable resilience and Australia is as well positioned as any other nation on Earth,“ Frydenberg said. “Today’s national accounts represent a major step forward in Australia’s economic recovery.”Before this year, Australia had managed to avoid a recession for 28 years. The economy grew even during the global financial crisis thanks to strong demand for Australia’s mineral exports and a robust domestic sector.The better-than-expected figures were encouraging, economists said.“The rebound in Q3 GDP reversed around 40% of the decline during the first half of the year and we expect output to return to pre-virus levels by mid-2021,“ Ben Udy of Capital Economics said in a commentary.Now on top of the pandemic, Australia is enduring a spate of rocky relations with China, its biggest trading partner.Frydenberg said the situation with China is “very serious” but his government is focusing on striking deals with other countries in Asia and beyond.“We have great produce, and we have great services, and we have great resource sectors, and I’m very optimistic about the opportunities for our exporters around the world,“ he said.Australia’s relationship with China worsened this week after a Chinese official tweeted a fake image of a grinning Australian soldier holding a bloodied knife to a child’s throat.Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison called the image “repugnant” and demanded an apology from the Chinese government. But China has not backed down.The post took aim at alleged abuses by elite Australian soldiers during the conflict in Afghanistan.Tensions have been growing this year since the Australian government called for an independent inquiry into the origins of the pandemic. China has imposed tariffs and other restrictions on a number of Australian exports.\n",

      "CONTENT : The telemedicine arm of Chinese e-commerce giant JD.com Inc. raised $3.5 billion (U.S.) in Hong Kong’s largest initial public offering this year, taking proceeds from new listings in the city to a 10-year high.JD Health International Inc., which operates China’s largest online retail pharmacy and provides other health-care services, priced its stock offering at the top end of an indicative range, after strong demand for its shares from investors.The IPO, which could raise up to $4 billion if underwriting banks exercise an option to buy additional stock after it starts trading, gives the Beijing-based company a valuation of $28.5 billion.More than 120 companies have raised $44.6 billion through IPOs and secondary listings in Hong Kong this year, the highest since 2010 when the city logged nearly $68 billion from new listings, according to Dealogic. Companies from China have dominated the rankings, and make up the majority of Hong Kong’s more than $5 trillion stock-market capitalization.Jie Lu, head of investments for China at Robeco, said Hong Kong remains an important financial hub for Chinese companies to raise capital. Some investors had been concerned about Hong Kong’s status as a major global financial centre during recent geopolitical tensions in the city, but Beijing wouldn’t want to close “this important window for international investors to access China,” he said.Technology firms that listed in recent years have also been able to sell more stock. On Wednesday, Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi Corp. raised $4 billion via a share placement and sale of convertible bonds, about a week after the company reported a jump in global smartphone sales for the three months to September.Xiaomi’s shares fell 7.1 per cent Wednesday after the new shares were sold at a discounted price. They have more than doubled in the year to date, giving the company a market capitalization of roughly $76 billion.The robust fundraising is solidifying Hong Kong’s status as a major capital raising hub for Chinese companies amid strained relations between China and the U.S., and as American policy-makers have sought to step up scrutiny of New York-listed Chinese companies.U.S. lawmakers on Wednesday are likely to consider a plan that would force Chinese companies whose shares trade on American exchanges to comply with audit-oversight rules within three years, or delist from the New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq Stock Market.So far, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., Yum China Holdings Inc. and JD.com have been among 10 U.S.-listed companies that have added secondary listings in Hong Kong over the past 13 months.Robeco’s Mr. Lu said an increasing number of U.S.-traded firms returning to Hong Kong or the mainland for secondary listings would help them hedge any risk of U.S. restrictions on Chinese companies.JD Health fixed its IPO price at 70.58 Hong Kong dollars per share, and is scheduled to start trading Dec. 8, according to a term sheet seen by The Wall Street Journal. The company plans to use the funds raised to make investments and expand its business. Its listing will likely also result in a handsome payday for JD.com’s billionaire founder Richard Liu.This week, the company stopped collecting orders from institutional buyers a day ahead of schedule, after the deal was multiple times oversubscribed, according to a person familiar with the situation. The buyers include investment funds that typically hold stocks for long periods. BlackRock Inc., Tiger Global Singapore Pte. and Hillhouse Capital Management Ltd. were among so-called cornerstone investors that committed to buy up to $1.35 billion stock in the IPO.Demand from individual investors was also strong, according to Bright Smart Securities Chief Executive Edmond Hui Yik-bun, who said many investors took out margin loans to purchase JD Health stock. The offering was led by units of Bank of America Corp., Haitong International Securities Group Ltd. and UBS Group AG.\n",

      "CONTENT : Cooking by Degrees features 16 of Canada’s top college and university chefs sharing recipes that are popular with students for readers to make at home. Each story includes a recipe, a profile of the chef and insights from the farmers who produce our food. Study-abroad opportunities abound at Canadian universities. They’re entrenched in many academic programs and they’re sure to make a comeback in the post-pandemic world.And when it comes to food, international studies immerse students in their host country’s cuisine, either serendipitously or by design.That broadens their palates appreciably…and when they return to Canada, they want more than a traditional North American diet from the university’s food services.Queen’s University executive chef Colin Johnson says bring it on.    “I like this kind of food challenge,” he says. “International and variety go hand in hand, and as chefs, we like creating new meals. Our campus is ever changing with more demands for global foods.”          To accommodate demands and new influences, Queen’s opened a food outlet called Khao seven years ago, specializing in Thai, Indian and Chinese dishes.A feature soon to be on the menu is chef Johnson’s Thai-inspired Chili Beef Stir Fry, made with boneless blade steak. Johnson created this dish while at home during the COVID-19 shut down in the spring.He likes boneless blade steak for two reasons.First, it’s a lean protein when the visible fat is trimmed off.And second, he likes the flavour profile that he says accompanies less expensive beef cuts, including tri-tip, inside round, skirt steak and flat iron steak.“They have a more intense, robust beef flavour,” he says. “They’re tasty, they hold up on their own when you add something else to them, like spices and herbs. You don’t want any one ingredient to overwhelm another, you want it to be a hidden complement.”Johnson, who has worked at Queen’s for 28 years, is familiar with a global clientele. In 2010 he was the executive sous chef at the Vancouver Olympics, where he and his team of 80 chefs and cooks fed 2,630 athletes from 82 countries.“That experience taught me how to work with a diverse team and gave me a new ability to cook for a global palate,” he says.  A new crop of Canadian cattle producersAnd just like a new wave of university students with diverse tastes is emerging, there’s also a new crop of Canadian cattle producers evolving here.They’re ranchers like Thomas Hagan — nephew of University of Guelph president Charlotte Yates — who raises 300 cattle with his family on a 3,200-acre ranch near Virden, Man., committed to sustainability through an approach called regenerative agriculture.It’s based on helping the soil reach new heights of healthiness, rich in beneficial bacteria and microorganisms and putting carbon in the soil.The cattle have a role in pasture improvement, aerating the soil with their cloven hooves and working their manure into the soil with each step they take. Hagan herds them shoulder to shoulder, mimicking the action of tightly packed wildebeest herds on the savannah.The cattle change pastures up to five times a day, with help from automatic fence-lifting devices that open up greener pastures to them.Says Hagan, this year’s recipient of the Environmental Stewardship Award from Manitoba Beef Producers: “Grass is our number one asset, and the better we are at growing it, the more productive we are.”               Pair chef Johnson’s Thai-inspired Chili Beef Stir Fry with a lager such as Gananoque Brewing Company’s Naughty Otter or Perth Brewery’s Last Duel.  Thai-inspired Chili Beef Stir FryIngredients:·      2 lb (900 g) boneless blade steak or bottom flat·      2 tbsp fish sauce·      2 tsp brown sugar·      1 tsp ground coriander·      pinch of cayenne pepper·      8 tsp vegetable oil·      3 jalapeno chilies, diced·      1 medium red onion, julienned·      1 1/2 tbsp minced garlic·      2 cups snap peas or broccoli florets, small·      1/2 cup cilantro, roughly chopped·      1/2 cup fresh mint, chiffonade·      1/2 cup roasted peanuts, choppedSauce:·      3 tbsp fish sauce·      3 tbsp rice wine vinegar·      2 tbsp brown sugar·      1 1/2 tbsp chili-garlic paste or more to taste·      2 tbsp waterDirections:1.     Trim blade steaks of visible fat and any gristle. Cut into 1/8-inch slices approximately 1 1/2 inches long (needs to be sliced thinly or beef will be tough).2.     Toss the beef with the fish sauce, sugar, coriander and cayenne pepper. Marinate for 1 hour.3.     Combine all ingredients for sauce and whisk together. Cover and set aside.4.     Split the beef into 3 batches. In a skillet, cook off beef using 2 teaspoons of oil per batch (medium-high heat). Once beef is nicely browned on the edges, cover and set aside.5.     Add remaining oil to the skillet on medium heat. Add jalapeno, onion and garlic. Cook for a few minutes until onion softens slightly. Add snap peas, toss and cook for 30 seconds.6.     Add beef and any juices that may have accumulated. Add previously made sauce (whisking first). Toss ingredients while cooking for a further 45 seconds or so.  7.     Stir in half the cilantro and mint — toss. Transfer to serving dish. Sprinkle with remaining herbs and peanuts. Serve with rice and lime wedges.  Check out Beef Know-how for a stir-fry lesson and more.Disclaimer This content was funded but not approved by the advertiser.\n",
