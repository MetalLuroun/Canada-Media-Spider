Innocent citizens should not be caught in the crossfire of superpowers as they negotiate and manage their competition or differences.”She acknowledged that the situation is complicated but added, “I’m sometimes reminded there are three ways Michael comes home.”\n",

      "CONTENT : TAIPEI — Months after eliminating a popular challenge to its rule in Hong Kong, China is turning to an even higher-stakes target: self-governing Taiwan. The island has been bracing for conflict with China for decades, and in some respects, that battle has now begun.It’s not the final, titanic clash that Taiwan has long feared, with Chinese troops storming the beaches. Instead, the People’s Liberation Army, China’s two-million-strong military, has launched a form of “grey zone” warfare. In this irregular type of conflict, which stops short of an actual shooting war, the aim is to subdue the foe through exhaustion.Beijing is conducting waves of threatening forays from the air while ratcheting up existing pressure tactics to erode Taiwan’s will to resist, say current and former senior Taiwanese and U.S. military officers. The flights, they say, complement amphibious landing exercises, naval patrols, cyber attacks and diplomatic isolation.\n",

The internet is rife with advice on how to make the most of solitude while keeping it together, and survive the holidays without seeing our families.Now imagine that you’ve missed two Christmases with your loved ones, and every other day in between. You haven’t spent those days in the comfort of your home, either; you’ve spent them in a cramped cell, in a foreign country, where the lights have been kept on 24 hours a day and you have been repeatedly interrogated for hours on end.That is the reality Canadians Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor have endured, for the past two years, as prisoners in China.\n",

Talks with Japanese counterpart Toshimitsu Motegi covered maritime tensions, trade and the pandemic response.On Wednesday, Wang will make a courtesy call on Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga, who has so far sought to balance Japan’s deep economic reliance on China with security concerns, including Beijing’s claims over the disputed isles that are controlled by Japan.While Suga has steered clear of the harsh anti-China rhetoric used by Japan’s ally the United States, he has moved to counter its influence by deepening ties with Australia and choosing Vietnam and Indonesia for his first overseas trip.“It’s important to interact with people and talk directly with each other,” Motegi told a news briefing after the talks.He was referring to schemes streamlining travel for business travelers and those residing in each country, which has been restricted due to the coronavirus pandemic.\n",

      "CONTENT : TOKYO — Japan and Australia agreed on a breakthrough defense pact on Tuesday allowing reciprocal visits for training and operations, and voiced concern over the disputed South China Sea, where China is extending its military influence.It is Japan’s first agreement covering foreign military presence on its soil since a status of forces agreement in 1960 that allowed the United States to base warships, jets and troops in Japan as part of an alliance that Washington describes as the bedrock of regional security.The Reciprocal Access Agreement strengthens defense ties between the two U.S. allies at a time when China is asserting its role in the region and the United States is going through a messy leadership transition.The pact allows Japanese and Australian troops to visit each other’s countries and conduct training and joint operations and was agreed in principle by Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga and his Australian counterpart, Scott Morrison, who is visiting Tokyo.“I hereby announce that we reached agreement in principle on a reciprocal access agreement, which had been negotiated to elevate security and defense cooperation between Japan and Australia to a new level,” Suga told a joint news conference.\n",

Their arrests came shortly after the detention in Canada of Chinese Huawei executive, Meng Wanzhou, on a U.S. extradition warrant.“Over the past two years, two Canadians, Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, have been detained arbitrarily by China, and Canada has done absolutely everything necessary to try and get them home safe,” Trudeau said Wednesday in the House of Commons.Ottawa has resisted applying sanctions against China in response, and the government has not moved to recall our ambassador or send China’s ambassador to Ottawa home. Instead the Liberal government says it has been working with allies to increase verbal pressure on China, and several countries have raised the plight of the two men on Canada’s behalf.\n",

In September, Russia announced a deal to supply Egypt with 25 million doses of the Sputnik V vaccine.Egypt’s government has confirmed relatively low numbers of coronavirus infections, partly due to limited public testing, but has been warning of a second wave of the pandemic as daily infections have risen in recent weeks.

      "CONTENT : Tomorrow, Canada marks a grim milestone. For two years, Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor will have been held hostage in China simply for being Canadian.While Canadians are rightfully concerned about the fate of our two wrongfully imprisoned citizens, China’s hostage diplomacy has awoken the Canadian public to a far larger reality. A realignment in geopolitics has taken place over the last 40 years, and Canada has been late to heed its warnings.For 40 years the great opening of China’s free market has not gone as we had hoped. And for the past 30 years, since tanks rolled into Tiananmen Square, the Western world has chosen to hope that things would get better.To this day, every business, public or private, remains subject to the strategic objectives of the Chinese state. This may not have been a big deal when China produced mainly low-tech goods like shoes and toothbrushes, but it has dramatic implications today as Chinese tech firms export facial recognition technology and surveillance drones. All Chinese firms are required by law to collaborate with Chinese intelligence agencies. Yes, that includes mining TikTok videos and feel-good apps for data. And it certainly concerns Huawei building our digital future.\n",

      "CONTENT : BEIJING/TAIPEI — China will strike back against any moves that undermine its core interests, its foreign ministry said on Friday, after U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said that Taiwan “has not been a part of China.”China calls Taiwan the most sensitive and important issue in its ties with the United States, and has been angered by the Trump administration’s stepped up support for the Chinese-claimed yet democratically ruled island, such as arms sales.Speaking in a U.S. radio interview on Thursday, Pompeo said: “Taiwan has not been a part of China.”“That was recognized with the work that the Reagan administration did to lay out the policies that the United States has adhered to now for three-and-a-half decades,” he said.The United States is bound by law to provide Taiwan with the means to defend itself, and officially only acknowledges the Chinese position that Taiwan is part of it, rather than explicitly recognizing China’s claims.Speaking in Beijing, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said Taiwan was an inalienable part of China and that Pompeo was further damaging Sino-U.S. ties.“We solemnly tell Pompeo and his ilk, that any behavior that undermines China’s core interests and interferes with China’s domestic affairs will be met with a resolute counterattack by China,” he said, without elaborating.\n",

OK, it’s what the spokesperson said so it’s worth reporting, however stilted. But this opinion piece long-marched on: “A quick look into Australia’s official report on this matter finds that troops indeed are reported to have slit the throats of young boys within Afghanistan. This cartoon, created by a Chinese satirical artist, is in fact true.”\n",

      "CONTENT : Meng Wanzhou, the scion of the Huawei telecommunications company, who is mired in extradition proceedings in Canadian court, has spent the last two years living under partial house arrest in her Vancouver mansions, a colourful and relaxing life compared to the “grey, grinding monotony,” endured by the two Canadians in China who were seized in retaliation for Meng’s 2018 arrest in Vancouver.The story of the Two Michaels — Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor — are inextricably linked with Meng’s fate and on Thursday evening, U.S. media reported the U.S. Justice Department was in discussions with Meng’s lawyers about dropping criminal proceedings against her in exchange for an admission of wrongdoing.It’s the latest development in a saga that has seen a distinct deterioration in the diplomatic relationships between Ottawa and Washington and Beijing, and raises questions not just about Meng’s future, but also the possible fate of Kovrig and Spavor, not to mention other Canadians imprisoned in China.\n",

As of Wednesday, there were 24,363 confirmed cases in China, and 490 deaths.Outside of China there were 191 cases in 24 countries and one death, in the Philippines.So far, 99 per cent of cases of the virus known as 2019-nCov are in China; 80 per cent are from the province of Hubei.Many of those who have died succumbed to multiple organ failure, not necessarily from the virus itself but from “the demand and the shock the virus causes in the body in general,” Dr. Mike Ryan, executive director of the WHO health emergencies program said at a media briefing from Geneva.

That made China the fifth country to send satellites into orbit following the Soviet Union, the United States, France and Japan.Nov. 26, 1975: China’s first recoverable satellite was successfully launched and returned to Earth.Nov. 20, 1999: China successfully launched its first unmanned spacecraft, the Shenzhou 1, at the Jiuquan launch center. The country launched another three unmanned spaceships in 2001 and 2002 in preparation for a manned spacecraft.Oct. 15, 2003: China became the third country after the United States and Russia to send a man into space with its own rocket.

As I said, I think it is important to resolve such concerns one by one through high-level talks,” Japanese Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi told reporters on Friday.He added he would have a “frank exchange” of views on bilateral relations with Wang, including on how to resume traffic between the two countries during the pandemic.\n",

      "CONTENT : WASHINGTON — President-elect Joe Biden’s incoming national security adviser Jake Sullivan said on Tuesday he was “deeply concerned” about the continuing arrests and the imprisonment of pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong.Hong Kong police arrested eight more activists on Tuesday over an anti-government protest in July, the latest move by authorities in a relentless crackdown on opposition forces in the Chinese-ruled, Asian financial hub.“We stand united with our allies and partners against China’s assault on Hong Kong’s freedoms – and to help those persecuted find safe haven,” Sullivan said on Twitter.Democracy activists say conditions have worsened in the former British colony since China imposed security legislation in June, making anything Beijing regards as subversion, secession, terrorism or colluding with foreign forces punishable by up to life in prison.China’s new law have raised alarm in the West. The United States has imposed a series of sanctions on senior officials from Hong Kong and China deemed responsible for Beijing’s crackdown in the territory.The latest such move was on Monday, when Washington imposed financial sanctions and a travel ban on 14 Chinese officials. In response, China summoned the acting top U.S. diplomat in Beijing on Tuesday and vowed to take “reciprocal” retaliation.\n",

      "CONTENT : If Joe Biden is genuine about wanting to build bridges across the turbulent waters of American political tribalism, he could make no better start than to forge a broad coalition to meet the challenge from China.Canadians should need no reminders about how pitiless and ruthless China’s leaders can be in mounting that challenge. Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig, a.k.a. the two Michaels, have been held on trumped-up charges in Chinese prisons for almost two years now. They are hostages in a dispute they had no part in over Chinese tech giant Huawei.Canada is doing what it can to ensure their release. But the broader challenge can only be met by a United States that leads its allies in concert abroad, and marshals every ounce of muscle that America can bring to bear at home. In some respects, the signs are positive.Canadians should need no reminders about how pitiless and ruthless China’s leaders can beIn Congress, where there is strong bi-partisan agreement that robust push-back against Xi Jinping’s aggressive brand of authoritarianism is now unavoidable, Biden would be knocking at an open door. By giving credit to President Donald Trump for leading the first U.S. administration since the end of the Cold War to take the Chinese threat seriously, he would be setting a very public precedent that his commitment to inclusive politics is more than rhetoric.\n",

China has also shut down most imports of Canadian canola.Two months ago, the United States announced targeted bans on some goods produced in Xinjiang in an effort to combat China’s use of forced labor by detained Uighur Muslims there.

That made China the fifth country to send satellites into orbit following the Soviet Union, the United States, France and Japan.Nov. 26, 1975: China’s first recoverable satellite was successfully launched and returned to Earth.Nov. 20, 1999: China successfully launched its first unmanned spacecraft, the Shenzhou 1, at the Jiuquan launch center. The country launched another three unmanned spaceships in 2001 and 2002 in preparation for a manned spacecraft.Oct. 15, 2003: China became the third country after the United States and Russia to send a man into space with its own rocket.

      "CONTENT : TAIPEI — Taiwan faces military threats on a daily basis from “authoritarian forces,” President Tsai Ing-wen said on Tuesday, as the United States announced a new $280 million arms sale package to the Chinese-claimed island, the sixth this year.The outgoing Trump administration has ramped up support for the democratic island, with 11 arms sale packages in total, and on Monday the U.S. government notified Congress of the sale of a new Field Information Communications System.Such sales have riled China, adding to existing tension between Beijing and Washington, with China placing sanctions on U.S. companies involved and stepping up its military activities near Taiwan, including regular air force missions.Speaking at a security forum in Taipei, Tsai noted the threats in the region, including the “increasingly militarized” South China Sea, which China claims large parts of and where it has built artificial islands with air and naval facilities.“Authoritarian forces consistently attempt to violate the existing norms-based order,” Tsai said. “Taiwan has been at the receiving end of such military threats on a daily basis.”Taiwan’s Defence Ministry said the latest weapons sale demonstrated that the U.S. commitment to helping strengthen the island’s defense capabilities remained unchanged.\n",

      "CONTENT : China has seized Australian citizens and restricted Australian exports. Sound familiar, Canada? Elaine Pearson of Human Rights Watch Australia explores Canberra’s reaction to pressure from Beijing. Part of a series.Dec. 10 is Human Rights Day – the 72nd anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. And it also marks a grim milestone: the second anniversary of the arrests of Canadians Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor in China. Their detention is effectively hostage diplomacy, in apparent retaliation for Canadian authorities’ arrest of the Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou on a U.S. extradition warrant.To Australians, this sounds disturbingly familiar. China has detained Australians on national security grounds with scant information about the crimes they are alleged to have committed. Six weeks after Chinese authorities arrested Kovrig and Spavor, Chinese officials detained an Australian writer, Dr. Yang Hengjun. This August, the Chinese authorities seized an Australian journalist Cheng Lei, a business news anchor for a Chinese state media outlet, on suspicion of “endangering national security.”\n",
