      "CONTENT : China has successfully activated its so-called “artificial sun,” a nuclear fusion reactor that could fuel its energy ambitions for years to come — if they can make it more sustainable.China’s Atomic Energy Authority fired up its HL-2M Tokamak reactor for the first time on Friday, state-controlled media report. The brief test is being hailed as an important scientific achievement amid a global effort to develop safer, cleaner forms of nuclear energy.“The development of nuclear fusion energy is not only a way to solve China’s strategic energy needs, but also has great significance for the future sustainable development of China’s energy and national economy,” the state-run People’s Daily said.\n",

      "The reactor generates power by applying powerful magnetic fields to a contained loop of hot plasma, which can reach temperatures of more than 150 million C. That’s up to 10 times hotter than the core of the sun, but magnets and supercooling technology keep it contained.The device sounds like something a supervillain might use for world domination, but China has been working alongside the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) project, a coalition of dozens of nuclear-powered nations. Their aim is to develop a reliable form of nuclear fusion based on the same concept.\n",

      "Fusion is a coveted and elusive form of nuclear technology that scientists have been trying to perfect for decades. Fusion generates power by fusing the nuclei of atoms together, without generating large amounts of nuclear waste. That’s the opposite of fission, the atom-splitting process currently employed by nuclear weapons and power plants. Fission is easier but it generates nuclear waste, whereas fusion is hard to achieve but cleaner to maintain.Fusion is still considered prohibitively expensive, but China’s test should help researchers in their search for ways to bring those costs down.ITER is working on its own reactor in France, which is expected to be completed in 2025.\n",

      "CONTENT : EDITOR’S NOTE: An earlier version of this story by the Associated Press cited Chinese officials saying the two Michaels had been tried and indicted. A Canadian government official later said this was a translation error: the two Michaels have not been tried at this time. This story has been updated to reflect the new information.A Canadian government official says Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig, detained in China for two years, have not been tried despite earlier reports to that effect.Nothing has changed in the status of their case.This comes despite earlier reports that trials had taken place in the Chinese judicial system — a comment that was misinterpreted in a translation error, the official said.“Officials also confirmed that the confusion was caused by an inaccurate characterization of the process made by the Chinese MFA spokesperson,” read a statement from Global Affairs Canada.“The two men were indicted on June 19, but have yet not gone to trial.”At a daily briefing Thursday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying was erroneously quoted as saying the two had been “arrested, indicted and tried,” in what would have been the first public mention that they had been brought to court.Canadian officials explained that while the term “trial” has a very specific meaning in English, the term in Mandarin means “the whole process.” This discrepancy is what resulted in the mistranslation, they said.Hua was also quoted as saying that Spavor and Kovrig’s cases and were “different in nature,” with from that of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou. The spokesperson described Meng’s December 2018 arrest in Vancouver as being a “purely political incident.”Despite that, China has consistently linked the fate of the two Canadians to its demands that Meng be released immediately.\n",

      "\t\t\t\tKovrig, Spavor remain ‘robust’ after 2 years in Chinese prison: Canadian ambassador\t\t\t\n",
      "Conservative Leader Erin O’Toole spoke out about the issue during a Thursday press conference, calling on Canada to take a tougher stance on China.“A weak and timid approach has failed. It is time to work with our allies and show that we’re going to have a more serious approach with respect to Beijing,” O’Toole said.Kovrig and Spavor are marking two years in separate Chinese prisons, on what Canada and dozens of its Western allies say are trumped-up espionage charges in retaliation for the RCMP’s arrest of Wanzhou on a U.S. extradition warrant.Canada’s ambassador to China, Dominic Barton, one of the few outsiders to see them, said this week Kovrig and Spavor are anything but broken men, and that seeing how they’ve endured their captivity was inspiring.Kovrig is “marshalling every ounce of his willpower and strength” to cope with his difficult situation, his wife Vina Nadjibulla told The Canadian Press in an interview this week.“He says that knowing that Canadians care, knowing that the world cares, and people are fighting for his release, makes him feel stronger, and keeps hope alive,” she said, drawing on letters that he has written in captivity.“He hopes that he will be able to come out from this experience not only having survived it, but with a commitment, with resolve to rebuild his life better, to contribute even more to society.”The Canadian Press also reached out, through intermediaries, to request interviews with Spavor’s friends and family but was unsuccessful. Spavor worked as an entrepreneur in the Chinese city of Dandong, where he is imprisoned near the North Korean border.\n",

      "Kovrig was most recently an analyst with the International Crisis Group in Washington and before that he was a member of Canada’s diplomatic corps, a career focused on preventing deadly conflicts.“He hopes that he can continue to do that, and he can rejoin the broader conversation in the world with life and not just continue to be isolated and cut off in the way that he is,” said Nadjibulla.She said Kovrig is devouring books from the meditations of stoic philosopher Marcus Aurelius, to St. Paul’s Letter to the Romans, to Tolstoy’s “War and Peace,” to Nelson Mandela’s “Long Walk to Freedom.” He’s reread one of his pre-prison favourites, “Antifragile: Things That Gain From Disorder” by Nassim Nicholas Taleb, because it contains a key message for him.“It essentially posits that it’s important to cultivate an ability to not only survive traumas or disruptions but to become better and stronger as a result. So, this idea of building back better. I know it’s very much on the minds of many of us as we recover from the pandemic,” she said.Kovrig is also drawing on stoic philosophical teaching that, among other things, calls for the transformation of “fear into prudence, pain into information,” said Nadjibulla. Kovrig has added “anger into the termination of grievance” to that philosophy.He has been drawn to St. Paul’s Letter to the Romans, the sixth book of the New Testament, “which says suffering produces endurance, endurance produces character, character produces hope. And Michael is doing everything possible to keep hope alive,” said Nadjibulla.Kovrig is subjecting himself to a strict physical regimen, forever on the move in his small cell striving to walk the equivalent of five kilometres daily because he knows his mind cannot thrive if his body is not strong, said Nadjibulla.Robert Malley, Kovrig’s boss at the International Crisis Group, says his imprisoned colleague can hold the plank, a core body exercise of endurance, for 18 minutes. In solidarity, Crisis Group colleagues recently had a plank competition but the closest anyone got was seven minutes. They’re also walking 7,000 steps a day, the equivalent of five kilometres.\n",

      "Malley said he and his colleagues are in awe of Kovrig’s discipline.“None of us can be prepared for that, unless you’re in the military and you’re told this could happen. But he seems to have had all of the reflexes, instincts that are necessary,” said Malley.When Kovrig is released one day his colleagues hope stories of their attempts to replicate some of his exercises will help him heal and, perhaps, bridge the gap growing between them and him, said Malley.Kovrig only found out the scope of the global pandemic during Barton’s on-site virtual visit in October — his first contact with Canadian diplomats since January because Chinese authorities wouldn’t allow any contact due to COVID-19, said Nadjibulla.He was shocked at the pandemic’s scale and compared it to a zombie apocalypse and the movie “Contagion.”Kovrig is also aware that he is one of “two Michaels” and understands that both he and Spavor “are caught in this bigger situation,” she said. It’s not a topic that can be discussed during the now-resumed 30-minute consular visits.Nadjibulla said she was happy to hear that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau spoke to U.S. president-elect Joe Biden about the two Michaels in their recent conversation. Trudeau refused to discuss the content of that conversation last week, or whether Biden might revisit the Justice Department’s attempted extradition and prosecution of Meng.If the U.S. withdrew its charges, Meng could go free, and that might give China reason to free the two Michaels.“Our Michael and Michael Spavor are caught in a bigger geopolitical struggle,” Nadjibulla said. “They’re pawns in a bigger political game involving the U.S., China and Canada. And they have been in the situation for two long years, for no other reason than being Canadian citizens.”With files from The Canadian Press\n",

      "The security law, which punishes what Beijing broadly defines as secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces with up to life in jail, has been condemned by the West and human rights groups as a tool to crush dissent in the semi-autonomous, Chinese-ruled city.Authorities in Hong Kong and Beijing say it is vital to plug gaping holes in national security defenses exposed by months of sometimes violent anti-government and anti-China protests that rocked the global financial hub over the last year.“The goal is to hold Jimmy Lai, and shut Jimmy Lai up,” Mark Simon, an associate of Lai, told Reuters.Hong Kong police did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The publishing tycoon is one of the financial hub’s most prominent democracy activists, while his Next Media group is considered one of the key remaining bastions of media freedoms in Hong Kong.Tensions between China and the United States have escalated in recent weeks as Washington accuses Beijing of using the security law to trample wide-ranging freedoms guaranteed when the former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997.Authorities have intensified a crackdown on opposition forces in the city, dismissing lawmakers from the legislature, conducting widespread arrests and jailing high-profile democracy activists such as Joshua Wong.\n",

Hong Kong police later said they had arrested nine men and one woman for suspected offenses including “collusion with a foreign country/external elements to endanger national security, conspiracy to defraud” and others.The tycoon had been a frequent visitor to Washington, where he has met officials, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, to rally support for Hong Kong democracy, prompting Beijing to label him a “traitor.”(Reporting by Twinnie Siu and Greg Torode in Hong Kong; Writing by Anne Marie Roantree; Editing by Sam Holmes, Lincoln Feast and Michael Perry)\n",

      "CONTENT : China and 14 other countries agreed Sunday to set up the world’s largest trading bloc, encompassing nearly a third of all economic activity, in a deal many in Asia are hoping will help hasten a recovery from the shocks of the pandemic.The Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, or RCEP, was signed virtually on Sunday on the sidelines of the annual summit of the 10-nation Association of Southeast Asian Nations.“I am delighted to say that after eight years of hard work, as of today, we have officially brought RCEP negotiations to a conclusion for signing,” said host country Vietnam’s prime minister, Nguyen Xuan Phuc.\n",

      "“The conclusion of RCEP negotiation, the largest free trade agreement in the world, will send a strong message that affirms ASEAN’s leading role in supporting the multilateral trading system, creating a new trading structure in the region, enabling sustainable trade facilitation, revitalizing the supply chains disrupted by COVID-19 and assisting the post-pandemic recovery,” Phuc said.The accord will take already low tariffs on trade between member countries still lower, over time, and is less comprehensive than an 11-nation trans-Pacific trade deal that President Donald Trump pulled out of shortly after taking office.Apart from the 10 ASEAN members, it includes China, Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand, but not the United States. Officials said the accord leaves the door open for India, which dropped out due to fierce domestic opposition to its market-opening requirements, to rejoin the bloc.It will take time to fully assess exact details of the agreement encompassing tariff schedules and rules for all 15 countries involved _ the tariffs schedule just for Japan is 1,334 pages long.It is not expected to go as far as the European Union in integrating member economies but does build on existing free trade arrangements.The deal has powerful symbolic ramifications, showing that nearly four years after Trump launched his “America First” policy of forging trade deals with individual countries, Asia remains committed to multi-nation efforts toward freer trade that are seen as a formula for future prosperity.Ahead of Sunday’s RCEP “special summit” meeting, Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga said he would firmly convey his government’s support for “broadening a free and fair economic zone, including a possibility of India’s future return to the deal, and hope to gain support from the other countries.”The accord is also a coup for China, by far the biggest market in the region with more than 1.3 billion people, allowing Beijing to cast itself as a “champion of globalization and multilateral co-operation” and giving it greater influence over rules governing regional trade, Gareth Leather, senior Asian economist for Capital Economics, said in a report.\n",

      "\t\t\t\tMost Canadians think Trudeau should rely less on trade with China: Ipsos poll\t\t\t\n",
      "China’s official Xinhua News Agency quoted Premier Li Keqiang hailing the agreement as a victory against protectionism, in remarks delivered via a video link.“The signing of the RCEP is not only a landmark achievement of East Asian regional co-operation, but also a victory of multilateralism and free trade,” Li said.The agreement is expected to help China, Japan and South Korea finally reach a trilateral free trade deal after years of struggling to bridge their differences.Now that Trump’s opponent Joe Biden has been declared president-elect, the region is watching to see how U.S. policy on trade and other issues will evolve.Analysts are skeptical Biden will push hard to rejoin the trans-Pacific trade pact or to roll back many of the U.S. trade sanctions imposed on China by the Trump administration given widespread frustration with Beijing’s trade and human rights records, and accusations of spying and technology theft.Critics of free trade agreements say they tend to encourage companies to move manufacturing jobs overseas. So, having won over disaffected rust-belt voters in Michigan and western Pennsylvania in the Nov. 3 election, Biden is “not going to squander that by going back into TPP,” Michael Jonathan Green of the Center for Strategic and International Studies said in a web seminar.\n",

      "\t\t\t\tCUSMA just took effect. Here’s why Canada is facing new tariff threats from the U.S.\t\t\t\n",
      "But given concerns over China’s growing influence, Biden is likely to seek much more engagement with Southeast Asia to protect U.S. interests, he said.The fast-growing and increasingly affluent Southeast Asian market of 650 million people has been hit hard by the pandemic and is urgently seeking fresh drivers for growth.RCEP originally would have included about 3.6 billion people and encompassed about a third of world trade and global GDP. Minus India, it still covers more than 2 billion people and close to a third of all trade and business activity.The United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or CUSMA, the retooled version of the North American Free Trade Agreement under Trump, covers slightly less economic activity but less than a tenth of the world’s population. The EU and Comprehensive and Progressive Trans-Pacific Partnership, the revised version of the deal Trump rejected, also are smaller. RCEP includes six of the 11 remaining CPTPP members.India balked at exposing its farmers and factories to more foreign competition. Among other concerns, Indian dairy farmers are worried about competition from New Zealand and Australian milk and cheese producers. Automakers fear imports from across the region. But overall the biggest fear is over a flood of manufactured goods from China.Trade and investment flows within Asia have vastly expanded over the past decade, a trend that has accelerated amid feuding between the U.S. and China, which have imposed billions of dollars’ worth of punitive tariffs on each other’s exports.The RCEP agreement is loose enough to stretch to fit the disparate needs of member countries as diverse as Myanmar, Singapore, Vietnam and Australia. Unlike the CPTPP and EU, it does not establish unified standards on labour and the environment or commit countries to open services and other vulnerable areas of their economies.But it does set rules for trade that will facilitate investment and other business within the region, Jeffrey Wilson, research director at the Perth USAsia Center, said in a report for the Asia Society.“RCEP, therefore, is a much-needed platform for the Indo-Pacific’s post-COVID recovery,” he wrote.ASEAN members include Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Myanmar, the Philippines, Thailand, Brunei, Singapore, Malaysia and Vietnam.\n",

      "CONTENT : TAIPEI, Taiwan — Provincial governments across China are placing orders for experimental, domestically made coronavirus vaccines, though health officials have yet to say how well they work or how they may reach the country’s 1.4 billion people.Developers are speeding up final testing, the Chinese foreign minister said during a U.N. meeting last week, as Britain approved emergency use of Pfizer Inc.’s vaccine candidate and providers scrambled to set up distribution.Even without final approval, more than 1 million health care workers and others in China who are deemed at high risk of infection have received experimental vaccines under emergency use permission. Developers have yet to disclose how effective their vaccines are and possible side effects.\n",

      "China’s fledgling pharmaceutical industry has at least five vaccines from four producers being tested in more than a dozen countries including Russia, Egypt and Mexico. Health experts say even if they are successful, the certification process for the United States, Europe, Japan and other developed countries might be too complex for them to be used there. However, China said it will ensure the products are affordable for developing countries and has been actively pursuing deals across the world.On Sunday, 1.2 million doses of the Chinese company Sinovac’s vaccine arrived in Indonesia, the government said.“We are very grateful, thank God, the vaccine is now available so that we can immediately curb the spread of the COVID-19 disease,” President Joko Widodo said.Within China, so far only one developer, China National Pharmaceutical Group, known as Sinopharm, said in November it applied for final market approval for use of its vaccine. Others have been approved for emergency use on people deemed at high risk of infection.“We must be prepared for large-scale production,” Vice Premier Sun Chunlan said during a visit Wednesday to developers, according to the official Xinhua News Agency.Sun, who has as overseen much of the country’s response, visited one of Sinopharm’s Beijing subsidiary companies, Sinovac and a research lab under the National Medical Products Administration, a regulatory agency that approves medical products for public use.[ Sign up for our Health IQ newsletter for the latest coronavirus updates ]The government has yet to say how many people it plans to vaccinate. Sun said plans call for vaccinating border personnel and other high-risk populations this month.The companies are using more traditional techniques than Western developers.\n",

      "They say unlike Pfizer’s vaccine, which must be kept frozen at temperatures as low as minus 70 degrees Celsius (minus 94 Fahrenheit), theirs can be stored at 2 to 8 C (36 to 46 F). The Chinese producers have yet to say how they might be distributed.Health experts question why China is using experimental vaccines on such a vast scale now that the outbreak is largely under control within its borders.Health officials previously said China will be able to manufacture 610 million doses by the end of this year and ramp up to 1 billion doses next year.The government of Jiangsu province, where the major city of Nanjing is located, issued a procurement notice for vaccines from Sinovac and Sinopharm on Wednesday for emergency use.Authorities in Sichuan province in the west, which has about 85 million people, announced Monday they were already buying vaccines. An official newspaper in Anhui province, southeast of Beijing, said a local residential committee issued a notice asking whether residents want a vaccine.The Sichuan and Anhui announcements said the vaccine, given in two shots, would cost a total of 400 yuan ($60).Vaccines from Sinovac and Sinopharm were approved for emergency use in July.\n",

      "In October, Zhejiang province south of Shanghai offered the public vaccination under emergency use authorization. It said people considered high-risk would get priority.In November, the Communist Party secretary for Sinopharm said almost 1 million people had received its vaccine.In September, Sinovac’s CEO said about 3,000 of its employees had taken their vaccine. He said the company provided tens of thousands of doses to the Beijing city government.Sinopharm has clinical trials under way in 10 countries including the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Jordan, Peru and Argentina with nearly 60,000 volunteers. It has built two facilities in China capable of producing 200 million doses per year.Sinovac has trials in Brazil, Turkey and Indonesia. Its most recent publicized data, a study in the science journal the Lancet, showed its candidate produced lower levels of antibodies in people than those who had recovered from COVID-19. The company projects it will be able to produce a few hundred million doses of the vaccine by February or March of next year.Another producer, CanSino, is testing in Russia, Pakistan and Mexico and pursuing partnerships in Latin American countries. Its vaccine, which has been used on an emergency basis with the Chinese military, uses a harmless adenovirus to carry genes into human cells to generate an immune response.A fourth company, Anhui Zhifei Longcom Biologic Pharmacy Co., is conducting final stage trials across China.___Associated Press video producer Olivia Zhang contributed to this report.\n",

      "CONTENT : A report by Canada’s intelligence service accuses Russia, China and Iran of spreading COVID-19 disinformation to promote their strategic ambitions.The Canadian Security Intelligence Service named the trio of countries in a declassified report titled COVID-19: Global Effects and Canadian National Security Interests.It said Russia was “actively spreading disinformation blaming the West for the virus,” as part of a broader campaign to discredit the West, promote Russian influence and push for an end to Western sanctions.China, meanwhile, “is focused on a propaganda campaign that protects its own reputation and domestic legitimacy while touting its pandemic aid abroad,” said the assessment, marked Secret/Canadian Eyes Only.At the same time, China’s internal restrictions were not being widely reported, and the infection and mortality data released by Beijing was “unreliable,” CSIS wrote.For its part, the Iranian regime’s “increased disinformation campaign seeks to shift blame for domestic shortcomings in handling COVID-19 to foreign actors (especially U.S. sanctions).”\n",

      "COVID-19 misinformation has flourished since the start of the pandemic, fuelling what has been called an “infodemic” of conspiracy theories and falsehoods amid efforts to contain the coronavirus.Declassified documents obtained by Global News under the Access to Information Act show that CSIS has been monitoring the national security implications of the phenomenon.“Threat actors have used the pandemic as an opportunity to spread disinformation online,” CSIS spokesman John Townsend said Wednesday when asked about the documents.“It is important to note that disinformation, originating from anywhere in the world, can have serious consequences including threats to the safety and security of Canadians, erosion of trust in our democratic institutions, and confusion about government policies and notices including information on the COVID-19 pandemic,” he said.“State-sponsored disinformation campaigns are an example of foreign interference.”The Chinese embassy denied spreading COVID-19 disinformation, while the Russian embassy said it would comment after receiving a link to the CSIS statement. Iran has not had an embassy in Canada since the countries broke off diplomatic relations in 2012.Professor Stephanie Carvin said Moscow and Beijing engaged in COVID-19 disinformation for different purposes.“In the case of Russia, it’s just kind of the continuation of trying to sow discord within Western democracies, whether by amplifying conspiracy theories or by just trying to discredit certain initiatives that governments are doing,” she said.But China had different objectives, said Carvin, an associate professor of international relations at the Norman Paterson School of International Affairs.“I think they are predominantly concerned with their international reputation and their perceived failure to be transparent with regards to the pandemic in their own country. And they’ve been asserting that the pandemic may have actually started in other countries like Italy.“So what we’re really seeing is a variety of actors engaged in this for a number of purposes. And this is, of course, how they normally operate, anyways. It’s just I think because so much global attention is being paid to the pandemic, it’s not surprising that they would latch onto that.”\n",

      "The CSIS documents reveal the agency’s Intelligence Assessment Branch, as well as the Integrated Terrorism Assessment Centre, have been preparing regular internal briefings on COVID-19-related issues.The topics include the exploitation of the pandemic by extremist movements and 5G conspiracy theorists, and the promotion of pandemic disinformation by Canada’s authoritarian adversaries.Some of the records indicate they were prepared for senior officials in the Privy Council Office, Health Canada, the Public Health Agency of Canada and Canadian Heritage, as well as the Deputy Ministers Operations Committee.The documents were partly redacted on the grounds they contained information about the prevention of hostile activities. They cover the period between January and May 2020.“CSIS is clearly monitoring any updates regarding the pandemic,” said Ahmed al-Rawi, assistant professor at the Simon Fraser University School of Communication.He said the CSIS documents covered four main areas of interest to the intelligence service: Russia, China, Iran and extremist groups.“They seem to be concerned about the impact of conspiracy theories on Canadians,” said Al-Rawi, who also runs The Disinformation Project.Misinformation about COVID-19 has had an impact on behaviour, according to a study conducted by McGill University and University of Toronto researchers, and published in the Harvard Kennedy School Misinformation Review.The study found that misinformation about the virus was associated with less compliance with social distancing, and those most likely to hold misperceptions about the pandemic were more reliant on social media.But one of the authors of the report, Aengus Bridgman of McGill University, said there was little evidence that disinformation campaigns had any impact, and most misinformation was spread by people engaging politically on the internet.A CSIS report, classified Top Secret, cited the example of a Chinese foreign ministry official who promoted the COVID-19 falsehoods of a Montreal-based conspiracy theory website.Although the virus originated in China, the spokesperson for China’s foreign ministry, Zhao Lijian, posted an article on Twitter claiming it was created in a U.S. biological warfare lab.The online post alleged the pandemic was “a cover operation by the One World Order” to use vaccination to reduce the global population and create “a digital control system,” CSIS wrote.There is no credible evidence supporting the theory.The article tweeted by Zhao was from Global Research, which CSIS described as a “Canadian conspiracy publication” that publishes content that portrays Russia’s response to COVID-19 in a positive light while claiming Moscow is the victim of “Western conspiracies.”According to the CSIS report, the Global Research article tweeted by Zhao was “being exploited as part of a growing alternative narrative that seeks to create doubt that the COVID-19 pandemic originated in China.”The website did not respond to a request for comment.The pandemic has “deepened fissures between authoritarian states and Western liberal democracies,” according to another CSIS intelligence assessment, marked Top Secret.The pandemic “represents a threat to regime stability” for some states, the assessment said.“At the same time, adversarial states have used the pandemic as an opportunity to tout themselves as legitimate alternatives to liberal Western democracies, currently straining to deal with the crisis.“Global strategic competition increasingly is focusing on a race to find a solution and to recalibrate supply chains and other vital mechanisms guaranteeing social and economic stability.”Last week, the National Cyber Threat Assessment 2020 also singled out Russia, China and Iran, as well as North Korea, saying their state-sponsored cyber programs posed the greatest strategic threat to Canada.Stewart.Bell@globalnews.ca\n",

      "According to the Wall Street Journal’s sources, the deal would require Meng to admit to some of the allegations in the criminal case against her, which prosecutors would then drop if Meng co-operated.Negotiations between Meng’s lawyers and the Justice Department picked up after the U.S. presidential election, Reuters’ source said, adding it is still unclear what kind of deal can be struck.Meng does not think she did anything wrong and therefore is reluctant to make admissions that she does not think are true, that person said.The source said it does not appear to be part of a larger deal with Huawei.Meng is wanted in the United States on charges of bank fraud over allegations related to U.S. sanctions against Iran that both she and tech giant Huawei deny.She was arrested in December 2018 at Vancouver International Airport on a warrant from the United States, and has been under house arrest in Vancouver ever since as she and her lawyers fight extradition to the U.S.Meng’s lawyers have argued in B.C. Supreme Court that her arrest was unlawful and mishandled by the RCMP. They also allege political interference on the part of the U.S., citing comments by President Donald Trump who said Meng could be used as a bargaining chip in trade negotiations with China.\n",

Global News has also reached out to both the U.S. and Canadian justice departments for comment, but has not independently verified the reports.Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s office and foreign ministry had no immediate comment. Huawei has also not responded to requests for comment.Meng’s case has soured Canada’s relations with China, who detained Canadians Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor on allegations of espionage shortly after Meng’s arrest. The two men remain in Chinese detention to this day, with China suggesting they could be freed in exchange for Meng’s release.Deferred prosecution agreements are usually negotiated for corporations rather than individuals, allowing businesses to avoid criminal charges in exchange for significantly reduced penalties. Typically, companies still have to plead guilty to wrongdoing under such deals.In Canada, SNC-Lavalin ultimately struck a similar deal with federal prosecutors in 2019 that allowed the engineering giant to avoid criminal charges of corruption. The company still plead guilty to fraud and agreed to pay a fine of $280 million over five years, along with a three-year probation.Negotiations over a deferred prosecution agreement ultimately sparked the SNC-Lavalin affair that ensnared Trudeau’s government through early 2019.— With files from the Canadian Press and Reuters\n",

      "CONTENT : Top executives at CanSino Biologics — the Chinese company involved in a failed COVID-19 vaccine collaboration with Canada — were also part of a Chinese government program designed to incentivize people to transfer research and knowledge to China in exchange for salaries, funding and other benefits.Several former Canadian Security Intelligence Service officials interviewed by Global News said that CanSino’s Canadian-educated scientists were likely seen as potential assets by Chinese Communist Party information collection networks. And one of the Canadian security consultants, said the agency responsible for the CanSino collaboration— the National Research Council (NRC) — should have seen red flags surrounding a CanSino partnership.In August, the NRC announced its collaboration with CanSino had ended because Chinese officials had failed to send CanSino’s vaccine for testing in Canada.  Meanwhile, since June “many Chinese military” staff have received CanSino vaccine doses enabling them to soldier in “epidemic affected areas” without being infected, Chinese state media reported in November.\n",

      "The co-founders of CanSino — CEO Dr. Xuefeng Yu and executive director Dr. Tao Zhu — have been listed as members of China’s so-called Thousand Talents Plan, a Chinese Communist Party (CCP) recruiting strategy started in 2008 and now coming under increasing scrutiny from intelligence agencies in Canada, the United States and Australia.Yu, who was trained at McGill University, and Zhu left successful biopharma careers in Canada and founded CanSino in Tianjin China in 2009.Before returning to China the CanSino scientists were also members of a Chinese-Canadian research association that worked with Chinese government agencies to develop China’s science industry, the association’s records show. And after Yu and Zhu established CanSino’s lab with help from various levels of government in Mainland China, back in Toronto, Yu attended several forums with Chinese consular officials and recruiting officials, to promote China’s national recruiting plans, according to the Canada Chinese Biomedical and Pharmaceutical Association’s meeting records, which have been published online. CanSino’s Yu and Zhu didn’t respond to repeated questions from Global News about CanSino’s involvement in the Thousand Talents Plan and whether criticism of China’s talent recruitment plans by Western intelligence is unfair. The association’s website includes a January 2011 report that says Dr. Zhu is an association member, and he was selected to China’s “Thousand Talents” plan in December 2010.The 2011 report said CanSino had partially completed its research and development centre in Tianjin, after having “obtained financial support from the state, Tianjin City and other governments at all levels,” in China. More recently, company records say that in 2016 CanSino’s Tianjin lab started a Chinese-American talent recruiting program that is supported by an “Overseas Chinese Affairs” office that is part of China’s United Front Work Department.The Thousand Talents Plan is deeply intertwined with China’s broad espionage campaigns, Canadian experts said, and often in conjunction with the United Front Work Department, a sprawling foreign affairs agency that is central to Chinese interference and espionage networks, according to Western intelligence.\n",

      "In an interview Ward Elcock, former director of CSIS, said “the Chinese have long had a vacuum cleaner collection strategy, where everyone is collecting everything.”“There have been a lot of cases where Chinese academics have gathered intelligence in North America,” Elcock said. “The Chinese will make use of every opportunity. The Thousand Talents plan is one of those opportunities, and it’s clearly a vector of intelligence collection.”In the Thousand Talents plan, Western-based academics are sometimes approached to collaborate with Chinese institutions in deals that can have hidden contracts skewed in China’s favour, according to the consultants Global News interviewed for this report. For example, some professors have doubled their salaries by secretly taking pay from Chinese universities, the consultants said. In this way China has been able to cheaply obtain research and patents from the researchers it pays, even though their research is mostly funded by North American taxpayers.But Mandarin-speaking researchers born in China and well-established in the West are most coveted by the Thousand Talents Plan because they are perceived as potential assets for information collection in the West, former Canadian officials said.According to a November 2019 U.S. Senate report, China encourages these researchers to transmit their knowledge to China “in exchange for salaries, research funding, lab space and other incentives.” These prominent “Overseas Chinese” researchers are known as “sea turtles” because they return with knowledge to benefit the CCP, according to Michel Juneau Katsuya, a former CSIS Asia-Pacific desk agent.According to the U.S. Senate report and Western intelligence experts, the CCP uses all information gathered in its civilian talent recruiting to modernize its military.“The Chinese intelligence services have developed several concepts for repatriating information, and what better vehicle than to bring back someone that was educated abroad and understands the so-called ‘enemy’” Juneau Katsuya said. “This talent recruitment is systematically supported by the United Front Work Department, and other departments. But the United Front in particular, is responsible for trying to repatriate valuable Chinese people, like Dr. Yu.”Juneau Katsuya reviewed reports and photographs collected by Global News that detailed multiple forums attended by Yu involving Chinese recruiting and consular officials in Toronto. He said that these types of meetings provide the backdrops where Chinese officials can form personal relationships with talented researchers.\n",

      "According to meeting records posted on Canada Chinese Biomedical and Pharmaceutical Association’s website, in one February 2011 meeting, Yu gave a speech titled “Experience of Overseas Chinese Returning to China to Start a Business.” The website includes a slide of Yu’s presentation, titled “Lessons Learned.” According to the slide, one of Yu’s lessons was: “Better negotiate deal with government before you go.”Another was: “If use intangible asset as investment, better define it at the time of initial establishment.”Yu’s slide presentation — which hasn’t previously been reported on — appears to shed light on connections between China’s talent recruiting networks in Toronto and negotiations surrounding the funding Yu secured with China’s government, in CanSino’s business startup. But Yu’s slide presentation also shows he advised Chinese-Canadian researchers that doing scientific business with China’s government can involve “culture shock.” According to Juneau Katsuya, in China’s system, the cohort of Chinese researchers including Dr. Yu that attended such meetings in Toronto, would certainly be encouraged to bring their expertise back to Mainland China, for patriotic reasons. Yu, who is listed as director of the Toronto-based non-profit association, didn’t respond to requests for details on his funding from China. Corporate records say the association is active and was registered in 2003. And other association directors contacted by email for this story, also did not respond.While Yu didn’t respond to Global News, a May 2017 profile in Sixth Tone — an Asian news magazine — calls him a “shining example” of the “native Chinese who forged careers abroad and have now been lured home to develop the Chinese industry.”The profile says Yu “was selected for … the Thousand Talents Program, which offers generous packages to scientists who move to China.”“I felt like it was an obligation,” Yu was quoted, in the profile.Abandoned dealThe NRC entered a March 2020 deal with the endorsement of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, sharing Canada’s proprietary cell-line for vaccine-development with China. And in return, Canada was to test CanSino’s resulting vaccine and mass produce it in NRC labs. But in August, the NRC announced that “due to delays in Chinese customs releasing the vaccine candidate, the agreement was not acted upon.”The failed deal means that Canadian citizens lost a chance to be first-in-line to receive a vaccine produced in Canada.There is no explanation from Canada about why Chinese authorities blocked CanSino’s shipment to Canada. In a previous interview Scott Halperin, director of the Canadian Center for Vaccinology — the facility in Dalhousie University that was supposed to test CanSino’s vaccine — insisted that CanSino was an excellent collaborator. Halperin said the Canadian researchers involved can only assume that China’s government interfered in the partnership for geopolitical reasons. \n",

      "Halperin said the federal government has contacted his research centre to discuss security threats related to foreign actors and COVID-19 research. But these contacts never included warnings about China attempting to subvert Canadian researchers in order to benefit China’s military, he said.“I have not had any discussions in particular related to the issue you quote about China recruiting and subverting Canadian investigators,” Halperin said. “My interactions with CanSino involved the opposite direction; getting access to Chinese technology since they were providing the vaccine (which we never received).”According to a Globe and Mail report, Yu blamed indecision on the part of Chinese bureaucrats for CanSino’s failure to ship vaccine material to Canada. “We currently do not have any further information  to share at this time,” a CanSino spokeswoman said, when asked by Global News “why will China not ship the vaccine to Canada, which under the terms of the deal (between CanSino and NRC), was supposed to receive the vaccine in order to do tests in Canada?”Some experts have said CanSino’s vaccine has fallen behind the leading candidates in clinical tests, including Pfizer and Moderna, because CanSino’s vaccine is based on a modified cold virus, which makes it less effective for more elderly segments of populations. However, Yu was cited in a Chinese state-media report in November, saying that CanSino’s vaccine has proven effective in protecting Chinese military personnel operating in areas impacted by the coronavirus pandemic.In an interview Elcock said he “found it interesting” that the CanSino deal collapsed. But there is not enough information, he said, to know what went wrong behind the scenes. And Elcock said the fact that CanSino is involved in the Thousand Talents Plan doesn’t necessarily mean NRC was unwise to partner with CanSino.But Juneau Katsuya said the NRC has been burned a number of times in collaborations with China and has lost intellectual property in major espionage and hacking cases, and still hasn’t learned its lesson.In one example, in 2014, the NRC was targeted in a Chinese cyberattack estimated to have cost Canada hundreds of millions and the loss of vast amounts of data, including personal information about NRC staff. Canada has yet to disclose more details about the nature of information lost to China in the case.And in another case, as Global News has previously revealed, a McGill University academic named Ishiang Shih collaborated with NRC, Canada’s space agency, and the Canadian army, in various research projects. Shih and a number of alleged conspirators are accused in the United States of secretly sending sensitive technologies to China to modernize its military units. Shih denies the allegations.\n",

      "Juneau Katsuya said he believes the NRC is ignoring security warnings and that Ottawa lacks a coordinated plan to counteract risks in partnerships with China. In recent parliamentary committee hearings on Canada’s dealings with China, elected officials have made similar criticisms, and called for ‘all of government’ national security vetting for potential contracts involving Chinese companies. “The right hand doesn’t know what the left hand is doing, and NRC has been abused by China before in this way, and that is why this case is so offensive,” Juneau Katsuya said. “In this case it looks like what China did, is they got what they needed (from Canada) and they stopped the vaccine shipment. This neutralizes the ability for Canada to participate in developing the vaccine.”Juneau Katsuya says he believes China’s other objective was to leverage Canada in the Meng Wanzhou extradition case.“Blocking the vaccine shipment also sends the (geopolitical) message: ‘Look, if you really want to work with us, you need to toe the line.’ I have seen it before, and it shows how dependent we are on China.”The NRC, CSIS, and Public Safety Canada would not answer whether the NRC has ever received cautions about NRC’s vaccine collaborations with CanSino and China’s military. The NRC first collaborated with CanSino in 2014, providing a cell-line used by Dr. Yu and CanSino and the People’s Liberation Army, to produce an Ebola vaccine. In a statement to Global News CSIS spokesman John Townsend would not confirm whether CSIS looked into the involvement of CanSino executives in Chinese-state sponsored talent recruiting programs and meetings in Toronto.However, Townsend confirmed generally, that CSIS has informed Canadian institutions involved in COVID-19 vaccine research, that the Thousand Talents Plan is one of the programs used by China “to acquire sensitive Canadian technologies and expertise by utilizing a range of traditional and non-traditional intelligence collection methods.”“While the Thousand Talents Plan is one example, academic talent plans are used by multiple hostile states,” Townsend said. After this story was published Wednesday, in a Parliamentary debate, Conservative leader Erin O’Toole cited Global News’ investigation of CanSino’s involvement in the Thousand Talents Plan.“How delayed is our vaccine response going to be, because this Prime Minister preferred to partner with China, ahead of anyone else?” O’Toole asked.“The answer is not at all,” Prime Minister Justin Trudeau responded. “Because we set out to make sure we were knocking on every single door, regardless of which researchers, or which companies found the vaccine first.”Also following on findings from this story, Conservative MP Garnett Genuis gave notice of a motion to examine the CanSino-NRC deal, in the Canada-China committee’s upcoming study on national security.Genuis’ motion asks the committee to question representatives of CanSino, CSIS director David Vigneault, and NRC’s president Iain Stewart, in mid-December.Huge vacuuming sound Margaret McCuaig-Johnston says that in her former role as an assistant deputy minister, she supported Canada’s research collaborations with China.  But since 2012, when Xi Jinping came to power, collaborations involving China’s Thousand Talents Plan have become increasingly dangerous, she says, because Xi has promoted the fusion of civilian and military research, and China has become increasingly “desperate” to obtain cutting-edge technology for the People’s Liberation Army.“You can almost hear the huge vacuuming sound whisking away North American technologies to Chinese labs, under Xi Jinping,” she said.And McCuaig-Johnston says the Thousand Talents Plan draws on funds from Beijing’s United Front Work Department, in order to offer lucrative pay and research-funding packages to Mandarin-speaking candidates working in Western labs and universities. “They play on the scientists’ obligations to help the Chinese homeland, and this is a big part of China’s keeping tabs on scholars that have gone abroad, through professional research associations,” she said. “It is all part of the United Front Work Department approach.”Canadian-based researchers and experts are also approached with lucrative packages that can be funded by the United Front, McCuaig-Johnston said. “I had a discussion with one Canadian professor in Artificial Intelligence, who was approached in the Thousand Talents Plan, with the offer that he would get a full salary at (a Chinese collaborator university) on top of his Canadian university salary,” she said.Critics in Australia and the U.S., including FBI director Christopher Wray, have pointed to similar concerns.\n",

      "And in August, Australian analyst Alex Joske published a report on the Thousand Talents Plan showing that Canada is one of the top nations targeted by China’s talent recruiting programs with links to the United Front. The report says Canada has 47 Chinese talent recruiting stations, the U.K. and Australia each have 49, Germany has 57 and the U.S. has 146. These stations are often run by United Front groups already established in Chinese-community groups in Western cities, the report said.In a Canadian case study, Joske’s report found that the Fujian Provincial Overseas Chinese Affairs Office sent representatives worldwide in July 2016 to establish China’s talent recruitment stations. And the Fujian office, which is part of China’s United Front according to Joske, set up four stations in Canada. Canada’s former ambassador to China, John McCallum, was pictured at the opening of one of the stations in Toronto. The Toronto community leader that opened that station and was pictured with McCallum, “is a member of several organisations run by the United Front Work Department in China and has been accused of running a lobbying group for the Chinese Consulate in Toronto,” Joske’s report says.McCallum, who is based in Hong Kong now, hasn’t responded to repeated requests for comment for this story. In a parliamentary hearing in late November regarding Canada’s troubled relations with China, McCallum said he regretted meeting with Chinese officials ahead of the fall 2019 federal election, and warning them a Conservative government would be less-friendly to Beijing than a Liberal government.\n",

      "CONTENT : The folly of Canada’s soft approach to dealing with China was exposed Friday when Beijing declared that Canadians Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor are to be tried on separate charges of espionage.It is a certainty that China will find the Two Michaels guilty, dooming the innocent men to years in jail unless and until a prison swap or deal of some kind can be arranged, most likely a few years after they are convicted.READ MORE: Canadians Michael Kovrig, Michael Spavor formally charged by China for alleged espionageThere has been some sympathy for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s position. The line of thinking has it that Canada has been caught in a steel trap between the U.S. and China that was not of its making. The trap was sprung the moment that the RCMP detained Huawei heiress Meng Wanzhou in Vancouver for potential extradition to the U.S. to face serious fraud charges.It is easy to understand that explanation because it is true. Canada is an innocent victim of a growing trade and security dispute between China’s Xi Jinping and the U.S.’s Donald Trump.But there is, however, another entirely different way to look at this. It is that China regards Canada as a pushover since Canada never pushes back.Like any great power, China can smell weakness. It likely sensed Canada’s vulnerability the moment Trudeau made his absurd declaration a few years back that he admired China’s “basic dictatorship.” To this day, the prime minister has not walked that bizarre statement back or explained his naivete in saying it.With the Two Michaels facing a dire future, perhaps Trudeau may now finally be pressed to explain what he meant by that remark or his widely circulated and now totally discredited idea that China improve its image by tightening ties with Canada.Another hard question for the prime minister is whether his admiration for the efficiency of China’s dictatorship extends to its rubber-stamp courts, which will surely find the Two Michaels guilty.The fate of the Two Michaels, who now face the untender mercies of China’s rigged, state-controlled justice system, is one of many recent examples of Beijing ignoring international conventions with no apparent concerns for its own reputation. In so doing, the communist dictatorship has quickly been transitioning from a rogue state into a pariah.A scorecard is required to keep track of all China’s tantrums and every country it has seriously offended lately. This week’s two other major outrages concern India and Australia.A bloody brawl over disputed territory at the “top of the world” involved hand-to-hand combat and left at least 20 Indians dead. Delhi is in a furious, unforgiving mood with some of its people out in the streets destroying Chinese-made television sets.Days after China threatened to ban all its students and tourists from going to Australia, Canberra said Friday that all branches of the Australian government had been simultaneously hit by cyberattacks by what it described as another “state-based actor.” Undoubtedly, that was code for China. Last year, Australia claimed China was responsible for a hacking attack on Australia’s Parliament.READ MORE: Australia says ‘state-based actor’ behind recent cyberattacks but won’t identify countryRecently, China has literally taken a run at Vietnamese and Filipino maritime interests in the South China Sea. It has also been aggressively probing Japanese resolve around its islands in the East China Sea and quarrelling with France, Germany, Britain and several Scandinavian countries.None of this has anything to do with the Two Michaels, but these disparate outrages must all be linked together if there is to be any hope of altering China’s behaviour. For starters, Ottawa must acknowledge that it owns the current policy of mostly polite silence, which has produced zero results, and that it must stop singing Kumbaya.The only way forward for Canada is to make common cause with the U.S., Japan, Australia and much of Europe on issues such as Hong Kong, the treatment of Muslim Uighurs, a ban on Huawei’s 5G technologies, and limiting Chinese territorial grabs in the western Pacific and the Himalayas. If Canada really wants to “be back” and gain international respect, it must lead in the formation of a coherent unified policy to confront China about its totally unacceptable behaviour.That won’t help the Two Michaels, but if the Canadian government finally stands up for democracy and human rights, it cannot harm the men any more than they are being harmed now.Matthew Fisher is an international affairs columnist and foreign correspondent who has worked abroad for 35 years.

      "CONTENT : Canada is an “attractive and permissive target” for Chinese interference that endangers the “foundations of our fundamental institutions, including our system of democracy itself,” according to a recent national security review.The reason, experts suggest, is because China’s Communist Party has won the support of some influential Canadians by using economic carrots and sticks, while public attention on Beijing’s broad campaign is “almost non-existent.”The national security review says “for years Canadian Security Intelligence Service has investigated and reported on the threat” of foreign interference. But unlike Canada’s Western intelligence allies, Ottawa hasn’t responded with strong countermeasures.In an interview, Global News pressed Liberal MP David McGuinty, chair of the national security and intelligence committee, to explain why Canada is “permissive” of China’s methods.McGuinty said he could only answer by citing the report findings because of its sensitivity. He chose to read this quote: “The People’s Republic of China utilizes its growing economic wealth to mobilize interference operations: ‘with deep coffers and the help of western enablers, the Chinese Communist Party uses money, rather than Communist ideology, as a powerful source of influence, creating parasitic relationships of long-term dependence.’”The committee’s report named two countries — Russia and China — among those conducting “sophisticated and pervasive foreign interference activities against Canada.”But intelligence officials and former diplomats, including Canada’s former ambassador to China, believe China is the greater threat, in large part because the country has been successful in “elite capture.”“China is the No. 1 threat to Canada and has been for some time,” David Mulroney, former ambassador to China, said in an interview. China has used its economic leverage to secure “the voices” of political and business leaders in Canada with “sweetheart business deals” and “various inducements,” including lucrative board positions or honours in China, he said. \n",

      "\t\t\t\tUnited Front groups in Canada helped Beijing stockpile coronavirus safety supplies\t\t\t\n",
      "And as a result, Mulroney said he often hears people reciting Beijing’s line on issues such as the extradition case of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou or are silent in the face of China’s mass detention of Uyghurs and incursions on democracy in Hong Kong.“There are people a lot more senior than I was in government, and they have some serious business links with China,” Mulroney said. “China is very willing to weaponize trade and investment to compel people to say what they want them to say.”The argument that Mulroney and experts interviewed by Global News make is not that all Canadian politicians and businesses that have traded with China have been influenced. Rather, they say, Beijing has targeted elites and deftly attempted to interweave the CCP’s interests with Canada’s economic interests, seeking to bend major decisions away from Canada’s democratic values.And they say Canadians should see Hong Kong as a case study.But recent events in the United States, Australia and Canada suggest that pushing back on China’s interference could have consequences. In 2019, China called for the firing of an NBA executive who tweeted support for Hong Kong, using the NBA’s business in China as leverage.And Australia has faced trade sanction threats and was targeted in sophisticated state-based cyberattacks, its government said in June. Australia recently pressed for an international probe of Beijing’s actions in the coronavirus pandemic and Australia’s intelligence experts say China is likely behind the attacks. China denies the accusation. And on Monday, Beijing warned Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to “stop making irresponsible remarks,” according to The Associated Press, after Trudeau told reporters Beijing’s decision to charge Canadians Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor with spying was related to the Meng case. But despite warning signs of China’s incursions, Canadian academics, think tanks and media have been way behind the international curve in scrutinizing China’s “clandestine” tactics, Mulroney said.“Canada is kind of a sleepy and unaware target,” he said. “We don’t have the same kind of vigilance that you now see in places like Australia and New Zealand. That had better change.”China uses a vast network of political, business and media operatives directed from Beijing, known as the United Front, in attempts to co-opt Chinese-Canadian communities and leaders, Mulroney and the experts interviewed by Global News said.In June, Alex Joske, an analyst with the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, released a report aimed at helping international journalists identify and demystify United Front networks. In it, Joske defines the United Front as “the system at the heart of the Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP) efforts to influence foreign politicians, meddle in ethnic Chinese communities and transfer technologies from abroad … it is an exportation of the CCP’s political system (which) undermines social cohesion, exacerbates racial tension, influences politics, harms media integrity, facilitates espionage.”He believes the United Front could be just as active in Canada as it is in Australia, where an alleged United Front leader, billionaire and casino high-roller became a major funder of Australian political parties. An Australian senator also allegedly accepted funds from Chinese agents and touted China’s South China Sea policy against Australia’s position after the billionaire threatened to withdraw a $400,000 political donation. \n",

      "\t\t\t\tChinese-Canadians ‘suffering in silence’ as China’s United Front reaches into Canada\t\t\t\n",
      "Joske said in order to understand the United Front, people should look at China’s patient campaign to control Hong Kong, where China has used front groups to co-opt political leaders, tycoons and institutions since the 1990s.“Hong Kong is a long way down the track,” Joske said. “But by looking at Hong Kong, you understand how the United Front works.”Joske’s report also underlined the United Front’s mobilization during the COVID-19 pandemic — in Australia, Canada, the U.S. and U.K., Japan, Argentina and the Czech Republic — “to gather increasingly scarce medical supplies from around the world and send them to China.”And based on China’s success using United Front networks during the coronavirus pandemic, Beijing can be expected to ramp up the intensity of its United Front interference worldwide as tensions between China and the world rise in the post-COVID-19 landscape, Joske said. “The CCP’s attempts to interfere in diaspora communities, influence political systems and covertly access valuable and sensitive technology will only grow.”Joske’s report says United Front pioneers such as Premier Zhou Enlai, a CCP revolutionary, said the United Front should use “the legal to mask the illegal,” and the CCP should be “nestling intelligence within the United Front.” And Chinese President Xi Jinping has elevated the United Front’s prominence in Beijing’s global plans.“The United Front … is an important magic weapon for strengthening the party’s ruling position … and an important magic weapon for realizing the China Dream of the Great Rejuvenation of the Chinese Nation,” Xi said in a 2015 speech.But China does not acknowledge the United Front facilitates espionage.Experts describe Beijing as holding out carrots and sticks. And unfortunately, it is Chinese diaspora communities that often face the sticks. According to the Canadian Security Intelligence Service, China uses “a range of tactics including threats, harassment, detention of family members abroad and refusal to issue travel documents or visas.”Chinese-Canadian community leader Gloria Fung, director of democracy advocacy group Canada-Hong Kong Link, says she has seen China’s influence efforts in Canada become increasingly aggressive with both the carrot and the stick.In the 1990s, United Front networks just made passive political donations to all Canadian political parties, Fung said. Now they are aggressively lobbying for Beijing’s policies, covertly offering political funding from Beijing and attempting to promote covert CCP party members for election, Fung claimed.And Fung said she believes China has successfully influenced “many elected officials.”\n",

      "“They could be bribing, offering money or material benefits to targets in the decision-making process,” Fung said. “Many elected officials are offered free tours to China. And many, when they returned, seem to have changed their positions towards China.”Tensions reached a new level in August 2019, Fung said, when Hong Kong Canadians were targeted in anti-democracy counter-protests in a number of Canadian cities. Fung pointed to a Hong Kong democracy counter-rally at Toronto’s Old City Hall on Aug. 17, where she says her group was surrounded by students and middle-aged leaders, who Fung associated with Toronto United Front groups. A similar conflict occurred in Vancouver on Aug. 18 when a pro-China crowd surrounded a church where Hong Kong Canadians were praying. By comparing photos and video of the event with pictures of meetings involving Chinese consulate officials, Global News sources identified several senior members in the crowd as directors of a pro-CCP association, which Chen Yonglin, a defected Chinese diplomat, alleges is a “controlling level” United Front group in Canada.The pro-CCP association is part of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Office, a United Front group that Beijing uses to influence the Chinese diaspora, according to a 2018 report from the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission. “United Front work is Beijing’s strategy to influence overseas Chinese communities, foreign governments and other actors … mainly through economic or financial inducement,” the commission’s chair Robin Cleveland and vice-chair Carolyn Bartholomew told Global News in a statement. “The CCP considers ethnic Chinese everywhere to ultimately be Chinese subjects, regardless of their citizenship, and seeks to treat them as resources to assist in ‘the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation’ whether they like it or not.”\n",

      "A Chinese-Canadian academic ⁠— who is studying Beijing’s influence networks ⁠— agreed with Fung’s assessment of China’s efforts to control community groups.The academic asked to remain anonymous because of fears that officials in Chinese consulates could interfere with their ongoing research.“Many in the Chinese-Canadian diaspora do not want to have anything to do with the Chinese government. But unfortunately, immigrants from China and Hong Kong are not completely free from the government’s control and surveillance,” the academic said.Most experts interviewed by Global News said Australia’s legislative reforms should be a model for other countries combating China’s interference campaigns.In an interview, McGuinty, the intelligence committee chair, said the report underlined how Australia has taken concrete measures since 2018, including adding new offences to its Criminal Code.The report says the new offences “provide a high degree of specificity on offences and threat activities, including on whether the activity was in the planning stages, intentional, reckless or funded by a foreign intelligence service.”The penalties range from 10 to 20 years’ imprisonment. And “the legislation creates a new transparency scheme that prescribes the registration of persons acting as agents of foreign principals and requires regular public disclosures.”In an interview, Mulroney said: “We need to invest in national security and insist on greater transparency.”He said currently, Canadians have no real idea whether influential politicians and businesspersons are acting for China or Canada. And it is extremely difficult to hold Canadian citizens that may be acting against Canadian interests to account under current laws.“What Australia have done is give transparency requirements some legal teeth,” Mulroney said. “And they use their intelligence apparatus to make the case against people that are not transparent. And I think we need to consider these things so Canadians become far more aware of who is speaking for whom.”Gloria Fung agreed.“Legislative tools on corruption and fishy transactions need to be closely monitored and put under Parliament’s radar,” Fung said. “Australia has all kinds of legislative tools to handle political collusion.”McGuinty was asked by Global News to explain the evident gap between Canadian intelligence’s strong warnings of China’s interference and the federal government’s response.McGuinty reiterated that the committee recommendations are bipartisan and straightforward, and the committee purposefully chose Australia as an exemplar to be considered by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government.“We believe the government needs to up its game when it comes to foreign interference,” he said. “There is lots of room for improvement.”But University of B.C. China expert Prof. Paul Evans, who has argued for closer ties with China and published research indicating Canadians are losing confidence “about the role of the United States” in global affairs, told Global News “the discourse of ‘capture’ is especially dangerous.”Evans draws a distinction between influence and “interference activities” and says “it is very difficult to estimate how many such incidents happen in Canada each year.”“My sense is that they are comparatively rare,” Evans wrote in an email response. “It is unproductive to talk about undermining ‘institutions’ without specifying which ones are being discussed.”Evans said it is “dangerous” to rely on Australia’s data and examples of foreign interference, and assume the same kinds and scale of interference activity is occurring in Canada.“We have reached a dangerous phase of our debates about China policy where advocates of engagement, past and present, are being attacked not just for the content of their views and actions but also for their integrity and even loyalty,” Evans wrote. “This is vile terrain and reminiscent of the worst of the McCarthy era and anti-communist actions in the United States in the 1950s.”\n",

      "CONTENT : China has successfully activated its so-called “artificial sun,” a nuclear fusion reactor that could fuel its energy ambitions for years to come — if they can make it more sustainable.China’s Atomic Energy Authority fired up its HL-2M Tokamak reactor for the first time on Friday, state-controlled media report. The brief test is being hailed as an important scientific achievement amid a global effort to develop safer, cleaner forms of nuclear energy.“The development of nuclear fusion energy is not only a way to solve China’s strategic energy needs, but also has great significance for the future sustainable development of China’s energy and national economy,” the state-run People’s Daily said.\n",

      "The reactor generates power by applying powerful magnetic fields to a contained loop of hot plasma, which can reach temperatures of more than 150 million C. That’s up to 10 times hotter than the core of the sun, but magnets and supercooling technology keep it contained.The device sounds like something a supervillain might use for world domination, but China has been working alongside the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) project, a coalition of dozens of nuclear-powered nations. Their aim is to develop a reliable form of nuclear fusion based on the same concept.\n",

      "Fusion is a coveted and elusive form of nuclear technology that scientists have been trying to perfect for decades. Fusion generates power by fusing the nuclei of atoms together, without generating large amounts of nuclear waste. That’s the opposite of fission, the atom-splitting process currently employed by nuclear weapons and power plants. Fission is easier but it generates nuclear waste, whereas fusion is hard to achieve but cleaner to maintain.Fusion is still considered prohibitively expensive, but China’s test should help researchers in their search for ways to bring those costs down.ITER is working on its own reactor in France, which is expected to be completed in 2025.\n",

      "CONTENT : EDITOR’S NOTE: An earlier version of this story by the Associated Press cited Chinese officials saying the two Michaels had been tried and indicted. A Canadian government official later said this was a translation error: the two Michaels have not been tried at this time. This story has been updated to reflect the new information.A Canadian government official says Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig, detained in China for two years, have not been tried despite earlier reports to that effect.Nothing has changed in the status of their case.This comes despite earlier reports that trials had taken place in the Chinese judicial system — a comment that was misinterpreted in a translation error, the official said.“Officials also confirmed that the confusion was caused by an inaccurate characterization of the process made by the Chinese MFA spokesperson,” read a statement from Global Affairs Canada.“The two men were indicted on June 19, but have yet not gone to trial.”At a daily briefing Thursday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying was erroneously quoted as saying the two had been “arrested, indicted and tried,” in what would have been the first public mention that they had been brought to court.Canadian officials explained that while the term “trial” has a very specific meaning in English, the term in Mandarin means “the whole process.” This discrepancy is what resulted in the mistranslation, they said.Hua was also quoted as saying that Spavor and Kovrig’s cases and were “different in nature,” with from that of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou. The spokesperson described Meng’s December 2018 arrest in Vancouver as being a “purely political incident.”Despite that, China has consistently linked the fate of the two Canadians to its demands that Meng be released immediately.\n",

      "Conservative Leader Erin O’Toole spoke out about the issue during a Thursday press conference, calling on Canada to take a tougher stance on China.“A weak and timid approach has failed. It is time to work with our allies and show that we’re going to have a more serious approach with respect to Beijing,” O’Toole said.Kovrig and Spavor are marking two years in separate Chinese prisons, on what Canada and dozens of its Western allies say are trumped-up espionage charges in retaliation for the RCMP’s arrest of Wanzhou on a U.S. extradition warrant.Canada’s ambassador to China, Dominic Barton, one of the few outsiders to see them, said this week Kovrig and Spavor are anything but broken men, and that seeing how they’ve endured their captivity was inspiring.Kovrig is “marshalling every ounce of his willpower and strength” to cope with his difficult situation, his wife Vina Nadjibulla told The Canadian Press in an interview this week.“He says that knowing that Canadians care, knowing that the world cares, and people are fighting for his release, makes him feel stronger, and keeps hope alive,” she said, drawing on letters that he has written in captivity.“He hopes that he will be able to come out from this experience not only having survived it, but with a commitment, with resolve to rebuild his life better, to contribute even more to society.”The Canadian Press also reached out, through intermediaries, to request interviews with Spavor’s friends and family but was unsuccessful.

      "Kovrig was most recently an analyst with the International Crisis Group in Washington and before that he was a member of Canada’s diplomatic corps, a career focused on preventing deadly conflicts.“He hopes that he can continue to do that, and he can rejoin the broader conversation in the world with life and not just continue to be isolated and cut off in the way that he is,” said Nadjibulla.She said Kovrig is devouring books from the meditations of stoic philosopher Marcus Aurelius, to St. Paul’s Letter to the Romans, to Tolstoy’s “War and Peace,” to Nelson Mandela’s “Long Walk to Freedom.” He’s reread one of his pre-prison favourites, “Antifragile: Things That Gain From Disorder” by Nassim Nicholas Taleb, because it contains a key message for him.“It essentially posits that it’s important to cultivate an ability to not only survive traumas or disruptions but to become better and stronger as a result. So, this idea of building back better. I know it’s very much on the minds of many of us as we recover from the pandemic,” she said.Kovrig is also drawing on stoic philosophical teaching that, among other things, calls for the transformation of “fear into prudence, pain into information,” said Nadjibulla. Kovrig has added “anger into the termination of grievance” to that philosophy.He has been drawn to St. Paul’s Letter to the Romans, the sixth book of the New Testament, “which says suffering produces endurance, endurance produces character, character produces hope. And Michael is doing everything possible to keep hope alive,” said Nadjibulla.Kovrig is subjecting himself to a strict physical regimen, forever on the move in his small cell striving to walk the equivalent of five kilometres daily because he knows his mind cannot thrive if his body is not strong, said Nadjibulla.Robert Malley, Kovrig’s boss at the International Crisis Group, says his imprisoned colleague can hold the plank, a core body exercise of endurance, for 18 minutes. In solidarity, Crisis Group colleagues recently had a plank competition but the closest anyone got was seven minutes. They’re also walking 7,000 steps a day, the equivalent of five kilometres.\n",

      "Malley said he and his colleagues are in awe of Kovrig’s discipline.“None of us can be prepared for that, unless you’re in the military and you’re told this could happen. But he seems to have had all of the reflexes, instincts that are necessary,” said Malley.When Kovrig is released one day his colleagues hope stories of their attempts to replicate some of his exercises will help him heal and, perhaps, bridge the gap growing between them and him, said Malley.Kovrig only found out the scope of the global pandemic during Barton’s on-site virtual visit in October — his first contact with Canadian diplomats since January because Chinese authorities wouldn’t allow any contact due to COVID-19, said Nadjibulla.He was shocked at the pandemic’s scale and compared it to a zombie apocalypse and the movie “Contagion.”Kovrig is also aware that he is one of “two Michaels” and understands that both he and Spavor “are caught in this bigger situation,” she said. It’s not a topic that can be discussed during the now-resumed 30-minute consular visits.Nadjibulla said she was happy to hear that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau spoke to U.S. president-elect Joe Biden about the two Michaels in their recent conversation. Trudeau refused to discuss the content of that conversation last week, or whether Biden might revisit the Justice Department’s attempted extradition and prosecution of Meng.If the U.S. withdrew its charges, Meng could go free, and that might give China reason to free the two Michaels.“Our Michael and Michael Spavor are caught in a bigger geopolitical struggle,” Nadjibulla said. “They’re pawns in a bigger political game involving the U.S., China and Canada. And they have been in the situation for two long years, for no other reason than being Canadian citizens.”With files from The Canadian Press\n",

      "CONTENT : A report by Canada’s intelligence service accuses Russia, China and Iran of spreading COVID-19 disinformation to promote their strategic ambitions.The Canadian Security Intelligence Service named the trio of countries in a declassified report titled COVID-19: Global Effects and Canadian National Security Interests.It said Russia was “actively spreading disinformation blaming the West for the virus,” as part of a broader campaign to discredit the West, promote Russian influence and push for an end to Western sanctions.China, meanwhile, “is focused on a propaganda campaign that protects its own reputation and domestic legitimacy while touting its pandemic aid abroad,” said the assessment, marked Secret/Canadian Eyes Only.At the same time, China’s internal restrictions were not being widely reported, and the infection and mortality data released by Beijing was “unreliable,” CSIS wrote.For its part, the Iranian regime’s “increased disinformation campaign seeks to shift blame for domestic shortcomings in handling COVID-19 to foreign actors (especially U.S. sanctions).”\n",

      "COVID-19 misinformation has flourished since the start of the pandemic, fuelling what has been called an “infodemic” of conspiracy theories and falsehoods amid efforts to contain the coronavirus.Declassified documents obtained by Global News under the Access to Information Act show that CSIS has been monitoring the national security implications of the phenomenon.“Threat actors have used the pandemic as an opportunity to spread disinformation online,” CSIS spokesman John Townsend said Wednesday when asked about the documents.“It is important to note that disinformation, originating from anywhere in the world, can have serious consequences including threats to the safety and security of Canadians, erosion of trust in our democratic institutions, and confusion about government policies and notices including information on the COVID-19 pandemic,” he said.“State-sponsored disinformation campaigns are an example of foreign interference.”The Chinese embassy denied spreading COVID-19 disinformation, while the Russian embassy said it would comment after receiving a link to the CSIS statement. Iran has not had an embassy in Canada since the countries broke off diplomatic relations in 2012.Professor Stephanie Carvin said Moscow and Beijing engaged in COVID-19 disinformation for different purposes.“In the case of Russia, it’s just kind of the continuation of trying to sow discord within Western democracies, whether by amplifying conspiracy theories or by just trying to discredit certain initiatives that governments are doing,” she said.But China had different objectives, said Carvin, an associate professor of international relations at the Norman Paterson School of International Affairs.“I think they are predominantly concerned with their international reputation and their perceived failure to be transparent with regards to the pandemic in their own country. And they’ve been asserting that the pandemic may have actually started in other countries like Italy.“So what we’re really seeing is a variety of actors engaged in this for a number of purposes. And this is, of course, how they normally operate, anyways. It’s just I think because so much global attention is being paid to the pandemic, it’s not surprising that they would latch onto that.”\n",

      "The CSIS documents reveal the agency’s Intelligence Assessment Branch, as well as the Integrated Terrorism Assessment Centre, have been preparing regular internal briefings on COVID-19-related issues.The topics include the exploitation of the pandemic by extremist movements and 5G conspiracy theorists, and the promotion of pandemic disinformation by Canada’s authoritarian adversaries.Some of the records indicate they were prepared for senior officials in the Privy Council Office, Health Canada, the Public Health Agency of Canada and Canadian Heritage, as well as the Deputy Ministers Operations Committee.The documents were partly redacted on the grounds they contained information about the prevention of hostile activities. They cover the period between January and May 2020.“CSIS is clearly monitoring any updates regarding the pandemic,” said Ahmed al-Rawi, assistant professor at the Simon Fraser University School of Communication.He said the CSIS documents covered four main areas of interest to the intelligence service: Russia, China, Iran and extremist groups.“They seem to be concerned about the impact of conspiracy theories on Canadians,” said Al-Rawi, who also runs The Disinformation Project.Misinformation about COVID-19 has had an impact on behaviour, according to a study conducted by McGill University and University of Toronto researchers, and published in the Harvard Kennedy School Misinformation Review.The study found that misinformation about the virus was associated with less compliance with social distancing, and those most likely to hold misperceptions about the pandemic were more reliant on social media.But one of the authors of the report, Aengus Bridgman of McGill University, said there was little evidence that disinformation campaigns had any impact, and most misinformation was spread by people engaging politically on the internet.A CSIS report, classified Top Secret, cited the example of a Chinese foreign ministry official who promoted the COVID-19 falsehoods of a Montreal-based conspiracy theory website.Although the virus originated in China, the spokesperson for China’s foreign ministry, Zhao Lijian, posted an article on Twitter claiming it was created in a U.S. biological warfare lab.The online post alleged the pandemic was “a cover operation by the One World Order” to use vaccination to reduce the global population and create “a digital control system,” CSIS wrote.There is no credible evidence supporting the theory.The article tweeted by Zhao was from Global Research, which CSIS described as a “Canadian conspiracy publication” that publishes content that portrays Russia’s response to COVID-19 in a positive light while claiming Moscow is the victim of “Western conspiracies.”According to the CSIS report, the Global Research article tweeted by Zhao was “being exploited as part of a growing alternative narrative that seeks to create doubt that the COVID-19 pandemic originated in China.”The website did not respond to a request for comment.The pandemic has “deepened fissures between authoritarian states and Western liberal democracies,” according to another CSIS intelligence assessment, marked Top Secret.The pandemic “represents a threat to regime stability” for some states, the assessment said.“At the same time, adversarial states have used the pandemic as an opportunity to tout themselves as legitimate alternatives to liberal Western democracies, currently straining to deal with the crisis.“Global strategic competition increasingly is focusing on a race to find a solution and to recalibrate supply chains and other vital mechanisms guaranteeing social and economic stability.”Last week, the National Cyber Threat Assessment 2020 also singled out Russia, China and Iran, as well as North Korea, saying their state-sponsored cyber programs posed the greatest strategic threat to Canada.Stewart.Bell@globalnews.ca\n",

      "CONTENT : China and 14 other countries agreed Sunday to set up the world’s largest trading bloc, encompassing nearly a third of all economic activity, in a deal many in Asia are hoping will help hasten a recovery from the shocks of the pandemic.The Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, or RCEP, was signed virtually on Sunday on the sidelines of the annual summit of the 10-nation Association of Southeast Asian Nations.“I am delighted to say that after eight years of hard work, as of today, we have officially brought RCEP negotiations to a conclusion for signing,” said host country Vietnam’s prime minister, Nguyen Xuan Phuc.\n",

      "“The conclusion of RCEP negotiation, the largest free trade agreement in the world, will send a strong message that affirms ASEAN’s leading role in supporting the multilateral trading system, creating a new trading structure in the region, enabling sustainable trade facilitation, revitalizing the supply chains disrupted by COVID-19 and assisting the post-pandemic recovery,” Phuc said.The accord will take already low tariffs on trade between member countries still lower, over time, and is less comprehensive than an 11-nation trans-Pacific trade deal that President Donald Trump pulled out of shortly after taking office.Apart from the 10 ASEAN members, it includes China, Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand, but not the United States. Officials said the accord leaves the door open for India, which dropped out due to fierce domestic opposition to its market-opening requirements, to rejoin the bloc.It will take time to fully assess exact details of the agreement encompassing tariff schedules and rules for all 15 countries involved _ the tariffs schedule just for Japan is 1,334 pages long.It is not expected to go as far as the European Union in integrating member economies but does build on existing free trade arrangements.The deal has powerful symbolic ramifications, showing that nearly four years after Trump launched his “America First” policy of forging trade deals with individual countries, Asia remains committed to multi-nation efforts toward freer trade that are seen as a formula for future prosperity.Ahead of Sunday’s RCEP “special summit” meeting, Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga said he would firmly convey his government’s support for “broadening a free and fair economic zone, including a possibility of India’s future return to the deal, and hope to gain support from the other countries.”The accord is also a coup for China, by far the biggest market in the region with more than 1.3 billion people, allowing Beijing to cast itself as a “champion of globalization and multilateral co-operation” and giving it greater influence over rules governing regional trade, Gareth Leather, senior Asian economist for Capital Economics, said in a report.\n",

      "China’s official Xinhua News Agency quoted Premier Li Keqiang hailing the agreement as a victory against protectionism, in remarks delivered via a video link.“The signing of the RCEP is not only a landmark achievement of East Asian regional co-operation, but also a victory of multilateralism and free trade,” Li said.The agreement is expected to help China, Japan and South Korea finally reach a trilateral free trade deal after years of struggling to bridge their differences.Now that Trump’s opponent Joe Biden has been declared president-elect, the region is watching to see how U.S. policy on trade and other issues will evolve.Analysts are skeptical Biden will push hard to rejoin the trans-Pacific trade pact or to roll back many of the U.S. trade sanctions imposed on China by the Trump administration given widespread frustration with Beijing’s trade and human rights records, and accusations of spying and technology theft.Critics of free trade agreements say they tend to encourage companies to move manufacturing jobs overseas. So, having won over disaffected rust-belt voters in Michigan and western Pennsylvania in the Nov. 3 election, Biden is “not going to squander that by going back into TPP,” Michael Jonathan Green of the Center for Strategic and International Studies said in a web seminar.\n",

      "But given concerns over China’s growing influence, Biden is likely to seek much more engagement with Southeast Asia to protect U.S. interests, he said.The fast-growing and increasingly affluent Southeast Asian market of 650 million people has been hit hard by the pandemic and is urgently seeking fresh drivers for growth.RCEP originally would have included about 3.6 billion people and encompassed about a third of world trade and global GDP. Minus India, it still covers more than 2 billion people and close to a third of all trade and business activity.The United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or CUSMA, the retooled version of the North American Free Trade Agreement under Trump, covers slightly less economic activity but less than a tenth of the world’s population. The EU and Comprehensive and Progressive Trans-Pacific Partnership, the revised version of the deal Trump rejected, also are smaller. RCEP includes six of the 11 remaining CPTPP members.India balked at exposing its farmers and factories to more foreign competition. Among other concerns, Indian dairy farmers are worried about competition from New Zealand and Australian milk and cheese producers. Automakers fear imports from across the region. But overall the biggest fear is over a flood of manufactured goods from China.Trade and investment flows within Asia have vastly expanded over the past decade, a trend that has accelerated amid feuding between the U.S. and China, which have imposed billions of dollars’ worth of punitive tariffs on each other’s exports.The RCEP agreement is loose enough to stretch to fit the disparate needs of member countries as diverse as Myanmar, Singapore, Vietnam and Australia. Unlike the CPTPP and EU, it does not establish unified standards on labour and the environment or commit countries to open services and other vulnerable areas of their economies.But it does set rules for trade that will facilitate investment and other business within the region, Jeffrey Wilson, research director at the Perth USAsia Center, said in a report for the Asia Society.“RCEP, therefore, is a much-needed platform for the Indo-Pacific’s post-COVID recovery,” he wrote.ASEAN members include Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Myanmar, the Philippines, Thailand, Brunei, Singapore, Malaysia and Vietnam.\n",

      "China’s fledgling pharmaceutical industry has at least five vaccines from four producers being tested in more than a dozen countries including Russia, Egypt and Mexico. Health experts say even if they are successful, the certification process for the United States, Europe, Japan and other developed countries might be too complex for them to be used there. However, China said it will ensure the products are affordable for developing countries and has been actively pursuing deals across the world.On Sunday, 1.2 million doses of the Chinese company Sinovac’s vaccine arrived in Indonesia, the government said.“We are very grateful, thank God, the vaccine is now available so that we can immediately curb the spread of the COVID-19 disease,” President Joko Widodo said.Within China, so far only one developer, China National Pharmaceutical Group, known as Sinopharm, said in November it applied for final market approval for use of its vaccine. Others have been approved for emergency use on people deemed at high risk of infection.“We must be prepared for large-scale production,” Vice Premier Sun Chunlan said during a visit Wednesday to developers, according to the official Xinhua News Agency.Sun, who has as overseen much of the country’s response, visited one of Sinopharm’s Beijing subsidiary companies, Sinovac and a research lab under the National Medical Products Administration, a regulatory agency that approves medical products for public use.[ Sign up for our Health IQ newsletter for the latest coronavirus updates ]The government has yet to say how many people it plans to vaccinate.

The Chinese producers have yet to say how they might be distributed.Health experts question why China is using experimental vaccines on such a vast scale now that the outbreak is largely under control within its borders.Health officials previously said China will be able to manufacture 610 million doses by the end of this year and ramp up to 1 billion doses next year.The government of Jiangsu province, where the major city of Nanjing is located, issued a procurement notice for vaccines from Sinovac and Sinopharm on Wednesday for emergency use.Authorities in Sichuan province in the west, which has about 85 million people, announced Monday they were already buying vaccines. An official newspaper in Anhui province, southeast of Beijing, said a local residential committee issued a notice asking whether residents want a vaccine.The Sichuan and Anhui announcements said the vaccine, given in two shots, would cost a total of 400 yuan ($60).Vaccines from Sinovac and Sinopharm were approved for emergency use in July.\n",

It said people considered high-risk would get priority.In November, the Communist Party secretary for Sinopharm said almost 1 million people had received its vaccine.In September, Sinovac’s CEO said about 3,000 of its employees had taken their vaccine. He said the company provided tens of thousands of doses to the Beijing city government.Sinopharm has clinical trials under way in 10 countries including the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Jordan, Peru and Argentina with nearly 60,000 volunteers. It has built two facilities in China capable of producing 200 million doses per year.Sinovac has trials in Brazil, Turkey and Indonesia. Its most recent publicized data, a study in the science journal the Lancet, showed its candidate produced lower levels of antibodies in people than those who had recovered from COVID-19. The company projects it will be able to produce a few hundred million doses of the vaccine by February or March of next year.Another producer, CanSino, is testing in Russia, Pakistan and Mexico and pursuing partnerships in Latin American countries. Its vaccine, which has been used on an emergency basis with the Chinese military, uses a harmless adenovirus to carry genes into human cells to generate an immune response.A fourth company, Anhui Zhifei Longcom Biologic Pharmacy Co., is conducting final stage trials across China.___Associated Press video producer Olivia Zhang contributed to this report.\n",

      "According to the Wall Street Journal’s sources, the deal would require Meng to admit to some of the allegations in the criminal case against her, which prosecutors would then drop if Meng co-operated.Negotiations between Meng’s lawyers and the Justice Department picked up after the U.S. presidential election, Reuters’ source said, adding it is still unclear what kind of deal can be struck.Meng does not think she did anything wrong and therefore is reluctant to make admissions that she does not think are true, that person said.The source said it does not appear to be part of a larger deal with Huawei.Meng is wanted in the United States on charges of bank fraud over allegations related to U.S. sanctions against Iran that both she and tech giant Huawei deny.She was arrested in December 2018 at Vancouver International Airport on a warrant from the United States, and has been under house arrest in Vancouver ever since as she and her lawyers fight extradition to the U.S.Meng’s lawyers have argued in B.C. Supreme Court that her arrest was unlawful and mishandled by the RCMP. They also allege political interference on the part of the U.S., citing comments by President Donald Trump who said Meng could be used as a bargaining chip in trade negotiations with China.\n",

Global News has also reached out to both the U.S. and Canadian justice departments for comment, but has not independently verified the reports.Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s office and foreign ministry had no immediate comment. Huawei has also not responded to requests for comment.Meng’s case has soured Canada’s relations with China, who detained Canadians Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor on allegations of espionage shortly after Meng’s arrest. The two men remain in Chinese detention to this day, with China suggesting they could be freed in exchange for Meng’s release.Deferred prosecution agreements are usually negotiated for corporations rather than individuals, allowing businesses to avoid criminal charges in exchange for significantly reduced penalties. Typically, companies still have to plead guilty to wrongdoing under such deals.In Canada, SNC-Lavalin ultimately struck a similar deal with federal prosecutors in 2019 that allowed the engineering giant to avoid criminal charges of corruption. The company still plead guilty to fraud and agreed to pay a fine of $280 million over five years, along with a three-year probation.Negotiations over a deferred prosecution agreement ultimately sparked the SNC-Lavalin affair that ensnared Trudeau’s government through early 2019.— With files from the Canadian Press and Reuters\n",

      "CONTENT : Top executives at CanSino Biologics — the Chinese company involved in a failed COVID-19 vaccine collaboration with Canada — were also part of a Chinese government program designed to incentivize people to transfer research and knowledge to China in exchange for salaries, funding and other benefits.Several former Canadian Security Intelligence Service officials interviewed by Global News said that CanSino’s Canadian-educated scientists were likely seen as potential assets by Chinese Communist Party information collection networks. And one of the Canadian security consultants, said the agency responsible for the CanSino collaboration— the National Research Council (NRC) — should have seen red flags surrounding a CanSino partnership.In August, the NRC announced its collaboration with CanSino had ended because Chinese officials had failed to send CanSino’s vaccine for testing in Canada.  Meanwhile, since June “many Chinese military” staff have received CanSino vaccine doses enabling them to soldier in “epidemic affected areas” without being infected, Chinese state media reported in November.\n",

      "The co-founders of CanSino — CEO Dr. Xuefeng Yu and executive director Dr. Tao Zhu — have been listed as members of China’s so-called Thousand Talents Plan, a Chinese Communist Party (CCP) recruiting strategy started in 2008 and now coming under increasing scrutiny from intelligence agencies in Canada, the United States and Australia.Yu, who was trained at McGill University, and Zhu left successful biopharma careers in Canada and founded CanSino in Tianjin China in 2009.Before returning to China the CanSino scientists were also members of a Chinese-Canadian research association that worked with Chinese government agencies to develop China’s science industry, the association’s records show. And after Yu and Zhu established CanSino’s lab with help from various levels of government in Mainland China, back in Toronto, Yu attended several forums with Chinese consular officials and recruiting officials, to promote China’s national recruiting plans, according to the Canada Chinese Biomedical and Pharmaceutical Association’s meeting records, which have been published online. CanSino’s Yu and Zhu didn’t respond to repeated questions from Global News about CanSino’s involvement in the Thousand Talents Plan and whether criticism of China’s talent recruitment plans by Western intelligence is unfair. The association’s website includes a January 2011 report that says Dr. Zhu is an association member, and he was selected to China’s “Thousand Talents” plan in December 2010.The 2011 report said CanSino had partially completed its research and development centre in Tianjin, after having “obtained financial support from the state, Tianjin City and other governments at all levels,” in China. More recently, company records say that in 2016 CanSino’s Tianjin lab started a Chinese-American talent recruiting program that is supported by an “Overseas Chinese Affairs” office that is part of China’s United Front Work Department.The Thousand Talents Plan is deeply intertwined with China’s broad espionage campaigns, Canadian experts said, and often in conjunction with the United Front Work Department, a sprawling foreign affairs agency that is central to Chinese interference and espionage networks, according to Western intelligence.\n",

      "In an interview Ward Elcock, former director of CSIS, said “the Chinese have long had a vacuum cleaner collection strategy, where everyone is collecting everything.”“There have been a lot of cases where Chinese academics have gathered intelligence in North America,” Elcock said. “The Chinese will make use of every opportunity. The Thousand Talents plan is one of those opportunities, and it’s clearly a vector of intelligence collection.”In the Thousand Talents plan, Western-based academics are sometimes approached to collaborate with Chinese institutions in deals that can have hidden contracts skewed in China’s favour, according to the consultants Global News interviewed for this report. For example, some professors have doubled their salaries by secretly taking pay from Chinese universities, the consultants said. In this way China has been able to cheaply obtain research and patents from the researchers it pays, even though their research is mostly funded by North American taxpayers.But Mandarin-speaking researchers born in China and well-established in the West are most coveted by the Thousand Talents Plan because they are perceived as potential assets for information collection in the West, former Canadian officials said.According to a November 2019 U.S. Senate report, China encourages these researchers to transmit their knowledge to China “in exchange for salaries, research funding, lab space and other incentives.” These prominent “Overseas Chinese” researchers are known as “sea turtles” because they return with knowledge to benefit the CCP, according to Michel Juneau Katsuya, a former CSIS Asia-Pacific desk agent.According to the U.S. Senate report and Western intelligence experts, the CCP uses all information gathered in its civilian talent recruiting to modernize its military.“The Chinese intelligence services have developed several concepts for repatriating information, and what better vehicle than to bring back someone that was educated abroad and understands the so-called ‘enemy’” Juneau Katsuya said. “This talent recruitment is systematically supported by the United Front Work Department, and other departments. But the United Front in particular, is responsible for trying to repatriate valuable Chinese people, like Dr. Yu.”Juneau Katsuya reviewed reports and photographs collected by Global News that detailed multiple forums attended by Yu involving Chinese recruiting and consular officials in Toronto. He said that these types of meetings provide the backdrops where Chinese officials can form personal relationships with talented researchers.\n",

      "According to meeting records posted on Canada Chinese Biomedical and Pharmaceutical Association’s website, in one February 2011 meeting, Yu gave a speech titled “Experience of Overseas Chinese Returning to China to Start a Business.” The website includes a slide of Yu’s presentation, titled “Lessons Learned.” According to the slide, one of Yu’s lessons was: “Better negotiate deal with government before you go.”Another was: “If use intangible asset as investment, better define it at the time of initial establishment.”Yu’s slide presentation — which hasn’t previously been reported on — appears to shed light on connections between China’s talent recruiting networks in Toronto and negotiations surrounding the funding Yu secured with China’s government, in CanSino’s business startup. But Yu’s slide presentation also shows he advised Chinese-Canadian researchers that doing scientific business with China’s government can involve “culture shock.” According to Juneau Katsuya, in China’s system, the cohort of Chinese researchers including Dr. Yu that attended such meetings in Toronto, would certainly be encouraged to bring their expertise back to Mainland China, for patriotic reasons. Yu, who is listed as director of the Toronto-based non-profit association, didn’t respond to requests for details on his funding from China. Corporate records say the association is active and was registered in 2003. And other association directors contacted by email for this story, also did not respond.While Yu didn’t respond to Global News, a May 2017 profile in Sixth Tone — an Asian news magazine — calls him a “shining example” of the “native Chinese who forged careers abroad and have now been lured home to develop the Chinese industry.”The profile says Yu “was selected for … the Thousand Talents Program, which offers generous packages to scientists who move to China.”“I felt like it was an obligation,” Yu was quoted, in the profile.Abandoned dealThe NRC entered a March 2020 deal with the endorsement of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, sharing Canada’s proprietary cell-line for vaccine-development with China. And in return, Canada was to test CanSino’s resulting vaccine and mass produce it in NRC labs. But in August, the NRC announced that “due to delays in Chinese customs releasing the vaccine candidate, the agreement was not acted upon.”The failed deal means that Canadian citizens lost a chance to be first-in-line to receive a vaccine produced in Canada.There is no explanation from Canada about why Chinese authorities blocked CanSino’s shipment to Canada. In a previous interview Scott Halperin, director of the Canadian Center for Vaccinology — the facility in Dalhousie University that was supposed to test CanSino’s vaccine — insisted that CanSino was an excellent collaborator. Halperin said the Canadian researchers involved can only assume that China’s government interfered in the partnership for geopolitical reasons. \n",

      "\t\t\t\t$6.8 million Nuctech deal rejected after security review\t\t\t\n",
      "Halperin said the federal government has contacted his research centre to discuss security threats related to foreign actors and COVID-19 research. But these contacts never included warnings about China attempting to subvert Canadian researchers in order to benefit China’s military, he said.“I have not had any discussions in particular related to the issue you quote about China recruiting and subverting Canadian investigators,” Halperin said. “My interactions with CanSino involved the opposite direction; getting access to Chinese technology since they were providing the vaccine (which we never received).”According to a Globe and Mail report, Yu blamed indecision on the part of Chinese bureaucrats for CanSino’s failure to ship vaccine material to Canada. “We currently do not have any further information  to share at this time,” a CanSino spokeswoman said, when asked by Global News “why will China not ship the vaccine to Canada, which under the terms of the deal (between CanSino and NRC), was supposed to receive the vaccine in order to do tests in Canada?”Some experts have said CanSino’s vaccine has fallen behind the leading candidates in clinical tests, including Pfizer and Moderna, because CanSino’s vaccine is based on a modified cold virus, which makes it less effective for more elderly segments of populations. However, Yu was cited in a Chinese state-media report in November, saying that CanSino’s vaccine has proven effective in protecting Chinese military personnel operating in areas impacted by the coronavirus pandemic.In an interview Elcock said he “found it interesting” that the CanSino deal collapsed. But there is not enough information, he said, to know what went wrong behind the scenes. And Elcock said the fact that CanSino is involved in the Thousand Talents Plan doesn’t necessarily mean NRC was unwise to partner with CanSino.But Juneau Katsuya said the NRC has been burned a number of times in collaborations with China and has lost intellectual property in major espionage and hacking cases, and still hasn’t learned its lesson.In one example, in 2014, the NRC was targeted in a Chinese cyberattack estimated to have cost Canada hundreds of millions and the loss of vast amounts of data, including personal information about NRC staff. Canada has yet to disclose more details about the nature of information lost to China in the case.And in another case, as Global News has previously revealed, a McGill University academic named Ishiang Shih collaborated with NRC, Canada’s space agency, and the Canadian army, in various research projects. Shih and a number of alleged conspirators are accused in the United States of secretly sending sensitive technologies to China to modernize its military units. Shih denies the allegations.\n",

      "Juneau Katsuya said he believes the NRC is ignoring security warnings and that Ottawa lacks a coordinated plan to counteract risks in partnerships with China. In recent parliamentary committee hearings on Canada’s dealings with China, elected officials have made similar criticisms, and called for ‘all of government’ national security vetting for potential contracts involving Chinese companies. “The right hand doesn’t know what the left hand is doing, and NRC has been abused by China before in this way, and that is why this case is so offensive,” Juneau Katsuya said. “In this case it looks like what China did, is they got what they needed (from Canada) and they stopped the vaccine shipment. This neutralizes the ability for Canada to participate in developing the vaccine.”Juneau Katsuya says he believes China’s other objective was to leverage Canada in the Meng Wanzhou extradition case.“Blocking the vaccine shipment also sends the (geopolitical) message: ‘Look, if you really want to work with us, you need to toe the line.’ I have seen it before, and it shows how dependent we are on China.”The NRC, CSIS, and Public Safety Canada would not answer whether the NRC has ever received cautions about NRC’s vaccine collaborations with CanSino and China’s military. The NRC first collaborated with CanSino in 2014, providing a cell-line used by Dr. Yu and CanSino and the People’s Liberation Army, to produce an Ebola vaccine. In a statement to Global News CSIS spokesman John Townsend would not confirm whether CSIS looked into the involvement of CanSino executives in Chinese-state sponsored talent recruiting programs and meetings in Toronto.However, Townsend confirmed generally, that CSIS has informed Canadian institutions involved in COVID-19 vaccine research, that the Thousand Talents Plan is one of the programs used by China “to acquire sensitive Canadian technologies and expertise by utilizing a range of traditional and non-traditional intelligence collection methods.”“While the Thousand Talents Plan is one example, academic talent plans are used by multiple hostile states,” Townsend said. After this story was published Wednesday, in a Parliamentary debate, Conservative leader Erin O’Toole cited Global News’ investigation of CanSino’s involvement in the Thousand Talents Plan.“How delayed is our vaccine response going to be, because this Prime Minister preferred to partner with China, ahead of anyone else?” O’Toole asked.“The answer is not at all,” Prime Minister Justin Trudeau responded. “Because we set out to make sure we were knocking on every single door, regardless of which researchers, or which companies found the vaccine first.”Also following on findings from this story, Conservative MP Garnett Genuis gave notice of a motion to examine the CanSino-NRC deal, in the Canada-China committee’s upcoming study on national security.Genuis’ motion asks the committee to question representatives of CanSino, CSIS director David Vigneault, and NRC’s president Iain Stewart, in mid-December.Huge vacuuming sound Margaret McCuaig-Johnston says that in her former role as an assistant deputy minister, she supported Canada’s research collaborations with China.  But since 2012, when Xi Jinping came to power, collaborations involving China’s Thousand Talents Plan have become increasingly dangerous, she says, because Xi has promoted the fusion of civilian and military research, and China has become increasingly “desperate” to obtain cutting-edge technology for the People’s Liberation Army.“You can almost hear the huge vacuuming sound whisking away North American technologies to Chinese labs, under Xi Jinping,” she said.And McCuaig-Johnston says the Thousand Talents Plan draws on funds from Beijing’s United Front Work Department, in order to offer lucrative pay and research-funding packages to Mandarin-speaking candidates working in Western labs and universities. “They play on the scientists’ obligations to help the Chinese homeland, and this is a big part of China’s keeping tabs on scholars that have gone abroad, through professional research associations,” she said. “It is all part of the United Front Work Department approach.”Canadian-based researchers and experts are also approached with lucrative packages that can be funded by the United Front, McCuaig-Johnston said. “I had a discussion with one Canadian professor in Artificial Intelligence, who was approached in the Thousand Talents Plan, with the offer that he would get a full salary at (a Chinese collaborator university) on top of his Canadian university salary,” she said.Critics in Australia and the U.S., including FBI director Christopher Wray, have pointed to similar concerns.\n",

      "And in August, Australian analyst Alex Joske published a report on the Thousand Talents Plan showing that Canada is one of the top nations targeted by China’s talent recruiting programs with links to the United Front. The report says Canada has 47 Chinese talent recruiting stations, the U.K. and Australia each have 49, Germany has 57 and the U.S. has 146. These stations are often run by United Front groups already established in Chinese-community groups in Western cities, the report said.In a Canadian case study, Joske’s report found that the Fujian Provincial Overseas Chinese Affairs Office sent representatives worldwide in July 2016 to establish China’s talent recruitment stations. And the Fujian office, which is part of China’s United Front according to Joske, set up four stations in Canada. Canada’s former ambassador to China, John McCallum, was pictured at the opening of one of the stations in Toronto. The Toronto community leader that opened that station and was pictured with McCallum, “is a member of several organisations run by the United Front Work Department in China and has been accused of running a lobbying group for the Chinese Consulate in Toronto,” Joske’s report says.McCallum, who is based in Hong Kong now, hasn’t responded to repeated requests for comment for this story. In a parliamentary hearing in late November regarding Canada’s troubled relations with China, McCallum said he regretted meeting with Chinese officials ahead of the fall 2019 federal election, and warning them a Conservative government would be less-friendly to Beijing than a Liberal government.\n",

      "CONTENT : The folly of Canada’s soft approach to dealing with China was exposed Friday when Beijing declared that Canadians Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor are to be tried on separate charges of espionage.It is a certainty that China will find the Two Michaels guilty, dooming the innocent men to years in jail unless and until a prison swap or deal of some kind can be arranged, most likely a few years after they are convicted.READ MORE: Canadians Michael Kovrig, Michael Spavor formally charged by China for alleged espionageThere has been some sympathy for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s position. The line of thinking has it that Canada has been caught in a steel trap between the U.S. and China that was not of its making. The trap was sprung the moment that the RCMP detained Huawei heiress Meng Wanzhou in Vancouver for potential extradition to the U.S. to face serious fraud charges.It is easy to understand that explanation because it is true. Canada is an innocent victim of a growing trade and security dispute between China’s Xi Jinping and the U.S.’s Donald Trump.But there is, however, another entirely different way to look at this. It is that China regards Canada as a pushover since Canada never pushes back.Like any great power, China can smell weakness. It likely sensed Canada’s vulnerability the moment Trudeau made his absurd declaration a few years back that he admired China’s “basic dictatorship.” To this day, the prime minister has not walked that bizarre statement back or explained his naivete in saying it.With the Two Michaels facing a dire future, perhaps Trudeau may now finally be pressed to explain what he meant by that remark or his widely circulated and now totally discredited idea that China improve its image by tightening ties with Canada.Another hard question for the prime minister is whether his admiration for the efficiency of China’s dictatorship extends to its rubber-stamp courts, which will surely find the Two Michaels guilty.The fate of the Two Michaels, who now face the untender mercies of China’s rigged, state-controlled justice system, is one of many recent examples of Beijing ignoring international conventions with no apparent concerns for its own reputation. In so doing, the communist dictatorship has quickly been transitioning from a rogue state into a pariah.A scorecard is required to keep track of all China’s tantrums and every country it has seriously offended lately. This week’s two other major outrages concern India and Australia.A bloody brawl over disputed territory at the “top of the world” involved hand-to-hand combat and left at least 20 Indians dead. Delhi is in a furious, unforgiving mood with some of its people out in the streets destroying Chinese-made television sets.Days after China threatened to ban all its students and tourists from going to Australia, Canberra said Friday that all branches of the Australian government had been simultaneously hit by cyberattacks by what it described as another “state-based actor.” Undoubtedly, that was code for China. Last year, Australia claimed China was responsible for a hacking attack on Australia’s Parliament.READ MORE: Australia says ‘state-based actor’ behind recent cyberattacks but won’t identify countryRecently, China has literally taken a run at Vietnamese and Filipino maritime interests in the South China Sea. It has also been aggressively probing Japanese resolve around its islands in the East China Sea and quarrelling with France, Germany, Britain and several Scandinavian countries.None of this has anything to do with the Two Michaels, but these disparate outrages must all be linked together if there is to be any hope of altering China’s behaviour. For starters, Ottawa must acknowledge that it owns the current policy of mostly polite silence, which has produced zero results, and that it must stop singing Kumbaya.The only way forward for Canada is to make common cause with the U.S., Japan, Australia and much of Europe on issues such as Hong Kong, the treatment of Muslim Uighurs, a ban on Huawei’s 5G technologies, and limiting Chinese territorial grabs in the western Pacific and the Himalayas. If Canada really wants to “be back” and gain international respect, it must lead in the formation of a coherent unified policy to confront China about its totally unacceptable behaviour.That won’t help the Two Michaels, but if the Canadian government finally stands up for democracy and human rights, it cannot harm the men any more than they are being harmed now.Matthew Fisher is an international affairs columnist and foreign correspondent who has worked abroad for 35 years.

      "The security law, which punishes what Beijing broadly defines as secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces with up to life in jail, has been condemned by the West and human rights groups as a tool to crush dissent in the semi-autonomous, Chinese-ruled city.Authorities in Hong Kong and Beijing say it is vital to plug gaping holes in national security defenses exposed by months of sometimes violent anti-government and anti-China protests that rocked the global financial hub over the last year.“The goal is to hold Jimmy Lai, and shut Jimmy Lai up,” Mark Simon, an associate of Lai, told Reuters.Hong Kong police did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The publishing tycoon is one of the financial hub’s most prominent democracy activists, while his Next Media group is considered one of the key remaining bastions of media freedoms in Hong Kong.Tensions between China and the United States have escalated in recent weeks as Washington accuses Beijing of using the security law to trample wide-ranging freedoms guaranteed when the former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997.Authorities have intensified a crackdown on opposition forces in the city, dismissing lawmakers from the legislature, conducting widespread arrests and jailing high-profile democracy activists such as Joshua Wong.\n",

      "CONTENT : WASHINGTON — A new report by a National Academy of Sciences committee has found that “directed” microwave radiation is the likely cause of illnesses among American diplomats in Cuba and China.The study commissioned by the State Department and released Saturday is the latest attempt to find a cause for the mysterious illnesses that started to emerge in late 2016 among U.S. personnel in Havana.\n",

      "The study found that “directed, pulsed radio frequency energy appears to be the most plausible” explanation for symptoms that included intense head pressure, dizziness and cognitive difficulties. It found this explanation was more likely than other previously considered causes such as tropical disease or psychological issues. The study did not name a source for the energy and did not say it came as the result of an attack, though it did note that previous research on this type of injury was done in the former Soviet Union.In its report, the 19-member committee noted that it faced significant challenges in trying to get to the bottom of the medical mystery. Among them, not everyone reported the same symptoms and the National Academy of Sciences research did not have access to all the previous studies on the illnesses, some of which are classified.“The committee found these cases quite concerning, in part because of the plausible role of directed, pulsed radiofrequency energy as a mechanism, but also because of the significant suffering and debility that has occurred in some of these individuals,” said committee chairman David Relman, a professor of medicine at Stanford University. “We as a nation need to address these specific cases as well as the possibility of future cases with a concerted, co-ordinated, and comprehensive approach.”The health effects were experienced by about two dozen Americans affiliated with the U.S. Embassy in Cuba as well as Canadian diplomats and personnel at the U.S. consulate in Guanghzhou, China, in early 2017.Earlier reporting by Global News found that after four years, Canadian officials still had no official answers on the cause of the illnesses experienced by the diplomats and their families, and that the federal government was telling them to stay silent on the issue.At least 15 Canadian diplomats and their dependents have since filed a $28-million lawsuit against the Canadian government, alleging that the situation was “badly mishandled.”\n",

The federal government continues to fight the impacted Canadians in court, arguing that they were making “exaggerated” claims.Some of the Americans have been critical of the U.S. government’s response to their health complaints as well, with at least one filing a suit against the State Department.Between late 2016 and May 2018, several U.S. and Canadian diplomats in Havana complained of health problems from an unknown cause. One U.S. government count put the number of American personnel affected at 26.Some reported hearing high-pitched sounds similar to crickets while at home or staying in hotels, leading to an early theory of a sonic attack.— With files from Global News\n",

Recent flare-ups have shown that there is still a risk of the virus returning, despite being largely controlled within China.On Monday, the National Health Commission reported two new locally transmitted cases in Shanghai over the last 24 hours, bringing the total to seven since Friday. China has recorded 86,442 total cases and 4,634 deaths since the virus was first detected in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year.The two latest cases confirmed in Shanghai were close contacts of another airport worker who was diagnosed with COVID-19 earlier in November. On Sunday night, the city’s Pudong International airport decided to test its workers, collecting 17,719 samples through the early hours of Monday morning. Plans call for testing others in surrounding communities if further cases are detected.Videos on social media purportedly from workers showed what appeared to be chaotic scenes at the airport as they were given last-minute orders to get tested. In the videos, people are seen standing in large groups pushing back and forth against officials in hazmat suits. Shanghai has been more selective with mass testing, targeting people associated with a particular place, such as the airport or the hospital where someone who has tested positive had worked, rather than an entire district.In Tianjin, health workers have collected more than 2.2 million samples for testing from residents in the Binhai new district, after five locally transmitted cases were discovered there last week.In Manzhouli, a city of more than 200,000 people, local health authorities are testing all residents after two cases were reported on Saturday. They also shut down all schools and public venues and banned public gatherings such as banquets.China has resorted to its heavy, top-down approach each time new cases of local transmission are found — shutting down schools and hospitals, locking down residential communities and entire neighborhoods, and testing millions.COMMENTARY: How reliable are China’s COVID-19 numbers?Tianjin authorities shut down a kindergarten and moved all the teachers, family and students to a centralized quarantine space. They also sealed the residential compound where the five cases were found.A worker for UPS at Pudong airport said one of those who tested positive earlier in the month had visited her office. Since then, her company has asked employees to quarantine themselves in the office and were forbidden to leave for four days, unless they signed an agreement to quarantine themselves at home for two weeks, she said, declining to be named out of fear of retaliation. She said she had been sleeping at the office since Friday, but was able to leave Monday. The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment.China’s approach to controlling the pandemic has been criticized for being draconian. It locked down the city of Wuhan, where cases were first reported, for more than two months to contain the virus, with the local government shutting down all traffic and confining residents to their homes. Domestically, however, China has called its strategy “clear to zero” and has boasted of its success.\n",

      "“In the entire world, only China has the ability to get to zero. Other countries don’t have this ability,” Zeng Guang, the chief epidemiologist at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said in a webinar hosted by Chinese media in September. “It’s not just getting to zero, even for them to control the first wave of the epidemic is hard.”“‘Clearing to zero’ is actually the most economically effective way to do epidemic prevention. If you don’t do that, then this problem will get more troublesome,” he said. “Use a heavier hand, and get to zero, then people will feel reassured.”\n",

      "CONTENT : Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan has confirmed Canadian soldiers are no longer training members of the Chinese military, amid scrutiny following a report that senior civil servants opposed a decision last year to stop training activities with the regime.A report by The Globe and Mail on Thursday cited documents mistakenly released under access to information laws which said Global Affairs Canada pushed back at the decision by Chief of Defence Staff Gen. Jonathan Vance last year to cancel the training.The training was set to see Canadian soldiers train Chinese soldiers in winter activities at CFB Petawawa.READ MORE: Canadian officials say two Michaels not tried by China, citing translation errorThe matter dominated question period in the House of Commons, with Sajjan blaming the former Conservative government for having signed a military cooperation plan in 2013 with Beijing.“Because of the agreement that they had signed, this is one of the reasons why we actually changed our approach because of the concerns that the member outlined,” Sajjan said after Conservative defence critic James Bezan asked him to explain why Canadian troops would train Chinese soldiers.“We will always stand up for Canadians who are arbitrarily detained. This is one of the reasons why we actually stopped our training with the Chinese.”Bezan was previously parliamentary secretary to Rob Nicholson, the former Conservative defence minister who signed that agreement in 2013.The revelation came as Canadians across the country marked a grim milestone.Thursday marked two years since Beijing arbitrarily detained Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, who have received only limited consular access since they were seized in December 2018.Beijing has repeatedly linked their arrests with the detention by Canadian authorities several days prior in December 2018 of Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou in accordance with the longstanding extradition treaty between Canada and the U.S.American officials have charged Meng and Huawei with dozens of criminal counts related to allegations of skirting sanctions on Iran and stealing corporate secrets.Kovrig, a Canadian diplomat, was on leave doing research work with the non-profit International Crisis Group as part of a team analyzing Chinese foreign policy.Brittany Brown, chief of staff for the International Crisis Group, said the team remains “devastated” by his continued detention, adding it casts a discouraging cloud around global relations.“I thought the worst-case scenario was three months, six months,” she told Global News, noting the group remains concerned that other authoritarian regimes will use the detentions as a model.“I think we can all imagine those governments are watching it really carefully and they’re seeing that China has pretty much gotten away with holding two Canadians hostage for the last two years with very little impact.”Charles Burton, a former Canadian diplomat in China and now senior fellow with the Macdonald-Laurier Institute, expressed similar concerns on Thursday.He said the federal government’s response so far sends a clear signal to China.“I think that all of these passive non-responses by our government is sending a signal to the Chinese authorities that hostage diplomacy works,” he said.“And until such time as we make it clear to the Chinese government that they cannot menace and intimidate us through hostage diplomacy, they will persist with this policy of hostage diplomacy.”Conservative leader Erin O’Toole called on the government to implement Magnitsky sanctions on Chinese officials, freezing their assets and finances here in Canada.He also called the report of senior officials opposing Vance’s move to cancel winter training “disturbing.”“China does not act like a partner or a friend,” he said. “Communist China acts against human rights and the rule of law consistently. … The government needs to wake up.”— With files from Global’s Marc-Andre Cossette.\n",

The influenza-like illness — which has been named COVID-19, the World Health Organization announced on Tuesday — has been reported in two dozen other countries, with one death in the Philippines.China has struggled to contain the virus but, with one of the world’s most sophisticated systems of electronic surveillance, the health emergency has given authorities new reasons for new methods of control.Drones are just the tip of the iceberg.A number of Chinese mobile apps can now tell users if they’ve been on a flight or public transportation with a COVID-19 patient. Other apps use digital maps to show users buildings where infected people live. New systems from top-tier Chinese tech firms require passengers to provide personal information before taking buses, trains or taxis. The data collection is intended to build a trip history for each citizen and monitor those who might have been in contact with COVID-19 patients.But, with millions of people wearing surgical masks, identifying a confirmed or suspected patient using China’s vast network of facial recognition technology isn’t as easy as it once was. A number of artificial intelligence companies are looking at ways to detect fevers and symptoms without a face identification.\n",

In the most extreme case, authorities in the province of Heilongjiang have warned citizens could face the death penalty for deliberately spreading the virus by being out in public. In one county in Hebei, authorities are allegedly offering people bounties of 1,000 yan ($140) to tell on neighbours who have recently arrived from Wuhan.The Chinese government’s handling of the crisis, however, has been criticized since the outbreak began. The death of a young doctor from the virus who had earlier been threatened by police for warning people online about the illness only fanned the flames of public outrage over the crisis.— With files from Reuters and The Associated Press\n",

Supreme Court that her arrest was unlawful and mishandled by the RCMP.

Global News has also reached out to both the U.S. and Canadian justice departments for comment, but has not independently verified the reports.Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s office and foreign ministry had no immediate comment. Huawei has also not responded to requests for comment.Meng’s case has soured Canada’s relations with China, who detained Canadians Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor on allegations of espionage shortly after Meng’s arrest. The two men remain in Chinese detention to this day, with China suggesting they could be freed in exchange for Meng’s release.Deferred prosecution agreements are usually negotiated for corporations rather than individuals, allowing businesses to avoid criminal charges in exchange for significantly reduced penalties. Typically, companies still have to plead guilty to wrongdoing under such deals.In Canada, SNC-Lavalin ultimately struck a similar deal with federal prosecutors in 2019 that allowed the engineering giant to avoid criminal charges of corruption. The company still plead guilty to fraud and agreed to pay a fine of $280 million over five years, along with a three-year probation.Negotiations over a deferred prosecution agreement ultimately sparked the SNC-Lavalin affair that ensnared Trudeau’s government through early 2019.— With files from the Canadian Press and Reuters\n",

      "CONTENT : Canada is an “attractive and permissive target” for Chinese interference that endangers the “foundations of our fundamental institutions, including our system of democracy itself,” according to a recent national security review.The reason, experts suggest, is because China’s Communist Party has won the support of some influential Canadians by using economic carrots and sticks, while public attention on Beijing’s broad campaign is “almost non-existent.”The national security review says “for years Canadian Security Intelligence Service has investigated and reported on the threat” of foreign interference. But unlike Canada’s Western intelligence allies, Ottawa hasn’t responded with strong countermeasures.In an interview, Global News pressed Liberal MP David McGuinty, chair of the national security and intelligence committee, to explain why Canada is “permissive” of China’s methods.McGuinty said he could only answer by citing the report findings because of its sensitivity. He chose to read this quote: “The People’s Republic of China utilizes its growing economic wealth to mobilize interference operations: ‘with deep coffers and the help of western enablers, the Chinese Communist Party uses money, rather than Communist ideology, as a powerful source of influence, creating parasitic relationships of long-term dependence.’”The committee’s report named two countries — Russia and China — among those conducting “sophisticated and pervasive foreign interference activities against Canada.”But intelligence officials and former diplomats, including Canada’s former ambassador to China, believe China is the greater threat, in large part because the country has been successful in “elite capture.”“China is the No. 1 threat to Canada and has been for some time,” David Mulroney, former ambassador to China, said in an interview. China has used its economic leverage to secure “the voices” of political and business leaders in Canada with “sweetheart business deals” and “various inducements,” including lucrative board positions or honours in China, he said. \n",
      "READ MORE: \n",
      "\t\t\t\tUnited Front groups in Canada helped Beijing stockpile coronavirus safety supplies\t\t\t\n",
      "And as a result, Mulroney said he often hears people reciting Beijing’s line on issues such as the extradition case of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou or are silent in the face of China’s mass detention of Uyghurs and incursions on democracy in Hong Kong.“There are people a lot more senior than I was in government, and they have some serious business links with China,” Mulroney said. “China is very willing to weaponize trade and investment to compel people to say what they want them to say.”The argument that Mulroney and experts interviewed by Global News make is not that all Canadian politicians and businesses that have traded with China have been influenced. Rather, they say, Beijing has targeted elites and deftly attempted to interweave the CCP’s interests with Canada’s economic interests, seeking to bend major decisions away from Canada’s democratic values.And they say Canadians should see Hong Kong as a case study.But recent events in the United States, Australia and Canada suggest that pushing back on China’s interference could have consequences. In 2019, China called for the firing of an NBA executive who tweeted support for Hong Kong, using the NBA’s business in China as leverage.And Australia has faced trade sanction threats and was targeted in sophisticated state-based cyberattacks, its government said in June. Australia recently pressed for an international probe of Beijing’s actions in the coronavirus pandemic and Australia’s intelligence experts say China is likely behind the attacks. China denies the accusation. And on Monday, Beijing warned Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to “stop making irresponsible remarks,” according to The Associated Press, after Trudeau told reporters Beijing’s decision to charge Canadians Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor with spying was related to the Meng case. But despite warning signs of China’s incursions, Canadian academics, think tanks and media have been way behind the international curve in scrutinizing China’s “clandestine” tactics, Mulroney said.“Canada is kind of a sleepy and unaware target,” he said. “We don’t have the same kind of vigilance that you now see in places like Australia and New Zealand. That had better change.”China uses a vast network of political, business and media operatives directed from Beijing, known as the United Front, in attempts to co-opt Chinese-Canadian communities and leaders, Mulroney and the experts interviewed by Global News said.In June, Alex Joske, an analyst with the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, released a report aimed at helping international journalists identify and demystify United Front networks. In it, Joske defines the United Front as “the system at the heart of the Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP) efforts to influence foreign politicians, meddle in ethnic Chinese communities and transfer technologies from abroad … it is an exportation of the CCP’s political system (which) undermines social cohesion, exacerbates racial tension, influences politics, harms media integrity, facilitates espionage.”He believes the United Front could be just as active in Canada as it is in Australia, where an alleged United Front leader, billionaire and casino high-roller became a major funder of Australian political parties. An Australian senator also allegedly accepted funds from Chinese agents and touted China’s South China Sea policy against Australia’s position after the billionaire threatened to withdraw a $400,000 political donation. \n",

      "Joske said in order to understand the United Front, people should look at China’s patient campaign to control Hong Kong, where China has used front groups to co-opt political leaders, tycoons and institutions since the 1990s.“Hong Kong is a long way down the track,” Joske said. “But by looking at Hong Kong, you understand how the United Front works.”Joske’s report also underlined the United Front’s mobilization during the COVID-19 pandemic — in Australia, Canada, the U.S. and U.K., Japan, Argentina and the Czech Republic — “to gather increasingly scarce medical supplies from around the world and send them to China.”And based on China’s success using United Front networks during the coronavirus pandemic, Beijing can be expected to ramp up the intensity of its United Front interference worldwide as tensions between China and the world rise in the post-COVID-19 landscape, Joske said. “The CCP’s attempts to interfere in diaspora communities, influence political systems and covertly access valuable and sensitive technology will only grow.”Joske’s report says United Front pioneers such as Premier Zhou Enlai, a CCP revolutionary, said the United Front should use “the legal to mask the illegal,” and the CCP should be “nestling intelligence within the United Front.” And Chinese President Xi Jinping has elevated the United Front’s prominence in Beijing’s global plans.“The United Front … is an important magic weapon for strengthening the party’s ruling position … and an important magic weapon for realizing the China Dream of the Great Rejuvenation of the Chinese Nation,” Xi said in a 2015 speech.But China does not acknowledge the United Front facilitates espionage.Experts describe Beijing as holding out carrots and sticks. And unfortunately, it is Chinese diaspora communities that often face the sticks. According to the Canadian Security Intelligence Service, China uses “a range of tactics including threats, harassment, detention of family members abroad and refusal to issue travel documents or visas.”Chinese-Canadian community leader Gloria Fung, director of democracy advocacy group Canada-Hong Kong Link, says she has seen China’s influence efforts in Canada become increasingly aggressive with both the carrot and the stick.In the 1990s, United Front networks just made passive political donations to all Canadian political parties, Fung said. Now they are aggressively lobbying for Beijing’s policies, covertly offering political funding from Beijing and attempting to promote covert CCP party members for election, Fung claimed.And Fung said she believes China has successfully influenced “many elected officials.”\n",

      "“They could be bribing, offering money or material benefits to targets in the decision-making process,” Fung said. “Many elected officials are offered free tours to China. And many, when they returned, seem to have changed their positions towards China.”Tensions reached a new level in August 2019, Fung said, when Hong Kong Canadians were targeted in anti-democracy counter-protests in a number of Canadian cities. Fung pointed to a Hong Kong democracy counter-rally at Toronto’s Old City Hall on Aug. 17, where she says her group was surrounded by students and middle-aged leaders, who Fung associated with Toronto United Front groups. A similar conflict occurred in Vancouver on Aug. 18 when a pro-China crowd surrounded a church where Hong Kong Canadians were praying. By comparing photos and video of the event with pictures of meetings involving Chinese consulate officials, Global News sources identified several senior members in the crowd as directors of a pro-CCP association, which Chen Yonglin, a defected Chinese diplomat, alleges is a “controlling level” United Front group in Canada.The pro-CCP association is part of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Office, a United Front group that Beijing uses to influence the Chinese diaspora, according to a 2018 report from the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission. “United Front work is Beijing’s strategy to influence overseas Chinese communities, foreign governments and other actors … mainly through economic or financial inducement,” the commission’s chair Robin Cleveland and vice-chair Carolyn Bartholomew told Global News in a statement. “The CCP considers ethnic Chinese everywhere to ultimately be Chinese subjects, regardless of their citizenship, and seeks to treat them as resources to assist in ‘the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation’ whether they like it or not.”\n",

      "A Chinese-Canadian academic ⁠— who is studying Beijing’s influence networks ⁠— agreed with Fung’s assessment of China’s efforts to control community groups.The academic asked to remain anonymous because of fears that officials in Chinese consulates could interfere with their ongoing research.“Many in the Chinese-Canadian diaspora do not want to have anything to do with the Chinese government. But unfortunately, immigrants from China and Hong Kong are not completely free from the government’s control and surveillance,” the academic said.Most experts interviewed by Global News said Australia’s legislative reforms should be a model for other countries combating China’s interference campaigns.In an interview, McGuinty, the intelligence committee chair, said the report underlined how Australia has taken concrete measures since 2018, including adding new offences to its Criminal Code.The report says the new offences “provide a high degree of specificity on offences and threat activities, including on whether the activity was in the planning stages, intentional, reckless or funded by a foreign intelligence service.”The penalties range from 10 to 20 years’ imprisonment. And “the legislation creates a new transparency scheme that prescribes the registration of persons acting as agents of foreign principals and requires regular public disclosures.”In an interview, Mulroney said: “We need to invest in national security and insist on greater transparency.”He said currently, Canadians have no real idea whether influential politicians and businesspersons are acting for China or Canada. And it is extremely difficult to hold Canadian citizens that may be acting against Canadian interests to account under current laws.“What Australia have done is give transparency requirements some legal teeth,” Mulroney said. “And they use their intelligence apparatus to make the case against people that are not transparent. And I think we need to consider these things so Canadians become far more aware of who is speaking for whom.”Gloria Fung agreed.“Legislative tools on corruption and fishy transactions need to be closely monitored and put under Parliament’s radar,” Fung said. “Australia has all kinds of legislative tools to handle political collusion.”McGuinty was asked by Global News to explain the evident gap between Canadian intelligence’s strong warnings of China’s interference and the federal government’s response.McGuinty reiterated that the committee recommendations are bipartisan and straightforward, and the committee purposefully chose Australia as an exemplar to be considered by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government.“We believe the government needs to up its game when it comes to foreign interference,” he said. “There is lots of room for improvement.”But University of B.C. China expert Prof. Paul Evans, who has argued for closer ties with China and published research indicating Canadians are losing confidence “about the role of the United States” in global affairs, told Global News “the discourse of ‘capture’ is especially dangerous.”Evans draws a distinction between influence and “interference activities” and says “it is very difficult to estimate how many such incidents happen in Canada each year.”“My sense is that they are comparatively rare,” Evans wrote in an email response. “It is unproductive to talk about undermining ‘institutions’ without specifying which ones are being discussed.”Evans said it is “dangerous” to rely on Australia’s data and examples of foreign interference, and assume the same kinds and scale of interference activity is occurring in Canada.“We have reached a dangerous phase of our debates about China policy where advocates of engagement, past and present, are being attacked not just for the content of their views and actions but also for their integrity and even loyalty,” Evans wrote. “This is vile terrain and reminiscent of the worst of the McCarthy era and anti-communist actions in the United States in the 1950s.”\n",

      "For the months that followed, the officials with the facility spoke openly about the troubles they were having securing international travel permits to relocate the pandas.Then, on Friday, the zoo announced the pair were officially making their way home.“After months and months of hard work to secure international permits to get our beloved giant pandas home to China,” a Facebook post stated, “today is the day!”“A huge thank you to our amazing partners at YYC Calgary International Airport and International Animal Lounge YYC for being part of the beginning of Er Shun and Da Mao’s journey home today.”The pandas first arrived in Canada in 2013 as part of a 10-year agreement between Canada and China.After spending five years at the Toronto Zoo, the pair arrived at the Calgary Zoo in March 2018 with cubs Jia Panpan and Jia Yueyue.The cubs then travelled home to China in January, leaving just their parents to wander the Calgary Zoo’s Panda Passage exhibit.\n",

      "The zoo had said previously that the decision to send Er Shun and Da Mao home was due to COVID-19 travel restrictions, which had made it more challenging for them to get access to bamboo for the pandas to eat.According to the zoo, 99 per cent of a giant panda’s diet is made up of fresh bamboo, and each adult giant panda consumes approximately 40 kilograms of bamboo daily.In an email to Global News in August, the zoo said the bamboo came from a single supplier on Salt Spring Island, B.C.In the past, the Calgary Zoo said it had worked with alternative bamboo suppliers to find a way to keep the giant pandas fed, but shipments were “slower than acceptable” and resulted in “poor quality bamboo” that the giant pandas wouldn’t eat.The Calgary Zoo is encouraging anyone who wants to stay updated on Er Shun and Da Mao’s journey to check its social media accounts for updates, which will be posted using the hashtag #GetThePandasHome.\n",

      "CONTENT : WASHINGTON — A new report by a National Academy of Sciences committee has found that “directed” microwave radiation is the likely cause of illnesses among American diplomats in Cuba and China.The study commissioned by the State Department and released Saturday is the latest attempt to find a cause for the mysterious illnesses that started to emerge in late 2016 among U.S. personnel in Havana.\n",

      "The study found that “directed, pulsed radio frequency energy appears to be the most plausible” explanation for symptoms that included intense head pressure, dizziness and cognitive difficulties. It found this explanation was more likely than other previously considered causes such as tropical disease or psychological issues. The study did not name a source for the energy and did not say it came as the result of an attack, though it did note that previous research on this type of injury was done in the former Soviet Union.In its report, the 19-member committee noted that it faced significant challenges in trying to get to the bottom of the medical mystery. Among them, not everyone reported the same symptoms and the National Academy of Sciences research did not have access to all the previous studies on the illnesses, some of which are classified.“The committee found these cases quite concerning, in part because of the plausible role of directed, pulsed radiofrequency energy as a mechanism, but also because of the significant suffering and debility that has occurred in some of these individuals,” said committee chairman David Relman, a professor of medicine at Stanford University. “We as a nation need to address these specific cases as well as the possibility of future cases with a concerted, co-ordinated, and comprehensive approach.”The health effects were experienced by about two dozen Americans affiliated with the U.S. Embassy in Cuba as well as Canadian diplomats and personnel at the U.S. consulate in Guanghzhou, China, in early 2017.Earlier reporting by Global News found that after four years, Canadian officials still had no official answers on the cause of the illnesses experienced by the diplomats and their families, and that the federal government was telling them to stay silent on the issue.At least 15 Canadian diplomats and their dependents have since filed a $28-million lawsuit against the Canadian government, alleging that the situation was “badly mishandled.”\n",

The federal government continues to fight the impacted Canadians in court, arguing that they were making “exaggerated” claims.Some of the Americans have been critical of the U.S. government’s response to their health complaints as well, with at least one filing a suit against the State Department.Between late 2016 and May 2018, several U.S. and Canadian diplomats in Havana complained of health problems from an unknown cause. One U.S. government count put the number of American personnel affected at 26.Some reported hearing high-pitched sounds similar to crickets while at home or staying in hotels, leading to an early theory of a sonic attack.— With files from Global News\n",

      "CONTENT : Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan has confirmed Canadian soldiers are no longer training members of the Chinese military, amid scrutiny following a report that senior civil servants opposed a decision last year to stop training activities with the regime.A report by The Globe and Mail on Thursday cited documents mistakenly released under access to information laws which said Global Affairs Canada pushed back at the decision by Chief of Defence Staff Gen. Jonathan Vance last year to cancel the training.The training was set to see Canadian soldiers train Chinese soldiers in winter activities at CFB Petawawa.READ MORE: Canadian officials say two Michaels not tried by China, citing translation errorThe matter dominated question period in the House of Commons, with Sajjan blaming the former Conservative government for having signed a military cooperation plan in 2013 with Beijing.“Because of the agreement that they had signed, this is one of the reasons why we actually changed our approach because of the concerns that the member outlined,” Sajjan said after Conservative defence critic James Bezan asked him to explain why Canadian troops would train Chinese soldiers.“We will always stand up for Canadians who are arbitrarily detained. This is one of the reasons why we actually stopped our training with the Chinese.”Bezan was previously parliamentary secretary to Rob Nicholson, the former Conservative defence minister who signed that agreement in 2013.The revelation came as Canadians across the country marked a grim milestone.Thursday marked two years since Beijing arbitrarily detained Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, who have received only limited consular access since they were seized in December 2018.Beijing has repeatedly linked their arrests with the detention by Canadian authorities several days prior in December 2018 of Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou in accordance with the longstanding extradition treaty between Canada and the U.S.American officials have charged Meng and Huawei with dozens of criminal counts related to allegations of skirting sanctions on Iran and stealing corporate secrets.Kovrig, a Canadian diplomat, was on leave doing research work with the non-profit International Crisis Group as part of a team analyzing Chinese foreign policy.Brittany Brown, chief of staff for the International Crisis Group, said the team remains “devastated” by his continued detention, adding it casts a discouraging cloud around global relations.“I thought the worst-case scenario was three months, six months,” she told Global News, noting the group remains concerned that other authoritarian regimes will use the detentions as a model.“I think we can all imagine those governments are watching it really carefully and they’re seeing that China has pretty much gotten away with holding two Canadians hostage for the last two years with very little impact.”Charles Burton, a former Canadian diplomat in China and now senior fellow with the Macdonald-Laurier Institute, expressed similar concerns on Thursday.He said the federal government’s response so far sends a clear signal to China.“I think that all of these passive non-responses by our government is sending a signal to the Chinese authorities that hostage diplomacy works,” he said.“And until such time as we make it clear to the Chinese government that they cannot menace and intimidate us through hostage diplomacy, they will persist with this policy of hostage diplomacy.”Conservative leader Erin O’Toole called on the government to implement Magnitsky sanctions on Chinese officials, freezing their assets and finances here in Canada.He also called the report of senior officials opposing Vance’s move to cancel winter training “disturbing.”“China does not act like a partner or a friend,” he said. “Communist China acts against human rights and the rule of law consistently. … The government needs to wake up.”— With files from Global’s Marc-Andre Cossette.\n",

      "CONTENT : BEIJING — A Chinese spacecraft sent to return lunar rocks to Earth collected its first samples Wednesday after landing on the moon, the government announced, adding to a string of successes for Beijing‘s increasingly ambitious space program.The Chang’e 5 probe touched down shortly after 11 p.m. (1500 GMT) on Tuesday after descending from an orbiter, the China National Space Administration said. It released images of the barren scene at the landing site showing the lander’s shadow.“Chang’e has collected moon samples,” the agency said in a statement carried by the official Xinhua News Agency. It said the probe also had successfully unfolded solar panels that will power it.The probe, launched Nov. 24 from the tropical southern island of Hainan, is the latest venture by a Chinese space program that sent its first astronaut into orbit in 2003, has a spacecraft en route to Mars and aims eventually to land a human on the moon.\n",

      "Plans call for the lander to spend about two days drilling into the lunar surface and collecting 2 kilograms (4.4 pounds) of rocks and debris. The top stage of the probe will be launched back into lunar orbit to transfer the samples to a capsule for return to Earth, where it is to land in China’s northern grasslands in mid-December.If it succeeds, it will be the first time scientists have obtained fresh samples of lunar rocks since a Soviet probe in the 1970s. Those samples are expected to be made available to scientists from other nations, although its unclear how much access NASA will have, given tight U.S. government restrictions on space co-operation with China.From the rocks and debris, scientists hope to learn more about the moon, including its precise age, as well as increased knowledge about other bodies in our solar system. Collecting samples, including from asteroids, is an increasing focus of many space programs and China’s mastery of the technology once again places it among the leading nations operating in space.Congratulations to China on the successful landing of Chang’e 5. This is no easy task. When the samples collected on the Moon are returned to Earth, we hope everyone will benefit from being able to study this precious cargo that could advance the international science community. pic.twitter.com/2xoKouf3dq— Thomas Zurbuchen (@Dr_ThomasZ) December 1, 2020American and Russian space officials congratulated the Chinese program.“Congratulations to China on the successful landing of Chang’e 5. This is no easy task,” wrote NASA’s science mission chief, Thomas Zurbuchen, on Twitter.“When the samples collected on the Moon are returned to Earth, we hope everyone will benefit from being able to study this precious cargo that could advance the international science community.”The most recent return of lunar rocks to Earth was carried out in 1976 by Luna 24, a Soviet robot probe.U.S. astronauts brought back 842 pounds (382 kilograms) of lunar samples from 1969 to 1972, some of which is still being analyzed and experimented on.The Chang’e 5 flight is China’s third successful lunar landing. Its predecessor, Chang’e 4, was the first probe to land on the moon’s little-explored far side.Chinese space program officials have said they envision future crewed missions along with robotic ones, including possibly a permanent research base. No timeline or other details have been announced.The latest flight includes collaboration with the European Space Agency, which is helping to monitor the mission.China’s space program has proceeded more cautiously than the U.S.-Soviet space race of the 1960s, which was marked by fatalities and launch failures.In 2003, China became the third country to send an astronaut into orbit on its own after the Soviet Union and the United States. It also launched a crewed space station.China, along with neighbours Japan and India, also has joined the growing race to explore Mars. The Tianwen 1 probe launched in July is on its way to the red planet carrying a lander and a rover to search for water.\n",

      "According to the Wall Street Journal’s sources, the deal would require Meng to admit to some of the allegations in the criminal case against her, which prosecutors would then drop if Meng co-operated.Negotiations between Meng’s lawyers and the Justice Department picked up after the U.S. presidential election, Reuters’ source said, adding it is still unclear what kind of deal can be struck.Meng does not think she did anything wrong and therefore is reluctant to make admissions that she does not think are true, that person said.The source said it does not appear to be part of a larger deal with Huawei.Meng is wanted in the United States on charges of bank fraud over allegations related to U.S. sanctions against Iran that both she and tech giant Huawei deny.She was arrested in December 2018 at Vancouver International Airport on a warrant from the United States, and has been under house arrest in Vancouver ever since as she and her lawyers fight extradition to the U.S.Meng’s lawyers have argued in B.C. Supreme Court that her arrest was unlawful and mishandled by the RCMP. They also allege political interference on the part of the U.S., citing comments by President Donald Trump who said Meng could be used as a bargaining chip in trade negotiations with China.\n",

      "U.S. Justice Department spokesman Marc Raimondi declined to comment on the negotiations to Reuters. Global News has also reached out to both the U.S. and Canadian justice departments for comment, but has not independently verified the reports.Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s office and foreign ministry had no immediate comment. Huawei has also not responded to requests for comment.Meng’s case has soured Canada’s relations with China, who detained Canadians Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor on allegations of espionage shortly after Meng’s arrest. The two men remain in Chinese detention to this day, with China suggesting they could be freed in exchange for Meng’s release.Deferred prosecution agreements are usually negotiated for corporations rather than individuals, allowing businesses to avoid criminal charges in exchange for significantly reduced penalties. Typically, companies still have to plead guilty to wrongdoing under such deals.In Canada, SNC-Lavalin ultimately struck a similar deal with federal prosecutors in 2019 that allowed the engineering giant to avoid criminal charges of corruption. The company still plead guilty to fraud and agreed to pay a fine of $280 million over five years, along with a three-year probation.Negotiations over a deferred prosecution agreement ultimately sparked the SNC-Lavalin affair that ensnared Trudeau’s government through early 2019.— With files from the Canadian Press and Reuters\n",

The influenza-like illness — which has been named COVID-19, the World Health Organization announced on Tuesday — has been reported in two dozen other countries, with one death in the Philippines.China has struggled to contain the virus but, with one of the world’s most sophisticated systems of electronic surveillance, the health emergency has given authorities new reasons for new methods of control.Drones are just the tip of the iceberg.A number of Chinese mobile apps can now tell users if they’ve been on a flight or public transportation with a COVID-19 patient. Other apps use digital maps to show users buildings where infected people live. New systems from top-tier Chinese tech firms require passengers to provide personal information before taking buses, trains or taxis. The data collection is intended to build a trip history for each citizen and monitor those who might have been in contact with COVID-19 patients.But, with millions of people wearing surgical masks, identifying a confirmed or suspected patient using China’s vast network of facial recognition technology isn’t as easy as it once was.

      "CONTENT : Foreign Affairs Minister François-Philippe Champagne on Monday said progress is being made in the continued push for the release of two Canadians detained in China, but wouldn’t say if it’s because of a reported deal for Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou.The Wall Street Journal and Reuters reported last week that a potential deal between the U.S. Department of Justice and Meng’s representatives was in the works, which would allow her to return home to China with a deferred prosecution agreement.Champagne said the federal government won’t comment on pending legal cases, but said Ottawa is following developments in Meng’s case “very closely.”\n",

      "\t\t\t\tTrudeau says detained Canadians ‘top priority’ amid report of possible Meng deal\t\t\t\n",
      "The minister instead highlighted Canada’s efforts to bring the “arbitrary detentions” of Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor to international attention.He pointed to a statement released from this past summer’s bilateral summit between China and the European Union, which mentioned Kovrig and Spavor, as an example of liberal democracies working together to fight against China’s “coercive diplomacy.”“I would say to you, find me other cases which are raised to the extent that the case of Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor have been,” he said.“This case is emblematic of the type of coercive diplomacy we’ve seen. And I think we’re standing up very clearly, very strongly as liberal democracies to say that’s completely unacceptable. They need to be released.”Thursday will mark two years since Kovrig, a former diplomat, and businessman Spavor were arrested and detained in China — just days after Meng’s arrest in Vancouver in December 2018. Beijing has charged the two Canadians with espionage, but officials have still not provided detailed evidence to explain why.Meng, Huawei’s chief financial officer, was arrested on a warrant from the United States on charges of bank fraud over allegations related to U.S. sanctions against Iran that both she and tech giant Huawei deny.Relations between Canada and China immediately soured upon Meng’s arrest and have only worsened as the executive and her lawyers continue to fight extradition to the U.S.\n",

      "China has suggested that Kovrig and Spavor could be freed in exchange for Meng’s release, prompting calls for Canada to end Meng’s extradition to allow for the two men’s release.Champagne said he will continue to work with the U.S., other Five Eyes allies like the United Kingdom, and other countries to push China for the “two Michaels” to be returned to Canada.He would not say if he felt President-elect Joe Biden’s administration would be better partners in that fight than that of outgoing U.S. President Donald Trump, who has been accused of politically interfering in Meng’s case by suggesting she could be used as a bargaining chip in trade negotiations with China.“I think more than ever, this administration and the next administration have realized that the way to face China when it comes to, for example, coercive diplomacy is to work together,” he said.Champagne said ongoing talks with China finally led to resumed consular access to Kovrig and Spavor last month, although restrictions were put in place due to the coronavirus pandemic.The “on-site consular access” meetings saw Canada’s ambassador to China Dominic Barton visit the separate facilities where the men are being detained and talk to them through a camera.“That was a step forward that we wanted to see and … we will continue to insist it be granted,” Champagne said.The minister did not give details on Kovrig and Spavor’s conditions, but said their families are being updated.“Certainly we’re making sure that we do everything we can to ensure their well-being, as we would do for Canadians which are detained abroad,” he said.\n",

      "The zoo had said previously that the decision to send Er Shun and Da Mao home was due to COVID-19 travel restrictions, which had made it more challenging for them to get access to bamboo for the pandas to eat.According to the zoo, 99 per cent of a giant panda’s diet is made up of fresh bamboo, and each adult giant panda consumes approximately 40 kilograms of bamboo daily.In an email to Global News in August, the zoo said the bamboo came from a single supplier on Salt Spring Island, B.C.In the past, the Calgary Zoo said it had worked with alternative bamboo suppliers to find a way to keep the giant pandas fed, but shipments were “slower than acceptable” and resulted in “poor quality bamboo” that the giant pandas wouldn’t eat.The Calgary Zoo is encouraging anyone who wants to stay updated on Er Shun and Da Mao’s journey to check its social media accounts for updates, which will be posted using the hashtag #GetThePandasHome.\n",

      "CONTENT : Canada is failing to combat the spread of Chinese influence that is “alive and well” throughout the country, one prominent student leader says.And she argues the presence of politicians like former Ontario trade minister Michael Chan as a headliner at a rally last week to mobilize the Chinese diaspora against pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong is just another sign of how far Beijing’s influence has spread.READ MORE: YouTube pulls 210 channels linked to Hong Kong protests influence campaign“I’m definitely concerned,” said Chemi Lhamo, president of the student union at the University of Toronto’s Scarborough campus, and a Canadian citizen of Tibetan heritage, in an interview with The West Block‘s Mercedes Stephenson.“These are the folks that are actually implementing the propaganda and amplifying the propaganda that the Chinese state is trying to control.”WATCH: Ottawa has been weak responding to Beijing, expert saysLhamo made headlines earlier this year when her election as student union president prompted a wave of abuse by Chinese trolls who mobilized online to threaten Lhamo’s position, her future — and even her life.“Somehow the international Chinese community came to find out that I was running for the elections, but to be specific, it was more like a Tibetan running for the campaign. When they found out, they immediately released a petition online against me. In addition to that, they took it on social media and they started giving me comments in the thousands from rape threats to death threats — not only to me but my family members,” she said.“There was a pattern in these comments. Everything was talking about Tibet and China.”READ MORE: Over 900 Chinese Twitter, Facebook accounts disabled over ‘deceptive tactics’Those attacks came both from abroad and at home. In some cases, she says she was even told by attackers that they went to school right on her campus.And Lhamo believes what she experienced is part of a broader pattern of Chinese influence spread throughout Canada.“It’s alive and well, and it’s creeping on us in every corner.”Lhamo cited the influence the Chinese government is able to extend through the Confucius Institute, a network of hundreds of centres around the world funded by the Chinese government and branded as educational programs that offer services like Mandarin lessons to students.But critics argue they are in fact a propaganda arm for the Chinese state used as a means to mobilize pro-Beijing actors in their regions.WATCH: How far will China go to impose change in Hong Kong?Last week, the Australian government scrapped Confucius Institutes in that country amid growing fears of the extent of Chinese influence and cited concerns about potential interference and inappropriate influence in its review of the programs.The U.S. Senate’s Homeland Security committee also released a scathing report earlier this year calling for the centres to be shut down.In Canada, CSIS has already issued warnings about Chinese influence across all levels of government in this country and declassified intelligence reports pointed to the creation of the centres as part of China’s plans to exert soft power abroad.But universities and public school systems have continued to sign agreements with the Confucius Institute amid a the backdrop of broader funding cuts for education and increasing demands for services that will prepare students to work in a world with growing Asian power.There continue to be 12 Confucius Institutes across the country, along with regional programming with public school boards, with more than 20,000 students.China has repeatedly said the goal of the centres is simply to teach Mandarin and increase awareness about China.READ MORE: Conservatives want CSIS to investigate John McCallum for election interferenceThe New Brunswick government tried and failed to axe the programs earlier this year over concerns the institute was blacklisting topics that countered the Chinese state’s opinions. The Toronto District School Board also cancelled plans for the programs several years ago.Confucius Institutes and connected programming remain in public schools in Alberta, B.C, and other provinces, as well as numerous university campuses including Ottawa’s Carleton University, the University of Regina, the University of Saskatchewan, Toronto’s Seneca College and the University of Waterloo.Lhamo says without a much stronger stance from the government, Chinese influence will continue to spread.“There is so much more that we can do,” she said, suggesting attention should turn to students studying in Canada, many of whom she suggests are coming under intense pressure from the Chinese government back home to carry out activities abroad that advocate the state line.“Chinese international students are one of the biggest cash cows for universities and academic institutions. It’s time that we take a stance and let them know their human rights record does not reflect international standards.”\n",

      "CONTENT : Canada is an “attractive and permissive target” for Chinese interference that endangers the “foundations of our fundamental institutions, including our system of democracy itself,” according to a recent national security review.The reason, experts suggest, is because China’s Communist Party has won the support of some influential Canadians by using economic carrots and sticks, while public attention on Beijing’s broad campaign is “almost non-existent.”The national security review says “for years Canadian Security Intelligence Service has investigated and reported on the threat” of foreign interference. But unlike Canada’s Western intelligence allies, Ottawa hasn’t responded with strong countermeasures.In an interview, Global News pressed Liberal MP David McGuinty, chair of the national security and intelligence committee, to explain why Canada is “permissive” of China’s methods.McGuinty said he could only answer by citing the report findings because of its sensitivity. He chose to read this quote: “The People’s Republic of China utilizes its growing economic wealth to mobilize interference operations: ‘with deep coffers and the help of western enablers, the Chinese Communist Party uses money, rather than Communist ideology, as a powerful source of influence, creating parasitic relationships of long-term dependence.’”The committee’s report named two countries — Russia and China — among those conducting “sophisticated and pervasive foreign interference activities against Canada.”But intelligence officials and former diplomats, including Canada’s former ambassador to China, believe China is the greater threat, in large part because the country has been successful in “elite capture.”“China is the No. 1 threat to Canada and has been for some time,” David Mulroney, former ambassador to China, said in an interview. China has used its economic leverage to secure “the voices” of political and business leaders in Canada with “sweetheart business deals” and “various inducements,” including lucrative board positions or honours in China, he said. \n",

      "And as a result, Mulroney said he often hears people reciting Beijing’s line on issues such as the extradition case of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou or are silent in the face of China’s mass detention of Uyghurs and incursions on democracy in Hong Kong.“There are people a lot more senior than I was in government, and they have some serious business links with China,” Mulroney said. “China is very willing to weaponize trade and investment to compel people to say what they want them to say.”The argument that Mulroney and experts interviewed by Global News make is not that all Canadian politicians and businesses that have traded with China have been influenced. Rather, they say, Beijing has targeted elites and deftly attempted to interweave the CCP’s interests with Canada’s economic interests, seeking to bend major decisions away from Canada’s democratic values.And they say Canadians should see Hong Kong as a case study.But recent events in the United States, Australia and Canada suggest that pushing back on China’s interference could have consequences. In 2019, China called for the firing of an NBA executive who tweeted support for Hong Kong, using the NBA’s business in China as leverage.And Australia has faced trade sanction threats and was targeted in sophisticated state-based cyberattacks, its government said in June. Australia recently pressed for an international probe of Beijing’s actions in the coronavirus pandemic and Australia’s intelligence experts say China is likely behind the attacks. China denies the accusation. And on Monday, Beijing warned Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to “stop making irresponsible remarks,” according to The Associated Press, after Trudeau told reporters Beijing’s decision to charge Canadians Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor with spying was related to the Meng case. But despite warning signs of China’s incursions, Canadian academics, think tanks and media have been way behind the international curve in scrutinizing China’s “clandestine” tactics, Mulroney said.“Canada is kind of a sleepy and unaware target,” he said. “We don’t have the same kind of vigilance that you now see in places like Australia and New Zealand. That had better change.”China uses a vast network of political, business and media operatives directed from Beijing, known as the United Front, in attempts to co-opt Chinese-Canadian communities and leaders, Mulroney and the experts interviewed by Global News said.In June, Alex Joske, an analyst with the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, released a report aimed at helping international journalists identify and demystify United Front networks. In it, Joske defines the United Front as “the system at the heart of the Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP) efforts to influence foreign politicians, meddle in ethnic Chinese communities and transfer technologies from abroad … it is an exportation of the CCP’s political system (which) undermines social cohesion, exacerbates racial tension, influences politics, harms media integrity, facilitates espionage.”He believes the United Front could be just as active in Canada as it is in Australia, where an alleged United Front leader, billionaire and casino high-roller became a major funder of Australian political parties. An Australian senator also allegedly accepted funds from Chinese agents and touted China’s South China Sea policy against Australia’s position after the billionaire threatened to withdraw a $400,000 political donation. \n",

      "Joske said in order to understand the United Front, people should look at China’s patient campaign to control Hong Kong, where China has used front groups to co-opt political leaders, tycoons and institutions since the 1990s.“Hong Kong is a long way down the track,” Joske said. “But by looking at Hong Kong, you understand how the United Front works.”Joske’s report also underlined the United Front’s mobilization during the COVID-19 pandemic — in Australia, Canada, the U.S. and U.K., Japan, Argentina and the Czech Republic — “to gather increasingly scarce medical supplies from around the world and send them to China.”And based on China’s success using United Front networks during the coronavirus pandemic, Beijing can be expected to ramp up the intensity of its United Front interference worldwide as tensions between China and the world rise in the post-COVID-19 landscape, Joske said. “The CCP’s attempts to interfere in diaspora communities, influence political systems and covertly access valuable and sensitive technology will only grow.”Joske’s report says United Front pioneers such as Premier Zhou Enlai, a CCP revolutionary, said the United Front should use “the legal to mask the illegal,” and the CCP should be “nestling intelligence within the United Front.” And Chinese President Xi Jinping has elevated the United Front’s prominence in Beijing’s global plans.“The United Front … is an important magic weapon for strengthening the party’s ruling position … and an important magic weapon for realizing the China Dream of the Great Rejuvenation of the Chinese Nation,” Xi said in a 2015 speech.But China does not acknowledge the United Front facilitates espionage.Experts describe Beijing as holding out carrots and sticks. And unfortunately, it is Chinese diaspora communities that often face the sticks. According to the Canadian Security Intelligence Service, China uses “a range of tactics including threats, harassment, detention of family members abroad and refusal to issue travel documents or visas.”Chinese-Canadian community leader Gloria Fung, director of democracy advocacy group Canada-Hong Kong Link, says she has seen China’s influence efforts in Canada become increasingly aggressive with both the carrot and the stick.In the 1990s, United Front networks just made passive political donations to all Canadian political parties, Fung said. Now they are aggressively lobbying for Beijing’s policies, covertly offering political funding from Beijing and attempting to promote covert CCP party members for election, Fung claimed.And Fung said she believes China has successfully influenced “many elected officials.”\n",

      "“They could be bribing, offering money or material benefits to targets in the decision-making process,” Fung said. “Many elected officials are offered free tours to China. And many, when they returned, seem to have changed their positions towards China.”Tensions reached a new level in August 2019, Fung said, when Hong Kong Canadians were targeted in anti-democracy counter-protests in a number of Canadian cities. Fung pointed to a Hong Kong democracy counter-rally at Toronto’s Old City Hall on Aug. 17, where she says her group was surrounded by students and middle-aged leaders, who Fung associated with Toronto United Front groups. A similar conflict occurred in Vancouver on Aug. 18 when a pro-China crowd surrounded a church where Hong Kong Canadians were praying. By comparing photos and video of the event with pictures of meetings involving Chinese consulate officials, Global News sources identified several senior members in the crowd as directors of a pro-CCP association, which Chen Yonglin, a defected Chinese diplomat, alleges is a “controlling level” United Front group in Canada.The pro-CCP association is part of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Office, a United Front group that Beijing uses to influence the Chinese diaspora, according to a 2018 report from the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission. “United Front work is Beijing’s strategy to influence overseas Chinese communities, foreign governments and other actors … mainly through economic or financial inducement,” the commission’s chair Robin Cleveland and vice-chair Carolyn Bartholomew told Global News in a statement. “The CCP considers ethnic Chinese everywhere to ultimately be Chinese subjects, regardless of their citizenship, and seeks to treat them as resources to assist in ‘the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation’ whether they like it or not.”\n",

      "A Chinese-Canadian academic ⁠— who is studying Beijing’s influence networks ⁠— agreed with Fung’s assessment of China’s efforts to control community groups.The academic asked to remain anonymous because of fears that officials in Chinese consulates could interfere with their ongoing research.“Many in the Chinese-Canadian diaspora do not want to have anything to do with the Chinese government. But unfortunately, immigrants from China and Hong Kong are not completely free from the government’s control and surveillance,” the academic said.Most experts interviewed by Global News said Australia’s legislative reforms should be a model for other countries combating China’s interference campaigns.In an interview, McGuinty, the intelligence committee chair, said the report underlined how Australia has taken concrete measures since 2018, including adding new offences to its Criminal Code.The report says the new offences “provide a high degree of specificity on offences and threat activities, including on whether the activity was in the planning stages, intentional, reckless or funded by a foreign intelligence service.”The penalties range from 10 to 20 years’ imprisonment. And “the legislation creates a new transparency scheme that prescribes the registration of persons acting as agents of foreign principals and requires regular public disclosures.”In an interview, Mulroney said: “We need to invest in national security and insist on greater transparency.”He said currently, Canadians have no real idea whether influential politicians and businesspersons are acting for China or Canada. And it is extremely difficult to hold Canadian citizens that may be acting against Canadian interests to account under current laws.“What Australia have done is give transparency requirements some legal teeth,” Mulroney said. “And they use their intelligence apparatus to make the case against people that are not transparent. And I think we need to consider these things so Canadians become far more aware of who is speaking for whom.”Gloria Fung agreed.“Legislative tools on corruption and fishy transactions need to be closely monitored and put under Parliament’s radar,” Fung said. “Australia has all kinds of legislative tools to handle political collusion.”McGuinty was asked by Global News to explain the evident gap between Canadian intelligence’s strong warnings of China’s interference and the federal government’s response.McGuinty reiterated that the committee recommendations are bipartisan and straightforward, and the committee purposefully chose Australia as an exemplar to be considered by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government.“We believe the government needs to up its game when it comes to foreign interference,” he said. “There is lots of room for improvement.”But University of B.C. China expert Prof. Paul Evans, who has argued for closer ties with China and published research indicating Canadians are losing confidence “about the role of the United States” in global affairs, told Global News “the discourse of ‘capture’ is especially dangerous.”Evans draws a distinction between influence and “interference activities” and says “it is very difficult to estimate how many such incidents happen in Canada each year.”“My sense is that they are comparatively rare,” Evans wrote in an email response. “It is unproductive to talk about undermining ‘institutions’ without specifying which ones are being discussed.”Evans said it is “dangerous” to rely on Australia’s data and examples of foreign interference, and assume the same kinds and scale of interference activity is occurring in Canada.“We have reached a dangerous phase of our debates about China policy where advocates of engagement, past and present, are being attacked not just for the content of their views and actions but also for their integrity and even loyalty,” Evans wrote. “This is vile terrain and reminiscent of the worst of the McCarthy era and anti-communist actions in the United States in the 1950s.”\n",

      "CONTENT : China has asked Canada to stop exporting meat, over an issue with alleged “forged” certificates, after it said its customs officials detected the drug ractopamine in Canadian pork – which is prohibited in China.Here’s what you need to know about the drug.Ractopamine hydrochloride is an additive put into animal feed. It belongs to a class of drugs called beta-agonists, according to Ben Bohrer, an assistant professor at the University of Guelph, and president of the Canadian Meat Science Association.\n",

      "\t\t\t\tChinese embassy asks Canada to suspend all meat exports over ‘forged certificates’\t\t\t\n",
      "In Canada, ractopamine can be used on pork, cattle and turkeys. Animals that take the drug grow larger and leaner, and take less feed to get there. All this is good for farmers, as they can spend less money to get more meat from their animals.It’s usually used to “finish” animals, getting in some weight gain in the last few weeks before slaughter.\n",

      "“In the livestock production world, that’s really the major goal of most livestock producers: to produce a product that’s efficient,” Bohrer said. “They have low input costs or lower input costs, so they’re consuming less feed, and with less feed, they’re producing meat that’s both larger and leaner.”According to Bohrer, China lumps ractopamine in with other drugs from the beta-agonist family, which have been shown to have effects on human health.“There are some beta-agonist products that have been shown to be very dangerous if they’re consumed,” he said. They mainly affect the cardiovascular system. “It will speed up heart rate, increase anxiety, those types of challenges.”WATCH: China bans all Canadian meat due to forged documents; Ottawa suggests meat wasn’t from CanadaBut Bohrer doesn’t believe that ractopamine should be grouped with some of these other drugs. It has a short “half-life” in the animal, he said. An animal stops getting fed eight to 12 hours before slaughter, he said, and by that time, most traces of the drug would have disappeared from its body.“The feed has already been metabolized and it’s out of the animal’s system, so there’s not high enough levels in the meat residue that will cause any of those types of problems,” he said.\n",

      "The European Union has also banned ractopamine, saying that the safety data isn’t good enough to support a minimum acceptable amount in meat.Bohrer says the drug has been extensively tested and evaluated by U.S. authorities, a process that takes years and costs the drug developer a lot of money to go through.Under an agreement with the U.S., he said, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) has accepted the FDA’s findings and permitted it for use in Canada, subject to certain limits and restrictions on the amount that can be given and when it can be fed to animals.Health Canada said in a statement that it only approves veterinary drugs like ractopamine after “a thorough assessment of scientific evidence demonstrates the safety — including human safety — and effectiveness of the drug.”According to Bohrer, ractopamine is used in a relatively small percentage of Canadian pork.“For the most part, because the export market is so reliant on countries like China, and China has banned the compound, it’s not fed to very many pigs.”He estimates that somewhere between five to 10 per cent of pigs in Canada are fed ractopamine, maybe less, simply because it eliminates the opportunity for export. Around 22 per cent of pork exports, by dollar value, went to China in April 2019, according to Statistics Canada data.WATCH: Canada investigating China’s claims on allegedly forged documents for meat importsThe CFIA has a ractopamine-free certification program for Canadian pork, to help with exports. China is alleging that meat certified under this program contained ractopamine – a claim that Canada’s federal trade minister is now challenging, saying there is no proof.— With files from Jesse Ferreras\n",

A list of controlled items will be published “in a timely manner” in conjunction with relevant departments, according to the law.The new law allows Beijing to retaliate against the U.S., which in recent months has attempted to block Chinese technology firms such as telecommunications gear supplier Huawei, Bytedance’s TikTok app and Tencent’s messaging app WeChat on grounds of posing a national security threat, including the data they may possess from operating in the country.Companies and individuals who endanger national security by breaching the new export control law, including those outside of China, could face criminal charges. Violations of the law, such as exporting items without a permit, could result in fines of 5 million yuan ($746,500), or up to 20 times the business value of the illegal transaction.The new law adds to the growing uncertainty of Bytedance’s deal to sell its video app TikTok to U.S. firm Oracle Corp. In August, China added technologies including voice recognition, text analysis and content recommendation to its list of regulated exports.President Donald Trump had earlier ordered Bytedance to sell its U.S. operations of TikTok to an American firm or face a block in the country.The new export control laws adds to China’s growing regulatory toolkit that allows it to take action against countries such as the U.S.\n",

Deaths from COVID-19 were about 989,000 and there were about 7.5 million active cases, while about 24 million people were listed as recovered.The website also lists individual nations, detailing their COVID-19 case counts including total cases, new cases, total deaths, new deaths, total recoveries and active cases.This is done in descending order, with the nation recording the largest number of coronavirus cases being the United States with a population of 331.5 million and a Worldometer total COVID-19 case count of about 7.2 million, including deaths at about 208,000.READ MORE: How cold air could make the coronavirus spread more easily this winterChina, meanwhile, with a population of 1.44 billion and where the coronavirus pandemic began, is only number 43 on the list of nations with just over 85,000 total cases and about 4,600 recorded deaths.Canada, with our national population of 37.8 million — a fraction of China’s — nevertheless shows at number 26 on the nations’ list with about 150,000 cases and 9,250 deaths.Carry this a few steps further and you’ll find that combining the populations of the five nations immediately leading China on the COVID-19 nations list — Kuwait, Oman, Sweden, UAE and Guatemala — adds up to approximately 47.5 million.Yet Kuwait, with its tiny national population of 4.3 million, records its total COVID-19 cases at just over 102,000, which is some 17,000 higher than China with its 1.44 billion people.READ MORE: Health minister continues defence of China’s handling of coronavirus case dataI have been tracking and tweeting about these numeric disparities for some weeks now and suggesting someone in an official capacity might question Beijing’s reporting.When asked about China’s data earlier this year, Minister of Health Patty Hajdu said asking that question was feeding into “conspiracy theories.”Considering Hajdu’s reaction when China’s actions during the early months of the pandemic were questioned, it should be stated this commentary is not conspiratorial in nature.Roy Green is the host of the Roy Green Show on the Global News Radio network.Subscribe to the Roy Green Show Podcast now at Apple Podcast or Google Play\n",

      "On Thursday, the number of new cases reported by authorities in Hubei spiked to 15,152, mainly because China has changed the way it is counting. That included 13,332 that were diagnosed with doctors’ analyses and lung imaging instead of the previous standard of laboratory testing. Health authorities said the new method would facilitate earlier treatment.Nine more temporary hospitals have opened in gymnasiums and other public buildings, with 6,960 beds in Hubei, the National Health Commission announced. It said 5,606 patients with mild symptoms were being treated. The ruling Communist Party is trying to restore public confidence following complaints leaders in Wuhan suppressed information about the disease. The party faced similar criticism after the 2002-03 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS.The party should “strengthen areas of weakness and close up loopholes” after the epidemic exposed “shortcomings and deficiencies,” President Xi Jinping said at a meeting of party leaders Friday, according to state media.Extended closures of factories and businesses prevented a flood of travel after the Lunar New Year holiday, normally the Chinese industry’s busiest season, officials said at a news conference.Total volume of daily travelers is down 80 per cent from last year, according to a deputy transportation minister, Liu Xiaoming.\n",

      "CONTENT : A whack of documents supplied to some international media over the weekend has provided evidence of China’s attempts to identify westerners — including nearly 4,000 Canadians — who could be attacked through coercive social media or other types of cyber warfare.This shocking revelation, which first appeared in Canada in the Globe and Mail, is a dark complement to research that an Australian think tank published recently about what China is up to in the remote South Pacific. The Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI) provides details of a significant play that China is making to co-opt Kiribati, which is made up of three archipelagos scattered across a swath of sea that is half as wide as Australia.The gambit in Oceania’s backwaters and the activities of a data company with ties to China’s military and intelligence establishments underscores the staggering breadth of Beijing’s global ambitions. It is casting covetous eyes at strategically important specks of land many thousands of kilometres from the Chinese mainland at the same it is burrowing its cyber tentacles deep inside the wealthiest Western countries to probe for vulnerabilities that can be exploited.For those readers unfamiliar with Kiribati (pronounced Kirabas), it is 32 atolls, a coral island and 110,000 souls. It is one of the countries that is most at risk of rising seas caused by global warming and is also in the middle of the world’s biggest untapped tuna fishing grounds.On Tarawa, which is Kiribati’s capital, the U.S. Marine Corps was schooled in 1943 by the Imperial Japanese Army about how much American blood and treasure would have to be expended to expel Emperor Hirohito’s troops from atolls and islands stretching across much of the Pacific.China’s Kiribati stratagem is eerily reminiscent of Japan’s pre-war manoeuvering in the South Pacific. The main goal then as now would appear to be to control vital shipping lanes between the U.S. and Australia and New Zealand and threaten the U.S.’s Pacific possessions.\n",

      "Less than one year after Kiribati switched its diplomatic relations from Taiwan to China, Beijing has offered to dredge lagoons to enlarge some atolls. If that sounds familiar, it is because the same Chinese equipment and work crews converted at least seven Filipino and Vietnamese-claimed outcroppings in the South China Sea into “Chinese islands” bristling with missiles, radar systems, ammunition and fuel dumps, and airfields capable of handling fighter jets and the biggest military transports.Not forgotten in Washington is that only five years earlier, President Xi Jinping had pledged China had no intention to militarize the atolls.Plans for Kiribati include building two major ports in the middle of the empty southern ocean. There would be little obvious advantage for Kiribati to have such ports, though building one of them on Kiritimati, which used to be called Christmas Island, could be a strategic nightmare for the Americans because that atoll is less than 2,000 kilometres away from Pearl Harbor which, as in the Second World War, is the U.S. navy’s crown jewel in the Pacific.China already can use an old U.S. satellite tracking facility in Kiribati. It is trying to further develop relations with an island in French Polynesia where it is building a $2-billion fish farm near a deep water harbour and a disused military airfield.Canada already has a lot on its plate in trying to maintain what’s left of its shaky relationship with China, which has been poisoned by the Meng Wanzhou-Huawei extradition dispute, the subsequent kidnapping by China of the “two Michaels” and sharp questions in Canada about whether some of the many Mainland Chinese students attending university here spy for the Chinese military or for government-controlled companies.Though Ottawa remains more reluctant to do or say anything to upset China than most of its Asian and European allies, to maintain its self-respect it must do more than just wag a finger at Beijing since it was revealed that it was tracking many Canadians, including Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s daughter and some leading bureaucrats, businessmen and criminals. Though the U.S. and Australia clearly must lead in ensuring Kiribati’s future security and well-being, Canada could play a modest role, too.\n",

      "On one of its biannual Pacific patrols, the Royal Canadian Navy could send a frigate to Kiribati on a goodwill visit. Canada could also burnish its vaunted green credentials by providing funding and technical assistance to the impoverished island statelet to help it manage the potentially existential effects of global warming. Citing anonymous government sources, the Toronto Star floated the idea last week that a major shift in Canada’s Indo-Pacific policy was in the works.Canadian diplomats tell me that they have been asked to develop what is being described as an Asian policy. However, planning is still at such an early, initial stage that nothing will be ready for the government’s consideration for many months and quite probably not before the next federal election, should it take place any time between next week’s Throne Speech and next spring.The sudden disclosure of preliminary discussions about a change in direction could be a reaction to a series of recent polls that show a large majority of Canadians want much less to do with China than the government does, and/or a response to Conservative Leader Erin O’Toole’s recent pledge to counter China’s ugly behaviour by seeking stronger partnerships with other countries in the Indo-Pacific.With China up to no good in many different places, including India, Australia, the South China Sea, the East China Sea, Japan, stifling free speech and human rights in Hong Kong and Muslim Xinjiang, and now demonstrably tracking thousands of Canadians citizens, the world has become wide awake to this growing danger.Ottawa must respond to Beijing’s many provocations with more than words of disappointment because along with climate change, what to do about China will likely be the defining challenge of the 21st century.Matthew Fisher is an international affairs columnist and foreign correspondent who has worked abroad for 35 years.

It said Beijing “exploits United States investors” to finance military development by selling securities in American and foreign financial markets.The order bars American investors from conducting any transactions in publicly traded securities issued by any Chinese companies designated by the secretary of defense as being linked to the Communist Party’s military wing, the People’s Liberation Army.The Pentagon earlier designated 31 companies as being owned or controlled by the Chinese military.

      "However, the concept of how “strategic” should be defined remains a key question and one MPs should try to define more clearly as they recommend how the government should move forward, experts said.“We’re not here to make China any favours. We especially shouldn’t at this time. But some investments might still be in the interests of both and we should cautiously pursue those while restricting others,” said Daniel Schwanen, vice president of research at the C.D. Howe Institute, before the committee.“Maybe this crisis is an opportunity for us to ask, what is strategic? What is national security? And maybe have a broader view of what that entails.”The uncertainty of the coronavirus pandemic has wrought economic turmoil as countries around the world have put their citizens under months of lockdowns and struggled to craft policies that will keep their economies from collapsing under the chaos.[ Sign up for our Health IQ newsletter for the latest coronavirus updates ]That impact has hit across economic sectors, roiling stock markets and leaving even large companies strapped for cash and rolling out massive layoffs.All of that uncertainty has prompted fears that Canadian businesses, particularly those deemed critical or strategic for national interests, could become attractive targets for hostile foreign takeovers.The Canadian Security Intelligence Service warned about exactly that in its most recent annual report.The agency said that while many foreign investors are not hostile, those from state-owned enterprises and firms with close ties to governments or intelligence services need to be weighed very carefully.“Corporate acquisitions by these entities pose potential risks related to vulnerabilities in critical infrastructure, control over strategic sectors, espionage and foreign influenced activities, and illegal transfer of technology and expertise,” the report stated.“As difficult as it is to measure, this damage to our collective prosperity is very real.”Foreign takeovers of Canadian businesses are evaluated under the Investment Canada Act, which weighs the “net benefits” of proposed takeovers with an eye to things like potential jobs versus potential risks.To weigh those risks, national security agencies like CSIS and the RCMP can share their concerns with the government and when the federal cabinet shares those concerns, it can block takeovers.Effectively, it forces officials to ask the question: jobs might be created, but at what cost?\n",

      "Those new rules said the government will put under extra scrutiny “foreign direct investments of any value, controlling or non-controlling, in Canadian businesses that are related to public health or involved in the supply of critical goods and services to Canadians or to the government.”As well, those extra screenings will also apply to “all foreign investments by state-owned investors, regardless of their value, or private investors assessed as being closely tied to or subject to direction from foreign governments.”“Some investments into Canada by state-owned enterprises may be motivated by non-commercial imperatives that could harm Canada’s economic or national security interests, a risk that is amplified in the current context,” the notice of the rules stated.Patrick Leblond, an associate professor of international politics with the University of Ottawa, told the committee that while there’s room to “improve the process,” there are also reasons to be cautious about making any rule changes more permanent.“If we’re constantly changing the rules of the game, we may not be able to have the right investors that will build a competitive business environment and that could slow down economic growth,” he said.“I think the Act is strong enough as it is right now with the current guidelines.”Finance Minister Bill Morneau has not yet committed to keeping the tougher rules in place.They are currently set to last “until the economy recovers from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.”\n",

      "CONTENT : Canada is an “attractive and permissive target” for Chinese interference that endangers the “foundations of our fundamental institutions, including our system of democracy itself,” according to a recent national security review.The reason, experts suggest, is because China’s Communist Party has won the support of some influential Canadians by using economic carrots and sticks, while public attention on Beijing’s broad campaign is “almost non-existent.”The national security review says “for years Canadian Security Intelligence Service has investigated and reported on the threat” of foreign interference. But unlike Canada’s Western intelligence allies, Ottawa hasn’t responded with strong countermeasures.In an interview, Global News pressed Liberal MP David McGuinty, chair of the national security and intelligence committee, to explain why Canada is “permissive” of China’s methods.McGuinty said he could only answer by citing the report findings because of its sensitivity. He chose to read this quote: “The People’s Republic of China utilizes its growing economic wealth to mobilize interference operations: ‘with deep coffers and the help of western enablers, the Chinese Communist Party uses money, rather than Communist ideology, as a powerful source of influence, creating parasitic relationships of long-term dependence.’”The committee’s report named two countries — Russia and China — among those conducting “sophisticated and pervasive foreign interference activities against Canada.”But intelligence officials and former diplomats, including Canada’s former ambassador to China, believe China is the greater threat, in large part because the country has been successful in “elite capture.”“China is the No. 1 threat to Canada and has been for some time,” David Mulroney, former ambassador to China, said in an interview. China has used its economic leverage to secure “the voices” of political and business leaders in Canada with “sweetheart business deals” and “various inducements,” including lucrative board positions or honours in China, he said. \n",
      "READ MORE: \n",
      "\t\t\t\tUnited Front groups in Canada helped Beijing stockpile coronavirus safety supplies\t\t\t\n",
      "And as a result, Mulroney said he often hears people reciting Beijing’s line on issues such as the extradition case of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou or are silent in the face of China’s mass detention of Uyghurs and incursions on democracy in Hong Kong.“There are people a lot more senior than I was in government, and they have some serious business links with China,” Mulroney said. “China is very willing to weaponize trade and investment to compel people to say what they want them to say.”The argument that Mulroney and experts interviewed by Global News make is not that all Canadian politicians and businesses that have traded with China have been influenced. Rather, they say, Beijing has targeted elites and deftly attempted to interweave the CCP’s interests with Canada’s economic interests, seeking to bend major decisions away from Canada’s democratic values.And they say Canadians should see Hong Kong as a case study.But recent events in the United States, Australia and Canada suggest that pushing back on China’s interference could have consequences. In 2019, China called for the firing of an NBA executive who tweeted support for Hong Kong, using the NBA’s business in China as leverage.And Australia has faced trade sanction threats and was targeted in sophisticated state-based cyberattacks, its government said in June. Australia recently pressed for an international probe of Beijing’s actions in the coronavirus pandemic and Australia’s intelligence experts say China is likely behind the attacks. China denies the accusation. And on Monday, Beijing warned Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to “stop making irresponsible remarks,” according to The Associated Press, after Trudeau told reporters Beijing’s decision to charge Canadians Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor with spying was related to the Meng case. But despite warning signs of China’s incursions, Canadian academics, think tanks and media have been way behind the international curve in scrutinizing China’s “clandestine” tactics, Mulroney said.“Canada is kind of a sleepy and unaware target,” he said. “We don’t have the same kind of vigilance that you now see in places like Australia and New Zealand. That had better change.”China uses a vast network of political, business and media operatives directed from Beijing, known as the United Front, in attempts to co-opt Chinese-Canadian communities and leaders, Mulroney and the experts interviewed by Global News said.In June, Alex Joske, an analyst with the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, released a report aimed at helping international journalists identify and demystify United Front networks. In it, Joske defines the United Front as “the system at the heart of the Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP) efforts to influence foreign politicians, meddle in ethnic Chinese communities and transfer technologies from abroad … it is an exportation of the CCP’s political system (which) undermines social cohesion, exacerbates racial tension, influences politics, harms media integrity, facilitates espionage.”He believes the United Front could be just as active in Canada as it is in Australia, where an alleged United Front leader, billionaire and casino high-roller became a major funder of Australian political parties. An Australian senator also allegedly accepted funds from Chinese agents and touted China’s South China Sea policy against Australia’s position after the billionaire threatened to withdraw a $400,000 political donation. \n",

      "\t\t\t\tChinese-Canadians ‘suffering in silence’ as China’s United Front reaches into Canada\t\t\t\n",
      "Joske said in order to understand the United Front, people should look at China’s patient campaign to control Hong Kong, where China has used front groups to co-opt political leaders, tycoons and institutions since the 1990s.“Hong Kong is a long way down the track,” Joske said. “But by looking at Hong Kong, you understand how the United Front works.”Joske’s report also underlined the United Front’s mobilization during the COVID-19 pandemic — in Australia, Canada, the U.S. and U.K., Japan, Argentina and the Czech Republic — “to gather increasingly scarce medical supplies from around the world and send them to China.”And based on China’s success using United Front networks during the coronavirus pandemic, Beijing can be expected to ramp up the intensity of its United Front interference worldwide as tensions between China and the world rise in the post-COVID-19 landscape, Joske said. “The CCP’s attempts to interfere in diaspora communities, influence political systems and covertly access valuable and sensitive technology will only grow.”Joske’s report says United Front pioneers such as Premier Zhou Enlai, a CCP revolutionary, said the United Front should use “the legal to mask the illegal,” and the CCP should be “nestling intelligence within the United Front.” And Chinese President Xi Jinping has elevated the United Front’s prominence in Beijing’s global plans.“The United Front … is an important magic weapon for strengthening the party’s ruling position … and an important magic weapon for realizing the China Dream of the Great Rejuvenation of the Chinese Nation,” Xi said in a 2015 speech.But China does not acknowledge the United Front facilitates espionage.Experts describe Beijing as holding out carrots and sticks. And unfortunately, it is Chinese diaspora communities that often face the sticks. According to the Canadian Security Intelligence Service, China uses “a range of tactics including threats, harassment, detention of family members abroad and refusal to issue travel documents or visas.”Chinese-Canadian community leader Gloria Fung, director of democracy advocacy group Canada-Hong Kong Link, says she has seen China’s influence efforts in Canada become increasingly aggressive with both the carrot and the stick.In the 1990s, United Front networks just made passive political donations to all Canadian political parties, Fung said. Now they are aggressively lobbying for Beijing’s policies, covertly offering political funding from Beijing and attempting to promote covert CCP party members for election, Fung claimed.And Fung said she believes China has successfully influenced “many elected officials.”\n",

      "“They could be bribing, offering money or material benefits to targets in the decision-making process,” Fung said. “Many elected officials are offered free tours to China. And many, when they returned, seem to have changed their positions towards China.”Tensions reached a new level in August 2019, Fung said, when Hong Kong Canadians were targeted in anti-democracy counter-protests in a number of Canadian cities. Fung pointed to a Hong Kong democracy counter-rally at Toronto’s Old City Hall on Aug. 17, where she says her group was surrounded by students and middle-aged leaders, who Fung associated with Toronto United Front groups. A similar conflict occurred in Vancouver on Aug. 18 when a pro-China crowd surrounded a church where Hong Kong Canadians were praying. By comparing photos and video of the event with pictures of meetings involving Chinese consulate officials, Global News sources identified several senior members in the crowd as directors of a pro-CCP association, which Chen Yonglin, a defected Chinese diplomat, alleges is a “controlling level” United Front group in Canada.The pro-CCP association is part of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Office, a United Front group that Beijing uses to influence the Chinese diaspora, according to a 2018 report from the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission. “United Front work is Beijing’s strategy to influence overseas Chinese communities, foreign governments and other actors … mainly through economic or financial inducement,” the commission’s chair Robin Cleveland and vice-chair Carolyn Bartholomew told Global News in a statement. “The CCP considers ethnic Chinese everywhere to ultimately be Chinese subjects, regardless of their citizenship, and seeks to treat them as resources to assist in ‘the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation’ whether they like it or not.”\n",

      "A Chinese-Canadian academic ⁠— who is studying Beijing’s influence networks ⁠— agreed with Fung’s assessment of China’s efforts to control community groups.The academic asked to remain anonymous because of fears that officials in Chinese consulates could interfere with their ongoing research.“Many in the Chinese-Canadian diaspora do not want to have anything to do with the Chinese government. But unfortunately, immigrants from China and Hong Kong are not completely free from the government’s control and surveillance,” the academic said.Most experts interviewed by Global News said Australia’s legislative reforms should be a model for other countries combating China’s interference campaigns.In an interview, McGuinty, the intelligence committee chair, said the report underlined how Australia has taken concrete measures since 2018, including adding new offences to its Criminal Code.The report says the new offences “provide a high degree of specificity on offences and threat activities, including on whether the activity was in the planning stages, intentional, reckless or funded by a foreign intelligence service.”The penalties range from 10 to 20 years’ imprisonment. And “the legislation creates a new transparency scheme that prescribes the registration of persons acting as agents of foreign principals and requires regular public disclosures.”In an interview, Mulroney said: “We need to invest in national security and insist on greater transparency.”He said currently, Canadians have no real idea whether influential politicians and businesspersons are acting for China or Canada. And it is extremely difficult to hold Canadian citizens that may be acting against Canadian interests to account under current laws.“What Australia have done is give transparency requirements some legal teeth,” Mulroney said. “And they use their intelligence apparatus to make the case against people that are not transparent. And I think we need to consider these things so Canadians become far more aware of who is speaking for whom.”Gloria Fung agreed.“Legislative tools on corruption and fishy transactions need to be closely monitored and put under Parliament’s radar,” Fung said. “Australia has all kinds of legislative tools to handle political collusion.”McGuinty was asked by Global News to explain the evident gap between Canadian intelligence’s strong warnings of China’s interference and the federal government’s response.McGuinty reiterated that the committee recommendations are bipartisan and straightforward, and the committee purposefully chose Australia as an exemplar to be considered by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government.“We believe the government needs to up its game when it comes to foreign interference,” he said. “There is lots of room for improvement.”But University of B.C. China expert Prof. Paul Evans, who has argued for closer ties with China and published research indicating Canadians are losing confidence “about the role of the United States” in global affairs, told Global News “the discourse of ‘capture’ is especially dangerous.”Evans draws a distinction between influence and “interference activities” and says “it is very difficult to estimate how many such incidents happen in Canada each year.”“My sense is that they are comparatively rare,” Evans wrote in an email response. “It is unproductive to talk about undermining ‘institutions’ without specifying which ones are being discussed.”Evans said it is “dangerous” to rely on Australia’s data and examples of foreign interference, and assume the same kinds and scale of interference activity is occurring in Canada.“We have reached a dangerous phase of our debates about China policy where advocates of engagement, past and present, are being attacked not just for the content of their views and actions but also for their integrity and even loyalty,” Evans wrote. “This is vile terrain and reminiscent of the worst of the McCarthy era and anti-communist actions in the United States in the 1950s.”\n",

      "CONTENT : Foreign Affairs Minister François-Philippe Champagne on Monday said progress is being made in the continued push for the release of two Canadians detained in China, but wouldn’t say if it’s because of a reported deal for Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou.The Wall Street Journal and Reuters reported last week that a potential deal between the U.S. Department of Justice and Meng’s representatives was in the works, which would allow her to return home to China with a deferred prosecution agreement.Champagne said the federal government won’t comment on pending legal cases, but said Ottawa is following developments in Meng’s case “very closely.”\n",

      "The minister instead highlighted Canada’s efforts to bring the “arbitrary detentions” of Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor to international attention.He pointed to a statement released from this past summer’s bilateral summit between China and the European Union, which mentioned Kovrig and Spavor, as an example of liberal democracies working together to fight against China’s “coercive diplomacy.”“I would say to you, find me other cases which are raised to the extent that the case of Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor have been,” he said.“This case is emblematic of the type of coercive diplomacy we’ve seen. And I think we’re standing up very clearly, very strongly as liberal democracies to say that’s completely unacceptable. They need to be released.”Thursday will mark two years since Kovrig, a former diplomat, and businessman Spavor were arrested and detained in China — just days after Meng’s arrest in Vancouver in December 2018. Beijing has charged the two Canadians with espionage, but officials have still not provided detailed evidence to explain why.Meng, Huawei’s chief financial officer, was arrested on a warrant from the United States on charges of bank fraud over allegations related to U.S. sanctions against Iran that both she and tech giant Huawei deny.Relations between Canada and China immediately soured upon Meng’s arrest and have only worsened as the executive and her lawyers continue to fight extradition to the U.S.\n",

      "China has suggested that Kovrig and Spavor could be freed in exchange for Meng’s release, prompting calls for Canada to end Meng’s extradition to allow for the two men’s release.Champagne said he will continue to work with the U.S., other Five Eyes allies like the United Kingdom, and other countries to push China for the “two Michaels” to be returned to Canada.He would not say if he felt President-elect Joe Biden’s administration would be better partners in that fight than that of outgoing U.S. President Donald Trump, who has been accused of politically interfering in Meng’s case by suggesting she could be used as a bargaining chip in trade negotiations with China.“I think more than ever, this administration and the next administration have realized that the way to face China when it comes to, for example, coercive diplomacy is to work together,” he said.Champagne said ongoing talks with China finally led to resumed consular access to Kovrig and Spavor last month, although restrictions were put in place due to the coronavirus pandemic.The “on-site consular access” meetings saw Canada’s ambassador to China Dominic Barton visit the separate facilities where the men are being detained and talk to them through a camera.“That was a step forward that we wanted to see and … we will continue to insist it be granted,” Champagne said.The minister did not give details on Kovrig and Spavor’s conditions, but said their families are being updated.“Certainly we’re making sure that we do everything we can to ensure their well-being, as we would do for Canadians which are detained abroad,” he said.\n",

      "CONTENT : A whack of documents supplied to some international media over the weekend has provided evidence of China’s attempts to identify westerners — including nearly 4,000 Canadians — who could be attacked through coercive social media or other types of cyber warfare.This shocking revelation, which first appeared in Canada in the Globe and Mail, is a dark complement to research that an Australian think tank published recently about what China is up to in the remote South Pacific. The Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI) provides details of a significant play that China is making to co-opt Kiribati, which is made up of three archipelagos scattered across a swath of sea that is half as wide as Australia.The gambit in Oceania’s backwaters and the activities of a data company with ties to China’s military and intelligence establishments underscores the staggering breadth of Beijing’s global ambitions. It is casting covetous eyes at strategically important specks of land many thousands of kilometres from the Chinese mainland at the same it is burrowing its cyber tentacles deep inside the wealthiest Western countries to probe for vulnerabilities that can be exploited.For those readers unfamiliar with Kiribati (pronounced Kirabas), it is 32 atolls, a coral island and 110,000 souls. It is one of the countries that is most at risk of rising seas caused by global warming and is also in the middle of the world’s biggest untapped tuna fishing grounds.On Tarawa, which is Kiribati’s capital, the U.S. Marine Corps was schooled in 1943 by the Imperial Japanese Army about how much American blood and treasure would have to be expended to expel Emperor Hirohito’s troops from atolls and islands stretching across much of the Pacific.China’s Kiribati stratagem is eerily reminiscent of Japan’s pre-war manoeuvering in the South Pacific. The main goal then as now would appear to be to control vital shipping lanes between the U.S. and Australia and New Zealand and threaten the U.S.’s Pacific possessions.\n",

      "Less than one year after Kiribati switched its diplomatic relations from Taiwan to China, Beijing has offered to dredge lagoons to enlarge some atolls. If that sounds familiar, it is because the same Chinese equipment and work crews converted at least seven Filipino and Vietnamese-claimed outcroppings in the South China Sea into “Chinese islands” bristling with missiles, radar systems, ammunition and fuel dumps, and airfields capable of handling fighter jets and the biggest military transports.Not forgotten in Washington is that only five years earlier, President Xi Jinping had pledged China had no intention to militarize the atolls.Plans for Kiribati include building two major ports in the middle of the empty southern ocean. There would be little obvious advantage for Kiribati to have such ports, though building one of them on Kiritimati, which used to be called Christmas Island, could be a strategic nightmare for the Americans because that atoll is less than 2,000 kilometres away from Pearl Harbor which, as in the Second World War, is the U.S. navy’s crown jewel in the Pacific.China already can use an old U.S. satellite tracking facility in Kiribati. It is trying to further develop relations with an island in French Polynesia where it is building a $2-billion fish farm near a deep water harbour and a disused military airfield.Canada already has a lot on its plate in trying to maintain what’s left of its shaky relationship with China, which has been poisoned by the Meng Wanzhou-Huawei extradition dispute, the subsequent kidnapping by China of the “two Michaels” and sharp questions in Canada about whether some of the many Mainland Chinese students attending university here spy for the Chinese military or for government-controlled companies.Though Ottawa remains more reluctant to do or say anything to upset China than most of its Asian and European allies, to maintain its self-respect it must do more than just wag a finger at Beijing since it was revealed that it was tracking many Canadians, including Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s daughter and some leading bureaucrats, businessmen and criminals. Though the U.S. and Australia clearly must lead in ensuring Kiribati’s future security and well-being, Canada could play a modest role, too.\n",

      "On one of its biannual Pacific patrols, the Royal Canadian Navy could send a frigate to Kiribati on a goodwill visit. Canada could also burnish its vaunted green credentials by providing funding and technical assistance to the impoverished island statelet to help it manage the potentially existential effects of global warming. Citing anonymous government sources, the Toronto Star floated the idea last week that a major shift in Canada’s Indo-Pacific policy was in the works.Canadian diplomats tell me that they have been asked to develop what is being described as an Asian policy. However, planning is still at such an early, initial stage that nothing will be ready for the government’s consideration for many months and quite probably not before the next federal election, should it take place any time between next week’s Throne Speech and next spring.The sudden disclosure of preliminary discussions about a change in direction could be a reaction to a series of recent polls that show a large majority of Canadians want much less to do with China than the government does, and/or a response to Conservative Leader Erin O’Toole’s recent pledge to counter China’s ugly behaviour by seeking stronger partnerships with other countries in the Indo-Pacific.With China up to no good in many different places, including India, Australia, the South China Sea, the East China Sea, Japan, stifling free speech and human rights in Hong Kong and Muslim Xinjiang, and now demonstrably tracking thousands of Canadians citizens, the world has become wide awake to this growing danger.Ottawa must respond to Beijing’s many provocations with more than words of disappointment because along with climate change, what to do about China will likely be the defining challenge of the 21st century.Matthew Fisher is an international affairs columnist and foreign correspondent who has worked abroad for 35 years.

      "The Chinese Communist Party encouraged citizens to visit tourist destinations for Golden Week. Tickets sold out quickly at many destinations, with capacity capped at 75 per cent.Photos captured from the iconic Great Wall of China show large crowds swarming over the tourist destination in scenes that might make North Americans cringe.Most are tourists pictured in masks, but it’s not hard to pick out plenty of people who do not have their faces covered.The images offer a potential glimpse into a post-pandemic future — or a snapshot of impending disaster, depending on how the next few weeks play out.COVID-19 remains a threat but China claims to have largely curbed the spread of the disease, and has spent the last several months carefully reopening tourist spots under enhanced safety measures. The city of Wuhan, for example, went back to hosting parties and large events this summer, in a startling turnaround for the suspected origin point of the virus.The Great Wall of China partially reopened back in late March, sparking concern from other parts of the world where people were still under lockdown.Golden Week started on Oct. 1 and runs until Oct. 8. Chinese citizens often plan family travel during the holiday week, but they’ve been forced to stay closer to home due to the global pandemic.China claims to have near-zero local transmission rates, even as other parts of the world fight to control the virus.\n",

Source: https://t.co/a5vbXcTijb pic.twitter.com/7oRLNegDNK— Andrew Jones (@AJ_FI) July 23, 2020It marked the second flight to Mars this week, after a United Arab Emirates orbiter blasted off on a rocket from Japan on Monday. And the U.S. is aiming to launch Perseverance, its most sophisticated Mars rover ever, from Cape Canaveral, Florida, next week.China’s tandem spacecraft — with both an orbiter and a rover — will take seven months to reach Mars, like the others. If all goes well, Tianwen-1, or “quest for heavenly truth,” will look for underground water, if it’s present, as well as evidence of possible ancient life.This isn’t China’s first attempt at Mars. In 2011, a Chinese orbiter accompanying a Russian mission was lost when the spacecraft failed to get out of Earth’s orbit after launching from Kazakhstan, eventually burning up in the atmosphere.This time, China is going at it alone. It also is fast-tracking, launching an orbiter and rover on the same mission instead of stringing them out.China’s secretive space program has developed rapidly in recent decades. Yang Liwei became the first Chinese astronaut in 2003, and last year, Chang’e-4 became the first spacecraft from any country to land on the far side of the moon.\n",

      "Conquering Mars would put China in an elite club.“There is a whole lot of prestige riding on this,” said Dean Cheng, an expert on Chinese aerospace programs at the Heritage Foundation in Washington.Landing on Mars is notoriously difficult. Only the U.S. has successfully landed a spacecraft on Martian soil, doing it eight times since 1976. NASA’s InSight and Curiosity rovers still operate today. Six other spacecraft are exploring Mars from orbit: three American, two European and one from India.Unlike the two other Mars missions launching this month, China has tightly controlled information about the program — even withholding any name for its rover. National security concerns led the U.S. to curb cooperation between NASA and China’s space program.In an article published earlier this month in Nature Astronomy, mission chief engineer Wan Weixing said Tianwen-1 would slip into orbit around Mars in February and look for a landing site on Utopia Planitia — a plain where NASA has detected possible evidence of underground ice. Wan died in May from cancer.The landing would then be attempted in April or May, according to the article. If all goes well, the 240-kilogram (530-pound) golf cart-sized, solar-powered rover is expected to operate for about three months, and the orbiter for two years.\n",

      "Though small compared to America’s hulking, car-sized 1,025-kilogram (2,260-pound) Perseverance, it’s almost twice as big as the two rovers China has sent to the moon in 2013 and 2019. Perseverance is expected to operate for at least two years.This Mars-launching season — which occurs every 26 months when Earth and Mars are at their closest — is especially busy.The UAE spacecraft Amal, or Hope, which will orbit Mars but not land, is the Arab world’s first interplanetary mission. NASA’s Perseverance rover is up next.“At no other time in our history have we seen anything like what is unfolding with these three unique missions to Mars. Each of them is a science and engineering marvel,” the Space Foundation’s chief executive officer Thomas Zelibor said in an online panel discussion earlier this week.China’s road to Mars hit a few bumps: A Long March-5 rocket, nicknamed “Fat 5” because of its bulky shape, failed to launch earlier this year. The coronavirus pandemic forced scientists to work from home. In March, when instruments needed to be transported from Beijing to Shanghai, three team members drove 12 hours to deliver them.While China is joining the U.S., Russia and Europe in creating a satellite-based global navigation system, experts say it isn’t trying to overtake the U.S. lead in space exploration.Instead, Cheng of the Heritage Foundation said China is in a “slow race” with Japan and India to establish itself as Asia’s space power.Ghosal reported from New Delhi.\n",

      "Many other countries, including the United States, are coordinating closely with the private sector to try to win the vaccine development race, and China faces many challenges.Its success in driving down COVID-19 infections makes it harder to conduct large-scale vaccine trials, and so far only a few other countries have agreed to work with it. After past vaccine scandals, Beijing will also have to convince the world it has met all safety and quality requirements.But China’s use of command economy-type tools is so far yielding results.A state-controlled entity, for example, completed two vaccine plants at what it called the “wartime speed” of a couple of months, while state-owned enterprises and the military have allowed experimental shots to be used on staff.The People’s Liberation Army’s (PLA) medical research unit, which has been a driving force in China’s efforts to fight infectious diseases, is also working with private firms including CanSino to develop COVID-19 vaccines.Challenging the West’s traditional dominance of the industry, China is behind eight of the 19 vaccine candidates in human trials, with Sinovac’s experimental shot and one jointly developed by the military and CanSino among the front runners.It is also focused mainly on inactivated vaccine technology – a technology that is well known and has been used to make vaccines against diseases such as influenza and measles – something which could raise the chances of success.By contrast, several Western rivals such as U.S.-based Moderna and Germany’s CureVac and BioNTech are using a new technology called messenger RNA that has never before yielded a product approved by regulators.“It’s a tried and true strategy,” said Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, about inactivated vaccine technology.“If I had to pick a vaccine that I think would be the most likely to be safe and effective, it would be that one,” he said. Offit is also co-inventor of the rotavirus vaccine, RotaTeq, manufactured by Merck & Co Inc.\n",

      "Four of the Chinese candidates in human trials are inactivated vaccines, including Sinovac’s and two vaccines from China National Biotec Group (CNBG), a unit of state-owned China National Pharmaceutical Group (Sinopharm).There are currently only two experimental COVID-19 vaccines in final Phase III trials – one from Sinopharm and another from AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford. Sinovac’s is set to become the third later this month.To speed up the process, China allowed Sinopharm and Sinovac to combine Phase I and Phase II trials for their vaccine candidates.For CanSino’s experimental vaccine, the PLA research institute played a key role, with the two working on a method using an adenovirus – a similar approach to AstraZeneca’s.The PLA has its own approval process for “military specifically-needed drugs,” and approved the military use of the candidate developed by its research unit and CanSino last month.PLA lead scientist Chen Wei, who has been the face of its vaccine development effort, was among the first to take the experimental COVID-19 shot developed by her team, as well as its potential SARS treatment years before, according to state media.China has challenges, though, as the epidemic has petered out in the country, hampering efforts to conduct large trials.It has since shifted its focus overseas, but only a handful of countries have shown willingness to collaborate – UAE, Canada, Brazil, Indonesia and Mexico. Neither major European countries nor the United States have shown interest in China’s COVID-19 vaccines as they focus on their own projects.\n",

Trudeau said it was due to congestion at the Shanghai airport and strict limits on time crews spend on the ground. A spokesman for the Chinese foreign ministry then said that was “inaccurate.”Canada is heavily reliant on China for securing enough personal protective equipment for health-care workers in the COVID-19 pandemic. It has set up a special supply chain system in Shanghai to secure the products in what Freeland has referred to as the “Wild West” of medical supplies.\n",

      "Millions of N95 masks, surgical masks, gowns, swabs for COVID-19 tests, and other equipment have arrived in Canada from China already, and many have passed muster.But on more than one occasion, in both Canada and elsewhere, including Finland, the Netherlands and Spain, Chinese-made products were returned when they failed to meet national standards. In addition to the N95 masks, Canada rejected a shipment of swabs for use in COVID-19 tests from China because they were mouldy.N95 masks are so-named because they are supposed to protect against 95 per cent of small particles. Bill Matthews, the deputy minister for Public Services and Procurement told a House of Commons committee on April 24 the problem was mainly with the elastics that are used to secure the masks, not the filtration. He said it was possible they might be able to be used by workers not directly in contact with COVID-19 patients.Matthews said the two companies involved in both the masks and the swabs were standing by their product and intended to make things right, but it is not clear whether those masks were replaced or if they were sent to other health-care workers.\n",

The city of Wuhan, for example, went back to hosting parties and large events this summer, in a startling turnaround for the suspected origin point of the virus.The Great Wall of China partially reopened back in late March, sparking concern from other parts of the world where people were still under lockdown.Golden Week started on Oct. 1 and runs until Oct. 8.

Source: https://t.co/a5vbXcTijb pic.twitter.com/7oRLNegDNK— Andrew Jones (@AJ_FI) July 23, 2020It marked the second flight to Mars this week, after a United Arab Emirates orbiter blasted off on a rocket from Japan on Monday. And the U.S. is aiming to launch Perseverance, its most sophisticated Mars rover ever, from Cape Canaveral, Florida, next week.China’s tandem spacecraft — with both an orbiter and a rover — will take seven months to reach Mars, like the others. If all goes well, Tianwen-1, or “quest for heavenly truth,” will look for underground water, if it’s present, as well as evidence of possible ancient life.This isn’t China’s first attempt at Mars. In 2011, a Chinese orbiter accompanying a Russian mission was lost when the spacecraft failed to get out of Earth’s orbit after launching from Kazakhstan, eventually burning up in the atmosphere.This time, China is going at it alone. It also is fast-tracking, launching an orbiter and rover on the same mission instead of stringing them out.China’s secretive space program has developed rapidly in recent decades. Yang Liwei became the first Chinese astronaut in 2003, and last year, Chang’e-4 became the first spacecraft from any country to land on the far side of the moon.\n",

      "Conquering Mars would put China in an elite club.“There is a whole lot of prestige riding on this,” said Dean Cheng, an expert on Chinese aerospace programs at the Heritage Foundation in Washington.Landing on Mars is notoriously difficult. Only the U.S. has successfully landed a spacecraft on Martian soil, doing it eight times since 1976. NASA’s InSight and Curiosity rovers still operate today. Six other spacecraft are exploring Mars from orbit: three American, two European and one from India.Unlike the two other Mars missions launching this month, China has tightly controlled information about the program — even withholding any name for its rover. National security concerns led the U.S. to curb cooperation between NASA and China’s space program.In an article published earlier this month in Nature Astronomy, mission chief engineer Wan Weixing said Tianwen-1 would slip into orbit around Mars in February and look for a landing site on Utopia Planitia — a plain where NASA has detected possible evidence of underground ice. Wan died in May from cancer.The landing would then be attempted in April or May, according to the article. If all goes well, the 240-kilogram (530-pound) golf cart-sized, solar-powered rover is expected to operate for about three months, and the orbiter for two years.\n",

Perseverance is expected to operate for at least two years.This Mars-launching season — which occurs every 26 months when Earth and Mars are at their closest — is especially busy.The UAE spacecraft Amal, or Hope, which will orbit Mars but not land, is the Arab world’s first interplanetary mission. NASA’s Perseverance rover is up next.“At no other time in our history have we seen anything like what is unfolding with these three unique missions to Mars. Each of them is a science and engineering marvel,” the Space Foundation’s chief executive officer Thomas Zelibor said in an online panel discussion earlier this week.China’s road to Mars hit a few bumps: A Long March-5 rocket, nicknamed “Fat 5” because of its bulky shape, failed to launch earlier this year. The coronavirus pandemic forced scientists to work from home. In March, when instruments needed to be transported from Beijing to Shanghai, three team members drove 12 hours to deliver them.While China is joining the U.S., Russia and Europe in creating a satellite-based global navigation system, experts say it isn’t trying to overtake the U.S. lead in space exploration.Instead, Cheng of the Heritage Foundation said China is in a “slow race” with Japan and India to establish itself as Asia’s space power.Ghosal reported from New Delhi.\n",

      "Medical workers account for about 3.8% of confirmed cases as of several days ago, Zeng said.The commission also reported another sizable rise in the number of infections as a result of a new way of counting adopted by Hebei province, the hardest-hit area.Confirmed cases in mainland China rose to 63,851 by the end of Thursday, up 5,090 from the previous day. The death toll rose 121 to 1,380.Hubei province is now including cases based on a physician’s diagnosis before they have been confirmed by lab tests. Of the 5,090 new cases, 3,095 fell into that category.The acceleration in the number of cases does not necessarily represent a sudden surge in new infections of the virus that causes COVID-19 as much as the revised methodology.The health commission has said that the change was aimed at identifying suspected cases so they can be treated more quickly, though experts also saw it as a reflection of the crush of people seeking treatment and the struggle to keep up with a backlog of untested samples in Hubei and its capital, Wuhan, where the disease first surfaced in December.In Taiwan, about 100 family members of people stuck in Hubei province protested outside Taiwan’s Mainland Affairs Council headquarters in the capital, Taipei.\n",

Japan now has 258 confirmed cases, including 218 from a cruise ship, the Diamond Princess, that has been quarantined in Yokohama.Health officials allowed 11 elderly passengers to leave the ship on Friday after they tested negative for the virus.

Health officials are investigating how she got infected.In an unprecedented attempt to contain the disease, the Chinese government has placed the hardest-hit cities — home to more than 60 million — under lockdown. People are restricted from entering or leaving the cities, and in many places can only leave their homes or residential complexes for shopping and other daily needs.___Associated Press writers Ralph Jennings in Taipei, Taiwan, and Mari Yamaguchi in Tokyo contributed to this report.\n",

      "Many other countries, including the United States, are coordinating closely with the private sector to try to win the vaccine development race, and China faces many challenges.Its success in driving down COVID-19 infections makes it harder to conduct large-scale vaccine trials, and so far only a few other countries have agreed to work with it. After past vaccine scandals, Beijing will also have to convince the world it has met all safety and quality requirements.But China’s use of command economy-type tools is so far yielding results.A state-controlled entity, for example, completed two vaccine plants at what it called the “wartime speed” of a couple of months, while state-owned enterprises and the military have allowed experimental shots to be used on staff.The People’s Liberation Army’s (PLA) medical research unit, which has been a driving force in China’s efforts to fight infectious diseases, is also working with private firms including CanSino to develop COVID-19 vaccines.Challenging the West’s traditional dominance of the industry, China is behind eight of the 19 vaccine candidates in human trials, with Sinovac’s experimental shot and one jointly developed by the military and CanSino among the front runners.It is also focused mainly on inactivated vaccine technology – a technology that is well known and has been used to make vaccines against diseases such as influenza and measles – something which could raise the chances of success.By contrast, several Western rivals such as U.S.-based Moderna and Germany’s CureVac and BioNTech are using a new technology called messenger RNA that has never before yielded a product approved by regulators.“It’s a tried and true strategy,” said Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, about inactivated vaccine technology.“If I had to pick a vaccine that I think would be the most likely to be safe and effective, it would be that one,” he said. Offit is also co-inventor of the rotavirus vaccine, RotaTeq, manufactured by Merck & Co Inc.\n",

      "Four of the Chinese candidates in human trials are inactivated vaccines, including Sinovac’s and two vaccines from China National Biotec Group (CNBG), a unit of state-owned China National Pharmaceutical Group (Sinopharm).There are currently only two experimental COVID-19 vaccines in final Phase III trials – one from Sinopharm and another from AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford. Sinovac’s is set to become the third later this month.To speed up the process, China allowed Sinopharm and Sinovac to combine Phase I and Phase II trials for their vaccine candidates.For CanSino’s experimental vaccine, the PLA research institute played a key role, with the two working on a method using an adenovirus – a similar approach to AstraZeneca’s.The PLA has its own approval process for “military specifically-needed drugs,” and approved the military use of the candidate developed by its research unit and CanSino last month.PLA lead scientist Chen Wei, who has been the face of its vaccine development effort, was among the first to take the experimental COVID-19 shot developed by her team, as well as its potential SARS treatment years before, according to state media.China has challenges, though, as the epidemic has petered out in the country, hampering efforts to conduct large trials.It has since shifted its focus overseas, but only a handful of countries have shown willingness to collaborate – UAE, Canada, Brazil, Indonesia and Mexico. Neither major European countries nor the United States have shown interest in China’s COVID-19 vaccines as they focus on their own projects.\n",

      "CONTENT : Throughout January, the World Health Organization publicly praised China for what it called a speedy response to the new coronavirus. It repeatedly thanked the Chinese government for sharing the genetic map of the virus “immediately,” and said its work and commitment to transparency were “very impressive, and beyond words.”But behind the scenes, it was a much different story, one of significant delays by China and considerable frustration among WHO officials over not getting the information they needed to fight the spread of the deadly virus, The Associated Press has found.Despite the plaudits, China in fact sat on releasing the genetic map, or genome, of the virus for more than a week after three different government labs had fully decoded the information. Tight controls on information and competition within the Chinese public health system were to blame, according to dozens of interviews and internal documents.Chinese government labs only released the genome after another lab published it ahead of authorities on a virologist website on Jan. 11. Even then, China stalled for at least two weeks more on providing WHO with detailed data on patients and cases, according to recordings of internal meetings held by the U.N. health agency through January — all at a time when the outbreak arguably might have been dramatically slowed.\n",

      "\t\t\t\tCoronavirus: Trump terminates relationship with World Health Organization\t\t\t\n",
      "WHO officials were lauding China in public because they wanted to coax more information out of the government, the recordings obtained by the AP suggest. Privately, they complained in meetings the week of Jan. 6 that China was not sharing enough data to assess how effectively the virus spread between people or what risk it posed to the rest of the world, costing valuable time.“We’re going on very minimal information,” said American epidemiologist Maria Van Kerkhove, now WHO’s technical lead for COVID-19, in one internal meeting. “It’s clearly not enough for you to do proper planning.”“We’re currently at the stage where yes, they’re giving it to us 15 minutes before it appears on CCTV,” said WHO’s top official in China, Dr. Gauden Galea, referring to the state-owned China Central Television, in another meeting.The story behind the early response to the virus comes at a time when the U.N. health agency is under siege, and has agreed to an independent probe of how the pandemic was handled globally. After repeatedly praising the Chinese response early on, U.S. President Donald Trump has blasted WHO in recent weeks for allegedly colluding with China to hide the extent of the coronavirus crisis. He cut ties with the organization on Friday, jeopardizing the approximately $450 million the U.S. gives every year as WHO’s biggest single donor.In the meantime, Chinese President Xi Jinping has vowed to pitch in $2 billion over the next two years to fight the coronavirus, saying China has always provided information to WHO and the world “in a most timely fashion.”The new information does not support the narrative of either the U.S. or China, but instead portrays an agency now stuck in the middle that was urgently trying to solicit more data despite limits to its own authority. Although international law obliges countries to report information to WHO that could have an impact on public health, the U.N. agency has no enforcement powers and cannot independently investigate epidemics within countries. Instead, it must rely on the cooperation of member states.The recordings suggest that rather than colluding with China, as Trump declared, WHO was kept in the dark as China gave it the minimal information required by law. However, the agency did try to portray China in the best light, likely as a means to secure more information. And WHO experts genuinely thought Chinese scientists had done “a very good job” in detecting and decoding the virus, despite the lack of transparency from Chinese officials.WHO staffers debated how to press China for gene sequences and detailed patient data without angering authorities, worried about losing access and getting Chinese scientists into trouble. Under international law, WHO is required to quickly share information and alerts with member countries about an evolving crisis. Galea noted WHO could not indulge China’s wish to sign off on information before telling other countries because “that is not respectful of our responsibilities.”\n",

      "In the second week of January, WHO’s chief of emergencies, Dr. Michael Ryan, told colleagues it was time to “shift gears” and apply more pressure on China, fearing a repeat of the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome that started in China in 2002 and killed nearly 800 people worldwide.“This is exactly the same scenario, endlessly trying to get updates from China about what was going on,” he said. “WHO barely got out of that one with its neck intact given the issues that arose around transparency in southern China.”Ryan said the best way to “protect China” was for WHO to do its own independent analysis with data from the Chinese government, because otherwise the spread of the virus between people would be in question and “other countries will take action accordingly.” Ryan also noted that China was not cooperating in the same way some other countries had in the past.“This would not happen in Congo and did not happen in Congo and other places,” he said, probably referring to the Ebola outbreak that began there in 2018. “We need to see the data…..It’s absolutely important at this point.”The delay in the release of the genome stalled the recognition of its spread to other countries, along with the global development of tests, drugs and vaccines. The lack of detailed patient data also made it harder to determine how quickly the virus was spreading — a critical question in stopping it.Between the day the full genome was first decoded by a government lab on Jan. 2 and the day WHO declared a global emergency on Jan. 30, the outbreak spread by a factor of 100 to 200 times, according to retrospective infection data from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. The virus has now infected over 6 million people worldwide and killed more than 375,000.“It’s obvious that we could have saved more lives and avoided many, many deaths if China and the WHO had acted faster,” said Ali Mokdad, a professor at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington.However, Mokdad and other experts also noted that if WHO had been more confrontational with China, it could have triggered a far worse situation of not getting any information at all.\n",

      "If WHO had pushed too hard, it could even have been kicked out of China, said Adam Kamradt-Scott, a global health professor at the University of Sydney. But he added that a delay of just a few days in releasing genetic sequences can be critical in an outbreak. And he noted that as Beijing’s lack of transparency becomes even clearer, WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus’s continued defense of China is problematic.“It’s definitely damaged WHO’s credibility,” said Kamradt-Scott. “Did he go too far? I think the evidence on that is clear….it has led to so many questions about the relationship between China and WHO. It is perhaps a cautionary tale.”WHO and its officials named in this story declined to answer questions asked by The Associated Press without audio or written transcripts of the recorded meetings, which the AP was unable to supply to protect its sources.“Our leadership and staff have worked night and day in compliance with the organization’s rules and regulations to support and share information with all Member States equally, and engage in frank and forthright conversations with governments at all levels,” a WHO statement said.[ Sign up for our Health IQ newsletter for the latest coronavirus updates ]China’s National Health Commission and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had no comment. But in the past few months, China has repeatedly defended its actions, and many other countries — including the U.S. — have responded to the virus with even longer delays of weeks and even months.“Since the beginning of the outbreak, we have been continuously sharing information on the epidemic with the WHO and the international community in an open, transparent and responsible manner,” said Liu Mingzhu, an official with the National Health Commission’s International Department, at a press conference on May 15.___________The race to find the genetic map of the virus started in late December, according to the story that unfolds in interviews, documents and the WHO recordings. That’s when doctors in Wuhan noticed mysterious clusters of patients with fevers and breathing problems who weren’t improving with standard flu treatment. Seeking answers, they sent test samples from patients to commercial labs.By Dec. 27, one lab, Vision Medicals, had pieced together most of the genome of a new coronavirus with striking similarities to SARS. Vision Medicals shared its data with Wuhan officials and the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, as reported first by Chinese finance publication Caixin and independently confirmed by the AP.On Dec. 30, Wuhan health officials issued internal notices warning of the unusual pneumonia, which leaked on social media. That evening, Shi Zhengli, a coronavirus expert at the Wuhan Institute of Virology who is famous for having traced the SARS virus to a bat cave, was alerted to the new disease, according to an interview with Scientific American.

      "The next day, Chinese CDC director Gao Fu dispatched a team of experts to Wuhan. Also on Dec. 31, WHO first learned about the cases from an open-source platform that scouts for intelligence on outbreaks, emergencies chief Ryan has said.WHO officially requested more information on Jan. 1. Under international law, members have 24 to 48 hours to respond, and China reported two days later that there were 44 cases and no deaths.By Jan. 2, Shi had decoded the entire genome of the virus, according to a notice later posted on her institute’s website.Scientists agree that Chinese scientists detected and sequenced the then-unknown pathogen with astonishing speed, in a testimony to China’s vastly improved technical capabilities since SARS, during which a WHO-led group of scientists took months to identify the virus. This time, Chinese virologists proved within days that it was a never-before-seen coronavirus. Tedros would later say Beijing set “a new standard for outbreak response.”But when it came to sharing the information with the world, things began to go awry.On Jan. 3, the National Health Commission issued a confidential notice ordering labs with the virus to either destroy their samples or send them to designated institutes for safekeeping. The notice, first reported by Caixin and seen by the AP, forbade labs from publishing about the virus without government authorization. The order barred Shi’s lab from publishing the genetic sequence or warning of the potential danger.Chinese law states that research institutes cannot conduct experiments on potentially dangerous new viruses without approval from top health authorities. Although the law is intended to keep experiments safe, it gives top health officials wide-ranging powers over what lower-level labs can or cannot do.“If the virologist community had operated with more autonomy….the public would have been informed of the lethal risk of the new virus much earlier,” said Edward Gu, a professor at Zhejiang University, and Li Lantian, a PhD student at Northwestern University, in a paper published in March analyzing the outbreak.Commission officials later repeated that they were trying to ensure lab safety, and had tasked four separate government labs with identifying the genome at the same time to get accurate, consistent results.By Jan. 3, the Chinese CDC had independently sequenced the virus, according to internal data seen by the Associated Press. The next day, WHO reported on Twitter that investigations were under way into an unusual cluster of pneumonia cases with no deaths in Wuhan, and said it would share “more details as we have them.”By just after midnight on Jan. 5, a third designated government lab, the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, had decoded the sequence and submitted a report — pulling all-nighters to get results in record time, according to a state media interview. Yet even with full sequences decoded by three state labs independently, Chinese health officials remained silent. The WHO reported on Twitter that investigations were under way into an unusual cluster of pneumonia cases with no deaths in Wuhan, and said it would share “more details as we have them.”\n",

      "Meanwhile, at the Chinese CDC, gaps in coronavirus expertise proved a problem.For nearly two weeks, Wuhan reported no new infections, as officials censored doctors who warned of suspicious cases. Meanwhile, researchers found the new coronavirus used a distinct spike protein to bind itself to human cells. The unusual protein and the lack of new cases lulled some Chinese CDC researchers into thinking the virus didn’t easily spread between humans — like the coronavirus that casues Middle East respiratory syndrome, or MERS, according to an employee who declined to be identified out of fear of retribution.Li, the coronavirus expert, said he immediately suspected the pathogen was infectious when he spotted a leaked copy of a sequencing report in a group chat on a SARS-like coronavirus. But the Chinese CDC team that sequenced the virus lacked specialists in the molecular structure of coronaviruses and failed to consult with outside scientists, Li said. Chinese health authorities rebuffed offers of assistance from foreign experts, including Hong Kong scientists barred from a fact-finding mission to Wuhan and an American professor at a university in China.On Jan. 5, the Shanghai Public Clinical Health Center, led by famed virologist Zhang Yongzhen, was the latest to sequence the virus. He submitted it to the GenBank database, where it sat awaiting review, and notified the National Health Commission. He warned them that the new virus was similar to SARS and likely infectious.“It should be contagious through respiratory passages,” the center said in an internal notice seen by the AP. “We recommend taking preventative measures in public areas.”On the same day, WHO said that based on preliminary information from China, there was no evidence of significant transmission between humans, and did not recommend any specific measures for travelers.The next day, the Chinese CDC raised its emergency level to the second highest. Staffers proceeded to isolate the virus, draft lab testing guidelines, and design test kits. But the agency did not have the authority to issue public warnings, and the heightened emergency level was kept secret even from many of its own staff.By Jan. 7, another team at Wuhan University had sequenced the pathogen and found it matched Shi’s, making Shi certain they had identified a novel coronavirus. But Chinese CDC experts said they didn’t trust Shi’s findings and needed to verify her data before she could publish, according to three people familiar with the matter. Both the National Health Commission and the Ministry of Science and Technology, which oversees Shi’s lab, declined to make Shi available for an interview.A major factor behind the gag order, some say, was that Chinese CDC researchers wanted to publish their papers first. “They wanted to take all the credit,” said Li Yize, a coronavirus researcher at the University of Pennsylvania.Internally, the leadership of the Chinese CDC is plagued with fierce competition, six people familiar with the system explained. They said the agency has long promoted staff based on how many papers they can publish in prestigious journals, making scientists reluctant to share data.As the days went by, even some of the Chinese CDC’s own staff began to wonder why it was taking so long for authorities to identify the pathogen.“We were getting suspicious, since within one or two days you would get a sequencing result,” a lab technician said, declining to be identified for fear of retribution.___________On Jan. 8, the Wall Street Journal reported that scientists had identified a new coronavirus in samples from pneumonia patients in Wuhan, pre-empting and embarrassing Chinese officials. The lab technician told the AP they first learned about the discovery of the virus from the Journal.The article also embarrassed WHO officials. Dr. Tom Grein, chief of WHO’s acute events management team, said the agency looked “doubly, incredibly stupid.” Van Kerkhove, the American expert, acknowledged WHO was “already late” in announcing the new virus and told colleagues that it was critical to push China.Ryan, WHO’s chief of emergencies, was also upset at the dearth of information.\n",

      "“The fact is, we’re two to three weeks into an event, we don’t have a laboratory diagnosis, we don’t have an age, sex or geographic distribution, we don’t have an epi curve,” he complained, referring to the standard graphic of outbreaks scientists use to show how an epidemic is progressing.After the article, state media officially announced the discovery of the new coronavirus. But even then, Chinese health authorities did not release the genome, diagnostic tests, or detailed patient data that could hint at how infectious the disease was.By that time, suspicious cases were already appearing across the region.On Jan. 8, Thai airport officers pulled aside a woman from Wuhan with a runny nose, sore throat, and high temperature. Chulalongkorn University professor Supaporn Wacharapluesadee’s team found the woman was infected with a new coronavirus, much like what Chinese officials had described. Supaporn partially figured out the genetic sequence by Jan. 9, reported it to the Thai government and spent the next day searching for matching sequences.But because Chinese authorities hadn’t published any sequences, she found nothing. She could not prove the Thai virus was the same pathogen sickening people in Wuhan.“It was kind of wait and see, when China will release the data, then we can compare,” said Supaporn.On Jan. 9, a 61-year-old man with the virus passed away in Wuhan — the first known death. The death wasn’t made public until Jan. 11.WHO officials complained in internal meetings that they were making repeated requests for more data, especially to find out if the virus could spread efficiently between humans, but to no avail.“We have informally and formally been requesting more epidemiological information,” WHO’s China representative Galea said. “But when asked for specifics, we could get nothing.”Emergencies chief Ryan grumbled that since China was providing the minimal information required by international law, there was little WHO could do. But he also noted that last September, WHO had issued an unusual public rebuke of Tanzania for not providing enough details about a worrisome Ebola outbreak.“We have to be consistent,” Ryan said. “The danger now is that despite our good intent…especially if something does happen, there will be a lot of finger-pointing at WHO.”Ryan noted that China could make a “huge contribution” to the world by sharing the genetic material immediately, because otherwise “other countries will have to reinvent the wheel over the coming days.”\n",

      "On Jan. 11, a team led by Zhang, from the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, finally published a sequence on virological.org, used by researchers to swap tips on pathogens. The move angered Chinese CDC officials, three people familiar with the matter said, and the next day, his laboratory was temporarily shuttered by health authorities.Zhang referred a request for comment to the Chinese CDC. The National Health Commission, which oversees the Chinese CDC, declined multiple times to make its officials available for interviews and did not answer questions about Zhang.Supaporn compared her sequence with Zhang’s and found it was a 100% match, confirming that the Thai patient was ill with the same virus detected in Wuhan. Another Thai lab got the same results. That day, Thailand informed the WHO, said Tanarak Plipat, deputy director-general of the Department of Disease Control at Thailand’s Ministry of Public Health.After Zhang released the genome, the Chinese CDC, the Wuhan Institute of Virology and the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences raced to publish their sequences, working overnight to review them, gather patient data, and send them to the National Health Commission for approval, according to documentation obtained by the AP. On Jan. 12, the three labs together finally published the sequences on GISAID, a platform for scientists to share genomic data.By then, more than two weeks had passed since Vision Medicals decoded a partial sequence, and more than a week since the three government labs had all obtained full sequences. Around 600 people were infected in that week, a roughly three-fold increase.Some scientists say the wait was not unreasonable considering the difficulties in sequencing unknown pathogens, given accuracy is as important as speed. They point to the SARS outbreak in 2003 when some Chinese scientists initially — and wrongly — believed the source of the epidemic was chlamydia.“The pressure is intense in an outbreak to make sure you’re right,” said Peter Daszak, president of the EcoHealthAlliance in New York. “It’s actually worse to go out to go to the public with a story that’s wrong because the public completely lose confidence in the public health response.”Still, others quietly question what happened behind the scenes.Infectious diseases expert John Mackenzie, who served on a WHO emergency committee during the outbreak, praised the speed of Chinese researchers in sequencing the virus. But he said once central authorities got involved, detailed data trickled to a crawl.“There certainly was a kind of blank period,” Mackenzie said. “There had to be human to human transmission. You know, it’s staring at you in the face… I would have thought they would have been much more open at that stage.”_________________On Jan. 13, WHO announced that Thailand had a confirmed case of the virus, jolting Chinese officials.The next day, in a confidential teleconference, China’s top health official ordered the country to prepare for a pandemic, calling the outbreak the “most severe challenge since SARS in 2003”, as the AP previously reported. Chinese CDC staff across the country began screening, isolating, and testing for cases, turning up hundreds across the country.\n",

      "Yet even as the Chinese CDC internally declared a level one emergency, the highest level possible, Chinese officials still said the chance of sustained transmission between humans was low.WHO went back and forth. Van Kerkhove said in a press briefing that “it is certainly possible there is limited human-to-human transmission.” But hours later, WHO seemed to backtrack, and tweeted that “preliminary investigations conducted by the Chinese authorities have found no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission” – a statement that later became fodder for critics.A high-ranking official in WHO’s Asia office, Dr. Liu Yunguo, who attended medical school in Wuhan, flew to Beijing to make direct, informal contacts with Chinese officials, recordings show. Liu’s former classmate, a Wuhan doctor, had alerted him that pneumonia patients were flooding the city’s hospitals, and Liu pushed for more experts to visit Wuhan, according to a public health expert familiar with the matter.On Jan. 20, the leader of an expert team returning from Wuhan, renowned government infectious diseases doctor Zhong Nanshan, declared publicly for the first time that the new virus was spreading between people. Chinese President Xi Jinping called for the “timely publication of epidemic information and deepening of international cooperation.”Despite that directive, WHO staff still struggled to obtain enough detailed patient data from China about the rapidly evolving outbreak. That same day, the U.N. health agency dispatched a small team to Wuhan for two days, including Galea, the WHO representative in China.They were told about a worrying cluster of cases among more than a dozen doctors and nurses. But they did not have “transmission trees” detailing how the cases were connected, nor a full understanding of how widely the virus was spreading and who was at risk.In an internal meeting, Galea said their Chinese counterparts were “talking openly and consistently” about human-to-human transmission, and that there was a debate about whether or not this was sustained. Galea reported to colleagues in Geneva and Manila that China’s key request to WHO was for help “in communicating this to the public, without causing panic.”On Jan. 22, WHO convened an independent committee to determine whether to declare a global health emergency. After two inconclusive meetings where experts were split, they decided against it — even as Chinese officials ordered Wuhan sealed in the biggest quarantine in history. The next day, WHO chief Tedros publicly described the spread of the new coronavirus in China as “limited.”For days, China didn’t release much detailed data, even as its case count exploded. Beijing city officials were alarmed enough to consider locking down the capital, according to a medical expert with direct knowledge of the matter.On Jan. 28, Tedros and top experts, including Ryan, made an extraordinary trip to Beijing to meet President Xi and other senior Chinese officials. It is highly unusual for WHO’s director-general to directly intervene in the practicalities of outbreak investigations. Tedros’ staffers had prepared a list of requests for information.\n",

      "“It could all happen and the floodgates open, or there’s no communication,” Grein said in an internal meeting while his boss was in Beijing. “We’ll see.”At the end of Tedros’ trip, WHO announced China had agreed to accept an international team of experts. In a press briefing on Jan. 29, Tedros heaped praise on China, calling its level of commitment “incredible.”The next day, WHO finally declared an international health emergency. Once again, Tedros thanked China, saying nothing about the earlier lack of cooperation.“We should have actually expressed our respect and gratitude to China for what it’s doing,” Tedros said. “It has already done incredible things to limit the transmission of the virus to other countries.”\n",

      "CONTENT : A whack of documents supplied to some international media over the weekend has provided evidence of China’s attempts to identify westerners — including nearly 4,000 Canadians — who could be attacked through coercive social media or other types of cyber warfare.This shocking revelation, which first appeared in Canada in the Globe and Mail, is a dark complement to research that an Australian think tank published recently about what China is up to in the remote South Pacific. The Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI) provides details of a significant play that China is making to co-opt Kiribati, which is made up of three archipelagos scattered across a swath of sea that is half as wide as Australia.The gambit in Oceania’s backwaters and the activities of a data company with ties to China’s military and intelligence establishments underscores the staggering breadth of Beijing’s global ambitions. It is casting covetous eyes at strategically important specks of land many thousands of kilometres from the Chinese mainland at the same it is burrowing its cyber tentacles deep inside the wealthiest Western countries to probe for vulnerabilities that can be exploited.For those readers unfamiliar with Kiribati (pronounced Kirabas), it is 32 atolls, a coral island and 110,000 souls. It is one of the countries that is most at risk of rising seas caused by global warming and is also in the middle of the world’s biggest untapped tuna fishing grounds.On Tarawa, which is Kiribati’s capital, the U.S. Marine Corps was schooled in 1943 by the Imperial Japanese Army about how much American blood and treasure would have to be expended to expel Emperor Hirohito’s troops from atolls and islands stretching across much of the Pacific.China’s Kiribati stratagem is eerily reminiscent of Japan’s pre-war manoeuvering in the South Pacific. The main goal then as now would appear to be to control vital shipping lanes between the U.S. and Australia and New Zealand and threaten the U.S.’s Pacific possessions.\n",

      "Less than one year after Kiribati switched its diplomatic relations from Taiwan to China, Beijing has offered to dredge lagoons to enlarge some atolls. If that sounds familiar, it is because the same Chinese equipment and work crews converted at least seven Filipino and Vietnamese-claimed outcroppings in the South China Sea into “Chinese islands” bristling with missiles, radar systems, ammunition and fuel dumps, and airfields capable of handling fighter jets and the biggest military transports.Not forgotten in Washington is that only five years earlier, President Xi Jinping had pledged China had no intention to militarize the atolls.Plans for Kiribati include building two major ports in the middle of the empty southern ocean. There would be little obvious advantage for Kiribati to have such ports, though building one of them on Kiritimati, which used to be called Christmas Island, could be a strategic nightmare for the Americans because that atoll is less than 2,000 kilometres away from Pearl Harbor which, as in the Second World War, is the U.S. navy’s crown jewel in the Pacific.China already can use an old U.S. satellite tracking facility in Kiribati. It is trying to further develop relations with an island in French Polynesia where it is building a $2-billion fish farm near a deep water harbour and a disused military airfield.Canada already has a lot on its plate in trying to maintain what’s left of its shaky relationship with China, which has been poisoned by the Meng Wanzhou-Huawei extradition dispute, the subsequent kidnapping by China of the “two Michaels” and sharp questions in Canada about whether some of the many Mainland Chinese students attending university here spy for the Chinese military or for government-controlled companies.Though Ottawa remains more reluctant to do or say anything to upset China than most of its Asian and European allies, to maintain its self-respect it must do more than just wag a finger at Beijing since it was revealed that it was tracking many Canadians, including Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s daughter and some leading bureaucrats, businessmen and criminals. Though the U.S. and Australia clearly must lead in ensuring Kiribati’s future security and well-being, Canada could play a modest role, too.\n",

      "On one of its biannual Pacific patrols, the Royal Canadian Navy could send a frigate to Kiribati on a goodwill visit. Canada could also burnish its vaunted green credentials by providing funding and technical assistance to the impoverished island statelet to help it manage the potentially existential effects of global warming. Citing anonymous government sources, the Toronto Star floated the idea last week that a major shift in Canada’s Indo-Pacific policy was in the works.Canadian diplomats tell me that they have been asked to develop what is being described as an Asian policy. However, planning is still at such an early, initial stage that nothing will be ready for the government’s consideration for many months and quite probably not before the next federal election, should it take place any time between next week’s Throne Speech and next spring.The sudden disclosure of preliminary discussions about a change in direction could be a reaction to a series of recent polls that show a large majority of Canadians want much less to do with China than the government does, and/or a response to Conservative Leader Erin O’Toole’s recent pledge to counter China’s ugly behaviour by seeking stronger partnerships with other countries in the Indo-Pacific.With China up to no good in many different places, including India, Australia, the South China Sea, the East China Sea, Japan, stifling free speech and human rights in Hong Kong and Muslim Xinjiang, and now demonstrably tracking thousands of Canadians citizens, the world has become wide awake to this growing danger.Ottawa must respond to Beijing’s many provocations with more than words of disappointment because along with climate change, what to do about China will likely be the defining challenge of the 21st century.Matthew Fisher is an international affairs columnist and foreign correspondent who has worked abroad for 35 years.

      "“Canadian officials attended the April 30th, 2019, verdict and sentencing of Mr. Fan. We call on China to grant clemency. It is of extreme concern to our government that China has chosen to apply the death penalty, a cruel and inhumane punishment,” a Global Affairs spokesperson told Global News.The verdict marks the second time a Canadian has been handed the death sentence in China in less than five months.On Jan. 14, Canadian Robert Lloyd Schellenberg, originally sentenced in 2016 to a 15-year term for drug smuggling, had his sentence changed to the death penalty. He has appealed the sentence, and the matter is still before the courts.WATCH: B.C. man gets death penalty in China after drug smuggling conviction“We know the judiciary and criminal system in China are not independent of (politics) and can work under the party,” Lynette Ong, an associate professor of political science at the University of Toronto, said.Ong said because of this, the chance of Schellenberg winning his appeal may be “very low,” as many experts say his death sentence is seen as punishment for Canada’s arrest of Meng Wanzhou, chief financial officer of the Chinese telecom company Huawei.“We know the party can interfere in the judicial decision — that is how the system works,” she said.But what happens to individuals who are handed the death sentence in China? The question is difficult to answer, according to organizations such as Amnesty International, which says information on China’s death penalty is “shrouded in secrecy.”\n",

      "\t\t\t\tChina brushes off mounting international concern over Canadian sentenced to death\t\t\t\n",
      "China executes more people than any other country in the world, according to Amnesty International. But it is difficult to determine the number of death sentences imposed and the number of executions carried out.Many cases are classified as a state secret. However, occasionally, death penalty cases are very public, as in the case of Schellenberg.The Cornell Center on the Death Penalty Worldwide provides a database of the death penalties in 87 countries, including China. The organization notes that although information on some countries’ death penalty laws is a state secret, it still “offers a cautious, informed assessment of state practice.”In the case of China, Death Penalty Worldwide says there are “possibly thousands” of individuals executed every year.It is difficult to asses the exact number, as many prisoners do not linger on death row — they are either executed immediately or given a suspended two-year sentence, after which they are either executed or have their sentence commuted, the centre said.The death sentences reported in the media are also a “fraction of those that are imposed,” the organization added. That includes foreign nationals given the death sentence for drug-related crimes.WATCH: Government will intercede in Canadian facing death sentence in China, Trudeau saysBut it is estimated that China sentences thousands of people to death every year, more than the rest of the world put together.For example, it was reported that 2,000 people were executed in China in 2018. In comparison, 501 individuals were reportedly executed in the Middle East and North Africa region in 2018 (Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Saudi Arabia and Yemen).In 2007, the Chinese Supreme People’s Court was granted the power to review death penalty cases.“All death sentences are meant to be reviewed by higher courts in China … but do these reviews result in a different outcome? Not necessarily,” said Sophie Richardson, China director at Human Rights Watch.She said it’s very difficult to know how a Chinese court came to its decision after a trial.\n",

      "In the case of foreign individuals — such as the two Canadians — being handed the death penalty, Ong said an embassy in Beijing could try and discuss the case with the Chinese government.“But China could turn around and say the behaviour was conducted on their territory and sovereign rights overrule this so China does not have to disclose any other information,” she said.Once an individual is handed a death sentence, such as Tuesday’s case of the Canadian, the Chinese government could detain the individual for years before the sentence is carried out, Ong said. But, she added, it’s also quite common to execute people right away.China allows the death penalty to be imposed for 68 crimes, 44 of which do not involve violence, according to Dui Hua, a U.S. organization that advocates for prisoners in China.These include murder, rape, drug trafficking, robbery, treason, espionage, prison riots and producing or selling tainted food or medicine.WATCH: Family of Canadian imprisoned in China for 10 years searching for answersFor example, in 2009, China’s state media reported that the government executed a dairy farmer and a milk salesman for their role in a tainted infant formula scandal that killed six children and made 300,000 ill.“The majority of the crimes eligible for the death penalty in China (are) not definitely violent ones, which is of concern,” Richardson said. “Add on top of this the chronic challenges of getting a fair trial in China.”Most executions in China are reportedly carried out by lethal injection, with firing squads as a method being phased out.Death Penalty Worldwide reported that lethal injection and shooting are the only methods authorized by China’s Criminal Procedure Law of 1996. However, as of 2010, shooting executions aren’t reportedly used anymore, the organization added.“In June 2009, the Chinese government announced that it was a long-term objective to replace the firing squad with lethal injection,” the organization stated.\n",

      "CONTENT : Throughout January, the World Health Organization publicly praised China for what it called a speedy response to the new coronavirus. It repeatedly thanked the Chinese government for sharing the genetic map of the virus “immediately,” and said its work and commitment to transparency were “very impressive, and beyond words.”But behind the scenes, it was a much different story, one of significant delays by China and considerable frustration among WHO officials over not getting the information they needed to fight the spread of the deadly virus, The Associated Press has found.Despite the plaudits, China in fact sat on releasing the genetic map, or genome, of the virus for more than a week after three different government labs had fully decoded the information. Tight controls on information and competition within the Chinese public health system were to blame, according to dozens of interviews and internal documents.Chinese government labs only released the genome after another lab published it ahead of authorities on a virologist website on Jan. 11. Even then, China stalled for at least two weeks more on providing WHO with detailed data on patients and cases, according to recordings of internal meetings held by the U.N. health agency through January — all at a time when the outbreak arguably might have been dramatically slowed.\n",

      "WHO officials were lauding China in public because they wanted to coax more information out of the government, the recordings obtained by the AP suggest. Privately, they complained in meetings the week of Jan. 6 that China was not sharing enough data to assess how effectively the virus spread between people or what risk it posed to the rest of the world, costing valuable time.“We’re going on very minimal information,” said American epidemiologist Maria Van Kerkhove, now WHO’s technical lead for COVID-19, in one internal meeting. “It’s clearly not enough for you to do proper planning.”“We’re currently at the stage where yes, they’re giving it to us 15 minutes before it appears on CCTV,” said WHO’s top official in China, Dr. Gauden Galea, referring to the state-owned China Central Television, in another meeting.The story behind the early response to the virus comes at a time when the U.N. health agency is under siege, and has agreed to an independent probe of how the pandemic was handled globally. After repeatedly praising the Chinese response early on, U.S. President Donald Trump has blasted WHO in recent weeks for allegedly colluding with China to hide the extent of the coronavirus crisis. He cut ties with the organization on Friday, jeopardizing the approximately $450 million the U.S. gives every year as WHO’s biggest single donor.In the meantime, Chinese President Xi Jinping has vowed to pitch in $2 billion over the next two years to fight the coronavirus, saying China has always provided information to WHO and the world “in a most timely fashion.”The new information does not support the narrative of either the U.S. or China, but instead portrays an agency now stuck in the middle that was urgently trying to solicit more data despite limits to its own authority. Although international law obliges countries to report information to WHO that could have an impact on public health, the U.N. agency has no enforcement powers and cannot independently investigate epidemics within countries. Instead, it must rely on the cooperation of member states.The recordings suggest that rather than colluding with China, as Trump declared, WHO was kept in the dark as China gave it the minimal information required by law. However, the agency did try to portray China in the best light, likely as a means to secure more information. And WHO experts genuinely thought Chinese scientists had done “a very good job” in detecting and decoding the virus, despite the lack of transparency from Chinese officials.WHO staffers debated how to press China for gene sequences and detailed patient data without angering authorities, worried about losing access and getting Chinese scientists into trouble. Under international law, WHO is required to quickly share information and alerts with member countries about an evolving crisis. Galea noted WHO could not indulge China’s wish to sign off on information before telling other countries because “that is not respectful of our responsibilities.”\n",

      "In the second week of January, WHO’s chief of emergencies, Dr. Michael Ryan, told colleagues it was time to “shift gears” and apply more pressure on China, fearing a repeat of the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome that started in China in 2002 and killed nearly 800 people worldwide.“This is exactly the same scenario, endlessly trying to get updates from China about what was going on,” he said. “WHO barely got out of that one with its neck intact given the issues that arose around transparency in southern China.”Ryan said the best way to “protect China” was for WHO to do its own independent analysis with data from the Chinese government, because otherwise the spread of the virus between people would be in question and “other countries will take action accordingly.” Ryan also noted that China was not cooperating in the same way some other countries had in the past.“This would not happen in Congo and did not happen in Congo and other places,” he said, probably referring to the Ebola outbreak that began there in 2018. “We need to see the data…..It’s absolutely important at this point.”The delay in the release of the genome stalled the recognition of its spread to other countries, along with the global development of tests, drugs and vaccines. The lack of detailed patient data also made it harder to determine how quickly the virus was spreading — a critical question in stopping it.Between the day the full genome was first decoded by a government lab on Jan. 2 and the day WHO declared a global emergency on Jan. 30, the outbreak spread by a factor of 100 to 200 times, according to retrospective infection data from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. The virus has now infected over 6 million people worldwide and killed more than 375,000.“It’s obvious that we could have saved more lives and avoided many, many deaths if China and the WHO had acted faster,” said Ali Mokdad, a professor at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington.However, Mokdad and other experts also noted that if WHO had been more confrontational with China, it could have triggered a far worse situation of not getting any information at all.\n",

      "If WHO had pushed too hard, it could even have been kicked out of China, said Adam Kamradt-Scott, a global health professor at the University of Sydney. But he added that a delay of just a few days in releasing genetic sequences can be critical in an outbreak. And he noted that as Beijing’s lack of transparency becomes even clearer, WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus’s continued defense of China is problematic.“It’s definitely damaged WHO’s credibility,” said Kamradt-Scott. “Did he go too far? I think the evidence on that is clear….it has led to so many questions about the relationship between China and WHO. It is perhaps a cautionary tale.”WHO and its officials named in this story declined to answer questions asked by The Associated Press without audio or written transcripts of the recorded meetings, which the AP was unable to supply to protect its sources.“Our leadership and staff have worked night and day in compliance with the organization’s rules and regulations to support and share information with all Member States equally, and engage in frank and forthright conversations with governments at all levels,” a WHO statement said.[ Sign up for our Health IQ newsletter for the latest coronavirus updates ]China’s National Health Commission and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had no comment. But in the past few months, China has repeatedly defended its actions, and many other countries — including the U.S. — have responded to the virus with even longer delays of weeks and even months.“Since the beginning of the outbreak, we have been continuously sharing information on the epidemic with the WHO and the international community in an open, transparent and responsible manner,” said Liu Mingzhu, an official with the National Health Commission’s International Department, at a press conference on May 15.___________The race to find the genetic map of the virus started in late December, according to the story that unfolds in interviews, documents and the WHO recordings. That’s when doctors in Wuhan noticed mysterious clusters of patients with fevers and breathing problems who weren’t improving with standard flu treatment. Seeking answers, they sent test samples from patients to commercial labs.By Dec. 27, one lab, Vision Medicals, had pieced together most of the genome of a new coronavirus with striking similarities to SARS. Vision Medicals shared its data with Wuhan officials and the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, as reported first by Chinese finance publication Caixin and independently confirmed by the AP.On Dec. 30, Wuhan health officials issued internal notices warning of the unusual pneumonia, which leaked on social media. That evening, Shi Zhengli, a coronavirus expert at the Wuhan Institute of Virology who is famous for having traced the SARS virus to a bat cave, was alerted to the new disease, according to an interview with Scientific American. Shi took the first train from a conference in Shanghai back to Wuhan.\n",

      "The next day, Chinese CDC director Gao Fu dispatched a team of experts to Wuhan. Also on Dec. 31, WHO first learned about the cases from an open-source platform that scouts for intelligence on outbreaks, emergencies chief Ryan has said.WHO officially requested more information on Jan. 1. Under international law, members have 24 to 48 hours to respond, and China reported two days later that there were 44 cases and no deaths.By Jan. 2, Shi had decoded the entire genome of the virus, according to a notice later posted on her institute’s website.Scientists agree that Chinese scientists detected and sequenced the then-unknown pathogen with astonishing speed, in a testimony to China’s vastly improved technical capabilities since SARS, during which a WHO-led group of scientists took months to identify the virus. This time, Chinese virologists proved within days that it was a never-before-seen coronavirus. Tedros would later say Beijing set “a new standard for outbreak response.”But when it came to sharing the information with the world, things began to go awry.On Jan. 3, the National Health Commission issued a confidential notice ordering labs with the virus to either destroy their samples or send them to designated institutes for safekeeping. The notice, first reported by Caixin and seen by the AP, forbade labs from publishing about the virus without government authorization. The order barred Shi’s lab from publishing the genetic sequence or warning of the potential danger.Chinese law states that research institutes cannot conduct experiments on potentially dangerous new viruses without approval from top health authorities. Although the law is intended to keep experiments safe, it gives top health officials wide-ranging powers over what lower-level labs can or cannot do.“If the virologist community had operated with more autonomy….the public would have been informed of the lethal risk of the new virus much earlier,” said Edward Gu, a professor at Zhejiang University, and Li Lantian, a PhD student at Northwestern University, in a paper published in March analyzing the outbreak.Commission officials later repeated that they were trying to ensure lab safety, and had tasked four separate government labs with identifying the genome at the same time to get accurate, consistent results.By Jan. 3, the Chinese CDC had independently sequenced the virus, according to internal data seen by the Associated Press. The next day, WHO reported on Twitter that investigations were under way into an unusual cluster of pneumonia cases with no deaths in Wuhan, and said it would share “more details as we have them.”By just after midnight on Jan. 5, a third designated government lab, the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, had decoded the sequence and submitted a report — pulling all-nighters to get results in record time, according to a state media interview. Yet even with full sequences decoded by three state labs independently, Chinese health officials remained silent. The WHO reported on Twitter that investigations were under way into an unusual cluster of pneumonia cases with no deaths in Wuhan, and said it would share “more details as we have them.”\n",

      "Meanwhile, at the Chinese CDC, gaps in coronavirus expertise proved a problem.For nearly two weeks, Wuhan reported no new infections, as officials censored doctors who warned of suspicious cases. Meanwhile, researchers found the new coronavirus used a distinct spike protein to bind itself to human cells. The unusual protein and the lack of new cases lulled some Chinese CDC researchers into thinking the virus didn’t easily spread between humans — like the coronavirus that casues Middle East respiratory syndrome, or MERS, according to an employee who declined to be identified out of fear of retribution.Li, the coronavirus expert, said he immediately suspected the pathogen was infectious when he spotted a leaked copy of a sequencing report in a group chat on a SARS-like coronavirus. But the Chinese CDC team that sequenced the virus lacked specialists in the molecular structure of coronaviruses and failed to consult with outside scientists, Li said. Chinese health authorities rebuffed offers of assistance from foreign experts, including Hong Kong scientists barred from a fact-finding mission to Wuhan and an American professor at a university in China.On Jan. 5, the Shanghai Public Clinical Health Center, led by famed virologist Zhang Yongzhen, was the latest to sequence the virus. He submitted it to the GenBank database, where it sat awaiting review, and notified the National Health Commission. He warned them that the new virus was similar to SARS and likely infectious.“It should be contagious through respiratory passages,” the center said in an internal notice seen by the AP. “We recommend taking preventative measures in public areas.”On the same day, WHO said that based on preliminary information from China, there was no evidence of significant transmission between humans, and did not recommend any specific measures for travelers.The next day, the Chinese CDC raised its emergency level to the second highest. Staffers proceeded to isolate the virus, draft lab testing guidelines, and design test kits. But the agency did not have the authority to issue public warnings, and the heightened emergency level was kept secret even from many of its own staff.By Jan. 7, another team at Wuhan University had sequenced the pathogen and found it matched Shi’s, making Shi certain they had identified a novel coronavirus. But Chinese CDC experts said they didn’t trust Shi’s findings and needed to verify her data before she could publish, according to three people familiar with the matter. Both the National Health Commission and the Ministry of Science and Technology, which oversees Shi’s lab, declined to make Shi available for an interview.A major factor behind the gag order, some say, was that Chinese CDC researchers wanted to publish their papers first. “They wanted to take all the credit,” said Li Yize, a coronavirus researcher at the University of Pennsylvania.Internally, the leadership of the Chinese CDC is plagued with fierce competition, six people familiar with the system explained. They said the agency has long promoted staff based on how many papers they can publish in prestigious journals, making scientists reluctant to share data.As the days went by, even some of the Chinese CDC’s own staff began to wonder why it was taking so long for authorities to identify the pathogen.“We were getting suspicious, since within one or two days you would get a sequencing result,” a lab technician said, declining to be identified for fear of retribution.___________On Jan. 8, the Wall Street Journal reported that scientists had identified a new coronavirus in samples from pneumonia patients in Wuhan, pre-empting and embarrassing Chinese officials. The lab technician told the AP they first learned about the discovery of the virus from the Journal.The article also embarrassed WHO officials. Dr. Tom Grein, chief of WHO’s acute events management team, said the agency looked “doubly, incredibly stupid.” Van Kerkhove, the American expert, acknowledged WHO was “already late” in announcing the new virus and told colleagues that it was critical to push China.Ryan, WHO’s chief of emergencies, was also upset at the dearth of information.\n",

      "“The fact is, we’re two to three weeks into an event, we don’t have a laboratory diagnosis, we don’t have an age, sex or geographic distribution, we don’t have an epi curve,” he complained, referring to the standard graphic of outbreaks scientists use to show how an epidemic is progressing.After the article, state media officially announced the discovery of the new coronavirus. But even then, Chinese health authorities did not release the genome, diagnostic tests, or detailed patient data that could hint at how infectious the disease was.By that time, suspicious cases were already appearing across the region.On Jan. 8, Thai airport officers pulled aside a woman from Wuhan with a runny nose, sore throat, and high temperature. Chulalongkorn University professor Supaporn Wacharapluesadee’s team found the woman was infected with a new coronavirus, much like what Chinese officials had described. Supaporn partially figured out the genetic sequence by Jan. 9, reported it to the Thai government and spent the next day searching for matching sequences.But because Chinese authorities hadn’t published any sequences, she found nothing. She could not prove the Thai virus was the same pathogen sickening people in Wuhan.“It was kind of wait and see, when China will release the data, then we can compare,” said Supaporn.On Jan. 9, a 61-year-old man with the virus passed away in Wuhan — the first known death. The death wasn’t made public until Jan. 11.WHO officials complained in internal meetings that they were making repeated requests for more data, especially to find out if the virus could spread efficiently between humans, but to no avail.“We have informally and formally been requesting more epidemiological information,” WHO’s China representative Galea said. “But when asked for specifics, we could get nothing.”Emergencies chief Ryan grumbled that since China was providing the minimal information required by international law, there was little WHO could do. But he also noted that last September, WHO had issued an unusual public rebuke of Tanzania for not providing enough details about a worrisome Ebola outbreak.“We have to be consistent,” Ryan said. “The danger now is that despite our good intent…especially if something does happen, there will be a lot of finger-pointing at WHO.”Ryan noted that China could make a “huge contribution” to the world by sharing the genetic material immediately, because otherwise “other countries will have to reinvent the wheel over the coming days.”\n",

      "On Jan. 11, a team led by Zhang, from the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, finally published a sequence on virological.org, used by researchers to swap tips on pathogens. The move angered Chinese CDC officials, three people familiar with the matter said, and the next day, his laboratory was temporarily shuttered by health authorities.Zhang referred a request for comment to the Chinese CDC. The National Health Commission, which oversees the Chinese CDC, declined multiple times to make its officials available for interviews and did not answer questions about Zhang.Supaporn compared her sequence with Zhang’s and found it was a 100% match, confirming that the Thai patient was ill with the same virus detected in Wuhan. Another Thai lab got the same results. That day, Thailand informed the WHO, said Tanarak Plipat, deputy director-general of the Department of Disease Control at Thailand’s Ministry of Public Health.After Zhang released the genome, the Chinese CDC, the Wuhan Institute of Virology and the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences raced to publish their sequences, working overnight to review them, gather patient data, and send them to the National Health Commission for approval, according to documentation obtained by the AP. On Jan. 12, the three labs together finally published the sequences on GISAID, a platform for scientists to share genomic data.By then, more than two weeks had passed since Vision Medicals decoded a partial sequence, and more than a week since the three government labs had all obtained full sequences. Around 600 people were infected in that week, a roughly three-fold increase.Some scientists say the wait was not unreasonable considering the difficulties in sequencing unknown pathogens, given accuracy is as important as speed. They point to the SARS outbreak in 2003 when some Chinese scientists initially — and wrongly — believed the source of the epidemic was chlamydia.“The pressure is intense in an outbreak to make sure you’re right,” said Peter Daszak, president of the EcoHealthAlliance in New York. “It’s actually worse to go out to go to the public with a story that’s wrong because the public completely lose confidence in the public health response.”Still, others quietly question what happened behind the scenes.Infectious diseases expert John Mackenzie, who served on a WHO emergency committee during the outbreak, praised the speed of Chinese researchers in sequencing the virus. But he said once central authorities got involved, detailed data trickled to a crawl.“There certainly was a kind of blank period,” Mackenzie said. “There had to be human to human transmission. You know, it’s staring at you in the face… I would have thought they would have been much more open at that stage.”_________________On Jan. 13, WHO announced that Thailand had a confirmed case of the virus, jolting Chinese officials.The next day, in a confidential teleconference, China’s top health official ordered the country to prepare for a pandemic, calling the outbreak the “most severe challenge since SARS in 2003”, as the AP previously reported. Chinese CDC staff across the country began screening, isolating, and testing for cases, turning up hundreds across the country.\n",

      "Yet even as the Chinese CDC internally declared a level one emergency, the highest level possible, Chinese officials still said the chance of sustained transmission between humans was low.WHO went back and forth. Van Kerkhove said in a press briefing that “it is certainly possible there is limited human-to-human transmission.” But hours later, WHO seemed to backtrack, and tweeted that “preliminary investigations conducted by the Chinese authorities have found no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission” – a statement that later became fodder for critics.A high-ranking official in WHO’s Asia office, Dr. Liu Yunguo, who attended medical school in Wuhan, flew to Beijing to make direct, informal contacts with Chinese officials, recordings show. Liu’s former classmate, a Wuhan doctor, had alerted him that pneumonia patients were flooding the city’s hospitals, and Liu pushed for more experts to visit Wuhan, according to a public health expert familiar with the matter.On Jan. 20, the leader of an expert team returning from Wuhan, renowned government infectious diseases doctor Zhong Nanshan, declared publicly for the first time that the new virus was spreading between people. Chinese President Xi Jinping called for the “timely publication of epidemic information and deepening of international cooperation.”Despite that directive, WHO staff still struggled to obtain enough detailed patient data from China about the rapidly evolving outbreak. That same day, the U.N. health agency dispatched a small team to Wuhan for two days, including Galea, the WHO representative in China.They were told about a worrying cluster of cases among more than a dozen doctors and nurses. But they did not have “transmission trees” detailing how the cases were connected, nor a full understanding of how widely the virus was spreading and who was at risk.In an internal meeting, Galea said their Chinese counterparts were “talking openly and consistently” about human-to-human transmission, and that there was a debate about whether or not this was sustained. Galea reported to colleagues in Geneva and Manila that China’s key request to WHO was for help “in communicating this to the public, without causing panic.”On Jan. 22, WHO convened an independent committee to determine whether to declare a global health emergency. After two inconclusive meetings where experts were split, they decided against it — even as Chinese officials ordered Wuhan sealed in the biggest quarantine in history. The next day, WHO chief Tedros publicly described the spread of the new coronavirus in China as “limited.”For days, China didn’t release much detailed data, even as its case count exploded. Beijing city officials were alarmed enough to consider locking down the capital, according to a medical expert with direct knowledge of the matter.On Jan. 28, Tedros and top experts, including Ryan, made an extraordinary trip to Beijing to meet President Xi and other senior Chinese officials. It is highly unusual for WHO’s director-general to directly intervene in the practicalities of outbreak investigations. Tedros’ staffers had prepared a list of requests for information.\n",

      "“It could all happen and the floodgates open, or there’s no communication,” Grein said in an internal meeting while his boss was in Beijing. “We’ll see.”At the end of Tedros’ trip, WHO announced China had agreed to accept an international team of experts. In a press briefing on Jan. 29, Tedros heaped praise on China, calling its level of commitment “incredible.”The next day, WHO finally declared an international health emergency. Once again, Tedros thanked China, saying nothing about the earlier lack of cooperation.“We should have actually expressed our respect and gratitude to China for what it’s doing,” Tedros said. “It has already done incredible things to limit the transmission of the virus to other countries.”\n",

      "CONTENT : More than 1,700 Chinese medical workers have been infected by the new virus that has killed nearly 1,400 people and spread to other parts of Asia and as far as the U.S. and Europe, a senior Chinese official announced Friday.Six of the workers have died, Zeng Yixin, vice director of the National Health Commission, said at a news conference.The health commission is “highly concerned about this issue” and has issued guidelines for the prevention and control of infection within medical institutions, he said.\n",

      "Medical workers account for about 3.8% of confirmed cases as of several days ago, Zeng said.The commission also reported another sizable rise in the number of infections as a result of a new way of counting adopted by Hebei province, the hardest-hit area.Confirmed cases in mainland China rose to 63,851 by the end of Thursday, up 5,090 from the previous day. The death toll rose 121 to 1,380.Hubei province is now including cases based on a physician’s diagnosis before they have been confirmed by lab tests. Of the 5,090 new cases, 3,095 fell into that category.The acceleration in the number of cases does not necessarily represent a sudden surge in new infections of the virus that causes COVID-19 as much as the revised methodology.The health commission has said that the change was aimed at identifying suspected cases so they can be treated more quickly, though experts also saw it as a reflection of the crush of people seeking treatment and the struggle to keep up with a backlog of untested samples in Hubei and its capital, Wuhan, where the disease first surfaced in December.In Taiwan, about 100 family members of people stuck in Hubei province protested outside Taiwan’s Mainland Affairs Council headquarters in the capital, Taipei.\n",

      "About 1,000 Taiwanese hoping to fly home on charter flights have sparked a dispute between their government and China.One flight brought 247 people back on Feb. 4. Three were not on a passenger list that Taiwan gave to Chinese authorities and one tested positive for the virus, Taiwan’s Central News Agency has reported.Taiwan’s Mainland Affairs Council wants China to step up quarantine work and reach agreements with Taiwan on the names of people on priority lists for flights.China’s Taiwan Affairs Office accused Taiwan on Wednesday of “using all kinds of excuses to obstruct and delay” flights. China sees self-ruled Taiwan as part of its territory rather than an independent state.“We don’t want to politicize it, we want charter flights,” said protester Chung Chin-ming, chairman of the Chinese Cross-Strait Marriage Coordination Association in Taipei.Elsewhere, Japan confirmed seven more cases, a day after it reported its first death from the virus. Japan now has 258 confirmed cases, including 218 from a cruise ship, the Diamond Princess, that has been quarantined in Yokohama.Health officials allowed 11 elderly passengers to leave the ship on Friday after they tested negative for the virus. They are the first group of dozens of older passengers expected to get off the vessel before their 14-day quarantine period ends on Feb. 19 to reduce risks of their health deteriorating.Japanese Health Minister Katsunobu Kato on Thursday said passengers age 80 or older with chronic health issues or in cabins without windows that can open will be able to leave the ship if they pass the virus test.More than 580 cases have been confirmed outside mainland China and three deaths, one each in the Philippines and Hong Kong and now a Japanese woman in her 80s. Health officials are investigating how she got infected.In an unprecedented attempt to contain the disease, the Chinese government has placed the hardest-hit cities — home to more than 60 million — under lockdown. People are restricted from entering or leaving the cities, and in many places can only leave their homes or residential complexes for shopping and other daily needs.___Associated Press writers Ralph Jennings in Taipei, Taiwan, and Mari Yamaguchi in Tokyo contributed to this report.\n",

      "National Health Commission Chairman Ma Xiaowei did not address the specific findings in the AP report, but said it “seriously goes against the facts.” He added that there were many unknowns in the early stage of the outbreak and that it took time to gather evidence and figure out the characteristics of the new virus.“The Chinese government did not delay or cover up anything,” he said. “Instead, we have immediately reported virus data and relevant information about the epidemic to the international community and made an important contribution to the prevention and control of the epidemic around the world.”He ticked off a series of government actions from a detailed timeline in the government report. The timeline says that China began updating the WHO on a regular basis on Jan. 3 and that the head of China’s Center for Disease Control and Prevention briefed the head of the U.S. CDC on Jan. 4.[ Sign up for our Health IQ newsletter for the latest coronavirus updates ]U.S. officials have been critical of China’s early response, adding to a deterioration of U.S.-China relations over trade and technology and pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong.\n",

The foreign accounts do not show up on Trump’s public financial disclosures, where he must list personal assets, because they are held under corporate names.The Chinese account is controlled by Trump International Hotels Management LLC, which the tax records show paid $188,561 in taxes in China while pursuing licensing deals there from 2013 to 2015.\n",

      "In response to questions from The Times, Alan Garten, a lawyer for the Trump Organization, said the company had “opened an account with a Chinese bank having offices in the United States in order to pay the local taxes” associated with efforts to do business there. He said the company had opened the account after establishing an office in China “to explore the potential for hotel deals in Asia.”“No deals, transactions or other business activities ever materialized and, since 2015, the office has remained inactive,” Garten said. “Though the bank account remains open, it has never been used for any other purpose.”Garten would not identify the bank in China where the account is held.China continues to be an issue in the 2020 presidential campaign, from the president’s trade war to his barbs over the origin of the coronavirus pandemic. His campaign has tried to portray former Vice-President Joe Biden as misreading the dangers posed by China’s growing power. Trump has also sought to tar his opponent with overblown or unsubstantiated assertions about Hunter Biden’s business dealings there while his father was in office.As for the former vice-president, his public financial disclosures, along with the income tax returns he voluntarily released, show no income or business dealings of his own in China. However, there is ample evidence of Trump’s efforts to do business there.As with Russia, where he explored hotel and tower projects in Moscow without success, Trump has long sought a licensing deal in China. His efforts go at least as far back as 2006, when he filed trademark applications in Hong Kong and the mainland. Many Chinese government approvals came after he became president.In 2008, Trump pursued an office tower project in Guangzhou that never got off the ground. But his efforts accelerated in 2012 with the opening of a Shanghai office, and tax records show that one of Trump’s China-related companies, THC China Development LLC, claimed $84,000 in deductions that year for travel costs, legal fees and office expenses.The Times said Trump’s tax records show that he has invested at least $192,000 in five small companies created specifically to pursue projects in China over the years. Those companies claimed at least $97,400 in business expenses since 2010, including some minor payments for taxes and accounting fees as recently as 2018, the Times reported.\n",

      "CONTENT : China said Wednesday it remains firm in its insistence that Canada make the first move to end the detention of two Canadians, following a meeting of the two countries’ foreign ministers.Former Canadian diplomat Michael Kovrig and Canadian entrepreneur Michael Spavor have been held in China on unspecified national security charges for more than 620 days in apparent retaliation for Canada’s late 2018 arrest of Meng Wanzhou, an executive at tech giant Huawei and the daughter of the company’s founder.Meng was detained at Vancouver’s airport at the request of the United States, which wants her extradited to face fraud charges over the company’s dealings with Iran. Her arrest enraged Beijing, which calls it a political move aimed at constraining China’s rise as a global technology power.Canadian Minister of Foreign Affairs Francois-Philippe Champagne urged Beijing to release the two Canadians during a meeting with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi in Rome on Tuesday.The two are suspected of engaging in “activities endangering China’s national security” and their cases are being handled “in strict accordance with the law while protecting their legal rights,” foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said at a daily briefing on Wednesday.China has “made it clear to the Canadian side that it should respect the spirit of the rule of law and China’s judicial sovereignty,” Zhao said, adding that China was not responsible for the current difficulties in bilateral relations.\n",

      "”The Canadian side is well aware of the crux of the problem and should immediately take effective measures to correct the mistakes and create conditions for the bilateral relationship to get back on track,“ Zhao said.In addition to detaining Kovrig and Spavor, China has also restricted various Canadian exports to China, including canola seed oil, in an apparent attempt to pressure China into releasing Meng, who is residing in one of her Vancouver mansions under a form of house arrest.Since her detention, China has also sentenced four Canadians convicted on drug charges to death, an unusually high number for foreign suspects held in China.While the Canadian government has made no indication it will trade Meng for Kovrig and Spavor, calls have arisen among the Canadian public for a deal to be made.“The blind adherence to the use of the rule of law and no ransom ensures that Kovrig and Spavor will remain forgotten within Chinese prisons for the foreseeable future,” former foreign service officer Gar Pardy wrote in the Ottawa Citizen newspaper last week.“The offering of Meng Wanzhou in exchange for Kovrig and Spavor is the only answer,” Pardy wrote in the opinion piece.\n",

      "CONTENT : Chinese officials do not understand why Canada is getting caught in the middle of its trade war with the United States.In an interview with the West Block‘s Eric Sorensen, Nova Scotia Liberal Premier Stephen McNeil said the ongoing tensions between Canada and China amid its broader trade fight with the U.S. will only be solved by talking to each other because right now China does not seem to grasp Canada’s position.READ MORE: Trudeau defends approach to China over detainment of 2 Canadians despite ‘naive’ comment“There’s no question China believes that Canada is in the middle of a fight between the U.S. and China. They have a hard time understanding why we’re there,” he said. “I think the fact that we need to continue to demonstrate to them why the federal government is part of this, why they’ve become part of this.”McNeil, who has visited China seven times during his mandate and whose province has growing trade ties with the country, suggested the approach taken by some countries to try to restrict ties will not work to stabilize tensions.“It has always been my belief that the best way to solve our differences, whether it’s with China or other jurisdictions, is dialogue, not protectionism,” he said.WATCH BELOW: Trudeau defends approach to China over detainment of 2 Canadians despite ‘naive’ commentU.S. President Donald Trump is currently engaged in a trade war with China and has slapped tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars worth of Chinese goods.That comes as the two countries are holding on-again, off-again talks about a trade deal.Since coming into office in 2016, Trump has increasingly moved the U.S. towards protectionism and isolationism, applying tariffs on billions of dollars worth of goods including those coming from longstanding American allies including the European Union and Canada.The tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum have since been lifted but the request by U.S. officials for Canadian border agents to detain and extradite Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou in December 2018 has snarled Canada in the middle of the continuing American trade war.READ MORE: China scolds Canada for ‘mustering so-called allies’ on detaineesHuawei is a Chinese technological darling and the arrest of Meng was followed just days later by China detaining two Canadian citizens, including a diplomat on leave while working for an international non-governmental organization.Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor have been detained for seven months without legal access and only limited consular services.Meng, meanwhile, is out on bail and living in her multimillion-dollar Vancouver home while her extradition case works through the courts.The U.S. Department of Justice charged Meng and her company with 23 counts of skirting sanctions on Iran and corporate espionage in January 2019.McNeil, who is one of just three Liberal premiers still standing, also weighed in ahead of the 2019 summer meeting of Canada’s premiers.WATCH: What is a trade war? That meeting is set to take place in Saskatoon this week and will bring together the premiers of all 13 provinces and territories.They are set to discuss health care, federal funding, internal trade and energy and the meeting will be the last before the federal campaign this fall.Several conservative premiers have already taken the federal government to court over the carbon tax, with two losing their initial fights.But at least one — Alberta Premier Jason Kenney — has vowed to campaign against Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in the campaign.McNeil was asked about why so many voters appear dissatisfied with the Liberal Party in the provinces but said he doesn’t think the party is the only one facing re-election challenges because voters are indicating they want to move in “a different direction.”“I think if you look across the country, the electorate is volatile,” he said. “Regardless of the political stripe, we’ve seen in the last six years successive governments fall in different provinces, both Conservative, New Democrat and Liberal governments. I don’t think it’s a particular political stripe.”\n",

      "That would be a stunning statement coming from the president of the United States, where the First Amendment protects the right to religious beliefs and practices and prevents the government from creating or favouring a religion. It could drive a wedge between Trump and his Republican China hawks on Capitol Hill.It also could take some punch out of the Trump campaign’s efforts to portray former Vice-President Joe Biden as soft on China. The Trump campaign released an online video last month that included clips of Biden previously describing that country as “not bad folks” and saying economic growth there was in the U.S. interest.The Associated Press obtained an advance copy of Bolton’s book on Wednesday. It was the same day that Trump signed legislation that increases pressure on China over its crackdown in Xinjiang, where authorities have detained more than a million people — from ethnic groups that include Uighurs, Kazakhs and Kyrgyz — in a vast network of detention centres. Many have been subjected to torture and forced labour and deprived of adequate food and medical treatment.The law imposes sanctions on specific Chinese officials, such as the Communist Party official who oversees government policy in Xinjiang. In his signing statement, Trump took issue with one sanctions provision, saying it intruded on executive authority and he would regard it as non-binding.Trump’s alleged comment to Xi was at odds with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s statement last week condemning China’s treatment of the Uighurs.“In China, state-sponsored repression against all religions continues to intensify,” Pompeo said in releasing the department’s latest annual International Religious Freedom report. “The Chinese Communist Party is now ordering religious organizations to obey CCP leadership and infuse communist dogma into their teachings and practice of their faith. The mass detentions of Uighurs in Xinjiang continues.”It also contradicts the position of lawmakers who have taken hard-line positions against Beijing.Republican Sen. Jim Risch of Idaho, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said “the internment of at least a million Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities is reprehensible and inexcusable, and the Chinese Communist Party and government must be held to account.”Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., said the legislation was evidence that the U.S. supports the Uighurs and “will not sit idly by as the Chinese government and communist party commit egregious human rights abuses and crimes against humanity.”Nihad Awad, director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, a Washington-based Muslim civil rights and advocacy group, said he thought it was ironic that Trump signed the legislation on the same day that details of Bolton’s book became public.“We condemn President’s Trump’s reported approval of China’s concentration camps — places of untold suffering, torture, abuse, rape, and death — for Uyghur Muslims,” Awad said. “Congress must immediately investigate whether Trump gave his blessing to round up, imprison and oppress an ethnic religious community in concentration camps.”The bill was expected to further inflame already tense relations between the U.S. and China amid the Trump administration’s criticism of Beijing’s response to the outbreak of the coronavirus.Trump issued a statement upon signing the legislation that the new law would hold “perpetrators of human rights violations” accountable.The law requires the U.S. government to report to Congress on violations of human rights in Xinjiang as well as China’s acquisition of technology used for mass detention and surveillance. It also requires American authorities to look into the pervasive reports of harassment and threats of Uighurs and other Chinese nationals in the United States.\n",

Jeff Merkley, a co-sponsor of the legislation, said the act requires the secretary of state to determine whether individuals responsible for “appalling human rights violations” meet the criteria for sanctions. “The United States cannot remain silent in the face of these atrocious and horrifying abuses,” the Oregon Democrat said. “As millions of Americans fight for racial justice here at home, we must also stand strong as a champion of human rights abroad.”\n",

      "Whether it’s viewed as heroic sacrifice or a violation of international ethical norms, the claim underscores the enormous stakes as China competes with U.S. and British companies to be the first with a vaccine to help end the pandemic — a feat that would be both a scientific and political triumph.“Getting a COVID-19 vaccine is the new Holy Grail,” said Lawrence Gostin, a global public health law expert at Georgetown University. “The political competition to be the first is no less consequential than the race for the moon between the United States and Russia.”China has positioned itself to be a strong contender. Eight of the nearly two dozen potential vaccines in various stages of human testing worldwide are from China, the most of any country. And SinoPharm and another Chinese company already have announced they’re entering final testing.Both China and SinoPharm have invested heavily in a tried-and-true technology — an “inactivated” vaccine made by growing the whole virus in a lab and then killing it, which is how polio shots are made. Leading Western competitors use newer, less proven technology to target the “spike” protein that coats the virus.That protein is “a good place to make our bet,” Dr. Gary Nabel, chief scientific officer of the French pharmaceutical company Sanofi, said at a U.S. biotechnology industry meeting. But “it’s good to have some diversity. I like the fact that there is an inactivated, whole vaccine. That provides an alternative in case one of these should fail.”\n",

      "SinoPharm’s claim that 30 “special volunteers” rolled up their sleeves even before the company got permission for its initial human study raises ethical concerns among Western observers. The company’s post cites a “spirit of sacrifice” and shows seven men in suits and ties — a mix of scientists, businessmen and one Communist Party official with a background in military propaganda.“The idea of people willing to sacrifice themselves … is pretty much expected in China,” said Yanzhong Huang, a global health expert at the Council on Foreign Relations, a U.S. nonprofit organization.But with corporate and government officials getting vaccinated, other employees “might feel pressure to participate. That would violate the voluntary principle” that is a bedrock of modern medical ethics, Huang said.The first round of human testing — a Phase 1 trial — requires permission from a country’s drug regulators, who decide whether there is enough laboratory and animal evidence to justify the attempt.[ Sign up for our Health IQ newsletter for the latest coronavirus updates ]SinoPharm, which declined to comment for this story, is testing two vaccine candidates that received government permission for Phase 1 trials in mid- to late April. In a post on its subsidiary’s official WeChat account, the company says it conducted its “pre-test” at the end of March “to make the vaccines hit the market as early as possible.”\n",

      "It would not be the only shortcut China is taking. In late June, the government gave special approval for the military to use an experimental vaccine made by another company, CanSino Biologics, skipping the final testing needed to prove if it really works. CanSino now says it’s in talks with four other countries about doing that research.Some participants in the first CanSino clinical trial in March said in social media posts that researchers on the project claimed they had been injected Feb. 29, before regulators gave the study the go-ahead. A researcher said team leader Chen Wei, a renowned military virologist, was the first to receive the experimental vaccine, one of the participants told state-owned Beijing News.CanSino and Chen’s Academy of Military Medical Sciences turned down requests for information and interviews. The National Medical Products Administration, which approves vaccine trials, also declined to comment. In May, a Russian scientist told the RIA Novosti news agency that he and fellow researchers also had vaccinated themselves ahead of approved studies. “It’s self-defence in order for us to continue working” on a vaccine, said Alexander Gintsburg of the Moscow-based Gamaleya research institute.“Everyone is alive and well and cheerful,” he added.Russia’s Association of Clinical Research Organizations condemned the action as a “crude violation of the very foundations of clinical research, Russian law and universally accepted international regulations.” But about a month later, Russia launched its first vaccine study, using the Gamaleya product.Examples of scientists experimenting on themselves abound in medical history.\n",

      "Around 1900, Pierre Curie, Marie Curie’s husband, deliberately burned his arm with radium as part of their radiation experiments. In the 1950s, Jonas Salk tested his ultimately successful polio vaccine on himself and his family. In the 1980s, Australia’s Dr. Barry Marshall drank a bacteria-laden broth as part of his quest to prove germs, not stress, cause stomach ulcers. He was right.And in China in the 1970s, a researcher named Tu Youyou, working in a secret military program, discovered an important anti-malaria drug that she first tested on herself. In 2015, she won a Nobel Prize.With a COVID-19 vaccine, national pride is at stake. President Xi Jinping pledged that any Chinese-made vaccine would be a “global public good.”All this is taking place as China strives to overcome years of drug scandals — the latest coming in 2018 when authorities recalled a rabies vaccine and later announced batches of children’s DPT vaccines, for diphtheria, pertussis and tetanus, were ineffective.Giving the experimental shot early to SinoPharm’s employees “sends a signal to the Chinese people, `You guys should not worry about the safety of the vaccine,”’ Huang said.Scientists vehemently debate self-experimenting because what happens to one or a few people outside of a well-designed study is anecdote, not evidence. More than 600,000 U.S. schoolchildren had to be given Salk’s vaccine or a dummy shot to prove polio protection. It took almost another decade to validate Marshall’s ulcer germ theory, which earned him a Nobel as well.Modern international ethics rules require participants in medical research to be fully informed and to freely consent. In the U.S., studies involving people must receive approval from an “investigational review board,” and most U.S. research institutions explicitly state there is no exception to board approval for self-experimenting.\n",

      "“Employees may not be the best volunteers because employees are in a relationship which is not equal,” said Dr. Derrick Au, bioethics director at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.Still, he said questions about China’s medical ethics might disappear if one of its COVID-19 vaccines ultimately proves to work. “It’s difficult to argue against success,” Au said.William Lee of the Milken Institute, a think-tank in Santa Monica, California, that is tracking COVID-19 vaccine progress, said that because of China’s past scandals, “if they are successful as being the first with a workable product on the market, it had better be so pristine, so pure that people who are outside of China would be willing to buy into it.”Neergaard reported from Alexandria, Va. AP video producer Olivia Zhang in Beijing, science writer Victoria Milko in Jakarta, Indonesia, and correspondent Daria Litvinova in Moscow contributed to this report.\n",

      "CONTENT : U.S. President Donald Trump told China’s Xi Jinping that he was right to build detention camps to house hundreds of thousands of ethnic minorities, former U.S. national security adviser John Bolton alleged in a new book that could make the president’s tough-on-China mantra a hard sell.At a summit in Japan in 2019, with only interpreters present, Xi gave Trump an explanation for the Chinese camps for Uighurs, who are ethnically and culturally distinct from the country’s majority Han population and are suspected of harbouring separatist tendencies, Bolton wrote.“According to our interpreter, Trump said that Xi should go ahead with building the camps, which he thought was exactly the right thing to do,” the book said.\n",

      "That would be a stunning statement coming from the president of the United States, where the First Amendment protects the right to religious beliefs and practices and prevents the government from creating or favouring a religion. It could drive a wedge between Trump and his Republican China hawks on Capitol Hill.It also could take some punch out of the Trump campaign’s efforts to portray former Vice-President Joe Biden as soft on China. The Trump campaign released an online video last month that included clips of Biden previously describing that country as “not bad folks” and saying economic growth there was in the U.S. interest.The Associated Press obtained an advance copy of Bolton’s book on Wednesday. It was the same day that Trump signed legislation that increases pressure on China over its crackdown in Xinjiang, where authorities have detained more than a million people — from ethnic groups that include Uighurs, Kazakhs and Kyrgyz — in a vast network of detention centres. Many have been subjected to torture and forced labour and deprived of adequate food and medical treatment.The law imposes sanctions on specific Chinese officials, such as the Communist Party official who oversees government policy in Xinjiang. In his signing statement, Trump took issue with one sanctions provision, saying it intruded on executive authority and he would regard it as non-binding.Trump’s alleged comment to Xi was at odds with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s statement last week condemning China’s treatment of the Uighurs.“In China, state-sponsored repression against all religions continues to intensify,” Pompeo said in releasing the department’s latest annual International Religious Freedom report. “The Chinese Communist Party is now ordering religious organizations to obey CCP leadership and infuse communist dogma into their teachings and practice of their faith. The mass detentions of Uighurs in Xinjiang continues.”It also contradicts the position of lawmakers who have taken hard-line positions against Beijing.Republican Sen. Jim Risch of Idaho, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said “the internment of at least a million Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities is reprehensible and inexcusable, and the Chinese Communist Party and government must be held to account.”Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., said the legislation was evidence that the U.S. supports the Uighurs and “will not sit idly by as the Chinese government and communist party commit egregious human rights abuses and crimes against humanity.”Nihad Awad, director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, a Washington-based Muslim civil rights and advocacy group, said he thought it was ironic that Trump signed the legislation on the same day that details of Bolton’s book became public.“We condemn President’s Trump’s reported approval of China’s concentration camps — places of untold suffering, torture, abuse, rape, and death — for Uyghur Muslims,” Awad said. “Congress must immediately investigate whether Trump gave his blessing to round up, imprison and oppress an ethnic religious community in concentration camps.”The bill was expected to further inflame already tense relations between the U.S. and China amid the Trump administration’s criticism of Beijing’s response to the outbreak of the coronavirus.Trump issued a statement upon signing the legislation that the new law would hold “perpetrators of human rights violations” accountable.The law requires the U.S. government to report to Congress on violations of human rights in Xinjiang as well as China’s acquisition of technology used for mass detention and surveillance. It also requires American authorities to look into the pervasive reports of harassment and threats of Uighurs and other Chinese nationals in the United States.\n",

      "“The two sides have made positive progress on pushing forward the disengagement of the front-line troops on the western section of the border and easing the border tension,” Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said at a daily briefing on Wednesday.Hua called for concrete actions by India to implement the consensus the two countries have reached and jointly safeguard peace and tranquility along the border.There was no immediate comment by India’s defence ministry or the army.Last week, India’s India’s external affairs minister, Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, said Indian and Chinese troops were disengaging from the standoff along the countries’ undemarcated border.It’s very much a work in progress, Jaishankar said, adding that both sides agreed on the need to disengage because troops are deployed very close to each other.The disputed border, known as the Line of Actual Control, covers about 3,500 kilometres (2,175 miles) of frontier and stretches from Ladakh in the north to the Indian state of Sikkim in the northeast.India and China fought a border war in 1962 that also spilled into Ladakh.

      "CONTENT : It was a mind-blowing clue. In 2004 Nortel cyber-security advisor Brian Shields investigated a serious breach in the telecom giant’s network. At the time Nortel’s fibre optics equipment was the world’s envy, with 70 per cent of all internet traffic running on Canadian technology. And someone wanted Nortel’s secrets.Shields found that a computer in Shanghai had hacked into the email account of an Ottawa-based Nortel executive. Using passwords stolen from the executive the intruder downloaded more than 450 documents from “Live Link” — a Nortel server used to warehouse sensitive intellectual property.Shields soon found the hacker controlled the accounts of at least seven Nortel executives. This was no random cybercriminal. But who was it?Shields examined the numerical internet addresses of computers extracting Nortel data and found that they were clustered into a tiny pinprick of cyberspace. He was stunned because it looked like a room filled with web servers. Whoever was behind these hackers, Shields believed, seemed to control China’s internet. “It hit me like a ton of bricks,” Shields said. “I knew this couldn’t be happening by chance.”  Shields says the Internet addresses were all registered to Shanghai Faxian Corp., a company with no connection to Nortel that Shields determined was a front with no real business in China. Shields spotted another major clue in Nortel’s logs of network traffic from Saturday, April 24, 2004. According to Shields, in just seven hours a Shanghai Faxian address downloaded 779 documents that day using the account of Nortel CEO Frank Dunn. The hack occurred four days before Dunn was fired, amid an investigation of accounting irregularities. To Shields, this suggested the Shanghai hackers knew exactly what Nortel’s board of directors planned, and the perfect time to extract a massive cache of records.“To date, we have 1,488 documents which were downloaded,” Shields wrote to Nortel’s management in his “data theft” investigation report. “China is the source of all extractions we are aware of.”\n",

      "For months Shields tracked the hackers. But Nortel’s brass was mostly disinterested in the investigation and did little more than change executive account passwords, Shields says. He says they were more focused on year-to-year profits and innovation budgets than protecting Nortel’s precious research. Mike Zafirovski, Nortel’s CEO from 2005 to 2009, did not respond to questions for this story sent to his LinkedIn account. Zafirovski said Shields was known to “cry wolf” and management didn’t believe hacking was a real issue, the Wall Street Journal reported in 2012.So the systematic hacking continued, Shields says. And as a result, Shields says, in 2009 — after getting massively underbid on a series of contracts by China’s state-champion company Huawei — Nortel went bankrupt. In the end, Shields determined China’s government gained complete control of Nortel’s internal systems. After ten years of cyberattacks they could see everything Nortel was doing, he says. The infiltration was so insidious, Shields says, that technicians in China could send encrypted packages of stolen Nortel data to Shanghai and Beijing, by sending Internet commands to a “backdoor” buried in a Nortel computer. To visualize that in the real world — it would be similar to a foreign army constructing a hidden tunnel into Canada’s treasury vault, and marching out unimpeded with gold bars.And it was more than coincidence, Shields believes, that upstart Huawei suddenly replaced Nortel as the world’s dominant internet technology provider.“You could have put Steve Jobs in to run Nortel. But if you are up against a nation-state, Nortel would have failed, without Canadian government intervention,” Shields said. “Canadians just don’t realize the extent of the Chinese government’s involvement in this thing.” Now, more than 20 years after Nortel was first warned of Chinese Communist Party espionage, Hong Kong Canadians such as Cherie Wong say that Ottawa’s failure to protect Nortel and to promptly bar Huawei from modern 5G networks is putting lives at risk.Wong, executive-director of Alliance Canada Hong Kong, an umbrella group for democracy advocates, says Chinese dissident groups are already tracked and targeted by the Chinese Communist Party in Canada, through Chinese social media apps like WeChat and TikTok. And the threat of Huawei 5G Internet in Canada is much worse, she says.“It’s a growing concern whether or not Canada is equipped to combat this level of interference from the Chinese Communist Party,” Wong said. “We are being threatened and harassed. So giving Huawei control of the internet means everything we do will be monitored and tracked and given to the Chinese state.”However, Huawei strongly denies benefiting from the hacking of Nortel, and says it has never been accused of wrongdoing in Canada. The company says it complies with Canadian law and will not spy on Canadians. People’s Republic of China officials in Canada did not respond to detailed questions for this story.“Actionable intelligence”A collection of Canadian military records sought by Global News that could shed light on reports of massive espionage inside Nortel’s former Ottawa research headquarters are currently in a delayed vetting disclosure process, a Canadian military spokesman informed Global News. But Brian Shields says he is certain Ottawa has records that will show Canadians “the truth about what happened to Nortel.”One public record that suggests Ottawa may acknowledge a connection between China’s attack on Nortel and Huawei’s subsequent rise is a coy statement in the summary report of an academic conference held by Canadian Security Intelligence Service.“Ex-Nortel employee Brian Shields, who had led the forensic investigation of the compromise, came forward to disclose his experiences,” the summary report says. “Nortel went bankrupt in 2009. Could there be a link between the Nortel breaches and the rising fortunes of Nortel’s main China-based competitors, Huawei and ZTE?”The report doesn’t answer that question. But a Canadian intelligence expert with knowledge of investigations at Nortel says Ottawa knows exactly what happened in the case.“The evidence that China compromised Nortel is indisputable,” the expert said. “It was being systematically compromised, and everything was being taken. The only question is to what extent that caused Nortel to fall.”Global News has agreed not to name the expert because of his concerns that China’s government is targeting him due to his probes of continuing cyberattacks.The expert said China’s attack on Nortel had many facets, from systematic hacking and planting of electronic bugs and spies inside Nortel facilities, to usage of Chinese PhD students hired by Nortel to steal research, and attempts to compromise Nortel managers by using spies from the Chinese Communist Party and People’s Liberation Army.\n",

      "Many of these allegations are consistent with a February 2020 U.S. Department of Justice indictment that alleges Huawei was involved in a decades-long conspiracy to steal technology from numerous victim companies in efforts to grow its market share, the expert said.“There were visits by Nortel executives going to China to be wined and dined,” the expert said. “It was China’s classic United Front statecraft. And those executives were told in no uncertain terms by their security, ‘You are being recruited, and they will compromise your computers and cellphones.’”But to Shields and former CSIS agents, it seemed Nortel management saw the warnings as exaggerated spy novel plots.“There was detailed actionable intelligence naming people and methods and targets,” the expert said. “There were people that were caught, and devices found, and backdoors found and traced back to the Chinese. And this was escalated up to Nortel leaders. And they didn’t really want to see it.”The expert said Canadian intelligence eventually made the stunning discovery that the Chinese Communist Party was using Chinese organized crime gangsters, in attacks on Nortel. “We have seen organized crime, industry and government all spy and collect on Nortel,” the expert said. “The best way to describe it is between a nation-state, industry and organized crime, there is cooperation to the point of collaboration and collusion. Spying on Nortel became a requirement that satisfied everyone in that community.” \n",

      "In July — in a case that mirrors such allegations — the FBI accused Chinese intelligence services and organized crime groups of colluding in cyberattacks targeting COVID-19 vaccine research and intellectual property in many nations, and Chinese dissidents in Canada.Michel Juneau-Katsuya — former CSIS Asia-Pacific desk chief — confirmed his former CSIS colleague’s observations regarding China’s attack on Nortel.Juneau-Katsuya said he first completed a threat assessment on Nortel in the 1990s, and determined it was China’s top corporate espionage target. Soon CSIS recognized “quite an interesting traffic between Nortel and China,” Juneau-Katsuya says. But his alerts to Nortel fell on deaf ears, he said.Beijing’s United Front — according to a 2020 report from Australian analyst Alex Joske — is the Chinese Communist Party’s vast political influence and espionage network, which uses actors from business, politics and organized crime, to target Western political and business leaders and obtain intellectual property for China.Juneau-Katsuya suspects the Chinese Communist Party used the United Front to take Nortel down and boosted Huawei into its place by providing the company with subsidies and stolen technology. \n",

      "“Nortel is one of those situations, where Canada had the lead internationally, and we let it go. Why? For one, there were forces within the Canadian government. And Huawei received billions from their government. So if I invest billions into you, I will expect to control that operation. And Huawei’s founder is from the People’s Liberation Army. So he knows how to follow orders. So I will make you very rich, and I will give you intelligence support, and I will assist in stealing information.”“In retrospect, it’s clearly written on the wall how this happened. There is enough circumstantial evidence.”Juneau-Katsuya’s former CSIS colleague said prior to Nortel’s collapse Ottawa lacked the strategic foresight and capacity to fight China’s infiltration. The RCMP has jurisdictional and technical challenges investigating state-sponsored cybercrime, the expert said, while CSIS and the CSE, Canada’s cyberintelligence agency, are reluctant to involve themselves in threats against industry. “It was like a game of volleyball when everyone calls the ball but no one goes for it,” the expert said. “The Nortel example was like we have a nation-state against our industrial complex, and we don’t even have an agency mandated to tackle it.”The expert said Canada is starting to recognize the gravity of state-sponsored attacks on private industry but the government still isn’t prosecuting cases.Meanwhile, in the United States, the FBI is opening a new case against Chinese espionage every ten hours, according to director Christopher Wray.It isn’t only China involved in corporate espionage. Western high-tech companies have also faced accusations of IP theft, most often in civil court battles. But according to the FBI the majority of IP theft cases involve a range of actors sponsored by the Chinese Communist Party.“It’s the people of the United States who are the victims of what amounts to Chinese theft on a scale so massive that it represents one of the largest transfers of wealth in human history,” Wray said in July.\n",

      "It remains to be seen what details the FBI will allege in its IP theft indictment against Huawei. And Huawei rejects allegations that it stole technology from companies in the United States in order to grow its market share.But some former Nortel employees recognize the types of allegations made so far.Shields and former Nortel corporate security employee Mike Kennedy told Global News about a case that occurred in the United States from about 2000 to 2003, the same time that Huawei allegedly reverse-engineered Cisco Internet routers according to the FBI indictment. Some Nortel investigators alleged a company linked to Huawei had returned expensive networking equipment to a Nortel office and asked for a refund. Investigators judged the equipment had been completely disassembled and copied for IP theft. Kennedy and Shields said a third-party company was involved in this alleged reverse-engineering case, which resembles the FBI’s allegations against Huawei in the Cisco case.But Huawei says it has never stolen IP from Nortel.Wrestling with Unit 61398For Brian Shields, when the U.S. cybersecurity firm Mandiant pointed to Unit 61398, it made perfect sense. Unit 61398 is an elite People’s Liberation Army cyberwar unit that operates from a Shanghai compound, where it’s estimated hundreds of PLA hackers work day and night, sucking data from Western high-tech industries and political targets. According to Mandiant, the unit is tasked by the Chinese Communist Party’s most elite leaders to steal technology for industries chosen for growth in the party’s periodic five-year plans. According to Mandiant, 61398 seeks broad swathes of intellectual property, business plans, pricing documents, and emails from targeted organizations’ leadership. And in 2013, Mandiant reported Nortel was one of 141 North American entities 61398 attacked. For Shields, 61398’s reported tactics fit everything that he observed about the cluster of internet addresses in Shanghai.Another fact that seems more than coincidental, Shields says, is that Huawei was founded in 1987 by former PLA engineer Ren Zhengfei. And the Chinese Communist Party’s five-year plan for 1986 to 1990 was to “speed up the construction of the energy, communications, telecommunications and raw materials industries.”Equally damning, Shields says, is the intellectual property stolen from Nortel in 2004. The list of records, reviewed by Global News, includes strategy documents titled “Road-map values and challenges to Nortel,” and “Value Chain Dynamics & Industry Structure.”And stolen R&D included documents with titles such as “Photonic Crystals and Large Scale Integration” and “Switching and Tuning Highly Integrated Optical Circuits” and “Speed Data Over Universal Mobile Telecommunications Service.” These Nortel documents relate to its world-leading fibre optics equipment in 2004, and future innovations in 3G, 4G and 5G technology that enable incredibly detailed media to be sent worldwide via the internet.  “These were the crown jewels of Nortel R&D,” Shields said. “It was the future. And the only entity that could benefit from those kinds of documents being stolen, is a competitor.”\n",

      "\t\t\t\tHuawei still hopes to sell 5G equipment to Canada despite pressure from Five Eyes\t\t\t\n",
      "That’s why Shields says he cannot understand why Ottawa would even consider Huawei as a 5G network contender.“I never said Huawei stole our technology, I said the Chinese government stole Nortel’s technology,” he said. “I know what I found, and I know the discussions I had with certain people. Don’t Canadians deserve to know, too?”But Huawei has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing in the Nortel case. Responding to questions from Global News, a spokesman pointed to a 2014 University of Ottawa study, which found that poor management decisions led to Nortel’s downfall, not hacking.“There have been suggestions in the media that Chinese or other foreign espionage agents penetrated internal Nortel networks and computers in order to acquire technology and strategic information and that such action contributed to the downfall of the company,” the University of Ottawa study says. “We found no evidence of this and consider it unlikely.”In an interview, Peter MacKinnon, one of the study authors, said any hacking of Nortel was inconsequential in comparison to Nortel management errors.“There is no way the company could blame its failure on hacking by any party,” MacKinnon said. “It’s a timing thing, by saying Huawei has risen while Nortel went down. But that is not a direct relationship. There is no causation there.”For his part, Ren Zhengfei — who did not respond to an interview request for this story — says Huawei did not steal Nortel’s IP, and it was the 2000 market crash that ultimately did in Nortel.\n",

      "“Unfortunately, Nortel collapsed because the IT bubble burst,” a transcript of Ren’s 2019 interview with the Globe and Mail posted on Huawei’s website says. And there is ample evidence of bad management at Nortel and lingering wounds from the 2000 crash, most notably in the accounting scandals that ultimately led to RCMP charges against Frank Dunn and two other Nortel managers. Dunn and the other two were eventually acquitted. Dunn could not be reached for comment on this story. Astronomically low bidsCommodore Patrick Tyrrell, a retired military intelligence officer and the U.K.’s first cyberwarfare chief, says the Chinese Communist Party has mastered the art of waging war in cyberspace. Cyberwar strategy, Tyrrell says, fits the methods taught by ancient Chinese military general Sun Tzu, who said that territory can be seized without bloodshed, if the attacker patiently exploits an opponent’s vulnerabilities.Huawei’s incredible growth in 20 years under the Chinese Communist Party and guided by PLA engineer Ren Zhengfei has the look of a Sun Tzu strategy, Tyrrell said.“The first thing is, nobody does anything in China without the approval of the Chinese Communist Party. And if you look at Ren Zhengfei and the development of Huawei, it is quite clear this is a person with a military vision,” Tyrrell said. “If you have good intelligence, any military man will want to know the vulnerabilities in a particular company.”“And over the years Huawei was undoubtedly successful in being able to take over Nortel.”In Nortel’s case, Tyrrell says Huawei realized the Canadian giant’s Achilles Heel was its huge and costly inventory of technology assets. Generally, Chinese state-champions can stay afloat as long as Beijing decides to fund them. So they can afford to burn money and undercut competitors in strategic areas, Tyrrell says. But Western companies die when costs rise above sales. By 2008 Nortel was in trouble and it desperately needed to land the 3G Universal Mobile Telecommunications wireless contract offered in Canada by Telus Corp. and BCE Inc.​But Huawei won the deal by underbidding Nortel an estimated 40 per cent. Telus and BCE did not respond to questions from Global News for this story.“You go in and make sure Nortel can’t get the money to keep this behemoth afloat,” Tyrrell said. “Suddenly it collapses, and low and behold you can go pick the bits you want.”A similar case occurred in 2005, Tyrrell says, when Huawei beat out Nortel and U.K. telecom Marconi to construct part of a $17-billion fibre optic network for British Telecom (BT).Huawei underbid the next lowest bidder Marconi by $US 1 billion — about a 40 per cent discount — Tyrrell said. And one year later, Marconi collapsed. “Suddenly this company comes in with this astronomically low bid. And they would also have known if a company needs to get this bid to literally survive,” Tyrrell said. “That is a powerful piece of information.”\n",

      "\t\t\t\tA look at Huawei’s involvement in telecoms networks around the world\t\t\t\n",
      "BT did not respond to questions for this story. But its network deal with Huawei was criticized in a 2013 U.K. parliament intelligence and security committee report.The report summarized allegations made widely against Huawei by companies such as Cisco and Motorola. “It is alleged that Huawei was able to win many contracts by stealing technology from its rivals and then undercutting them on price,” the report says. “But Huawei strenuously denies that it has direct links with the Chinese Government or military, claiming that it receives no financial support from the Chinese Government.”In response to questions about Huawei’s funding, a spokesman sent Global News a YouTube video produced by Huawei which says the company receives a minimal amount of R&D funding from the Chinese government.“Huawei is repeatedly accused of being owned or funded by the Chinese government,” the linked video claims. “Truth is, Huawei is a private company and is 100 per cent employee-owned.”On the BT deal, by 2006, security concerns were discovered on equipment installed by Huawei, the report says. And in 2008 British intelligence warned “theoretically, the Chinese State may be able to exploit any vulnerabilities in Huawei’s equipment in order to gain some access to the BT network.”Finally, in 2011, the U.K. government briefed Huawei in China “on issues discovered with its equipment” the report says, and Huawei promised to address equipment problems.Huawei did not respond to a question from Global News, regarding the alleged equipment problems.Brian Shields and Patrick Tyrrell believe these sorts of network vulnerabilities cannot be mitigated because the Chinese Communist Party ultimately controls Chinese tech companies.And Tyrrell says nothing less than Canada’s sovereignty is riding on Ottawa’s pending 5G decision.  \n",

      "“Whatever happens on your information grid is known in Beijing before it is known in Ottawa in a Huawei 5G network,” Tyrrell said. “What that means is the Canadian government doesn’t have control of its destiny.”The U.S. government has come to a similar conclusion.This year former U.S. national security adviser H.R. McMaster asserted that in 2019, “a series of investigations revealed incontrovertible evidence of the grave national-security danger associated with a wide array of Huawei’s telecommunications equipment.”“Many Huawei workers are simultaneously employed by China’s Ministry of State Security and the intelligence arm of the People’s Liberation Army,” McMaster wrote in The Atlantic. “Huawei technicians have used intercepted cell data to help autocratic leaders in Africa spy on, locate, and silence political opponents.”\n",

      "CONTENT : As world leaders gather in Spain to discuss how to slow the warming of the planet, a spotlight falls on China — the top emitter of greenhouse gases.China burns about half the coal used globally each year. Between 2000 and 2018, its annual carbon emissions nearly tripled, and it now accounts for about 30 per cent of the world’s total. Yet it’s also the leading market for solar panels, wind turbines and electric vehicles, and it manufactures about two-thirds of solar cells installed worldwide.“We are witnessing many contradictions in China’s energy development,” said Kevin Tu, a Beijing-based fellow with the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University. “It’s the largest coal market and the largest clean energy market in the world.”That apparent paradox is possible because of the sheer scale of China’s energy demands.\n",

      "\t\t\t\tNearly 200 countries set to attend climate talks in Madrid\t\t\t\n",
      "But as China’s economy slows to the lowest level in a quarter century — around 6 per cent growth, according to government statistics — policymakers are doubling down on support for coal and other heavy industries, the traditional backbones of China’s energy system and economy. At the same time, the country is reducing subsidies for renewable energy.At the annual United Nations climate summit, this year in Madrid, government representatives will put the finishing touches on implementing the 2015 Paris Agreement, which set a goal to limit future warming to 1.5 to 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. Nations may decide for themselves how to achieve it.China had previously committed to shifting its energy mix to 20 per cent renewables, including nuclear and hydroelectric energy. Climate experts generally agree that the initial targets pledged in Paris will not be enough to reach the goal, and next year nations are required to articulate more ambitious targets.Hopes that China would offer to do much more are fading.Recent media reports and satellite images suggest that China is building or planning to complete new coal power plants with total capacity of 148 gigawatts — nearly equal to the entire coal-power capacity of the European Union within the next few years, according to an analysis by Global Energy Monitor, a San Francisco-based nonprofit.Separately, investment in China’s renewable energy dropped almost 40 per cent in the first half of 2019 compared with the same period last year, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance, a research organization. The government slashed subsidies for solar energy.Last week in Beijing, China’s vice minister of ecology and environment told reporters that non-fossil-fuel sources already account for 14.3 per cent of the country’s energy mix. He did not indicate that China would embrace more stringent targets soon.“We are still faced with challenges of developing our economy, improving people’s livelihood,” Zhao Yingmin said.\n",

      "China is alternately cast as the world’s worst climate villain or its potential clean-energy savior, but both superlatives are somewhat misplaced.As a fast-growing economy, it was always inevitable that China’s energy demands would climb steeply. The only question was whether the country could power a sufficiently large portion of its economy with renewables to curb emissions growth.Many observers took hope from a brief dip in China’s carbon emissions between 2014 and 2016, as well as Chinese leader Xi Jinping’s statement in 2017 that China had “taken a driving seat in international cooperation to respond to climate change.”Today the country’s renewed focus on coal comes as a disappointment.“Now there’s a sense that rather than being a leader, China is the one that is out of step,” said Lauri Myllyvirta, lead analyst at the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air in Helsinki. He notes that several developed countries — including Germany, South Korea and the United States — are rapidly reducing their reliance on coal power.Fossil fuels such as coal, gasoline and natural gas release carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, trapping heat and changing the climate. Coal is the biggest culprit.Last year, coal consumption in the United States hit the lowest level in nearly 40 years, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.One place to consider the rise, pause and rise again of China’s coal sector is Shanxi province — a vast mountainous region in central China.\n",

      "Shanxi is the heart of China’s traditional coal country, dotted with large mines, but also the site of some of the country’s largest solar and wind-power projects, according to state media.During most of the past 30 years of rapid economic growth, the coal business boomed in Shanxi and nearby provinces. As China’s cities and industries expanded, coal supplied much of that power, and China surpassed the U.S. as the world’s top carbon emitter in 2006.But after climbing sharply for two decades, China’s emissions stalled around 2013 and then declined slightly in 2015 and 2016, according to Global Carbon Budget, which tracks emissions worldwide. This dip came as Chinese leaders declared a “war on pollution” and suspended the construction of dozens of planned coal power plants, including some in Shanxi.At the same time, the government required many existing coal operators to install new equipment in smokestacks to remove sulfur dioxide, nitrous oxide and other hazardous substances. About 80% of coal plants now have scrubbers, said Alvin Lin, Beijing-based China climate and energy policy director for the Natural Resources Defense Council, a nonprofit.As a result, the air quality in many Chinese cities, including Beijing, improved significantly between 2013 and 2017. Residents long accustomed to wearing face masks and running home air-filter machines enjoyed a reprieve of more “blue sky days,” as low-pollution days are known in China.Annual levels of PM 2.5 — a tiny but dangerous pollutant — dropped by roughly a third across China between 2013 and 2017, from 61.8 to 42 micrograms per cubic meter, according to scientists at Beijing’s Tsinghua University and other institutions. They made the report in November in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, a peer-reviewed journal.“That’s a big improvement, although in terms of safe air quality, we’re still not there yet,” Lin said. China’s pollution levels are still well above standards set by the World Health Organization.While these retrofitted coal plants emit fewer pollutants that harm human health, the scrubbers do not reduce greenhouse gases. “The new plants are good for air quality, but you still have all that carbon dioxide that goes into the atmosphere,” Lin said.\n",

      "In the past three years, China’s carbon emissions have begun to rise again, according to Global Carbon Budget.That trend was evident in the first half of 2019, when China’s carbon emissions from fossil fuels and concrete production rose 4%, compared with the same period last year, according to Myllyvirta’s preliminary analysis of Chinese government data.The coming winter in Beijing may see a return of prolonged smog, as authorities loosen environmental controls on heavy industry — in part to compensate for other slowing sectors in the economy. Cement and steel production remain both energy intensive and heavily polluting.Permits for new coal plants proliferated after regulatory authority was briefly devolved from Beijing to provincial governments, which see construction projects and coal operations as boosts to local economies and tax bases, said Ted Nace, executive director of Global Energy Monitor.“It’s as though a boa constructor swallowed a giraffe, and now we’re watching that bulge move through the system,” said Nace. In China, it takes about three years to build a coal plant.In November, Premier Li Keqiang gave a speech to policymakers emphasizing the importance of domestic coal to energy security.But because China’s coal-power expansion is growing faster than energy demand, overcapacity “is a serious concern now,” said Columbia University’s Tu.And once new infrastructure is built, it’s hard to ignore.\n",

      "\t\t\t\tChinese companies commit to Alberta oilsands despite setbacks\t\t\t\n",
      "“It will be politically difficult to tear down a brand-new coal plant that’s employing people and supporting a mining operation. It will make it more difficult for China to transition away from coal,” Nace said.The world has already warmed by 1 degree Celsius. All scenarios envisioned by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change for holding planetary warming to around 1.5 degrees Celsius involve steep worldwide reductions in coal-power generation.In that effort, other countries rely on China to manufacture most of the solar panels installed worldwide, according to an analysis in the journal Science co-authored by Jonas Nahm, an energy expert at Johns Hopkins University.“If we have any chance to meet climate targets, we have to do a lot by 2030 — and we won’t be able to do it without China’s clean-energy supply chain,” Nahm said.China’s manufacturing helped bring down the cost of solar panels by 80 per cent between 2008 and 2013. Prices for wind turbines and lithium-ion batteries also dropped significantly, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance.“China has a really mixed record. On the one hand, it’s seen rapidly rising emissions over the past two decades,” Nahm said. “On the other hand, it’s shown it’s able to innovate around manufacturing — and make new energy technologies available at scale, faster and cheaper.”\n",

      "Whether it’s viewed as heroic sacrifice or a violation of international ethical norms, the claim underscores the enormous stakes as China competes with U.S. and British companies to be the first with a vaccine to help end the pandemic — a feat that would be both a scientific and political triumph.“Getting a COVID-19 vaccine is the new Holy Grail,” said Lawrence Gostin, a global public health law expert at Georgetown University. “The political competition to be the first is no less consequential than the race for the moon between the United States and Russia.”China has positioned itself to be a strong contender. Eight of the nearly two dozen potential vaccines in various stages of human testing worldwide are from China, the most of any country. And SinoPharm and another Chinese company already have announced they’re entering final testing.Both China and SinoPharm have invested heavily in a tried-and-true technology — an “inactivated” vaccine made by growing the whole virus in a lab and then killing it, which is how polio shots are made. Leading Western competitors use newer, less proven technology to target the “spike” protein that coats the virus.That protein is “a good place to make our bet,” Dr. Gary Nabel, chief scientific officer of the French pharmaceutical company Sanofi, said at a U.S. biotechnology industry meeting. But “it’s good to have some diversity. I like the fact that there is an inactivated, whole vaccine. That provides an alternative in case one of these should fail.”\n",

The company’s post cites a “spirit of sacrifice” and shows seven men in suits and ties — a mix of scientists, businessmen and one Communist Party official with a background in military propaganda.“The idea of people willing to sacrifice themselves … is pretty much expected in China,” said Yanzhong Huang, a global health expert at the Council on Foreign Relations, a U.S. nonprofit organization.But with corporate and government officials getting vaccinated, other employees “might feel pressure to participate. That would violate the voluntary principle” that is a bedrock of modern medical ethics, Huang said.The first round of human testing — a Phase 1 trial — requires permission from a country’s drug regulators, who decide whether there is enough laboratory and animal evidence to justify the attempt.[ Sign up for our Health IQ newsletter for the latest coronavirus updates ]SinoPharm, which declined to comment for this story, is testing two vaccine candidates that received government permission for Phase 1 trials in mid- to late April.

      "It would not be the only shortcut China is taking. In late June, the government gave special approval for the military to use an experimental vaccine made by another company, CanSino Biologics, skipping the final testing needed to prove if it really works. CanSino now says it’s in talks with four other countries about doing that research.Some participants in the first CanSino clinical trial in March said in social media posts that researchers on the project claimed they had been injected Feb. 29, before regulators gave the study the go-ahead. A researcher said team leader Chen Wei, a renowned military virologist, was the first to receive the experimental vaccine, one of the participants told state-owned Beijing News.CanSino and Chen’s Academy of Military Medical Sciences turned down requests for information and interviews. The National Medical Products Administration, which approves vaccine trials, also declined to comment. In May, a Russian scientist told the RIA Novosti news agency that he and fellow researchers also had vaccinated themselves ahead of approved studies. “It’s self-defence in order for us to continue working” on a vaccine, said Alexander Gintsburg of the Moscow-based Gamaleya research institute.“Everyone is alive and well and cheerful,” he added.Russia’s Association of Clinical Research Organizations condemned the action as a “crude violation of the very foundations of clinical research, Russian law and universally accepted international regulations.” But about a month later, Russia launched its first vaccine study, using the Gamaleya product.Examples of scientists experimenting on themselves abound in medical history.\n",

He was right.And in China in the 1970s, a researcher named Tu Youyou, working in a secret military program, discovered an important anti-malaria drug that she first tested on herself. In 2015, she won a Nobel Prize.With a COVID-19 vaccine, national pride is at stake. President Xi Jinping pledged that any Chinese-made vaccine would be a “global public good.”All this is taking place as China strives to overcome years of drug scandals — the latest coming in 2018 when authorities recalled a rabies vaccine and later announced batches of children’s DPT vaccines, for diphtheria, pertussis and tetanus, were ineffective.Giving the experimental shot early to SinoPharm’s employees “sends a signal to the Chinese people, `You guys should not worry about the safety of the vaccine,”’ Huang said.Scientists vehemently debate self-experimenting because what happens to one or a few people outside of a well-designed study is anecdote, not evidence. More than 600,000 U.S. schoolchildren had to be given Salk’s vaccine or a dummy shot to prove polio protection. It took almost another decade to validate Marshall’s ulcer germ theory, which earned him a Nobel as well.Modern international ethics rules require participants in medical research to be fully informed and to freely consent. In the U.S., studies involving people must receive approval from an “investigational review board,” and most U.S. research institutions explicitly state there is no exception to board approval for self-experimenting.\n",

      "“Employees may not be the best volunteers because employees are in a relationship which is not equal,” said Dr. Derrick Au, bioethics director at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.Still, he said questions about China’s medical ethics might disappear if one of its COVID-19 vaccines ultimately proves to work. “It’s difficult to argue against success,” Au said.William Lee of the Milken Institute, a think-tank in Santa Monica, California, that is tracking COVID-19 vaccine progress, said that because of China’s past scandals, “if they are successful as being the first with a workable product on the market, it had better be so pristine, so pure that people who are outside of China would be willing to buy into it.”Neergaard reported from Alexandria, Va.

      "They were arrested in what is widely seen as retaliation for Canada’s decision to arrest Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou on an extradition request from the United States.David Mulroney, a former Canadian ambassador to China, says that while it is good for Champagne to keep pushing, Canada’s assistance on the coronavirus simply isn’t contingent on what China can do for Canada.“Anything that opens up the channels of communication is a good thing, and we should use the conversation to raise all of our priorities,” he said.“We don’t play games when people are sick, and we shouldn’t allow China to play games with us. Freeing the Michaels isn’t a favour or quid pro quo; it is what we expect of law-abiding states.”[ Sign up for our Health IQ newsletter for the latest coronavirus updates ]Bessma Momani, an international-affairs expert at the University of Waterloo, says China wants only one thing — Meng released — and so-called health diplomacy will not change that.“I hope I’m wrong,” she said.“Why would Champagne say that? It’s kind of raising hope. So, it makes you wonder,” she said. “But at the same time, what would the Chinese get out of doing this? To them, Meng is a really important person … They don’t want to be seen as giving in.”\n",

But even after the coronavirus derailed trade, few want to leave skilled China’s skilled workforce and efficient suppliers of raw materials to move to other countries.Disruptions from the pandemic, on top of the U.S.-Chinese tariff war, fueled warnings that relying too much on China leaves global companies vulnerable to costly breakdowns in the event of disasters or political conflict.\n",

      "Drug makers stand out as one industry that is trying to reduce reliance on Chinese suppliers by setting up sources of raw materials in the United States and Europe. But consumer electronics, medical devices and other industries are sticking with China.“I don’t know of a single company right now that is moving ahead with any plans to move,” said Harley Seyedin, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in South China.China’s explosive rise as the world’s low-cost factory helped to hold down consumer prices and boosted Western corporate profits. But it has fueled political tension over lost American and European blue collar jobs. Governments and industry consultants fret that dependence on China can be a threat to supply chains and possibly national security.Chinese factories assemble most of the world’s smartphones and consumer electronics and a growing share of medical equipment, industrial robots and other high-tech goods. This country is a dominant supplier of vitamin C and ingredients for antibiotics and other medicines. The ruling Communist Party has spent two decades building ports, railways, telecom networks and other facilities that are regarded as among the world’s best.“China still offers an unparalleled supply chain for any industry,” said Jit Lim of Alvarez & Marsal, a management consulting firm.Philip Richardson, who manufactures loudspeakers in Panyu, near Hong Kong, said he has looked at Vietnam and other countries. But he said while their wages might be as low as 60% of China’s, the savings will be eaten up by the cost of giving up his network of Chinese suppliers.“We gave it consideration for about a minute, and it doesn’t make sense,” said Richardson, who has worked in China for 22 years. “When you buy magnets, now you have to pay for transportation and customs duties into other countries, whereas in China we just buy the magnets and they are shipping to us.”\n",

      "President Donald Trump took office in 2017 promising to “bring back our jobs.” The next year’s tariff hikes on goods from China in a fight over technology and trade prompted some exporters to shift production. But changes were small. Most went to other developing countries.The pandemic has raised political pressure for companies to move.The Japanese government, which sees China as a strategic rival, is offering 220 billion yen ($2 billion) to companies that move production to Japan in a virus aid package announced in April. It offers 23.5 billion yen ($220 million) for Japanese companies in China to move to other countries.The tariff war prompted concern about China’s dominance as a supplier of active pharmaceutical ingredients, or APIs, used in antibiotics and vitamins. Some American commentators warned Beijing might retaliate by withholding APIs, though was there no sign that happened.“There will be an increase in the repatriation of national drug supply chains and the re-establishment of national strategic manufacturing capabilities for key drugs,” Sakshi Sikka, who follows the industry for Fitch Solutions, said in an email.\n",

      "In May, the U.S. government awarded a contract worth up to $812 million over 10 years to Phlow Corp., a Virginia company set up to insure against drug shortages by producing ingredients and generics.In Europe, French drugmaker Sanofi SA is setting up an API supplier to reduce reliance on China. Sanofi says the company will be the No. 2 global producer, with annual sales of 1 billion euros by 2022.India and Indonesia have announced plans to increase their own production of pharmaceutical raw materials.Those changes are politically driven and will push up costs, while China’s dominance as a global supplier is unlikely to change in the near future, according to Fitch’s Sikka.Companies including Nike Inc. that used to make shoes, furniture, clothes and other low-margin goods in China have been migrating for a decade to Southeast Asia, Africa and other economies in search of cheaper labor.For higher-end shoes, however, U.S. import duties would have to rise even further before sites such as Ethiopia or Southeast Asia can compete with experienced Chinese workers and flexible suppliers, said Robert Gwynne, who produces women’s shoes for brands including Steve Madden in Dongguan, near Hong Kong.“All my clients say, we have to diversify,” said Gwynne. But when shown costs in other countries, “90% take the China scenario.”Companies also increasingly are tied to China by the appeal of its 1.3 billion consumers at a time when the West’s spending growth is anemic.Makers of automobiles and higher-value goods are spending billions of dollars to expand Chinese production. As the economy reopened, Volkswagen AG said in May it would spend 2 billion euros ($2.2 billion) to buy control of its Chinese electric vehicle venture and a controlling stake in a battery producer.\n",

      "Instead of using China to export, “now a lot of people are producing ‘local for local,’” said Lim.Only 11% of companies that responded to a survey by the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China said they were “considering shifting investment to other countries,” down from 15% last year.Some are leaving to cut labor costs, but the rest “are really committed to China,” said a chamber vice president, Charlotte Roule.Moving factories or finding non-Chinese suppliers to reduce the risk of disruption “means further investment,” Roule said. “Who is going to pay for that?”Charles M. Hubbs, founder of Premier Guard, which makes surgical gowns, masks and other medical devices in China, said he is gearing up to produce face masks in Mississippi to avoid problems with shipping.

They set up factories in Southeast Asia to serve other markets or insure against disruption in China, even if that raised their costs.But as China lifted anti-disease controls on business in March, other Asian economies shut down, forcing companies to shift work back to Chinese factories, which are working overtime to make up the shortfall, said Seyedin.Some U.S. and other leaders are talking about possible tax breaks or other incentives to lure companies home. Trump has threatened to raise taxes on American companies that move from China to any other country but the United States.Even if tax breaks or subsidies go ahead, companies face the costs of setting up a factory in unfamiliar territory, training rookie employees, finding suppliers and possible disruption to customer relations, said Alvarez & Marsal’s Lim.“Shifting is not free,” he said.\n",

      "Jenifer Bartman, a business adviser, explained to Global News that the issue revolves largely around U.S. and China relations — and Canada is caught in the middle.“We have this backdrop of all this uncertainty between these two parties, where Canada is not either party,” Bartman told Global News.She said that means the options for Canada in Meng’s case are limited, while the U.S. has the ability to drop the extradition.Here’s a look at what exactly happened in December and the diplomatic tensions it has spurred — and the possible next steps.WATCH: Chinese embassy asks Canada to suspend all meat exports over ‘forged certificates’The tensions began after Meng was arrested in Vancouver on Dec. 1, 2018 at the request of U.S. authorities, who want to try her on fraud charges.The arrest was met with sharp criticism from China, which called on Canada to release the executive.Huawei also denounced the arrest, saying Meng was taken on “unspecific charges” and “very little information was provided.”\n",

Chinese officials claimed the detentions were not related to the arrest of Meng.The two detained men, former diplomat Michael Kovrig and businessman Michael Spavor, were accused of conspiring together to steal state secrets. Months later, in May, they were formally arrested and charged.No evidence has been provided, and they have not been allowed access to family members or lawyers while remaining in custody.Trudeau has repeatedly denounced the detentions as “arbitrary” and called on China to release the two men.\n",

That’s the painful reality that we’re in, and it’s even more so because it’s not of our own making,” Paris said.He added that Canada’s leverage lies in working with its allies, particularly the United States, as well as others to pressure the Chinese government into releasing them.WATCH: Canada has followed extradition treaty commitments with Meng Wanzhou, says FreelandAnother form of pressure China has placed on Canada includes trade bans on key exports. The country has not acknowledged whether these are related to Meng’s case.Earlier this year, China put limits on Canadian canola products, citing concerns of pesticides and bacteria.Approximately 40 per cent of canola produced by Canadian farmers is supplied to China, according to the Canola Council of Canada.

      "China has also placed limits on soybeans and peas.On Tuesday, China announced it would halt all meat exports from Canada, citing a problem of “forged certificates.” China represented Canada’s third-biggest export market for pork in April 2019, behind the U.S. and Japan.In the same month, beef and veal exports to China totalled more than $63 million, representing 6.1 per cent of Canada’s total — these exports had increased by 344 per cent year over year.WATCH: China bans more Canadian products — What’s the impact on Alberta farmers?Canadian officials have questioned the reasoning for these trade bans, with International Trade Minister Jim Carr asking for proof of China’s claims.“Someone is going to have to come up with some proof that there’s something wrong with the product and that the product originates from Canada,” Carr said Wednesday.While it’s uncertain how long these trade limits will last, Bartman said that China doesn’t just run the risk of hurting Canada — it could also hurt itself.“China is a very large economy, and so in my mind, they can’t be mad at everybody,” she said, noting that China is also dealing with trade disagreements with the U.S.But for Canada specifically, Bartman said officials should think about mitigating the risk these types of trade issues pose by diversifying so it’s not reliant on “a handful of countries.”Amid all this, there has been growing criticism from opposition parties about how the Trudeau government is handling the situation.On Tuesday, Conservative agriculture critic Luc Berthold accused Liberals of “failing Canada’s meat sector” due to the trade ban.“It is clear that this is not an issue of food safety but a political issue caused by Justin Trudeau’s incompetence and weakness on the world stage,” the statement said.“Canada has already lost Chinese market access for canola, soy and now meat. And while this has been taking place, the Trudeau Liberals have failed to take decisive action and stand up to the Chinese government.”WATCH: Trudeau says he had ‘extended conversation’ with Trump about ChinaMeanwhile, officials have said the government is looking at options of resolving the detentions and trade issues. The Trudeau government has also indicated it will not step back on Meng’s extradition proceedings amid pressure from China.“There has been no political interference in this case,” Adam Austen, a spokesman for Freeland, said recently. “It has been entirely about officials taking decisions according to Canada’s commitments.”The Chinese have refused to talk to senior Canadian government officials, including Trudeau and Freeland.That’s why there has been talk of international allies stepping in and vouching for Canadian interests.This week, Trudeau is at the G20 leaders’ summit in Japan, where China is expected to be a focus. Trudeau will meet with European partners to discuss a range of issues, including China.Last week, U.S. President Donald Trump offered to help mediate the troubles between China and Canada.“Anything I can do to help Canada, I will be doing,” Trump said while holding a joint press conference with Trudeau in Washington.\n",

      "Some say that’s a good idea.It should come as no surprise that China doesn’t want to entertain a meeting with the prime minister, which is why Trump remains Canada’s best hope, said David Mulroney, a former Canadian ambassador to China.“That would be the strongest card that could be played in our interests,” he said. “It would be an American card played to say … ‘If you want a normal relationship with us, you’ll leave our allies alone,'” he explained.WATCH: Trump willing to raise Canada’s concerns to Chinese presidentBut China seems set on pressuring Canada to free Meng.In a regular daily news conference at China’s foreign ministry in Beijing on Wednesday, spokesman Geng Shuang again pressured Canada on the release.“Our position is very clear,” said Geng. “We urge the Canadian side to take our solemn concerns seriously, immediately release Ms. Meng Wanzhou and ensure that she returns to China safe and sound.”— With files from Global News reporters Jessica Vomiero, Jesse Ferreras and the Associated Press\n",

Or bring 3,000 legislators to Beijing next month and risk fueling public anger at the government’s handling of the disease.The party was already facing criticism of its heavy-handed censorship, on display during the outbreak, and other social controls under President Xi Jinping, who took power in 2012 and has accrued more political power than any Chinese leader since Mao Zedong.\n",

      "Now, the new disease named COVID-19 has become the party’s biggest crisis since China’s last outbreak of a mystery disease in 2002-2003. SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, killed nearly 800 people and led to accusations Beijing had endangered the public by hiding the disease to avoid disrupting a party leadership transition.There is no indication Xi faces any serious challenge to his position, but public anger could give opponents in the ruling party ammunition to push back against his autocratic rule.“In the long term, I think it will damage him,” said Steve Tsang, director of the China Institute at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London.But for now, even party figures who might be quite happy to see Xi weakened feel obligated to rally around him, Tsang said. “They will not risk allowing a crisis like this to destroy the credibility of the Communist Party itself,” he said.Prominent but powerless, the National People’s Congress, due to open on March 5, endorses the ruling party’s economic and social welfare plans. The premier and Cabinet ministers hold their only news conferences of the year, while delegates mingle at group meetings and talk to foreign reporters — a potentially explosive mix.Party leaders worry delegates “might vent their anger and frustration,” said Willy Lam, a political scientist at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.He said there would likely be “heavy censorship” to make sure angry delegates can’t talk to reporters if the meeting isn’t postponed for the first time since the ultra-radical Cultural Revolution of 1966-1976.\n",

      "The party could postpone holding the gathering to May or later in hopes the outbreak might have abated and the event could be held “without presenting an image that they don’t care how it affects people,” Tsang said.Going ahead with it would contradict Beijing’s intensive anti-disease controls. They have isolated cities with a total of 60 million people and discouraged travel and public gatherings nationwide, disrupting business and imposing mounting economic losses.China has reported more than 1,100 deaths and over 44,600 confirmed cases, most of them in the central city of Wuhan and the surrounding province of Hubei.The party has used its monopoly control of media and pervasive censorship controls to stifle criticism online, over the popular WeChat messaging service and through other social media. But it faces grumbling, including in its own ranks, about Xi’s autocratic rule and assertiveness over the South China Sea and other foreign issues that have strained relations with China’s neighbors.In an essay titled “angry people are no longer afraid,” a law professor at elite Tsinghua University in Beijing criticized “ruling through ‘big data totalitarianism’ and WeChat terrorism.”“Politics is corrupt and the regime is ethically exhausted,” wrote Xu Zhangrun in the essay published on China Digital Times, a website in California.Last year, Xu was suspended from his post and investigated by Tsinghua for criticizing the party’s decision in 2018 to remove presidential term limits from China’s constitution, allowing Xi to stay in office indefinitely.\n",

      "The party has also faced an outburst of public anger following the death this month of Li Wenliang, a physician in Wuhan who was reprimanded in December for warning about the virus. Local authorities were accused of discouraging doctors from talking about the outbreak to avoid overshadowing Hubei province’s major political event, a legislative meeting in preparation for the National People’s Congress.Comments left on Li’s microblog account accused Wuhan authorities of valuing politics over public safety.Party leaders have tried to divert anger by allowing state media and social media users to criticize local Wuhan officials.The party faced similar criticism over SARS.The first cases were reported in November 2002, but the party said the disease was under control. It didn’t declare an emergency until after then-President Jiang Zemin handed over power to Hu Jintao in March 2003 in a once-a-decade transition.Xi has amassed vast authority after being named party general secretary in 2012, effectively becoming leader for life. He took over as leader of the military and sidelined rivals including the No. 2 party figure, Premier Li Keqiang. Xi appointed himself to head party bodies that oversee economic reform and other important issues.It was a break with two previous generations of leadership, which were based on consensus among members of the ruling party’s inner circle of power, the Standing Committee.That has allowed Xi to push through ambitious plans, including the multi-billion-dollar Belt and Road Initiative, to expand trade by building ports, railways and other trade-related infrastructure across Asia, Africa and the Middle East.\n",

      "But it also makes it harder for Xi to deflect blame. This week, he broke a lengthy public silence about the disease by visiting a neighborhood of Beijing that has had about 340 cases of the virus.Xi is personally identified with a slew of thorny issues, from Beijing’s tariff war with Washington and prickly relations with Taiwan, the self-ruled island the Communist Party claims as its territory, to anti-government protests in Hong Kong and the mass detention of ethnic Muslim minorities in the Xinjiang region in the northwest.Xi has appeared to try to distance himself from the latest virus outbreak by naming the premier, Li Keqiang, on Jan. 26 to head the party group in charge of anti-disease work.The next day, Li flew to Wuhan, met with doctors and nurses and visited a supermarket.“This looks like an attempt to shift blame to Li Keqiang if progress in fighting the disease is unsatisfactory,” Lam said.\n",

      "Taiwan, the self-ruled island that China claims as its own, also confirmed its first case, a woman who had returned from working in Wuhan, on Tuesday.Taiwan, which has close economic and people-to-people links with China despite political tensions, on Monday set up an epidemic response command center to coordinate the island’s response to the virus. More than 1,000 beds were prepared in isolation wards in case the virus spreads further.The mounting anxiety was transmitted to regional markets. China’s onshore yuan fell 0.6 per cent, its biggest daily drop since Aug. 26, 2019, while airline and travel stocks fell across the region.European shares also slipped on mounting concerns about the impact of the outbreak, with luxury goods firms particularly hard-hit on worries about weaker demand from Chinese consumers.The virus can cause pneumonia, with symptoms including fever and difficulty in breathing. As those symptoms are similar to many other respiratory diseases, extra screening is needed.The origin of the virus has yet to be identified, but the primary source is most likely animal, according to WHO. Chinese officials have linked the outbreak to a seafood market in Wuhan.“The outbreak of a SARS-like coronavirus in Wuhan is developing into a major potential economic risk to the Asia-Pacific region now that there is medical evidence of human-to-human transmission,” said Rajiv Biswas, Asia Pacific Chief Economist for IHS Markit, in an email statement.So far, the WHO has not recommended trade or travel restrictions but such measures could be discussed at Wednesday’s emergency meeting.\n",

      "The increase in outbound travel during the five-day holiday, one of China’s peak tourism periods each year, would help lift the travel and hospitality sectors that have been hit hard by disruption from the coronavirus pandemic.The spike in tourism was led by increases in travellers from Wuhan, Beijing, Dalian, Tianjin and Jinan, with China having eased curbs on travel and relaxed rules on quarantine amid dwindling cases of the coronavirus.Hundreds of sightseeing spots have also been reopened, including the Forbidden City in Beijing, as authorities sought to revive and repair local economies.\n",

      "Firefighters responded to reports of papers being burned on the consulate grounds Tuesday night but were barred entry, according to Houston news media reports.The U.S., in a brief statement, did not provide any details on why the consulate in Texas was targeted.“The United States will not tolerate (China’s) violations of our sovereignty and intimidation of our people, just as we have not tolerated (its) unfair trade practices, theft of American jobs, and other egregious behaviour,” said the statement, which was attributed to State Department spokesperson Morgan Ortagus.The consulate was informed of the decision Tuesday, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said, calling it “an outrageous and unjustified move that will sabotage relations between the two countries.”“The unilateral closure of China’s consulate general in Houston within a short period of time is an unprecedented escalation of its recent actions against China,” Wang said at a daily news briefing in Beijing.He warned of firm countermeasures if the U.S. does not reverse itself. Besides its embassy in Beijing, the U.S. has five consulates in mainland China, according to its website. They are in Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu, Wuhan and Shenyang.Houston media reports said authorities responded to reports of a fire at the Chinese Consulate. Witnesses said people were burning paper in what appeared to be trash cans, the Houston Chronicle reported, citing police.\n",

He also said that U.S. diplomats in China engage in infiltration activities.“If we compare the two, it is only too evident which is engaged in interference, infiltration and confrontation,” Wang said.He also said that the Chinese Embassy in Washington has received bomb and death threats, and accused the U.S. government of fanning hatred against China.\n",

      "CONTENT : China is set to impose new national security legislation on Hong Kong after last year’s pro-democracy unrest, a Chinese official said on Thursday, drawing a warning from President Donald Trump that Washington would react “very strongly” against the attempt to gain more control over the former British colony.The U.S. State Department also warned China, saying a high-degree of autonomy and respect for human rights were key to preserving the territory’s special status in U.S. law, which has helped it maintain its position as a world financial centre.China’s action could spark fresh protests in Hong Kong, which enjoys many freedoms not allowed on the mainland, after often violent demonstrations of 2019 plunged the city into its deepest turmoil since it returned to Beijing’s rule in 1997.Trump, who has ratcheted up his anti-China rhetoric as he seeks re-election in November, told reporters “nobody knows yet” the details of China’s plan. “If it happens we’ll address that issue very strongly,” he said.Zhang Yesui, spokesman for the China’s National People’s Congress, said details of the legislation would be given on Friday when the parliament holds its annual session.“In light of the new circumstances and need, the National People’s Congress (NPC) is exercising its constitutional power” to establish a new legal framework and enforcement mechanism to safeguard national security in Hong Kong, he told a briefing.\n",

      "Wall Street ended lower on Thursday as U.S.-China tensions raised doubts about a trade deal reached this year between the world’s two largest economies. Tensions have heightened significantly in recent weeks, with bitter exchanges over the coronavirus.Pro-democracy demonstrators have for years opposed the idea of national security laws, arguing they could erode the city’s high degree of autonomy, guaranteed under the “one country, two systems” formula in place for two decades.A senior Hong Kong government official said details on the move and its implementation remained unclear, but Hong Kong media have reported the legislation would ban secession, foreign interference, terrorism and all seditious activities aimed at toppling the central government.U.S. State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus said any Chinese move to impose legislation that did not reflect the will of the people would be highly destabilizing and met with strong condemnation.READ MORE: Hong Kong protests gain steam as China’s coronavirus infections dwindleEnding Hong Kong’s special status would be a big blow for U.S. firms. The State Department says 85,000 U.S. citizens lived in Hong Kong in 2018 and more than 1,300 U.S. companies operate there, including nearly every major U.S. financial firm.A previous attempt to introduce Hong Kong national security legislation, known as Article 23, in 2003 was met with mass peaceful protests and shelved.Online posts had urged people in Hong Kong to protest on Thursday night and dozens were seen shouting pro-democracy slogans in a shopping mall as riot police stood nearby.Opposition lawmakers said the move would gravely wound Hong Kong’s reputation as a financial centre and its autonomy.READ MORE: China calls Hong Kong protesters a ‘virus’, says city won’t be calm until they’re removed“If this move takes place, ‘one country, two systems’ will be officially erased,” said democratic lawmaker Dennis Kwok. “This is the end of Hong Kong.”Daniel Russel, the top U.S. diplomat for Asia until early in the Trump administration, suggested Chinese President Xi Jinping might see “muscle-flexing” on Hong Kong as a means to make up for a series of setbacks, most notably the coronavirus pandemic that began in China – despite the risk of severe economic consequences for Hong Kong, China and others.\n",

      "CONTENT : A veteran Chinese-Canadian politician is coming forward to reveal that upon landing at the Shanghai airport in November 2015, Chinese authorities improperly detained him, separated him from his wife for eight hours, confiscated and searched his B.C. government phone and accused him of “endangering national security” before cancelling his visa and ordering him to fly back to Canada.And since his detention, he said, China’s interference in Canadian society has increased in myriad ways, including aggressive attempts to influence our political system and elected leaders, control Chinese-Canadian immigrants, and silence all criticism of Beijing’s policies. Richard Lee, the B.C. Liberal MLA for Burnaby from 2001 to 2017, provided Global News with a letter outlining his allegations, sent on Jan. 1, 2019, to then-foreign affairs minister Chrystia Freeland and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.Lee’s letter says he had planned to go public with his story after returning to Vancouver from Shanghai, but decided not to “in consideration of the potential damage to the relationship between China and Canada.”\n",
      "READ MORE: \n",
      "\t\t\t\tUBCM to ban foreign funding following outcry over China-funded cocktail party\t\t\t\n",
      "But since 2015, Lee claims he has seen increasing interference in Canada’s political system by China’s government, including private warnings from consular officials that Canadian politicians refrain from speaking out on issues that might anger China.And after China jailed Canadians Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor on vague national security grounds in late 2018, Lee says he felt reminded of the injustice in his own case.“I was accused of endangering China’s national security,” Lee said. “So my point is, it could happen to anyone. If someone in Canada does something not to China’s liking, your visa will be cancelled. It’s a serious situation.”He decided to put his case on the record with his letter emailed to China’s then-ambassador Lu Shaye and Freeland, and ‘CCed to Trudeau, and Canada’s then-justice minister, Jody Wilson-Raybould.About a year later, Lee had not received any response from Canada’s government, until Global News started to investigate his story. Finally on Wednesday, the day after Global News forwarded a copy of Lee’s complaint to China’s embassy in Vancouver along with questions for this story, Trudeau’s office emailed Lee “to acknowledge receipt of your correspondence.”But Lee says China’s interference in Canadian politics is already deeply ingrained, and he believes China’s Consulate General in Vancouver is pressuring Chinese-Canadian community groups to ostracize him. “I have freedom of speech and association, but (the Chinese consulate) said I could not do that in Canada,” Lee said. “There is many Chinese-Canadian associations that don’t consider themselves to be free, to speak against this interference.”So Lee has decided now, the Canadian public should hear his story.Since being elected for the B.C. Liberals in 2001, Lee says he has promoted good relations and trade with China. But he also believed in vocally supporting democracy and made a habit of commemorating the Tiananmen Square massacre every June 4 by joining candle-lighting services in front of China’s embassy in Vancouver.This is the kind of activity — along with publicly supporting Taiwan’s independence or democracy protesters in Hong Kong, or speaking out on China’s persecution of religious groups or mass detentions of Uighurs — that China’s foreign services are increasingly suppressing internationally, according to Lee and other community leaders interviewed by Global News.Lee said he was aware some of his statements displeased China but didn’t see any danger in late 2015, when he and his wife decided to celebrate their 30th anniversary with a trip to Shanghai. When they landed in Shanghai, Lee says, he was separated from his wife and placed in a room with two officials.“My wife was scared, because she didn’t know what was happening to me,” Lee said. “We could not communicate.”The officials took Lee’s personal phone and his B.C. government Blackberry, Lee said. They returned and demanded access to Lee’s password-protected Blackberry, which required Lee to reveal his passcode. \n",

      "Lee says he knew this could give the Chinese officials access to confidential Canadian government information, but he thought the Chinese officials were more interested in looking into his personal activities in Canada, as a Chinese community leader. Also, he was afraid he would be separated from his wife for days, or worse.So Lee gave them his passcode, and he believes the officials examined his B.C. legislative assembly account emails, while he was made to wait for about eight hours.“I was watched by one of the people, and sometimes I was left alone sitting there,” Lee said. “When I went to the washroom, I was accompanied by two people.”As the phone examination continued, Lee says he asked: “Why I’m here? And they said, what you did, is considered endangering China’s national security. They did not specify the reasons at all, of the allegations against me.”He says he also asked to speak to the Canadian Consulate General in Shanghai and the ambassador of Canada, but was refused.Finally, the officials returned his phone, and demanded that he and his family leave China immediately. Lee says he asked if they could fly to Hong Kong instead, but was told to return to Vancouver.When he arrived in British Columbia, Lee says he disclosed the circumstances of his detention, and the examination of his B.C. government Blackberry, to his B.C. Liberal caucus. Lee says he does not know whether B.C. Liberal leaders ever informed the RCMP about his Shanghai detention, and the possibility that the Chinese government obtained confidential B.C. government information by examining Lee’s Blackberry. The party has not answered questions from Global News on Lee’s allegations.In the absence of any explanation of China’s action against him, Lee says he believed he must have been blacklisted by the PRC, for ignoring repeated warnings about commemorating the Tiananmen Square massacre.The warnings had come directly — according to Lee — from Liu Fei, China’s then-consul general in Vancouver. But the consulate’s warnings were also relayed, Lee said, through the B.C. Liberal party.“On one occasion the consul general, Liu Fei, she told me directly I should not attend the commemoration of the June 4 services,” Lee said. “And she complained to some of my colleagues that I should not (attend June 4 services). Inside the party, they informed me that they had been told by the consul general, I should not do this.”  Lee told Global News that he’s reluctant to name the B.C. Liberals that relayed the Chinese consulate’s warnings to him. But he pointed to a senior B.C. Liberal government minister, and said the party caucus had a number of meetings regarding Liu’s statement.The senior B.C. Liberal leader could not be reached by deadline to answer questions for this story.The B.C. Liberal party has been forwarded a number of questions for this story and has yet to respond to the allegations made by Lee.Carlie Pochynok, director of communications for the B.C. Liberal caucus, provided this statement.“In regards to Richard Lee reporting his phone confiscation to the Party and whether or not anyone did anything with that info, I don’t know,” the statement says. “I don’t know who he reported this to and as this was almost five years ago, a large portion of leadership from that time is no longer part of this organization and I can’t speak on their behalf.”Liu left her post in 2017 and was replaced as consul general by Tong Xiaoling. The consulate in Vancouver has not yet responded to questions from Global News regarding allegations in this story.Global News asked B.C. Attorney General David Eby if he is concerned that confidential B.C. government information may now be in the hands of the Chinese government.“It’s a concerning and disturbing story on a number of levels, about what may have been on (Lee’s) phone,” Eby said. “It’s a story that has international implications for Canada and our relationship with China, and that is why I will be writing to the federal attorney general, and asking the federal government to look into this, and offering B.C.’s assistance, to get to the bottom of whatever happened.”\n",
      "COMMENTARY: \n",
      "\t\t\t\tCanada’s new foreign minister must figure out how to deal with China\t\t\t\n",
      "Global News forwarded Lee’s letter to the Chinese consulate on Tuesday at 3:40 p.m. and requested interviews with Chinese officials in Canada by Wednesday afternoon. The Chinese government has not responded.But on Wednesday afternoon, Lee received an email from Trudeau’s office that is ‘CCed to Canada’s new foreign affairs minister, Francois-Phillipe Champagne.“On behalf of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, I would like to acknowledge receipt of your correspondence,” the letter says. “Please be assured your comments have been carefully reviewed. In your correspondence, you raise an issue that falls within the portfolio of (Champagne.)”“I haven’t talked to them yet,” Lee said on Wednesday. “If they call me, I will answer any questions.”According to Vancouver journalist Gao Bingchen, founder of a B.C. pro-democracy group, he knows at least one other Chinese-Canadian has been detained while others may be blacklisted by the PRC for their activities in Canada, and face, threats and pressure when they return to China.In an interview with Global News, Gao said that one member of his pro-democracy group described such a detention.“The member returned to Anhui province in China, and the national security representatives held her. They released her and they asked her to continue the relationship with our democracy group, but they wanted her to report back to national security (about the group members in Vancouver.),” Gao said.\n",

      "The Chang’e 5 touched down Tuesday on the Sea of Storms on the moon’s near side. Its mission: collect about two kilograms (four pounds) of lunar rocks and bring them back to Earth, the first return of samples since Soviet spacecraft did so in the 1970s. Earlier, the U.S. Apollo astronauts brought back hundreds of pounds of moon rocks.The landing site is near a formation called the Mons Rumker and may contain rocks billions of years younger than those retrieved earlier.The ascent vehicle lifted off from the moon shortly after 11 p.m. Beijing time Thursday (1500 GMT) and was due to rendezvous with a return vehicle in lunar orbit, then transfer the samples to a capsule, according to the China National Space Administration. The moon rocks and debris were sealed inside a special canister to avoid contamination.It wasn’t clear when the linkup would occur. After the transfer, the ascent module would be ejected and the capsule would remain in lunar orbit for about a week, awaiting the optimal time to make the trip back to Earth.Chinese officials have said the capsule with the samples is due to land on Earth around the middle of the month. Touchdown is planned for the grasslands of Inner Mongolia, where China’s astronauts have made their return in Shenzhou spacecraft.Chang’e 5’s lander, which remained on the moon, was capable of scooping samples from the surface and drilling two metres (about six feet).While retrieving samples was its main task, the lander also was equipped to extensively photograph the area, map conditions below the surface with ground penetrating radar and analyze the lunar soil for minerals and water content.\n",

      "Right before the ascent vehicle lifted off, the lander unfurled what the space administration called the first free-standing Chinese flag on the moon. The agency posted an image — apparently taken from the lander — of the ascend vehicle firing its engines as it took off.Chang’e 5 has revived talk of China one day sending astronauts to the moon and possibly building a scientific base there, although no timeline has been proposed for such projects.China launched its first temporary orbiting laboratory in 2011 and a second in 2016. Plans call for a permanent space station after 2022, possibly to be serviced by a reusable space plane.While China is boosting co-operation with the European Space Agency and others, interactions with NASA are severely limited by U.S. concerns over the secretive nature and close military links of the Chinese program.\n",

      "Barton is leading Canada’s efforts in China to win the release of Kovrig and Spavor, who were arrested and imprisoned on Dec. 10, 2018, in what is widely seen as retaliation for Canada’s arrest of Chinese high-tech executive Meng Wanzhou.After months of delay, Barton was most recently granted on-site virtual consular access to Kovrig and Spavor in November, following similar virtual visits with the two Canadians a month earlier.“We were obviously very frustrated at not being able to get access even virtually because as far as we know . . . the virus doesn’t go through televisions,” said Barton.The Chinese government has charged Kovrig and Spavor with espionage but the Canadian government says their detention is arbitrary and has called repeatedly for their release.Barton said it wasn’t just Canada that was blocked by the Chinese from visiting prisoners charged in national security cases; the U.S. and Britain faced similar restrictions.When Barton was able to see them, he said he was able to verify they were in good physical and mental condition.“They are robust,” said Barton, who was testifying from Beijing via video link. “You would be very impressed by seeing both of them.”\n",

      "Spavor is being held in a prison in the city of Dandong near the North Korean border while Kovrig is in a Beijing area prison.“It’s a strange thing. We fly to these places, or drive to them in the case of Beijing. And I know that the Michaels (are) literally sort of on the other side of the wall, but you’ve got, you know, two big TVs,” he said. “It’s like this.”Barton’s main purpose for testifying was to describe the three-day Chinese government-controlled visit to Tibet that he and nine other Western diplomats undertook in October. He said he remains concerned about the human rights situation there and that they only saw what the Chinese wanted them to see.Even though the area is filled with security cameras, as is the capital of Beijing, Barton said he wandered off a couple of times to visit with locals without his Chinese government minders in tow.He said Canada is not reluctant to raise human rights concerns with China even though some people think Canada is in the Chinese “doghouse” these days. He also said that even though he knew the visit to Tibet would be controlled, it sent a signal to local people that the outside world still cared about their plight.Thursday marked Barton’s second appearance before the committee this year, following testimony in February in which he declared “the chill is real” in Canadian relations with China.In February, Barton described an angry, emotional meeting during his first diplomatic contact with his Chinese counterparts after being appointed to the post in 2019 after a long career in business, which included being the global managing director of the consulting giant McKinsey & Co.His position in the company gave Barton high level access in China and across Asia, something the Trudeau government is hoping to leverage to win freedom for Kovrig and Spavor while maintaining economic relations with its second largest trading partner.\n",

      "“At the very beginning, our strategy was designed for China and for Wuhan. Soon after that in June and July we adjusted our strategy, that is to face the world,” Yin said, referring to the Chinese city were the virus first emerged.“Our goal is to provide the vaccine to the world including the U.S., EU and others,” Yin said.Stringent regulations in the U.S., European Union, Japan and Australia have historically blocked the sale of Chinese vaccines. But Yin said that could change.SinoVac is developing one of China’s top four vaccine candidates along with state-owned SinoPharm, which has two in development, and military-affiliated private firm CanSino.More than 24,000 people are participating in clinical trials of CoronaVac in Brazil, Turkey, and Indonesia, with additional trials scheduled for Bangladesh and possibly Chile, Yin said. SinoVac chose those countries because they all had serious outbreaks, large populations and limited research and development capacity, he said.He spoke to reporters during a tour of a SinoVac plant south of Beijing. Built in a few months from scratch, the plant is designed to enable SinoVac to produce half a million vaccine doses a year. The bio-secure facility was already busy on Thursday filling tiny bottles with the vaccine and boxing them. The company projects it will be able to produce a few hundred million doses of the vaccine by February or March of next year.\n",

      "SinoVac is also starting to test small doses of CoronaVac on children and the elderly in China after noticing rising numbers of cases globally among those two groups.Yin said the company would prioritize distribution of the vaccine to countries hosting human trials of CoronaVac.While the vaccine has not yet passed the phase 3 clinical trials, a globally accepted standard, SinoVac has already injected thousands of people in China under an emergency use provision.Yin said he was one of the first to receive the experimental vaccine months ago along with researchers after phase one and two of human trials showed no serious adverse effects. He said that self-injecting showed his support for CoronaVac.“This is kind of a tradition of our company,” Yin said, adding that he had done the same with a hepatitis vaccine under development.Earlier this year, China permitted “emergency use” of vaccine candidates for at-risk populations like border personnel and medical workers if companies could show “good safety and good antibodies” from tests of about 1,000 people, Yin said.\n",

About 90 per cent of the company’s staff have received it.“We are confident that our research of the COVI-19 vaccines can meet the standards of the U.S. and EU countries,” Yin said.\n",

      "CONTENT : China’s decision to ban the trade and consumption of wild animals is the country’s latest bid to win the coronavirus fight.It’s a welcome development, but one experts say faces significant hurdles.“The concern is enforcement. How effective will government enforcement be?” said Yanzhong Huang, a public health researcher at the Council on Foreign Relations and director of global health studies at Seton Hall University.“But there’s a way of thinking in China. The norm is that those live animals are more delicious, that they’re better for you. That’s very much entrenched in China.“So you also have to replace a way of thinking.”\n",

      "\t\t\t\tCoronavirus spread renewing concerns about how animals are slaughtered\t\t\t\n",
      "The new virus sweeping the world is believed to have started in a “wet market” in Wuhan, China, where, like many other markets in Asia, bats, snakes, civets and other animals are tied up or stacked in cages. Many are killed on-site to ensure freshness, which is highly valued in Chinese culture and cuisine.The markets are considered breeding grounds for new and dangerous infections, health experts say, because the close contact between humans and live exotic animals makes it easier for viruses to jump between species.It’s believed SARS originated from the same type of market in 2002.Now, as COVID-19 spreads throughout China and widely across borders, there has been a renewed focus on the practice.With two epidemics tied to these markets, it’s likely China is far more serious about enforcing the ban this time around, said Lynette Ong, a political science professor at the University of Toronto who specializes in China.However, a ban isn’t a foolproof tactic, she said.[ Sign up for our Health IQ newsletter for the latest coronavirus updates ]“The government does have the capacity to really implement this policy, but having said that, it’s sort of like illicit drugs — the more you ban, the more you encourage the development of the black market. That’s just the way economics works,” she told Global News.During SARS, the Chinese government opted to ban the sales of exotic species, but the ban was later lifted. There was a crackdown on wildlife trafficking — tighter regulations and oversight — but it faded.“It’s going to be very difficult to get rid of it altogether because typically these sales are very localized,” she said.\n",

      "Tradition also stands in the way.Wet markets are considered a traditional form of food retail in Asia. They have persisted across the continent, despite the growth of big-box grocers.“The old norm needs to be replaced by a new norm, being that it’s a bad idea to consume these wild animals,” Huang said. “Not only because of the risk you take of getting infected, but also that it’s really not as delicious as something you’d get in a store.”He believes public education is what’s missing.“Because of the scale and the seriousness of the problem, I think they might be more inclined to agree that eating and selling these animals is not a good idea, but it needs to be complemented with an education campaign,” he said.“You need to teach people that it’s not a good idea. Government leaders need to come out and say, ‘This is bad for your health.’ We’re not seeing that right now.”COVID-19 and SARS are not the only viruses that can be traced back to animals. It’s believed Bird flu originated in chickens at a market in Hong Kong. Ebola is thought to be sourced from the killing and sale of bushmeat in Africa.Scientists have not yet determined exactly how the new coronavirus first infected people, but all signs so far point to the now-shuttered Wuhan market.China moved to suspend the trade and consumption of wildlife in January. The complete ban was announced earlier this week, although it’s unclear if it’s permanent.\n",

      "CONTENT : For Anastasia Lin, the breakthrough came shortly after her speech at Oxford University in early February.The 30-year-old Chinese-Canadian actress and beauty pageant winner had been speaking for years about the Chinese Communist Party’s worldwide influence operations, and its human rights abuses. But she had never received vocal support from her community, she says, until her widely shared speech struck a nerve amidst Beijing’s coronavirus response.Born in Hunan, China, her family immigrated to Vancouver, B.C. when she was 13.When she started to take acting jobs, almost by accident, some of the roles drew her into a community of Chinese dissidents and human rights advocates. She describes a process of “awakening” to the indoctrination of her education in China, where citizens are taught to view the West as an enemy and the Communist Party as the sole guardian of Chinese people worldwide.Lin became so vocal in her criticism of the Communist Party’s influence tactics in Chinese immigrant communities, that after she was crowned Miss World Canada in 2015, and she sought a visa to compete for the world title in China, authorities there denied her application.\n",

      "\t\t\t\tUnited Front groups in Canada helped Beijing stockpile coronavirus safety supplies\t\t\t\n",
      "For the University of Toronto graduate, speaking about China’s politics came at a personal cost.She says her family has been harassed and called “anti-Chinese.” Even more stunning, for Lin, her mother in Vancouver, informed her that Chinese national security agents had questioned a family business colleague in China.“My mom told me her colleague was visited by Chinese Secret police and they asked about me, in recent years,” Lin said.“It just made me think, how do they even know about me and care that much?”The Chinese consulate in Ottawa has not responded to a request for comment on the allegations in this story.Since winning the Miss World Canada title in 2015, Lin has come to the belief ⁠— through quiet conversations among trusted friends and colleagues ⁠— that most Chinese-Canadians are opposed to the Chinese Communist Party’s so-called “United Front” networks that seek to control immigrant groups. But in her words, many Chinese-heritage citizens worldwide are “suffering in silence and in isolation.”“If I speak up, people of my background would feel tremendous fear. Many people have tremendous anger towards the Chinese Communist Party, but also tremendous fear,” Lin said. “After I won Miss World Canada, I would run into Chinese in supermarkets in Scarborough. They would come up to me and tell me in secret, just in a very quiet voice, ‘what you are doing is brave.’”\n",

      "Even with this quiet support, while Lin grew into her role as a Chinese-Canadian leader, she says it was painful to read comments about herself online. She says “trolls” that criticize what they term as “anti-Chinese hostile forces” can be especially vicious toward women.But something changed for Lin after her speech at Oxford, on February 6.Her message resonated powerfully, and thousands responded positively. Whether the rest of the world understood it or not, China was engaged in a cold war with democracies, Lin said.“In considering Communist China’s threat, we could talk about many angles,” Lin said in her speech. “We can talk about how its censorship of information endangers global health, and now the coronavirus outbreak is a perfect example. I can tell you personally how the Chinese Communist Party targets family of political opponents abroad.”And Lin took direct aim at the Communist Party’s influence networks.“Beijing backs numerous front organizations and civil-society groups in Western societies, including Chinese student and professional associations. These groups act as extensions of the state and party apparatus. They are mobilized to influence the outcome of local elections and influence government policy in the West,” Lin said.“These groups are controlled and financed by the Chinese government through the United Front Work Department and the Office of Overseas Chinese Affairs, but these connections are concealed from the public.”Within days of the speech, she had 25,000 new Instagram followers. A YouTube recording of her speech posted April 14, has been viewed over 600,000 times. And according to YouTube statistics, 23,000 viewers have approved of Lin’s message, while 2,600 disapproved. About 6,600 have commented. And for the first time, Lin says she feels empowered to read the comments, without feeling attacked.“I’m daring to read the comments,” she said.“They are saying things like ‘This is such a historical speech. You are our proudest daughter.’”Lin believes it is the Communist Party’s handling of the coronavirus outbreak, which has triggered an unprecedented moment of openness for the Chinese diaspora.“I think the community is being more willing to be vocal about the pandemic coverup and that gave more ordinary Chinese people and diaspora courage to speak up for the first time,” she said. Lin said she estimates a majority of Chinese are against Beijing’s attempts to censor information and manage the pandemic.“Really, the influence issue is just an extension of that,” she said.Lin and a Chinese-Canadian academic that asked not to be named, and Canadian journalist Jonathan Manthorpe, an expert on China’s United Front diaspora influence operations, all told Global News they believe that Canadian leaders and the broad society need to recognize the pressure exerted on Chinese-Canadian community groups.The Chinese-Canadian academic ⁠— who is studying Beijing’s influence networks ⁠— asked to remain anonymous, due to concerns that officials in Chinese consulates in Canada could interfere with research. The academic said Beijing’s efforts to control citizens have recently increased, due to the pandemic crisis.“It is very complicated ⁠— many people are silent because the crackdown in China is harsh right now,” the academic said. “It is very much like what happened in the Cultural Revolution in the 1960s and ’70s, right now.”The academic said they believe Canadian society at large needs to make greater efforts to understand the diverse political views of the Chinese diaspora. Also, the academic said a multiplicity of voices from Chinese-Canadians in mainstream media, would improve understanding.“I think the Canadian government and public needs to be educated about China’s attempts to influence the overseas population,” the academic said. “You see that the Chinese embassy and consulates are trying to get members of the diaspora to work on its behalf. The increasing control of the media in Canada is part of the United Front, how they are reporting. It is important, for the sake of this country, for us to research this.”In an interview regarding the United Front’s influence networks in Canada, Manthorpe said the United Front has been vastly increased under President Xi Jinping and seeks to control the Chinese diaspora and use community members ⁠— only on the basis of their Chinese ancestry ⁠— as foreign agents for Beijing’s strategic goals.\n",

      "But Manthorpe said the United Front diaspora control operations have only been successful “to a limited degree.”“It certainly hasn’t been very successful amongst the Canadians of Chinese heritage. I mean, the antipathy towards Beijing in Richmond, Scarborough, wherever, is huge and building,” Manthorpe said.And yet, Canada has largely failed in exposing United Front operations and protecting Chinese-Canadians from the pressure exerted on them, he said.“I think we need a lot more openness from Ottawa, identifying these United Front organizations,” Manthorpe said.“And I think it’s also important to give support to Canadians of Chinese heritage who are under attack by these infiltrators.”Lin also said leadership from Ottawa has been lacking on the United Front threat.“The public voice of Canadian authorities is so crucially needed,” she said. “The fear to speak up (in the Chinese-Canadian community) is enlarged by the silence in the mainstream society. Because the Chinese Communist Party are so good at speaking into the race identity politics, that if you speak against China’s government, you are racist, or you are xenophobic. All the people that want to speak up, Chinese Canadians and around the world, they fear they are not being supported to speak up.”After this story was published Global News asked Prime Minister Justin Trudeau if his government is doing anything to expose United Front influence networks that are pressuring Chinese-Canadians.“The Canadian government has always highlighted concerns around human rights and respect for basic human democracies and liberties with every country that we engage with around the world including China,” Trudeau said. “We will continue to defend human rights while at the same time looking to protect Canadians everywhere around the world.”\n",

      "CONTENT : A veteran Chinese-Canadian politician is coming forward to reveal that upon landing at the Shanghai airport in November 2015, Chinese authorities improperly detained him, separated him from his wife for eight hours, confiscated and searched his B.C. government phone and accused him of “endangering national security” before cancelling his visa and ordering him to fly back to Canada.And since his detention, he said, China’s interference in Canadian society has increased in myriad ways, including aggressive attempts to influence our political system and elected leaders, control Chinese-Canadian immigrants, and silence all criticism of Beijing’s policies. Richard Lee, the B.C. Liberal MLA for Burnaby from 2001 to 2017, provided Global News with a letter outlining his allegations, sent on Jan. 1, 2019, to then-foreign affairs minister Chrystia Freeland and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.Lee’s letter says he had planned to go public with his story after returning to Vancouver from Shanghai, but decided not to “in consideration of the potential damage to the relationship between China and Canada.”\n",
      "READ MORE: \n",
      "\t\t\t\tUBCM to ban foreign funding following outcry over China-funded cocktail party\t\t\t\n",
      "But since 2015, Lee claims he has seen increasing interference in Canada’s political system by China’s government, including private warnings from consular officials that Canadian politicians refrain from speaking out on issues that might anger China.And after China jailed Canadians Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor on vague national security grounds in late 2018, Lee says he felt reminded of the injustice in his own case.“I was accused of endangering China’s national security,” Lee said. “So my point is, it could happen to anyone. If someone in Canada does something not to China’s liking, your visa will be cancelled. It’s a serious situation.”He decided to put his case on the record with his letter emailed to China’s then-ambassador Lu Shaye and Freeland, and ‘CCed to Trudeau, and Canada’s then-justice minister, Jody Wilson-Raybould.About a year later, Lee had not received any response from Canada’s government, until Global News started to investigate his story. Finally on Wednesday, the day after Global News forwarded a copy of Lee’s complaint to China’s embassy in Vancouver along with questions for this story, Trudeau’s office emailed Lee “to acknowledge receipt of your correspondence.”But Lee says China’s interference in Canadian politics is already deeply ingrained, and he believes China’s Consulate General in Vancouver is pressuring Chinese-Canadian community groups to ostracize him. “I have freedom of speech and association, but (the Chinese consulate) said I could not do that in Canada,” Lee said. “There is many Chinese-Canadian associations that don’t consider themselves to be free, to speak against this interference.”So Lee has decided now, the Canadian public should hear his story.Since being elected for the B.C. Liberals in 2001, Lee says he has promoted good relations and trade with China. But he also believed in vocally supporting democracy and made a habit of commemorating the Tiananmen Square massacre every June 4 by joining candle-lighting services in front of China’s embassy in Vancouver.This is the kind of activity — along with publicly supporting Taiwan’s independence or democracy protesters in Hong Kong, or speaking out on China’s persecution of religious groups or mass detentions of Uighurs — that China’s foreign services are increasingly suppressing internationally, according to Lee and other community leaders interviewed by Global News.Lee said he was aware some of his statements displeased China but didn’t see any danger in late 2015, when he and his wife decided to celebrate their 30th anniversary with a trip to Shanghai. When they landed in Shanghai, Lee says, he was separated from his wife and placed in a room with two officials.“My wife was scared, because she didn’t know what was happening to me,” Lee said. “We could not communicate.”The officials took Lee’s personal phone and his B.C. government Blackberry, Lee said. They returned and demanded access to Lee’s password-protected Blackberry, which required Lee to reveal his passcode. \n",

      "Lee says he knew this could give the Chinese officials access to confidential Canadian government information, but he thought the Chinese officials were more interested in looking into his personal activities in Canada, as a Chinese community leader. Also, he was afraid he would be separated from his wife for days, or worse.So Lee gave them his passcode, and he believes the officials examined his B.C. legislative assembly account emails, while he was made to wait for about eight hours.“I was watched by one of the people, and sometimes I was left alone sitting there,” Lee said. “When I went to the washroom, I was accompanied by two people.”As the phone examination continued, Lee says he asked: “Why I’m here? And they said, what you did, is considered endangering China’s national security. They did not specify the reasons at all, of the allegations against me.”He says he also asked to speak to the Canadian Consulate General in Shanghai and the ambassador of Canada, but was refused.Finally, the officials returned his phone, and demanded that he and his family leave China immediately. Lee says he asked if they could fly to Hong Kong instead, but was told to return to Vancouver.When he arrived in British Columbia, Lee says he disclosed the circumstances of his detention, and the examination of his B.C. government Blackberry, to his B.C. Liberal caucus. Lee says he does not know whether B.C. Liberal leaders ever informed the RCMP about his Shanghai detention, and the possibility that the Chinese government obtained confidential B.C. government information by examining Lee’s Blackberry. The party has not answered questions from Global News on Lee’s allegations.In the absence of any explanation of China’s action against him, Lee says he believed he must have been blacklisted by the PRC, for ignoring repeated warnings about commemorating the Tiananmen Square massacre.The warnings had come directly — according to Lee — from Liu Fei, China’s then-consul general in Vancouver. But the consulate’s warnings were also relayed, Lee said, through the B.C. Liberal party.“On one occasion the consul general, Liu Fei, she told me directly I should not attend the commemoration of the June 4 services,” Lee said. “And she complained to some of my colleagues that I should not (attend June 4 services). Inside the party, they informed me that they had been told by the consul general, I should not do this.”  Lee told Global News that he’s reluctant to name the B.C. Liberals that relayed the Chinese consulate’s warnings to him. But he pointed to a senior B.C. Liberal government minister, and said the party caucus had a number of meetings regarding Liu’s statement.The senior B.C. Liberal leader could not be reached by deadline to answer questions for this story.The B.C. Liberal party has been forwarded a number of questions for this story and has yet to respond to the allegations made by Lee.Carlie Pochynok, director of communications for the B.C. Liberal caucus, provided this statement.“In regards to Richard Lee reporting his phone confiscation to the Party and whether or not anyone did anything with that info, I don’t know,” the statement says. “I don’t know who he reported this to and as this was almost five years ago, a large portion of leadership from that time is no longer part of this organization and I can’t speak on their behalf.”Liu left her post in 2017 and was replaced as consul general by Tong Xiaoling. The consulate in Vancouver has not yet responded to questions from Global News regarding allegations in this story.Global News asked B.C. Attorney General David Eby if he is concerned that confidential B.C. government information may now be in the hands of the Chinese government.“It’s a concerning and disturbing story on a number of levels, about what may have been on (Lee’s) phone,” Eby said. “It’s a story that has international implications for Canada and our relationship with China, and that is why I will be writing to the federal attorney general, and asking the federal government to look into this, and offering B.C.’s assistance, to get to the bottom of whatever happened.”\n",
      "COMMENTARY: \n",
      "\t\t\t\tCanada’s new foreign minister must figure out how to deal with China\t\t\t\n",
      "Global News forwarded Lee’s letter to the Chinese consulate on Tuesday at 3:40 p.m. and requested interviews with Chinese officials in Canada by Wednesday afternoon. The Chinese government has not responded.But on Wednesday afternoon, Lee received an email from Trudeau’s office that is ‘CCed to Canada’s new foreign affairs minister, Francois-Phillipe Champagne.“On behalf of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, I would like to acknowledge receipt of your correspondence,” the letter says. “Please be assured your comments have been carefully reviewed. In your correspondence, you raise an issue that falls within the portfolio of (Champagne.)”“I haven’t talked to them yet,” Lee said on Wednesday. “If they call me, I will answer any questions.”According to Vancouver journalist Gao Bingchen, founder of a B.C. pro-democracy group, he knows at least one other Chinese-Canadian has been detained while others may be blacklisted by the PRC for their activities in Canada, and face, threats and pressure when they return to China.In an interview with Global News, Gao said that one member of his pro-democracy group described such a detention.“The member returned to Anhui province in China, and the national security representatives held her. They released her and they asked her to continue the relationship with our democracy group, but they wanted her to report back to national security (about the group members in Vancouver.),” Gao said.\n",

When asked if he would raise the case of the detained Canadians, Trump said: “I would, at Justin’s request. I will absolutely bring it up.”WATCH: Trump willing to raise Canada’s concerns with Chinese presidentTrudeau later declined to say whether he overtly asked Trump for help with the two Canadians.

Kovrig and Spavor were formally arrested and accused of “spying” in May. The two had been languishing in custody for several months before they were charged amid protests from Canada.“Canada, or any other country, should respect China’s judicial sovereignty and should not make irresponsible remarks about issues that fall under China’s judicial sovereignty,” Lu told reporters on Friday.\n",

Similar exercises involving Japan, Australia and the U.S. recently took place in the northwestern Pacific. Almost concurrently, the U.S. Navy twice sent a pair of aircraft carriers through the South China Sea to underscore its opposition to China’s so far largely successful move to establish facts on the water by building military structures on a score of Pacific atolls.To China’s consternation, Taiwan has also been getting lots of favourable attention in the U.S. and Japan.Citing what he called the worst human rights violations of this century by China against its Muslim Uighur minority and the harsh new security law that Beijing has imposed on Hong Kong, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called last month on free societies to unite against President Xi’s Communist dictatorship. In the weeks before the secretary spoke, the U.S. Air Force began frequent bomber sorties over the South China Sea. Alleging that they are spies, Washington has also been arresting Chinese citizens in the U.S.This is not just Donald Trump flying solo. Democrats overwhelmingly agree with the president’s position on China. Should Joe Biden win the presidency in November, there may be a less hawkish tone in the White House, but the policy on China is unlikely to change much.READ MORE: Four researchers in U.S. accused of China military tiesFor its part, Beijing has been conducting military games in the air and on the waters surrounding Taiwan. It has also been constantly probing Japan’s air and sea defences, particularly around the Senkaku Islands in the East China Sea. As a Japanese Self Defense Force commander on Okinawa told me in February, fighter jets and reconnaissance aircraft had to scramble nearly 1,000 times last year.As for the South China Sea, an international tribunal has found no legal basis for Beijing’s claims there, but Xi ignored the ruling. He was further emboldened by former-U.S. president Barack Obama’s refusal to do anything about intelligence that he was given back in 2013 that China intended to send an armada of dredgers to build artificial islands on rock and coral outcroppings there.Those tiny islets would be relatively easy for the U.S. military to eliminate with missiles and bombs. However, Beijing would regard such an attack as an act of war, with events likely spinning in unpredictable, highly dangerous directions after that.Neither side is threatening war, but there is a growing feeling in Asia, Australia, the U.S. and even western Europe that something must be done to check China’s territorial ambitions. The Chinese government has gotten as far as it has because of western apathy and because of its frequent use of coercive economic power. There is also a suspicion in many capitals that China has been more aggressively asserting its many claims across the Indo-Pacific in the past few months because the world has been focused on the global coronavirus pandemic.The centrepiece of China’s expansionary strategy is the South China Sea. It is of crucial importance because the countries that border the sea have nearly two billion people and because it sits atop rich fishing grounds and oil and gas reserves.There are broader geostrategic considerations at play. Having a string of airfields out in the South China Sea makes it harder for the U.S to operate there. Those possessions also permit Beijing to begin to have a little influence over the ocean to the east of Taiwan and the Philippines.Taiwan, the Philippines, Vietnam and Malaysia, which has enlarged its claim recently, have fortified atolls, too. But they are fewer in number and they cannot afford the infrastructure that China has built.READ MORE: Philippines calls for Beijing to follow ruling on South China sea disputeMoreover, China is not done. On the southern margins of China’s nine-dash-line maritime claim, the Chinese Coast Guard upped the ante in late July by attempting to assert authority over fishing grounds around Indonesia’s Natuna Islands. This has prompted an angry reaction from Jakarta, which has heretofore mostly tried to say out of the various overlapping territorial disputes in its neighbourhood.What China is trying to do around this archipelago about 3,000 kilometres from its shores is akin to Canada claiming the right to exploit the territorial waters abutting the Bahamas or Florida. As with China’s claim to the South China Sea — which Ottawa has ducked taking a position on for years — Canada remains either silent or an outlier on many issues of keen importance to its closest allies and potential new partners in Asia.Matthew Fisher is an international affairs columnist and foreign correspondent who has worked abroad for 35 years.

      "CONTENT : As political tensions rise between China and Australia, Canadian barley producers are reaping the benefits with an uptick in exports this summer.Due to the harsh tariffs and trading tensions from outside markets, one southern Alberta farmer noted his crops have been in high demand this season — both locally and internationally. “There’s been a price spike because of it,” John McKee said. “Unfortunately, I understand the reason is political, not because somebody really wants our high-quality barley.”\n",

      "Tensions first arose between the countries when Australia asked for a coronavirus probe into China. As part of its perceived retaliation, China effectively ended imports of Australian barley by putting tariffs of more than 80 per cent on the crop, and has now shifted its focus to the Canadian market.“It’s opened up a price advantage right now to sell some new crop barley at a higher price,” McKee said.The Canadian Grain Commission reported that international exports of barley more than doubled from April to May of this year — largely due to Chinese interest.Tom Steve, the commission’s general manager, noted the new gap in the market is good for Canadian farmers looking to expand their business amid the hardships brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic.“In 2019-20, Canada will export just over one million tonnes of malting barley to China for beer production, with the balance as feed barley,” he said.“This will be an opportunity for Canada to show the quality of our product to new Chinese buyers. If they know we have a good product and we are consistent in delivery, then we can expect they will keep buying our barley in the long term.”\n",

      "CONTENT : Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government appears willfully blind to a “growing body” of intelligence evidence regarding China’s interference in Canada, the Conservative shadow minister for Canada-China relations said Friday.MP Garnett Genuis, the Conservative member for the special committee on Canada-China relations, made the comments after Global News reported that Canada is a “permissive target” of China’s broad influence campaigns, according to reports from Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS). Intelligence experts say China is undermining Canada’s democracy by targeting elite politicians and businesspersons with “sweetheart” business deals and economic inducements. In this so-called “elite capture” strategy China’s Communist Party wins support for its foreign policy, experts said. A parliamentary intelligence committee review of CSIS warnings suggested Ottawa has been slow to respond to China’s threat. Genuis told Global News that Canada needs to tackle national security threats posed by China’s interference with the same urgency and “comprehensive responses” that Ottawa has previously applied to the threat of terrorism. “There is a growing body of evidence to suggest Canadians should be very concerned in general about foreign interference, and with the Chinese state in particular,” he said. “What looked like naivety actually looks more like willful blindness, because they have this intelligence and they have not acted on it.”Genuis and Conservative MP Dan Albas said the Global News analysis of China’s elite capture threat should be examined in the special committee. But the Liberal government, with the support of several NDP and Green MPs, ended the Canada-China relations hearings during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n",
      "READ MORE: \n",
      "\t\t\t\tUnited Front groups in Canada helped Beijing stockpile coronavirus safety supplies\t\t\t\n",
      "Global News asked Bill Blair, Canada’s Public Safety Minister responsible for CSIS, to comment on the government’s response to China’s interference.“Our government’s top priority is keeping Canadians safe. Alongside our international partners, Canada’s national security agencies are constantly working to identify threats to national security including foreign interference and espionage,” a statement from Blair’s office said.“We welcomed the report from the National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians released earlier this year which studied this issue, and continue to remain vigilant for potential threats and to take appropriate measures to ensure the safety and security of Canadians.”Experts told Global News not all politicians and businesses that trade with China are being influenced and cases of espionage and elite capture have yet to be proven in Canada. But evidence in countries such as Australia shows the Chinese Communist Party’s strategy is to patiently target and win support from elites abroad using the nation’s growing wealth, experts say.Charles Burton, a former Canadian diplomat in China, said he agrees that China’s Communist Party has obtained significant influence in Canadian affairs through elite capture. And he also agrees with Genuis’s assessment that Ottawa has been blind to China’s interference.“I think there is a tendency among our elites to downplay the significance of their collaboration with the Chinese state, and there is a tendency of believing the collaboration is for the greater good of Canada’s economy,” Burton said. “But there is a lot of willful ignoring of information that could be relating to matters that are at least conflicts of interest, if not unlawful.”Canada’s bipartisan intelligence committee review recommended the government examine Australia’s laws that are designed to counter China’s interference. Australia now requires current and former politicians to register any foreign business interests. Canada currently has no such laws, which makes it difficult to know who could be supporting the Chinese Communist Party for hidden financial reasons, experts told Global News.\n",

      "Burton said Australia’s counter-espionage transparency laws have already led to greater accountability. In one example, he said a former Australian trade minister dropped an $880,000 per year consulting gig for a Chinese company, after Australia’s new laws came into effect.“Sunshine is the best disinfectant,” Burton said. “So the idea that people who were responsible for important files should be subject to scrutiny for potential conflict of interest when they leave government, is good for Canada.”Genuis said if the Canada-China relations special committee restarts, his party wants to examine potential elite capture in Canadian business and politics, the integrity of Canadian academic institutions, theft of Canada’s high-tech and intellectual property, and foreign interference in diaspora communities in Canada.“We need to look at the vulnerability of our communities to pressure and bullying from state actors,” Genuis said. “But the government, unfortunately, isn’t taking this seriously. If they don’t start to, I think we will see electoral consequences.”\n",

      "CONTENT : President Xi Jinping wants to restore China to its former glory – and that means bringing Taiwan under the Communist Party’s control, one way or another.That was the gist of Xi’s direction-setting New Year’s speech on Jan. 2, when he addressed a packed house at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing. Xi’s speech marked 40 years since China stopped regular artillery bombardment of Taiwan-controlled islands off the Chinese coast. While he spoke at length about peace, he also made it clear that he’s running out of patience for polite politics.“We are willing to create a vast space for peaceful unification, but we will never leave any room for any sort of Taiwan independence or separatist activities,” Xi said from his seat at the front of the auditorium. He then directly addressed the scope of action China may use to enforce this: “We do not promise to renounce the use of force and reserve the option to use all necessary measures.”WATCH BELOW: China’s Xi threatens Taiwan with force but also seeks ‘peaceful reunification’Xi’s comments sparked a rebuke from Taiwan’s president, Tsai Ing-wen. “China must face the fact of the existence of Taiwan, and not deny the system of a democratic county that has been commonly built up by the Taiwanese people,” she said in a speech the next day.Tsai’s pro-independence party, the Democratic Progressive Party, replaced the China-friendly Kuomintang party in 2016, making it less likely than ever that Taipei will accept a peaceful “reunification” with the Communist-governed mainland. If anything, the back-and-forth might cement the two sides in opposition to one another.Xi’s comments are raising fears of a military conflict between the two sides, even if it’s not China’s preferred option. Taiwan announced a new round of military drills aimed at fending off invasion after Xi’s remarks, and President Tsai has asked international leaders to pledge their help in the event of a crisis.WATCH BELOW: Taiwan urges international support against ChinaDespite the escalating rhetoric, experts tell Global News an imminent military conflict is unlikely.While Ian Easton, a research fellow at the Project 2049 Institute, says “this is a very dangerous flashpoint,” he points out that China would fail if it tried to invade Taiwan in 2019. However, China’s chances for victory will be much greater in five-to-10 years, once it’s finished building up its military.\n",

      "“The farther forward you project, the more likely it becomes that there will be a military crisis in the Taiwan Strait,” said Easton, author of the book  The Chinese Invasion Threat: Taiwan’s Defense and American Strategy in Asia. “They’re building up all the capabilities that they would need to launch a potential invasion of Taiwan at some point in the next decade.”Here’s why China is so focused on controlling Taiwan, and why it probably can’t take over the island by force – at least for now.China has long viewed Taiwan as a rogue province run by nationalists who never accepted losing the Chinese Civil War in 1949, when Mao Zedong’s Communists rose to power. Taiwan views itself as a free and democratic country that stands apart from the controlling Communist Party. However, it can’t officially declare it’s full independence from China, lest it face some form of attack.\n",

      "Many western nations treated Taiwan as the “true” China until 40 years ago, when the Communist government in Beijing started reaching out to the world. That same year, in 1979, the U.S. shifted diplomatic relations to Beijing while promising to continue selling weapons to Taiwan for its defence.President Xi’s speech on Jan. 2 marked that anniversary.Taiwan – which officially calls itself the Republic of China – occupies a large island separated from mainland China by the Taiwan Strait, a 160-kilometre-wide stretch of water off China’s east coast. The self-governed island of approximately 23.6 million people has strong economy with a gross domestic product of approximately US$572 billion. It’s a booming hub for technology, shipping and banking, and it occupies a key strategic position between China and the Pacific Ocean.“Taiwan serves as a gateway to the Western Pacific, and if that gateway is in the American sphere of influence, it can be used to blockade China,” Easton said. He adds that Taiwan is an extremely valuable location for intelligence gathering, because it allows American spies to monitor China from a close vantage point.WATCH BELOW: Election results rattle Taiwan’s pro-independence governmentIt’s also a symbolically important piece of territory for Xi’s ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP), according to associate professor Josephine Chiu-Duke, who teaches Chinese intellectual history at the University of British Columbia’s Centre for Asian Studies. She says letting go of Taiwan would be a “criminal” act in the eyes of the CCP.“No leader wants to be the one who let part of the holy motherland be ceded,” she told Global News. “If they did they would become… the sinner of the nation.”The United States and many other nations – including Canada – have tip-toed around the Taiwan issue for decades in an effort to maintain friendly relations with China. Most nations do not officially recognize Taiwan as a country, but they still maintain unofficial diplomatic and economic relationships with its government.All but 17 of the world’s nations have stopped acknowledging Taiwan as a country, in accordance with Beijing’s “One China” policy.The U.S. is perhaps Taiwan’s closest unofficial ally. Washington has a deal with Taipei to sell it weapons and keep its naval fleet nearby. Experts say the U.S. would probably help the island in the event of an invasion, but there is no formal agreement that forces the Americans to do so – and no guidelines for how to deal with smaller-scale acts of Chinese aggression.“No one can be completely sure what the United States would do in the event of a crisis,” Easton said. He points out that the Trump administration has opened up more diplomatic channels with Taiwan, but the president’s erratic approach to global politics makes it hard to know for sure if he would back Taipei in a crisis.“Because of that strategic ambiguity, (China) is always trying to test American resolve on Taiwan,” Easton said.There is no definite naval border between Taiwan and China, because China does not recognize Taiwan as a separate country. However, Taiwan holds sway over several islands in the strait, including Kinmen, a tiny archipelago just a few kilometres from China.WATCH BELOW: U.S. Navy ship sails in disputed South China SeaChina could challenge Taiwan and the U.S. at any point by seizing one of these islands, sinking a Taiwanese ship or launching a few missiles across the strait, Easton said. “That can be done in a very shocking, sudden fashion,” he said.Easton says China might use one of these provocative actions to test Taiwan in 2019, just to see how it and the U.S. might react. However, the chances of a full-scale Chinese invasion are unlikely this year, he said. Rather, China will probably wait and see if a more Beijing-friendly government wins the next Taiwan election in 2020.If that doesn’t happen, the situation might tilt toward a larger conflict.China has ramped up pressure on Taiwan since the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) took power in 2016, ending a 20-year run by the more China-friendly Kuomintang (KMT) party. Taiwan had been drifting closer to China under the KMT, so when the DPP took over, Beijing decided to punish the island. It cut ties with Taipei, poached its diplomatic partners and barred Taiwanese officials from international gatherings.\n",

      "She adds that Xi is also likely using Taiwan to distract the Chinese people from the slowing economy, which is suffering from the effects of a trade war with the U.S.Despite China’s threats of violence, it probably won’t use force unless it loses all hope of reunification, according to Jie Daleil, an associate professor at Peking University’s School of International Studies.“Although Xi stressed that all options are on the table, unless Taipei makes radical moves to establish Taiwan independence or Washington rattles the ‘One China’ policy in a major way, Beijing will probably pursue its peaceful game plan for the foreseeable future,” he wrote in an analysis piece for The Washington Post.Chiu-Duke says China could simply blockade Taiwan and wage economic war against its government in order to bring it on side. She points out that Taiwan is likely riddled with Chinese agents already, and it wouldn’t be hard for China to co-opt Taiwanese officials into doing its bidding.  “They can control Taiwan without using one missile, so why should they try to start a war?” Chiu-Duke said. “So far, Xi Jingping always talks big, but if you examine what he does… he’s not that aggressive.”Experts say a Chinese invasion of Taiwan would be extremely bloody and damaging for both sides.“Taiwan would be ruined and many provinces along the (Chinese coast) would be destroyed,” said Chiu-Duke.“It would be a tremendously bloody war,” Easton said. “Both sides would take massive losses. You’re talking about hundreds of thousands dead on both sides. It would be really ugly.”A Chinese invasion of Taiwan would also strain China’s armed forces and invite international intervention, the U.S. Secretary of Defense’s office told Congress in a report on China last year. The report described a large-scale amphibious invasion as a “significant political and military risk.”\n",

      "On paper, China’s military looks like it should be able to crush Taiwan. The Chinese military budget was an estimated US$170.4 billion last year, according to a report from the U.S. government’s Defense Intelligence Agency. Taiwan spent approximately $10.7 billion on its own defence last year. China has several thousand more tanks, artillery weapons, missile launchers, attack helicopters, fighter jets and warships than Taiwan does, according to estimates on the military-tracking websites Global Fire Power and ArmedForces.EU.However, time, weather and terrain would be on Taiwan’s side in the event of an invasion, Easton says.Any Chinese invasion would have to happen in April or October, when conditions on the Taiwan Strait are calm enough for amphibious assault ships to cross, Easton says. These ships would make easy targets for Taiwan’s submarines, aircraft and defensive missiles, meaning the Chinese would have to overwhelm Taiwan’s defences and jam its communications in order to get enough ships through.Even if the Chinese managed to land on Taiwan’s shoreline, they would have a very difficult time establishing a beachhead against Taiwan’s ground troops, Easton says. He thinks Taiwan could hold off a Chinese invasion for several months, which would give the U.S. plenty of time to step in and help.\n",

      "Taiwan would also be able to launch counterattacks against mainland China, he said, killing troops waiting to cross at the shoreline and knocking out ports and air bases.He adds that a Chinese invasion would never come as a surprise. “It takes months to build up before an attack,” he said. Taiwan would see China moving thousands of troops to the coast several months in advance, and it would be able to prepare accordingly.“When you’re talking about an all-out, massive military operation, there are a lot of warnings and indicators that that’s coming,” he said.Brent Christensen, who serves as the unofficial U.S. ambassador in Taipei, reassured Taiwan in October that the U.S. would support it in a military conflict with China.\n",

      "“Any effort to determine the future of Taiwan by other than peaceful means represents a threat to the peace and security of the Western Pacific area and is of grave concern to the United States,” Christensen said at a press conference in Taipei on Oct. 31. “We are opposed to unilateral attempts to change the status quo.”He added at the time that the U.S. remains committed to helping Taiwan defend itself, as evidenced by a $330-million weapons deal signed in 2018.WATCH BELOW: U.S.-China trade talks wrap upChiu-Duke doesn’t think an invasion is imminent but she wouldn’t rule it out entirely.

      "CONTENT : China is facing a lot of criticism as political leaders from around the world have demanded transparency from Beijing about the origins of the virus and why it chose not to share information about it in a timely fashion.And there are a lot of questions. A groundbreaking investigation by Sam Cooper of Global News found that before China informed the world of the potential lethality of the novel coronavirus in late January, it told embassies and consulates around the world to secretly buy up all the personal protective equipment they could.\n",

      "In the face of reports like this, you might expect China to be responding with a diplomatic charm offensive. Instead, China’s response has been more of a “charmless” offensive. When Australia’s foreign minister called for a global inquiry into what China knew about the brewing pandemic, China’s response, from its ambassador to Australia, Cheng Jingye, was to question trade relations between the two countries: “Why should we drink Australian wine? Why eat Australian beef?”Hu Xijin, editor of the Communist Party newspaper Global Times, caused a sensation in Australia when he reportedly said the country had become “a bit like chewing gum stuck on the sole of China’s shoes.” Beijing’s diplomacy comes with distinctive characteristics. Among the actions it has taken in recent weeks has been to send more warships into the South China Sea and to demand that Vietnam, the Philippines and Indonesia adhere to a ban it is imposing this summer on fishing around atolls far out to sea there, which it brazenly claims for itself.However, an international court has ruled its military annexation of these waters was an illegal territorial grab.In one of the most outlandish recent claims, Zhao Lijian, chief spokesman for China’s foreign minister, alleged last month that the virus had its origins in the U.S., not China, though he did not provide a jot of information to support such a highly charged claim.The Global News report found that China secretly stockpiled PPE and other medical supplies, leaving many countries, including Canada, with limited supplies of PPE.The conduits for the purchases were diplomats, state-owned companies, and “overseas Chinese” working on behalf of the shadowy, state-controlled United Front. They were to buy up more than two billion face masks and other medical safety gear.In all, about 100 tons of such kit were quietly spirited out of Canada.China’s action explains why, when I went to a dozen pharmacies in Toronto and Ottawa in early February to buy face masks for a trip to Japan, I could not find one for sale, though there was barely any discussion among Canadians at the time about the need to buy such gear.Still, a constant theme of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government has been that Canadians should be gentle in their criticisms of China so as not to provoke racism.China has been angry with Canada for a while. Back in December 2018, a Canadian judge ordered that Meng Wanzhou, the daughter of the founder of the Huawei telecoms giant, remain in Vancouver while a court decides whether she should be extradited to the U.S. to face serious fraud charges.Beijing hit Canada with a ban on canola, pork and beef imports. China’s ambassador to Ottawa at the time, Lu Shaye, accused the West of “egotism and white supremacy.”He justified this by saying Canada had not shown respect for Chinese law after China jailed former Canadians Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor in December 2018.\n",

Beijing has said it won’t cooperate. But as Cooper’s scoop for Global News demonstrates, there should be enough evidence available for governments to stitch together a reasonably strong, factual narrative.Such investigations will likely lead to greater scrutiny of Chinese trade threats against countries that have called for inquiries into Beijing’s role in initially suppressing information about the virus.It could also eventually result in greater western scrutiny of China’s mistreatment of democratic protesters in Hong Kong and ethnic minorities such as Muslim Uighurs and Buddhist Tibetans.\n",

      "It has become tiresome to hear defenders of the Canadian government say that it cannot join other western countries in taking a tough stance on China because President Xi Jinping’s government holds the “Two Michaels.”While certainly a complicating factor, it conveniently ignores the fact that a cabal of Canada’s pro-China diplomats, business leaders and retired politicians has taken a far softer line on China than most western countries since long before the Michaels were abducted.Many developments are not trending in China’s favour at the moment. Tens of millions have lost their jobs. Its economy has already contracted at least 6.8 per cent in the first quarter of 2020.There has been another consequence of the coronavirus that threatens China’s economic future and reputation. Xi’s much-touted Belt and Road Initiative, which was designed to gain access to raw materials through building massive infrastructure projects and to take control of key ports in Asia, eastern and southern Europe, Latin America and especially Africa, was a huge bet that may now have lost its momentum and mojo.At least five African countries have called China’s ambassadors on the carpet to explain why their citizens have been banned from their homes and shopping districts in China because of fears that they may be carriers of the virus.Far worse than that for China, it is unlikely that impoverished African countries faced with their own COVID-19 crises will be able to repay a substantial portion of the US$143 billion a Johns Hopkins University study says they owe to Beijing.Predictably, China went crazy when Germany’s best selling newspaper, Bild, demanded China pay Berlin $160 billion for the havoc the virus had caused to Germany’s economy. President Trump has mused about charging China US$10 million in reparations for every American who was killed by the virus.With more than 68,000 Americans having already died from the virus, that would be a staggering amount of money.The size of such compensation claims is ludicrous. But such tempests speak to the current international mood.Ottawa has become an outlier in that it has had barely a harsh word to say about China throughout this tragic drama. It also seems incapable of making up its mind about whether to ban Huawei’s 5G cell phone technology, despite advice from its military and security establishments to do so.Australia has banished the new Huawei system because it could be used to conduct espionage. Germany and Britain are reconsidering their decisions to allow some pieces of Huawei’s technology into their country. Japan has created a $2.2-billion fund to try to get Japanese corporations to bring their factories back home or move them to other countries.It has suddenly dawned on the West that there has been an over-reliance on trade with China. There is talk in many capitals now about the need to greatly diminish dependence on Chinese products, particularly in areas related to national security and public health.At some point, Canada will have to stop admiring “China’s basic dictatorship,” as Justin Trudeau infamously once put it, and join its European, Asian and American allies in forging a common position on China that reflects the emerging post-COVID realities.Matthew Fisher is an international affairs columnist and foreign correspondent who has worked abroad for 35 years.

      "CONTENT : A senior Canadian military officer said the other day that some fellow officers were not thinking at all about a potential conflict in the Indo-Pacific. That can also be said of most Canadians.As with so much internationally in recent years, the federal government has had little to say as accelerating tensions roil a vast area stretching in a crescent from South Korea and Japan to Indonesia to India. Many nations are becoming heavily engaged, but not Canada despite its claim to be a Pacific nation with many trade interests in Asia.A new Cold War is upon us. It would not take too much of a miscalculation for it to become a Hot War.READ MORE: China’s Houston consulate carried out espionage, U.S. claimsAt the centre of the tempest are China and the United States. Arrayed against China are almost all of the countries in Asia except its client states, Cambodia, Burma, Pakistan — which is being drawn into China’s orbit, and the Philippines — which now may be trying to escape China’s embrace after a couple of years of favouring Beijing over its traditional ally, Washington.With China and the U.S. regularly hurling insults at each other, engaging in tit-for-tat expulsions of diplomats and staging bigger and bigger war games in the western Pacific, how much longer can Canada remain uninterested in the frictions that threaten democratic Taiwan and are developing around Chinese-held atolls such as the aptly well-named Mischief and Fiery Cross reefs? Then there is the dangerous sideshow between China and India that has restarted in remote mountain passes in the Himalayas.The U.S. and Australia have in the past few weeks explicitly declared that Chinese President Xi Jinping’s extravagant nine-dash-line claim to about 90 per cent of the South China Sea is total nonsense. India has cemented new trade and security ties with Australia, which is quickly establishing a much closer relationship with Japan. At the same time, India, Australia, Japan and the U.S. are deepening their relations through the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, and Australia and the U.S. have held high-level security talks about China.The annual Malabar naval exercise, which is to take place soon, will this year involve all the countries of the Quad, which Canada has shown no interest in joining. Similar exercises involving Japan, Australia and the U.S. recently took place in the northwestern Pacific. Almost concurrently, the U.S. Navy twice sent a pair of aircraft carriers through the South China Sea to underscore its opposition to China’s so far largely successful move to establish facts on the water by building military structures on a score of Pacific atolls.To China’s consternation, Taiwan has also been getting lots of favourable attention in the U.S. and Japan.Citing what he called the worst human rights violations of this century by China against its Muslim Uighur minority and the harsh new security law that Beijing has imposed on Hong Kong, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called last month on free societies to unite against President Xi’s Communist dictatorship. In the weeks before the secretary spoke, the U.S. Air Force began frequent bomber sorties over the South China Sea. Alleging that they are spies, Washington has also been arresting Chinese citizens in the U.S.This is not just Donald Trump flying solo. Democrats overwhelmingly agree with the president’s position on China. Should Joe Biden win the presidency in November, there may be a less hawkish tone in the White House, but the policy on China is unlikely to change much.READ MORE: Four researchers in U.S. accused of China military tiesFor its part, Beijing has been conducting military games in the air and on the waters surrounding Taiwan. It has also been constantly probing Japan’s air and sea defences, particularly around the Senkaku Islands in the East China Sea. As a Japanese Self Defense Force commander on Okinawa told me in February, fighter jets and reconnaissance aircraft had to scramble nearly 1,000 times last year.As for the South China Sea, an international tribunal has found no legal basis for Beijing’s claims there, but Xi ignored the ruling. He was further emboldened by former-U.S. president Barack Obama’s refusal to do anything about intelligence that he was given back in 2013 that China intended to send an armada of dredgers to build artificial islands on rock and coral outcroppings there.Those tiny islets would be relatively easy for the U.S. military to eliminate with missiles and bombs. However, Beijing would regard such an attack as an act of war, with events likely spinning in unpredictable, highly dangerous directions after that.Neither side is threatening war, but there is a growing feeling in Asia, Australia, the U.S. and even western Europe that something must be done to check China’s territorial ambitions. The Chinese government has gotten as far as it has because of western apathy and because of its frequent use of coercive economic power. There is also a suspicion in many capitals that China has been more aggressively asserting its many claims across the Indo-Pacific in the past few months because the world has been focused on the global coronavirus pandemic.The centrepiece of China’s expansionary strategy is the South China Sea. It is of crucial importance because the countries that border the sea have nearly two billion people and because it sits atop rich fishing grounds and oil and gas reserves.There are broader geostrategic considerations at play. Having a string of airfields out in the South China Sea makes it harder for the U.S to operate there. Those possessions also permit Beijing to begin to have a little influence over the ocean to the east of Taiwan and the Philippines.Taiwan, the Philippines, Vietnam and Malaysia, which has enlarged its claim recently, have fortified atolls, too. But they are fewer in number and they cannot afford the infrastructure that China has built.READ MORE: Philippines calls for Beijing to follow ruling on South China sea disputeMoreover, China is not done. On the southern margins of China’s nine-dash-line maritime claim, the Chinese Coast Guard upped the ante in late July by attempting to assert authority over fishing grounds around Indonesia’s Natuna Islands. This has prompted an angry reaction from Jakarta, which has heretofore mostly tried to say out of the various overlapping territorial disputes in its neighbourhood.What China is trying to do around this archipelago about 3,000 kilometres from its shores is akin to Canada claiming the right to exploit the territorial waters abutting the Bahamas or Florida. As with China’s claim to the South China Sea — which Ottawa has ducked taking a position on for years — Canada remains either silent or an outlier on many issues of keen importance to its closest allies and potential new partners in Asia.Matthew Fisher is an international affairs columnist and foreign correspondent who has worked abroad for 35 years.

      "CONTENT : Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government appears willfully blind to a “growing body” of intelligence evidence regarding China’s interference in Canada, the Conservative shadow minister for Canada-China relations said Friday.MP Garnett Genuis, the Conservative member for the special committee on Canada-China relations, made the comments after Global News reported that Canada is a “permissive target” of China’s broad influence campaigns, according to reports from Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS). Intelligence experts say China is undermining Canada’s democracy by targeting elite politicians and businesspersons with “sweetheart” business deals and economic inducements. In this so-called “elite capture” strategy China’s Communist Party wins support for its foreign policy, experts said. A parliamentary intelligence committee review of CSIS warnings suggested Ottawa has been slow to respond to China’s threat. Genuis told Global News that Canada needs to tackle national security threats posed by China’s interference with the same urgency and “comprehensive responses” that Ottawa has previously applied to the threat of terrorism. “There is a growing body of evidence to suggest Canadians should be very concerned in general about foreign interference, and with the Chinese state in particular,” he said. “What looked like naivety actually looks more like willful blindness, because they have this intelligence and they have not acted on it.”Genuis and Conservative MP Dan Albas said the Global News analysis of China’s elite capture threat should be examined in the special committee. But the Liberal government, with the support of several NDP and Green MPs, ended the Canada-China relations hearings during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n",

      "\t\t\t\tUnited Front groups in Canada helped Beijing stockpile coronavirus safety supplies\t\t\t\n",
      "Global News asked Bill Blair, Canada’s Public Safety Minister responsible for CSIS, to comment on the government’s response to China’s interference.“Our government’s top priority is keeping Canadians safe. Alongside our international partners, Canada’s national security agencies are constantly working to identify threats to national security including foreign interference and espionage,” a statement from Blair’s office said.“We welcomed the report from the National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians released earlier this year which studied this issue, and continue to remain vigilant for potential threats and to take appropriate measures to ensure the safety and security of Canadians.”Experts told Global News not all politicians and businesses that trade with China are being influenced and cases of espionage and elite capture have yet to be proven in Canada. But evidence in countries such as Australia shows the Chinese Communist Party’s strategy is to patiently target and win support from elites abroad using the nation’s growing wealth, experts say.Charles Burton, a former Canadian diplomat in China, said he agrees that China’s Communist Party has obtained significant influence in Canadian affairs through elite capture. And he also agrees with Genuis’s assessment that Ottawa has been blind to China’s interference.“I think there is a tendency among our elites to downplay the significance of their collaboration with the Chinese state, and there is a tendency of believing the collaboration is for the greater good of Canada’s economy,” Burton said. “But there is a lot of willful ignoring of information that could be relating to matters that are at least conflicts of interest, if not unlawful.”Canada’s bipartisan intelligence committee review recommended the government examine Australia’s laws that are designed to counter China’s interference. Australia now requires current and former politicians to register any foreign business interests. Canada currently has no such laws, which makes it difficult to know who could be supporting the Chinese Communist Party for hidden financial reasons, experts told Global News.\n",

      "Burton said Australia’s counter-espionage transparency laws have already led to greater accountability. In one example, he said a former Australian trade minister dropped an $880,000 per year consulting gig for a Chinese company, after Australia’s new laws came into effect.“Sunshine is the best disinfectant,” Burton said. “So the idea that people who were responsible for important files should be subject to scrutiny for potential conflict of interest when they leave government, is good for Canada.”Genuis said if the Canada-China relations special committee restarts, his party wants to examine potential elite capture in Canadian business and politics, the integrity of Canadian academic institutions, theft of Canada’s high-tech and intellectual property, and foreign interference in diaspora communities in Canada.“We need to look at the vulnerability of our communities to pressure and bullying from state actors,” Genuis said. “But the government, unfortunately, isn’t taking this seriously. If they don’t start to, I think we will see electoral consequences.”\n",

      "CONTENT : China has sentenced a Canadian citizen to death on charges of manufacturing the drug ketamine amid heightened tension between the two countries.The Guangzhou Municipal Intermediate Court announced Xu Weihong’s penalty on Thursday and said an alleged accomplice, Wen Guanxiong, had been given a life sentence.READ MORE: China detained Kovrig, Spavor in ‘political decision’ over Meng arrest, Trudeau saysDeath sentences are automatically referred to China’s highest court for review.The brief court statement gave no details but local media in the southern Chinese city at the heart of the country’s manufacturing industry said Xu and Wen had gathered ingredients and tools and began making ketamine in October 2016, then stored the final product in Xu’s home in Guangzhou’s Haizhu district.Police later confiscated more than 120 kilograms of the drug from Xu’s home and another address, the reports said. Ketamine is a powerful pain killer that has become popular among club goers in China and elsewhere.Relations between China and Canada have been soured over the arrest of Meng Wanzhou, an executive and the daughter of the founder of Chinese tech giant Huawei, at Vancouver’s airport in late 2018. The U.S. wants her extradited to face fraud charges over the company’s dealings with Iran. Her arrest infuriated Beijing, which sees her case as a political move designed to prevent China’s rise as a global technology power.In apparent retaliation, China detained former Canadian diplomat Michael Kovrig and Canadian entrepreneur Michael Spavor, accusing them of vague national security crimes. China also handed a death sentence to a convicted Canadian drug smuggler in a sudden retrial and has placed restrictions on various Canadian exports to China, including canola seed oil.Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said there was no connection between Xu’s sentencing and current China-Canada relations.READ MORE: Canada-China tensions — why they began and what’s happened since“I would like to stress that China’s judicial authorities handle the relevant case independently in strict accordance with Chinese law and legal procedures,” Wang said at a daily briefing Thursday. “This case should not inflict any impact on China-Canada relations.”Like many Asian nations, China deals out stiff penalties for manufacturing and selling illegal drugs, including the death penalty. In December 2009, Pakistani-British businessman Akmal Shaikh was executed after being convicted of smuggling heroin, despite allegations he was mentally disturbed.“Death sentences for drug-related crimes that are extremely dangerous will help deter and prevent such crimes,” Wang said. “China’s judicial authorities handle cases involving criminals of different nationalities in accordance with law.”\n",

      "CONTENT : For decades, the Uighur imam was a bedrock of his farming community in China’s far west. On Fridays, he preached Islam as a religion of peace. On Sundays, he treated the sick with free herbal medicine. In the winter, he bought coal for the poor.But as a Chinese government mass detention campaign engulfed Memtimin Emer’s native Xinjiang region three years ago, the elderly imam was swept up and locked away, along with all three of his sons living in China.READ MORE: Doctors, politicians sound alarm in Calgary over potential for coronavirus to spread in Chinese detention campsNow, a newly revealed database exposes in extraordinary detail the main reasons for the detentions of Emer, his three sons, and hundreds of others in Karakax County: their religion and their family ties.The database obtained by The Associated Press profiles the internment of 311 individuals with relatives abroad and lists information on more than 2,000 of their relatives, neighbors and friends. Each entry includes the detainee’s name, address, national identity number, detention date and location, along with a detailed dossier on their family, religious and neighborhood background, the reason for detention, and a decision on whether or not to release them. Issued within the past year, the documents do not indicate which government department compiled them or for whom.Taken as a whole, the information offers the fullest and most personal view yet into how Chinese officials decided who to put into and let out of detention camps, as part of a massive crackdown that has locked away more than a million ethnic minorities, most of them Muslims.WATCH: Hong Kong protesters rally in support of Uighurs, clash with riot policeThe database emphasizes that the Chinese government focused on religion as a reason for detention — not just political extremism, as authorities claim, but ordinary activities such as praying, attending a mosque, or even growing a long beard. It also shows the role of family: People with detained relatives are far more likely to end up in a camp themselves, uprooting and criminalizing entire families like Emer’s in the process.Similarly, family background and attitude is a bigger factor than detainee behavior in whether they are released.“It’s very clear that religious practice is being targeted,” said Darren Byler, a University of Colorado researcher studying the use of surveillance technology in Xinjiang.“They want to fragment society, to pull the families apart and make them much more vulnerable to retraining and reeducation.”The Xinjiang regional government did not respond to faxes requesting comment. Asked whether Xinjiang is targeting religious people and their families, foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said “this kind of nonsense is not worth commenting on.”Beijing has said before that the detention centers are for voluntary job training, and that it does not discriminate based on religion.WATCH: Thousands march in support of Uighurs after soccer star commentsChina has struggled for decades to control Xinjiang, where the native Uighurs have long resented Beijing’s heavy-handed rule. With the 9/11 attacks in the United States, officials began using the specter of terrorism to justify harsher religious restrictions, saying young Uighurs were susceptible to Islamic extremism.After militants set off bombs at a train station in Xinjiang’s capital in 2014, President Xi Jinping launched a so-called “People’s War on Terror”, transforming Xinjiang into a digital police state.The leak of the database from sources in the Uighur exile community follows the release in November of a classified blueprint on how the mass detention system really works. The blueprint obtained by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, which includes the AP, showed that the centers are in fact forced ideological and behavioral re-education camps run in secret. Another set of documents leaked to the New York Times revealed the historical lead-up to the mass detention.The latest set of documents came from sources in the Uighur exile community, and the most recent date in them is March 2019. The detainees listed come from Karakax County, a traditional settlement of about 650,000 on the edge of Xinjiang’s Taklamakan desert where more than 97 percent of residents are Uighur. The list was corroborated through interviews with former Karakax residents, Chinese identity verification tools, and other lists and documents seen by the AP.READ MORE: Secret documents reveal how China operates mass detention campsDetainees and their families are tracked and classified by rigid, well-defined categories. Households are designated as “trustworthy” or “not trustworthy,” and their attitudes are graded as “ordinary” or “good.” Families have “light” or “heavy” religious atmospheres, and the database keeps count of how many relatives of each detainee are locked in prison or sent to a “training center.”Officials used these categories to determine how suspicious a person was — even if they hadn’t committed any crimes.“It underscores the witch-hunt mindset of the government, and how the government criminalizes everything,” said Adrian Zenz, an expert on the detention centers and senior fellow at the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation in Washington, D.C.Reasons listed for internment include “minor religious infection,” “disturbs other persons by visiting them without reasons,” “relatives abroad,” “thinking is hard to grasp” and “untrustworthy person born in a certain decade.” The last seems to refer to younger men; about 31 percent of people considered “untrustworthy” were in the age bracket of 25 to 29 years, according to an analysis of the data by Zenz.When former student Abdullah Muhammad spotted Emer’s name on the list of the detained, he was distraught.“He didn’t deserve this,” Muhammad said. “Everyone liked and respected him. He was the kind of person who couldn’t stay silent against injustice.”Even in Karakax county, famed for its intellectuals and scholars, Emer stood out as one of the most renowned teachers in the region. Muhammad studied the Quran under Emer for six years as a kid, following him from house to house in an effort to dodge the authorities. Muhammad said Emer was so respected that the police would phone him with warnings ahead of time before raiding classes at his modest, single-story home of brick and mud.READ MORE: China warns U.S. criticism over Uighurs not ‘helpful’ for trade talksThough Emer gave Party-approved sermons, he refused to preach Communist propaganda, Muhammad said, eventually running into trouble with the authorities. He was stripped of his position as an imam and barred from teaching in 1997, amid unrest roiling the region.When Muhammad left China for Saudi Arabia and Turkey in 2009, Emer was making his living as a doctor of traditional medicine. Emer was growing old, and under heavy surveillance, he had stopped attending religious gatherings.That didn’t stop authorities from detaining the imam, who is in his eighties, and sentencing him on various charges for up to 12 years in prison over 2017 and 2018. The database cites four charges in various entries: “stirring up terrorism,” acting as an unauthorized “wild” imam, following the strict Saudi Wahhabi sect and conducting illegal religious teachings.Muhammad called the charges false. Emer had stopped his preaching, practiced a moderate Central Asian sect of Islam rather than Wahhabism and never dreamed of hurting others, let alone stirring up “terrorism,” Muhammad said.“He used to always preach against violence,” Muhammad said. “Anyone who knew him can testify that he wasn’t a religious extremist.”None of Emer’s three sons had been convicted of a crime. But the database shows that over the course of 2017, all were thrown into the detention camps for having too many children, trying to travel abroad, being “untrustworthy” or “infected with religious extremism,”or going on the Hajj, the Muslim pilgrimage to the holy city of Mecca. It also shows that their relation to Emer and their religious background was enough to convince officials they were too dangerous to let out from the detention camps.“His father taught him how to pray,” notes one entry for his eldest, Ablikim Memtimin.“His family’s religious atmosphere is thick. We recommend he (Emer) continue training,” says another entry for his youngest son, Emer Memtimin.Even a neighbor was tainted by living near him, with Emer’s alleged crimes and prison sentence recorded in the neighbor’s dossier.The database indicates much of this information is collected by teams of cadres stationed at mosques, sent to visit homes and posted in communities. This information is then compiled in a dossier called the “three circles”, encompassing their relatives, community, and religious background.It wasn’t just the religious who were detained. The database shows that Karakax officials also explicitly targeted people for activities that included going abroad, getting a passport or installing foreign software.Pharmacist Tohti Himit was detained in a camp for having gone multiple times to one of 26 “key” countries, mostly Muslim, according to the database. Former employee Habibullah, who is now in Turkey, recalled Himit as a secular, kind and wealthy man who kept his face free of a beard.“He wasn’t very pious, he didn’t go to the mosque,” said Habibullah, who declined to give his first name out of fear of retribution against family still in China. “I was shocked by how absurd the reasons for detention were.”The database says cadres found Himit had attended his grandfather’s funeral at a local mosque on March 10, 2008. Later that year, the cadres found, he had gone to the same mosque again, once to worship and once to celebrate a festival. In 2014 he had gone to Anhui province, in inner China, to get a passport and go abroad.That, the government concluded, was enough to show that Himit was “certainly dangerous.” They ordered Himit to stay in the center and “continue training.”Emer is now under house arrest due to health issues, his former student, Muhammad, has heard. It’s unclear where Emer’s sons are.It was the imam’s courage and stubbornness that did him in, Muhammad said. Though deprived of his mosque and his right to teach, Emer quietly defied the authorities for two decades by staying true to his faith.“Unlike some other scholars, he never cared about money or anything else the Communist Party could give him,” Muhammad said. “He never bowed down to them — and that’s why they wanted to eliminate him.”\n",

      "CONTENT : China’s Communist Party celebrated its 70th anniversary in power with a military parade Tuesday that showcased its growing might and strategic ambitions.An honour guard carrying the Chinese flag through Tiananmen Square, the country’s symbolic political heart, before thousands of spectators who waved flags. Artillery guns fired a salute.President Xi Jinping, wearing a gray Mao jacket, and other Chinese leaders, including former Presidents Hu Jintao and Jiang Zemin, watched from atop the Gate of Heavenly Peace at the square’s north end.READ MORE: Hong Kong police, protesters clash ahead of China’s National Day“No force can shake the status of our great motherland, and no force can stop the progress of the Chinese people and the Chinese nation,” Xi said in a nationally televised speech.Xi rode in an open-topped limousine past dozens of rows of truck-mounted missiles, armoured personnel carriers and other military gear. Soldiers in helmets and combat gear shouted, “Hello, leader!” and “Serve the people!” Xi replied, “Hello, comrades.”The event marks the anniversary of the Oct. 1, 1949, announcement of the founding of the People’s Republic of China by then-leader Mao Zedong following a civil war.WATCH: Hong Kong braces for chaos ahead of China’s National DayThe parade follows Xi’s promise in a speech Monday to allow Hong Kong to manage its own affairs despite anti-government protests that have embarrassed the ruling party ahead of the year’s highest-profile propaganda event.The parade through central Beijing is due to include 15,000 troops and more than 160 aircraft.Chinese news reports say it might include a new long-range nuclear-armed missile and a supersonic drone aircraft. Military spokespeople have declined to give details.\n",

      "CONTENT : China has sentenced a Canadian citizen to death on charges of manufacturing the drug ketamine amid heightened tension between the two countries.The Guangzhou Municipal Intermediate Court announced Xu Weihong’s penalty on Thursday and said an alleged accomplice, Wen Guanxiong, had been given a life sentence.READ MORE: China detained Kovrig, Spavor in ‘political decision’ over Meng arrest, Trudeau saysDeath sentences are automatically referred to China’s highest court for review.The brief court statement gave no details but local media in the southern Chinese city at the heart of the country’s manufacturing industry said Xu and Wen had gathered ingredients and tools and began making ketamine in October 2016, then stored the final product in Xu’s home in Guangzhou’s Haizhu district.Police later confiscated more than 120 kilograms of the drug from Xu’s home and another address, the reports said. Ketamine is a powerful pain killer that has become popular among club goers in China and elsewhere.Relations between China and Canada have been soured over the arrest of Meng Wanzhou, an executive and the daughter of the founder of Chinese tech giant Huawei, at Vancouver’s airport in late 2018. The U.S. wants her extradited to face fraud charges over the company’s dealings with Iran. Her arrest infuriated Beijing, which sees her case as a political move designed to prevent China’s rise as a global technology power.In apparent retaliation, China detained former Canadian diplomat Michael Kovrig and Canadian entrepreneur Michael Spavor, accusing them of vague national security crimes. China also handed a death sentence to a convicted Canadian drug smuggler in a sudden retrial and has placed restrictions on various Canadian exports to China, including canola seed oil.Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said there was no connection between Xu’s sentencing and current China-Canada relations.READ MORE: Canada-China tensions — why they began and what’s happened since“I would like to stress that China’s judicial authorities handle the relevant case independently in strict accordance with Chinese law and legal procedures,” Wang said at a daily briefing Thursday. “This case should not inflict any impact on China-Canada relations.”Like many Asian nations, China deals out stiff penalties for manufacturing and selling illegal drugs, including the death penalty. In December 2009, Pakistani-British businessman Akmal Shaikh was executed after being convicted of smuggling heroin, despite allegations he was mentally disturbed.“Death sentences for drug-related crimes that are extremely dangerous will help deter and prevent such crimes,” Wang said. “China’s judicial authorities handle cases involving criminals of different nationalities in accordance with law.”\n",

The quarantine in the city is to be formally lifted on Wednesday.In Beijing, President Xi Jinping led other top officials, all dressed in black suits with white carnations, as they bowed before a flag at half-staff in the leadership compound of Zhongnanhai.On Saturday, China reported one new confirmed case in Wuhan and 18 among people arriving from abroad, along with four new deaths, all in Wuhan. China now has recorded a total of 81,639 cases and 3,326 deaths, although those figures are generally considered to be understated because of a lack of testing and a reluctance to report the scale of the original outbreak.China’s slow, cautious emergence from the global pandemic comes as the U.S. is struggling to deal with an outbreak that has taken more than 1,860 lives in New York City alone. Hard-hit European nations Italy, Spain and France are also seeing rising numbers of cases and deaths, although strict social distancing measures such as those adopted by China appear to be having an effect.The State Council, China’s Cabinet, ordered that national flags be flown at half-staff around the country and at Chinese embassies and consulates abroad, and the suspension of all public recreational activities.READ MORE: Coronavirus — Deaths of healthcare workers highlight risks on the front linesThe horns of automobiles, trains and ships joined in what China’s official Xinhua News Agency called a “wail in grief” for three minutes.

Officials have banned such observances this year to avoid large gatherings that might contribute to a feared second wave of infections.More than 3,000 health care workers contracted COVID-19 and the government says 14 died of the disease. Among them was Dr. Li Wenliang, who was threatened with punishment by police after publicizing news of the outbreak but has since been listed among the national “martyrs.”\n",

Customers wash their hands with disinfectant and are checked for the virus’s telltake fever, said the manager, who would give only her surname, Lu.READ MORE: ‘We do get fresh air’ — Edmonton couple trapped on ship quarantined over coronavirus“It is normal for people to worry about supply, but we explain there will be enough,” Lu said by phone.Food stocks in supermarkets ran low shortly after Beijing imposed travel curbs and extended the Lunar New Year holiday to keep factories, offices and other businesses closed and the public at home in an attempt to prevent the virus from spreading.That also kept trucks off the road, disrupting supplies of food to markets, feed to farmers and poultry to slaughterhouses. As the shutdown of Wuhan expanded to cover cities with a total of 60 million people, villagers set up their own roadblocks to keep outsiders and possible infection away.This week, a Cabinet official acknowledged vegetable supplies were uneven and some “daily necessities” were sold out.“These problems are being coordinated and resolved,” Lian Weiliang, deputy chairman of the National Development and Reform Commission, said at a Feb. 3 news conference in Beijing.Later that day, state TV announced the ruling Communist Party order local authorities nationwide to “ensure the supply of daily necessities” including vegetables, meat, eggs, milk and grain.[ Sign up for our Health IQ newsletter for the latest coronavirus updates ]The following day, the Agriculture Ministry told officials to unblock transportation and “ensure normal operation” of livestock and feed production.

      "Merchants were warned earlier against hoarding and price-gouging. The Shanghai city government said it fined a supermarket 2 million yuan ($270,000) for raising the price of cabbage by 400 per cent.To reassure the public, state media are filled with photos of boxes stuffed with eggplants, cauliflower and other vegetables being loaded onto trucks for delivery to markets.Party leaders in Shenzhen, a city of 15 million people adjacent to Hong Kong that is a center for finance and technology, sent officials to rural Yunnan province in the southwest to make sure vegetable shipments resumed quickly after the holiday, the Shenzhen News Net reported.China already was struggling with surging food prices due to an outbreak of African swine fever that began in 2018. Millions of pigs died or were destroyed, disrupting supplies of pork, the country’s staple meat.The price of pork doubled in December from a year earlier, pushing up overall food costs by double digits. The government has released pork from stockpiles but industry analysts say prices and the size of Chinese pig herds are unlikely to return to normal until at least next year.In quarantined areas, trucks with government permits are allowed through roadblocks every day to bring in food. Soldiers from the ruling party’s military wing, the People’s Liberation Army, have taken over delivery of medical supplies.Some trucking companies are shorthanded because drivers who returned to their hometowns for Lunar New Year are stranded there by the suspension of bus and train links in some areas.“We have eight trucks and three of them are operating now,” said an employee of a vegetable delivery company in the eastern city of Nanjing. She would give only her surname, Yao.The Wushang Mart cut its daily opening hours from 13 to seven and put the whole staff to work in one shift, said Lu, the manager. That includes unloading 1,000-kilogram (2,000-pound) truckloads of green beans, spinach, potatoes and other vegetables.“The stock we have now is 50 per cent more than normal,” Lu said.\n",

Employees have been given masks, goggles, protective clothing, disinfectant and other supplies.JD.com, the country’s biggest online direct retailer, said its sales of fresh food in Wuhan were up 280 per cent from a year ago in the week ending Feb. 2. Nationwide, it says sales of beef, pork and eggs were up 400 per cent. The company said it sold 1.8 million bottles of disinfectant.In Nanjing, an outlet of the Huarun supermarket chain is stocking more than usual “to make sure people have enough to eat,” said an employee who answered the phone there. He refused to give his name.“There were some people who tried to buy a lot, but they no longer do it after seeing the abundant supply,” said the employee.\n",

      "CONTENT : China accused Australia of “petty tricks” on Wednesday in an intensifying dispute over Canberra’s push for an international inquiry into the coronavirus outbreak that could affect diplomatic and economic ties between the countries.Prime Minister Scott Morrison said his proposed inquiry into how the coronavirus developed and spread would not be targeted at China but was needed given COVID-19 had killed more than 200,000 people and shut down much of the global economy.“Now, it would seem entirely reasonable and sensible that the world would want to have an independent assessment of how this all occurred, so we can learn the lessons and prevent it from happening again,” he said.\n",

      "Australian government ministers have repeatedly said China was threatening “economic coercion” after its ambassador, Cheng Jingye, said this week that Chinese consumers could boycott Australian products and universities because of the calls for the inquiry.The head of Australia’s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) called Cheng to express concern. The Chinese embassy then released a statement detailing what it said was discussed on the call, prompting another rebuke from DFAT.On Wednesday, the Chinese embassy returned fire, saying on its website that details of the call had first been “obviously leaked by some Australian officials” and it needed to set the record straight.“The Embassy of China doesn’t play petty tricks, this is not our tradition. But if others do, we have to reciprocate,” an embassy spokesman said in the statement.\n",

      "CONTENT : Scientists in the city at the centre of China’s virus outbreak have applied to patent a drug made by U.S. company Gilead Science Inc. to treat the disease, possibly fueling conflict over technology policy that helped trigger Washington’s tariff war with Beijing.The government-run Wuhan Institute of Virology said this week it applied for the patent in January along with a military laboratory.

      "Granting its own scientists a patent might give the Chinese government leverage in negotiations over paying for the drug. But it also might fuel complaints Beijing abuses its regulatory system to pressure foreign companies to hand over valuable technology.On Thursday, the official Xinhua News Agency said clinical trials of the drug, remdesivir, were due to start.Gilead, headquartered in Foster City, California, said it applied in 2016 for a Chinese patent on use of remdesivir against coronaviruses and is waiting for a decision. The coronavirus family includes the novel coronavirus, or 2019-nCoV, blamed for the outbreak in Wuhan.“Gilead has no influence over whether a patent office issues a patent to the Chinese researchers,” said a company spokesman, Ryan McKeel. “Their application has been filed more than three years after Gilead’s filing and will be considered in view of what is already known about the compound and pending patent applications.”[ Sign up for our Health IQ newsletter for the latest coronavirus updates ]The institute said its application was filed Jan. 21. Two days later, Chinese authorities suspended most access to Wuhan, a city of 11 million people. That lockdown has expanded to surrounding cities and some in other provinces, isolating a total of about 60 million people in the most sweeping anti-disease measures ever imposed.China has the right under World Trade Organization rules to declare an emergency and compel a company to license a patent to protect the public. It would be required to pay a license fee that is deemed fair market value.\n",

      "The government might be able to avoid that fee if the patent were granted to the Wuhan institute, part of the elite Chinese Academy of Sciences.The institute said it applied for a “use patent” that specifies the Wuhan virus as the drug’s target. Gilead’s patent application, filed before the virus was identified, cites only the overall family of coronaviruses.The Chinese researchers made their patent application “from the perspective of protecting national interests,” said the institute statement.“If relevant foreign companies plan to contribute to China’s epidemic prevention and control, we both agree that if the state needs it, we will not require enforcement of rights given by the patent,” it said.Gillead said last week it was working with U.S. and Chinese health authorities on studying remdesivir. The company said it has provided the drug for emergency use in a small number of patients with the Wuhan virus “in the absence of any approved treatment options.”Remdesivir was used to treat the first U.S. patient with the new virus by doctors at a hospital north of Seattle. A detailed report on the patient’s symptoms and treatment was published in the New England Journal of Medicine. The man has been released from the hospital and is recovering at home, but it’s not clear whether the Gilead drug helped him or not.\n",

      "CONTENT : Editor’s Note: This story was updated on Sept. 10 to include a statement clarifying the founding and ownership from Nuctech.Canada’s minister of foreign affairs has promised to review Ottawa’s purchasing of security equipment as details emerge of five contracts awarded to a controversial high-tech company that is connected to the highest levels of the Chinese Communist Party.This week Ottawa posted details of the latest winning bid for Beijing-based Nuctech, in a deal to install X-ray scanning equipment and software to provide security for 170 Canadian embassies, consulates and high commissions worldwide.Nuctech was reportedly founded in 1997 by the son of former Chinese president Hu Jintao, and the security company has rapidly accumulated contracts worldwide for sensitive airport and border security infrastructure, while attracting criticism for alleged unfair business practices and allegations of corruption in Africa.According to the National Post, which first reported Thursday on Nuctech’s new deal with Global Affairs Canada, the July 2020 contract has an estimated value of $6.8 million. Documents do not confirm that figure, but confirm a “contract award date” of July 15.\n",

      "Global News has found that already, since 2017, Nuctech has been awarded four border security and customs warehouse contracts valued at $6.5 million, to provide scanners and lab equipment to Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA), according to procurement documents.This is despite mounting concerns among some national security experts about Nuctech’s growing access to sensitive facilities worldwide.Responding to questions from Global News, a statement from Minister of Foreign Affairs Francois-Phillipe Champagne promised to review Nuctech’s “standing offer” and look at “any possible issue relative to security or safety … all appropriate actions (will be) taken to ensure the safety of our missions around the world.”“We are currently looking into the offer with Nuctech Company to provide some security screening equipment in our missions abroad,” Champagne’s statement said. “Global Affairs has not purchased any equipment from Nuctech at this time.”“In addition, I have today directed GAC officials to review our purchasing practices when it comes to security equipment and to continue reviewing the security of our missions around the world.” After this story was first published the CBSA stated it is “currently reviewing this matter and will work with Public Services and Procurement Canada and Global Affairs Canada in this review.”“The safety and security of Canada is a top priority for the CBSA,” the statement said. “For large contracts, PSPC is the contracting authority.”PSPC declined to answer questions for this story.Nuctech also did not immediately respond to questions emailed from Global News for this story.The New York Times has repeatedly reported on an alleged corruption case in Namibia involving Nuctech. According to Namibian prosecutors, in May 2008, three suspects allegedly received $12.8 million in kickbacks to help Nuctech secure a $55-million X-ray scanner contract, the Times reported. Nuctech’s founder Hu Haifeng, the son of President Hu Jintao, was not accused in the case but was sought as a witness, according to the Times.The three suspects pleaded not guilty on preliminary corruption and money laundering charges. Hu Haifeng eventually became the CCP secretary in charge of a state-owned company that holds about 30 companies including Nuctech, the Times reported. Hu Jintao retired in 2012 and was succeeded as China’s paramount leader by Xi Jinping.However, Nuctech disputes that Hu Haifeng founded the company. In a statement to Global News after this story was published, the company said it “was founded by three professors from Tsinghua University.”Nuctech says that its parent company is Tsinghua Tongfang, and Nuctech is 16 per cent owned “through China National Nuclear Corporation” which is a state-owned entity.Meanwhile, in Europe, some analysts are complaining that Nuctech is making rapid inroads providing services to border security facilities due to China’s state-backing, unfair practices, and potentially Beijing’s influence over some European politicians.“Nuctech provides the services, systems and software to support its equipment, which can be connected to databases containing the personal data of millions of Europeans managed by airports,” Politico reported in February.The story quoted Axel Voss, a German federal politician, who said: “it’s extremely worrisome if a foreign state-funded company gets more and more control over our strategic infrastructure.”\n",

      "Carleton University professor Stephanie Carvin, a former Canadian Security Intelligence Service official, said the Nuctech contract for Canadian embassies presents security concerns, but she believes China’s “geo-economic” strategy is the bigger concern.“This is not Huawei. I’m not as concerned as I would be with telecommunications,” Carvin said. “The issue is the fact companies like Nuctech are inherently anti-competitive, they may in some cases be beneficiaries of stolen technologies, and they want to fundamentally take over and undermine western technologies.”However, another Canadian security expert, who asked not to be identified due to risks related to China, said Nuctech presents a serious high-tech danger.“All electronic equipment is an end-point and potential access point into your network and data,” the expert said. “For Global Affairs to proceed when China has been implicated in a systematic campaign of cyber-espionage against Canada, while former diplomats are being held hostage and tortured in Chinese prisons, is unintelligible.”\n",

It’s also been found in humans, but it’s extremely rare to see human-to-human transmission.The disease causes flu-like symptoms including fever, weakness, weight loss and malaise, the WHO says.

      "The Republican president, often accused of not acting early enough to prepare the United States for the spread of the virus, said he believed China should have been more active in letting the world know about the coronavirus much sooner.Asked whether he was considering the use of tariffs or even debt write-offs for China, Trump would not offer specifics. “There are many things I can do,” he said. “We’re looking for what happened.”“China will do anything they can to have me lose this race,” said Trump. He said he believes Beijing wants his Democratic opponent, Joe Biden, to win the race to ease the pressure Trump has placed on China over trade and other issues.“They’re constantly using public relations to try to make it like they’re innocent parties,” he said of Chinese officials.He said the trade deal that he concluded with Chinese President Xi Jinping aimed at reducing chronic U.S. trade deficits with China had been “upset very badly” by the economic fallout from the virus.A senior Trump administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said on Wednesday that an informal “truce” in the war of words that Trump and Xi essentially agreed to in a phone call in late March now appeared to be over.The two leaders had promised that their governments would do everything possible to cooperate to contain the coronavirus.

They want to make a deal,” Trump said. “They’ve agreed to pay a lot of money. They’re paying a lot more money than they did when I got here” in January 2017.The United States stations roughly 28,500 troops in South Korea, a legacy of the 1950-53 Korean War that ended in an armistice, rather than a peace treaty.Trump is leading a triage effort to try to keep the U.S. economy afloat through stimulus payments to individuals and companies while nudging state governors to carefully reopen their states as new infections decline.He said he is happy with the way many governors are operating under the strain of the virus but said some need to improve. He would not name names.Trump’s handling of the virus has come under scrutiny. Forty-three percent of Americans approved of Trump’s handling of the coronavirus, according to the Reuters/Ipsos poll from April 27-28.But the president got some good news when Gilead Sciences Inc said it’s experimental antiviral drug remdesivir was showing progress in treating virus victims.\n",

Vietnam counted its seventh case, a Vietnamese-American man who had a two-hour layover in Wuhan on his way from the U.S. to Ho Chi Minh City.The U.S. total rose to 11 cases, mostly involving recent travel to Wuhan. The U.S. said Sunday that Americans who had travelled in China within the last 14 days would be routed to designated airports for enhanced health screenings and most non-Americans who recently were in China would be denied entry.Amid accusations of a slow official response to the outbreak, six officials in the city of Huanggang, next to Wuhan in Hubei province, were fired over “poor performance” in handling the outbreak, the official Xinhua News Agency reported. It cited the mayor as saying the city’s “capabilities to treat the patients remained inadequate and there is a severe shortage in medical supplies such as protective suits and medical masks.”The trading and manufacturing centre of Wenzhou, with nearly 10 million people in coastal Zhejiang province, confined people to their homes, allowing only one family member to venture out every other day to buy necessary supplies. Huanggang, home to 7 million people, imposed similar measures on Saturday. \n",

      "With more countries imposing restrictions on travellers from China, and reports of discrimination against Chinese abroad, the country’s diplomats are beginning to speak out.Chinese ambassador in Sri Lanka Cheng Xueyuan issued a statement Sunday night expressing worries over Chinese people being turned away by restaurants and taxis in the Indian Ocean island nation.“We understand the concerns of (the) Sri Lanka public but we at the same time hope that they could feel China’s responsible attitude and see the forceful and effective measures taken by China,” Cheng said.The crisis is the latest to confront Chinese leader Xi Jinping, who has been beset by months of anti-government protests in Hong Kong, the reelection of Taiwan’s pro-independence president and criticism over human rights violations in the traditionally Muslim territory of Xinjiang. Meanwhile, the domestic economy continues to slow, weighed down by slowing demand and the trade war with Washington.\n",
