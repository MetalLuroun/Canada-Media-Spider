      "\tFive years after it was passed, the Paris agreement may finally be changing the climate on climate change.\n",
      "\t\"I've always known we're not going to act as soon as we could have,\" said Mark Jaccard, a widely consulted energy economist at Simon Fraser University.\n",
      "\t\"I also know that when we do start to act, it'll be very fast. It'll be one of those tipping points and it could be that we're at one right now.\"\n",
      "\tOn Dec. 12, 2015, 196 countries met in Paris and put their signatures on a legally binding treaty to do what it took to limit global warming to below two degrees Celsius and to create carbon-neutral economies by 2050.\n",
      "\tProgress on those promises has been spotty.\n",
      "\tThe United Nations annual emissions gap report released this week points out that greenhouse gas emissions have continued to grow and reached record levels in 2019. Even with a seven per cent decline in emissions expected this year because of the COVID-19 pandemic, atmospheric concentrations are expected to rise.\n",
      "\tThe Liberal government has committed Canada to being carbon neutral by 2050. But it has released no plan for the three to four per cent annual cuts that it would take to get there. Canada has never met any of its previous climate goals and is one of five G20 countries behind on its Paris commitments.\n",
      "\tAnd yet ...\n",
      "\t\"We have a much stronger climate movement that we did,\" said Keith Stewart of Greenpeace. \"A lot of the big forces in the world are starting to line up behind the transition.\"\n",
      "\tMore and more financial institutions -- including, just this week, the $225-billion New York state pension fund -- are divesting from fossil fuels or decarbonizing. The UN says 126 countries, including China, have either adopted binding net-zero goals or are considering them.\n",
      "\tThe cost of renewable energy is plummeting -- 90 per cent for solar power, says an Oxford University publication. Some countries -- again, including China -- are putting end dates on the sale of gas-powered vehicles.\n",
      "\t\"The effort is picking up speed,\" Jaccard said.\n",
      "\tWithout Paris, Canada wouldn't have achieved what it has, federal Environment Minister Jonathan Wilkinson told an online webinar Thursday.\n",
      "\t\"Canadians were really tired of inaction,\" he said. \"The pan-Canadian framework was something that came out of the Paris agreement.\"\n",
      "\tThe federal Liberals have implemented a carbon tax, signed agreements to reduce methane releases, promised a clean-fuel standard to cut vehicle emissions, announced $1.5 billion in funding for electric buses and charging stations, and helped phase out coal-generated power.\n",
      "\t\"The Trudeau government is the only federal government Canada's had that is implementing the pricing and regulations that actually reduce emissions,\" Jaccard said.\n",
      "\tWilkinson promises even more.\n",
      "\t\"We know that more ambition will be required.\"\n",
      "\tMore is needed than just a new set of targets, Stewart said. Canadians who depend on the fossil fuel industry need help with the transition.\n",
      "\t\"There's a whole bunch of people who are going to be hurt badly if we don't do this properly,\" he said. \"The rest of the country is going to be supporting Alberta, Saskatchewan and Newfoundland.\"\n",
      "\tJaccard said some way may be needed to prevent countries that aren't limiting emissions from having a trade advantage. Tariffs that penalize products from high-carbon jurisdictions are being discussed both at home and abroad, he said.\n",
      "\t\"How do you get any kind of collective action when there are easy rewards for cheating? You have to have penalty mechanisms.\"\n",
      "\tParis made a real difference and progress is out there, said Jaccard.\n",
      "\t\"I react strongly to people who say it's too late. The evidence doesn't support it.\n",
      "\t\"It's harder, which means we've taken longer to act on it, but I always knew we would act.\"\n",

      "\tEuropean Union leaders reached a hard-fought deal Friday to cut the bloc's net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% by the end of the decade compared with 1990 levels, avoiding a hugely embarrassing deadlock ahead of a UN climate meeting this weekend.\n",
      "\tFollowing night-long discussions at their two-day summit in Brussels, the 27 member states approved the EU executive commission's proposal to toughen the bloc's intermediate target on the way to climate neutrality by mid-century, after a group of reluctant, coal-reliant countries finally agreed to support the improved goal.\n",
      "\t\"Europe is the leader in the fight against climate change,\" tweeted EU Council president Charles Michel as daylight broke over the EU capital city. \"We decided to cut our greenhouse gas emissions of at least 55% by 2030.\"\n",
      "\tGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel said the 21-hour summit during which the climate debate was a constant worry, had much to show for it. \"It was worth having a sleepless night,\" she said.\n",
      "\tFive years after the Paris agreement, the EU wants to be a leader in the fight against global warming. Yet the bloc's leaders were unable to agree on the new target the last time they met in October, mainly because of financial concerns by eastern nations seeking more clarity about how to fund and handle the green transition.\n",
      "\tBut the long-awaited deal on a massive long-term budget and coronavirus recovery clinched Thursday by EU leaders swung the momentum.\n",
      "\tLarge swaths of the record-high 1.82 trillion-euro package are set to pour into programs and investments designed to help the member states, regions and sectors particularly affected by the green transition, which are in need of a deep economic and social transformation. EU leaders have agreed that 30% of the package -- some 550 billion euros -- should be used to support the transition.\n",
      "\tStill, agreeing on common language was not an easy task. Negotiations were punctuated throughout the night by intense discussions in the plenary session and multiple chats in smaller groups on the sidelines.\n",
      "\tAnother delay in revising the EU's current 40% emission cuts objective for 2030 would have been particularly embarrassing before the virtual Climate Ambition Summit marking five years since the Paris deal, and leaders worked to the wire to seal a deal.\n",
      "\tThe event on Saturday will be co-hosted by the U.K. with the United Nations and France.\n",
      "\tFrench President Emmanuel Macron praised \"a major signal\" that will enable EU leaders \"to bring in our wake our big international partners, especially the United States and China.\"\n",
      "\tBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced last week he wants the U.K. to cut greenhouse gas emissions by at least 68% from 1990 levels by 2030 -- a more ambitious goal than the EU's.\n",
      "\tPoland, which last year didn't commit to the EU's 2050 climate neutrality goal, and other eastern countries, including the Czech Republic and Hungary, largely depend on coal for their energy needs. They considered it unfair that all member states should be submitted to the same ambition without considering their respective energy mixes.\n",
      "\tTo win their approval, member states agreed that the new target should be delivered collectively. According to the Belgian Prime minister's office, \"leaders agreed that the cuts will be first achieved in sectors and countries where there is still plenty of room for improvement.\"\n",
      "\tIn addition, the European Commission will take into account specific national situations when drawing up the measures. A progress report will be submitted to the European Council in the spring.\n",
      "\tThe accord also left the door open to member states to use gas or nuclear power as they drop fossil fuels. EU leaders agreed last year that nuclear energy would be part of the bloc's solution to making its economy carbon neutral, and they reiterated Friday that they would respect member states' rights to decide on their energy mix and to choose the most appropriate technologies to reach the goal.\n",
      "\tAccording to a French official who was not authorized to speak publicly about the meeting, Poland also obtained guarantees that the EU's Emissions Trading System -- a cap-and-trade scheme for industries to buy carbon credits covering about 40% of the EU's greenhouse gas emissions -- would be revamped. Poland wants the reform of the system to redirect more revenues to the poorer EU countries.\n",
      "\tWorld leaders agreed five years ago in Paris to keep the global warming increase to below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit), and ideally no more than 1.5 degrees C (2.7 degrees F) by the end of the century. Under the Paris accord, countries are required to submit updated climate targets by the end of this year.\n",
      "\tGreenpeace and other environmental groups have said the improved EU target is insufficient to properly tackle climate change.\n",
      "\t\"To increase the chances of limiting global heating to 1.5┬░C and avoid the worst effects of climate breakdown, Greenpeace is calling for at least a 65% cut in EU emissions from polluting sectors by 2030,\" the NGO said.\n",
      "\tClimate Action Network Europe regretted that the revised \"net\" target includes carbon sinks like reforestation, meaning that emitting sectors will need to decarbonize less to reach the new goal.\n",
      "\t\"As the Commission indicates itself in its 2030 Climate Target Plan, if the EU is successful in implementing the Commission's biodiversity, carbon removals could represent up to 5% of emissions. In this case the real emissions reduction target would be as low as 50%,\" the NGO said.\n",
      "\tEU leaders also encouraged the commission to propose a carbon tax at the bloc's borders for countries that did do not regulate CO2 emissions as strictly as the EU does.\n",

      "\tThe sweeping legislation prompted more public protests and led to complaints that Beijing is violating the autonomy promised to Hong Kong when was handed over to China from Britain in 1997. Critics have said the law is also damaging Hong Kong's status as a business centre.\n",

      "\tThe UN General Assembly approved a resolution over Russian objections Thursday commending progress in peace talks between the Afghan government and the Taliban while urging stepped-up efforts to tackle terrorist attacks by the Taliban, al-Qaida, the Islamic State extremist group and their affiliates.\n",
      "\tThe vote in the 193-member world body was 130 in favour, Russia against, and China, Pakistan and Belarus abstaining. Fifty-nine countries did not vote.\n",
      "\tThe 15-page resolution titled \"The Situation in Afghanistan\" covers a wide range of issues including peace and reconciliation, democracy, the rule of law, good governance, human rights, counter-narcotics, social and economic development and regional co-operation.\n",
      "\tWhile welcoming progress in the intra-Afghan talks, including the Dec. 2 agreement on rules of procedure for negotiations, the resolution \"condemns the high rate of continued violence.\" It says this \"is contributing to an unacceptable number of casualties\" and calls for an immediate cessation of violence and strongly encourages the Afghan government and the Taliban \"to pursue confidence-building measures and to reduce violence.\"\n",
      "\tThe resolution reiterates the General Assembly's \"serious concern\" about the security situation in Afghanistan and stresses the need to continue to address the threat to the country's stability from violence committed by the Taliban, including the Haqqani Network, as well as al-Qaida, Islamic State, their affiliates \"and other terrorist and criminal groups.\"\n",
      "\tAfghanistan's UN ambassador, Adela Raz, expressed regret that despite her government's strong support for the resolution it wasn't adopted by consensus, saying the measure reflects \"developments that are taking place on the ground and particularly the progress in the peace process.\"\n",
      "\tRaz said the goal of the government, Afghanistan's neighbours and the General Assembly is to incorporate the Taliban as a political party. \"It is our utmost aim to see the Taliban as a constructive political party in the country, without the relationship with al-Qaida and other terrorist groups, working for prosperity and peace in Afghanistan,\" she said.\n",
      "\tNoting that UN experts monitoring sanctions against the Taliban say it \"maintains ties to terrorist groups such as al-Qaida,\" Raz said the resolution is balanced regarding \"the Taliban's willingness to take firm steps towards peace and reconciliation\" and its continuing attacks and terrorist ties.\n",
      "\tGerman Ambassador Christoph Heusgen, whose country led negotiations on the resolution, said that \"out of all the 'special years' for Afghanistan declared in the past two decades, 2020 was indeed singular.\" Most important was the start of Afghan peace negotiations in September, he said after detailing all the events leading to the talks, starting with the U.S.-Taliban agreement in February.\n",
      "\tHeusgen also pointed to pledges of more than US$13 billion in foreign aid and stabilization for Afghanistan at a donors conference in Geneva just over two weeks ago as evidence that \"the international community stands firmly behind the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan and its ongoing quest to achieve self-reliance.\"\n",
      "\tHe said the resolution is \"constructive and forward-looking\" and the vote signals that the General Assembly \"stands behind the Afghan people in a very difficult period of the country.\"\n",
      "\tRussia's deputy UN ambassador, Anna Evstigneeva, sharply criticized Germany's role in the negotiations, saying there was \"blatant disregard\" for Moscow's concerns. She also said it is \"an attempt to conceal the true scope\" of threats from the Islamic State extremist group and drug issues threatening the country's security.\n",
      "\tShe accused Germany of having \"a pre-established biased position favouring one group of states,\" which she didn't name, and said it should no longer facilitate negotiations on the Afghanistan resolution in the General Assembly.\n",
      "\tNonetheless, Evstigneeva said, \"we continue to support Afghanistan during this crucial period.\"\n",
      "\tGermany's Heusgen responded by saying Russia's \"no\" vote sends the message that \"Russia today let down the Afghan people.\"\n",
      "\t\"All of us should have voted in favour and should have sent a strong signal to the Afghan people: In these difficult times, we stand behind you,\" he said.\n",

      "CONTENT : \n",
      "\tA locked-down pandemic-struck world cut its carbon dioxide emissions this year by 7%, the biggest drop ever, new preliminary figures show.\n",
      "\tThe Global Carbon Project, an authoritative group of dozens of international scientists who track emissions, calculated that the world will have put 37 billion U.S. tons (34 billion metric tons) of carbon dioxide in the air in 2020. That's down from 40.1 billion US tons (36.4 billion metric tons) in 2019, according a study published Thursday in the journal Earth System Science Data.\n",
      "\tScientists say this drop is chiefly because people are staying home, travelling less by car and plane, and that emissions are expected to jump back up after the pandemic ends. Ground transportation makes up about one-fifth of emissions of carbon dioxide, the chief man-made heat-trapping gas.\n",
      "\t\"Of course, lockdown is absolutely not the way to tackle climate change,\" said study co-author Corinne LeQuere, a climate scientist at the University of East Anglia.\n",
      "\tThe same group of scientists months ago predicted emission drops of 4% to 7%, depending on the progression of COVID-19. A second coronavirus wave and continued travel reductions pushed the decrease to 7%, LeQuere said.\n",
      "\tEmissions dropped 12% in the United States and 11% in Europe, but only 1.7% in China. That's because China had an earlier lockdown with less of a second wave. Also China's emissions are more industrial based than other countries and its industry was less affected than transportation, LeQuere said.\n",
      "\tThe calculations -- based on reports detailing energy use, industrial production and daily mobility counts -- were praised as accurate by outside scientists.\n",
      "\tEven with the drop in 2020, the world on average put 1,185 tons (1,075 metric tons) of carbon dioxide into the air every second.\n",
      "\tFinal figures for 2019 published in the same study show that from 2018 to 2019 emissions of the main man-made heat-trapping gas increased only 0.1%, much smaller than annual jumps of around 3% a decade or two ago. Even with emissions expected to rise after the pandemic, scientists are wondering if 2019 be the peak of carbon pollution, LeQuere said.\n",
      "\t\"We are certainly very close to an emissions peak, if we can keep the global community together,\" said United Nations Development Director Achim Steiner.\n",
      "\tChris Field, director of the Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment, thinks emissions will increase after the pandemic, but said \"I am optimistic that we have, as a society learned some lessons that may help decrease emissions in the future.\"\n",
      "\t\"For example,\" he added, \"as people get good at telecommuting a couple of days a week or realize they don't need quite so many business trips, we might see behaviour-related future emissions decreases.\"\n",

      "\tOn the grim two-year anniversary of Michael Kovrig’s imprisonment in China, his wife says she worries most about the state of his mental health heading into yet another holiday season alone.\n",
      "\t\"Here we are, two years later, still speaking about him being in detention. None of us would have imagined this was going to be the case,\" said Vina Nadjibulla in an interview on CTV’s Power Play on Thursday.\n",
      "\t\"I hoped sincerely that Michael would be home by now and instead he’s facing a prospect of his third Christmas alone, in isolation, in detention.\"\n",
      "\tKovrig, a former diplomat, and fellow Canadian Michael Spavor were arrested in China on Dec. 10, 2018, and charged with allegations of state spying for Canada. The Canadian government calls their detention arbitrary, while most in the diplomatic community view it as retaliation for the arrest of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou days prior in Vancouver on a U.S. extradition request.\n",
      "\tConsular access has been limited throughout the pandemic; the two men went 10 months without communication with Canadian representatives.\n",
      "\t\"Our contact has been very limited between January and October. There were no consular visits, there were very few letters from Michael. Finally, in October we were able to get a consular visit and at least confirmation and a reassurance that he is still healthy and is doing well,\" said Nadjibulla, who is married to Kovrig but separated.\n",
      "\tCanada’s Ambassador to China Dominic Barton who is leading the effort to secure Kovrig and Spavor’s release, told a House of Commons committee this week that the two men looked \"robust\" and that one \"would be very impressed by seeing both of them.\"\n",
      "\tNadjibulla called that long-awaited visit this fall a \"huge relief\" but notes she remains deeply concerned about his mental health.\n",
      "\t\"Michael is doing everything he possibly can to keep his mind occupied with positive thoughts, with virtuous thoughts, with prayers of gratitude, with philosophical passages. Reading really provides him solace day-to-day, he essentially says that is what gets him through moment-to-moment, is being able to read and have access to books, which we’ve been advocating for quite a bit,\" said Nadjibulla.\n",
      "\tThe Liberal government remains adamant it’s doing all it can to free the men, despite opposition criticism that Ottawa has been \"kowtowing\" to China over the last several years.\n",
      "\t\"Today is the sad anniversary of the illegal abduction and imprisonment of two innocent Canadians in China,\" said Conservative Leader Erin O’Toole during a press conference on Thursday.\n",
      "\t\"For months China has unfairly targeted our farming exports. For years, the Chinese Communist Party has been carrying out mass internment of the Uighurs in concentration camps and still the Liberals keep pushing for more involvement and more engagement with China.\"\n",
      "\tOptimism sparked last week when the Wall Street Journal reported the U.S. Justice Department was in talks with Meng’s legal team to resolve her fraud charges and allow her to return home should she admit to criminal wrongdoing. It led to speculation that the arrangement could pave a way for Kovrig and Spavor’s freedom.\n",
      "\tNadjibulla says, more broadly, she was left hopeful after hearing that during the first call between Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and U.S. President-Elect Joe Biden the leaders discussed the fate of the two men.\n",
      "\t\"I pray that we will be seeing the light at the end of the tunnel,\" she said.\n",

      "\tOutraged, Zhou took the previously taboo step of filing a lawsuit in 2018, joining the global #MeToo movement against sexual harassment. But the ruling Communist Party dislikes such grassroots activism and offers few ways to pursue complaints. Zhou waited two years for a hearing, while the host fought back by filing a defamation lawsuit.\n",
      "\tOn Wednesday, Zhou's case goes to trial in Beijing, highlighting the growing willingness of Chinese women to speak up about sexual harassment despite official resistance and censorship that eroded #MeToo's impact.\n",
      "\t\"There are very few sexual harassment cases who have a court hearing,\" Zhou said. \"We hope each individual case can be a type of push forward.\"\n",
      "\tThe ruling party, whose late leader Mao Zedong famously declared, \"women hold up half the sky,\" has improved their legal and social status but is far from delivering on its promise of equality. In some areas, conditions are deteriorating: Women have disappeared from leadership roles over the past three decades.\n",
      "\t#MeToo's global spread helped to encourage activism in China. But that came at a time when President Xi Jinping's government is tightening controls and stamping out dissent.\n",
      "\tWomen who complain face censorship and official resistance. It was only in 2019 that sexual harassment was added to court regulations as grounds for a suit.\n",
      "\tZhou accuses CCTV host Zhu Jun of groping and forcibly kissing her in 2014. She is asking for a public apology as well as 50,000 yuan (US$7,600) in damages.\n",
      "\tIn a series of social media posts, she said she was alone with Zhu in his dressing room for a few minutes. She said he tried to reach into her dress and drag her onto himself, and then forcibly kissed her. The posts were shared widely and reposted by many on the Chinese internet and prompted a great amount of media coverage.\n",
      "\tWhen Zhou filed suit in 2018, such complaints were treated as labour disputes or under other laws that didn't relate directly to sexual harassment. Zhou's was termed a \"personality rights dispute.\"\n",
      "\tHer lawyers have asked for it to be heard under the new legal provision that explicitly cites sexual harassment.\n",
      "\tZhu, the CCTV host, has denied the allegations. A call to his phone wasn't answered. A person who answered at the number in public records for the law firm that represents him said the firm had moved and had no new number.\n",

      "\tZhou expressed hope her case will show \"there are problems in the legal process.\"\n",
      "\tThe movement took off in 2018 in China when a college student in Beijing publicly accused her professor of sexual harassment.\n",
      "\tIn a rare victory, a woman who used the alias Liu Li won a sexual harassment suit against her former boss in July. The boss, a social worker in the western city of Chengdu, was required to issue a public apology but no damages were awarded.\n",
      "\tActivists want more legislative changes and legal tools.\n",

      "\tThe EU drug agency said Tuesday it may need another four weeks to decide whether to grant its first approval for a coronavirus vaccine, even as authorities in the United States and Britain continued to aim for a green light before Christmas.\n",
      "\tThe European Medicines Agency plans to convene a meeting by Dec. 29 to decide if there is enough safety and efficacy data about the vaccine developed by Pfizer and BioNTech for it to be approved, the regulator said. The agency also said it could decide as early as Jan. 12 whether to approve a rival shot by American pharmaceutical company Moderna Inc, which was submitted to U.S. and European regulators this week.\n",
      "\tIf its vaccine is approved, Germany-based BioNTech said its use in Europe could begin before the end of 2020 - but that seems quite ambitious, given that the EU Commission usually needs to rubber-stamp the regulator's decision. Still, the regulator has also left open the possibility that the date of that meeting will be brought forward if data comes in faster.\n",
      "\tThe approval date now being eyed would be later than some European countries had hoped. Germany, which has given BioNTech 375 million euros ($450 million) in funding to develop the vaccine, has been preparing to start immunizing people from mid-December onward.\n",
      "\tOn Tuesday, officials in Germany, France and the Netherlands cautioned that vaccine programs likely won't start until the end of the year.\n",
      "\t“With the information we got in recent days we have to assume that approval will only happen around the turn of the year,” German Health Minister Jens Spahn said.\n",
      "\t“It has moved because some studies obviously need a little longer to be submitted,” he said. “What's important is to be prepared.”\n",
      "\tHis comments were echoed by French President Emmanuel Macron and Dutch Health Minister Hugo de Jonge, who said authorities in those countries are working to begin vaccinating people in the first week of January.\n",
      "\t“It won't be a vaccination policy for the broader public” during the first few months, Macron said in a news conference at the Elysee presidential palace.\n",
      "\tBioNTech and Pfizer have said that clinical trials showed their vaccine is 95% effective. The two companies have already submitted data to regulators in the United States and Britain, and approval might come from them first.\n",
      "\tHospitals in England have been told they could receive the first doses of the Pfizer shot as early as the week of Dec. 7 if it receives the OK, the Guardian and Financial Times reported. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration's scientific advisers are holding a public meeting Dec. 10 to review Pfizer's request to allow emergency use of its vaccine, and a decision could come shortly thereafter.\n",
      "\tBritish regulators also are assessing another vaccine developed by researchers from Oxford University and AstraZeneca.\n",
      "\tWhichever of the regulators acts earliest would be giving the first approval of a COVID-19 vaccine that's been that's been rigorously tested in tens of thousands of people in trials that meet common scientific standards.\n",
      "\tGlobally, every country that has a drug regulatory agency will have to issue its own approval for any COVID-19 vaccine, although countries with weak systems typically rely on the World Health Organization to vet the shots. In the EU, countries typically accept EMA approval for vaccines and drugs unless there is a specific issue the country wants examined further.\n",
      "\tMultiple successful vaccines will be needed to end the pandemic, which has been on the upswing in Europe and the U.S. and so far left more than 1.4 million people worldwide dead.\n",
      "\tNumerous other vaccines are already being worked on across the world. Russia and China have even begun administering shots of locally developed vaccines and selling them to other countries before publishing evidence from advanced studies proving the vaccines are safe and effective.\n",
      "\tEven after vaccines are approved, manufacturers and regulators will be monitoring how well they are received by patients to determine the frequency of rarer side effects that may only appear when millions are immunized. While the vaccines so far submitted for approval seem to prevent people from getting sick, it is still unclear whether they prevent people from picking up the virus entirely - and crucially - passing it to others.\n",
      "\tAnd officials caution that while some people may receive a vaccine in the coming weeks, it will take many months to give billions of people around the world the shot, or two if a booster is necessary, meaning that people will be living with virus control measures well into next year.\n",
      "\tAuthorities and drugmakers have pledged to work together to immediately begin rolling out the first shots once approval comes in, whether that's in the United States or Europe.\n",
      "\t“Depending on how the authorities decide we can start delivering within a few hours,” said BioNTech's chief operating officer, Sierk Poetting.\n",

      "\tJoe Biden has had his first look as president-elect at the President's Daily Brief, a top secret summary of U.S. intelligence and world events -- a document former first lady Michelle Obama has called \"The Death, Destruction, and Horrible Things Book.\"\n",
      "\tBiden has already had eyes on different iterations of the so-called PDB, which is tailored to the way each president likes to absorb information.\n",
      "\tMore than a decade ago, Biden read President George W. Bush's PDB during Biden's transition into the vice presidency. After that, he read President Barack Obama's PDB for eight years. Beginning Monday, after a four-year break, he's reading U.S. President Donald Trump's PDB.\n",
      "\t\"The briefers almost certainly will be asking Biden what he prefers in terms of format and style,\" said David Priess, author of \"The President's Book of Secrets,\" a history of the PDB. \"At a minimum, they're seeing what seems to resonate most with him so that when they make the book his book, they can tailor it to him.\"\n",
      "\tObama's PDB was a 10- to 15-page document tucked in a leather binder, which he found waiting for him on the breakfast table. Later in his presidency, he liked reading the ultra-secret intelligence brief on a secured iPad.\n",
      "\t\"Michelle called it \"The Death, Destruction, and Horrible Things Book,\" Obama wrote in his recently released book, \"A Promised Land.\"\n",
      "\t\"On a given day, I might read about terrorist cells in Somalia or unrest in Iraq or the fact that the Chinese or Russians were developing new weapons systems,\" Obama wrote. \"Nearly always, there was mention of potential terrorist plots, no matter how vague, thinly sourced, or unactionable -- a form of due diligence on the part of the intelligence community, meant to avoid the kind of second-guessing that had transpired after 9-11.\"\n",
      "\tFrom now until Inauguration Day, Biden and Vice-President-elect Kamala Harris will be reading the PDB crafted for Trump, who had delayed giving Biden and Harris access to it as he contests the outcome of the election.\n",
      "\tTrump, who prefers absorbing information in visual ways, likes short texts and graphics.\n",
      "\t\"Trump himself said during his campaign and during the transition in 2016 that he did not like reading long documents -- that he preferred bullet points,\" said Priess, who has not seen any of Trump's PDBs. \"It probably has charts, tables, graphs -- things like that. Not the parody that people make that it's like a cartoon book ... but something that is more visual. But we don't know for sure.\"\n",
      "\tThe written brief, which Trump doesn't always read, often is followed by a verbal briefing with an intelligence official, although those oral briefings stopped at least for a time in October. Priess said he didn't know why they stopped or if they had resumed, but that they stopped at a time when Trump was spending much of his time on the campaign trail.\n",
      "\tBefore Trump authorized Biden to get the PDB as president-elect, Biden was given some intelligence background briefings as a candidate. But they were more general and did not include the nation's top secrets.\n",
      "\tThe other thing that a president-elect gets is a briefing \"on CIA's covert actions,\" former acting CIA director Mike Morell said at an event hosted by the Center for Presidential Transition based in Washington. \"It's important for the president-elect to get this briefing ... because on Inauguration Day, these covert actions will become the new president's.\"\n",
      "\tIn 1961, President John F. Kennedy read his first brief while sitting on the diving board of a swimming pool at his retreat in the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia. President Lyndon Johnson liked to read his brief in the afternoon. President Richard Nixon relied on his national security adviser Henry Kissinger to peruse the briefs and tell him what he thought the president should know.\n",
      "\tAs the laborious recount of ballots dragged on in 2000, President Bill Clinton decided that then-Gov. George W. Bush should get access to his PDB just in case he was the winner. Bush became was the first incoming president to read it before he was president-elect.\n",
      "\tBiden is getting the PDB later than usual because of Trump's ongoing protest of the election results. Trump approved the briefings for Biden last Tuesday, a day after his administration approved the formal transition process to his successor.\n",
      "\tWhen Biden walks into the Oval Office, he'll be inheriting nuclear threats from North Korea and Iran, changing political dynamics in the Middle East, the winding down of America's presence in Afghanistan and rising competition from China.\n",
      "\tBiden had access to the PDB in Wilmington, Delaware. Harris received it in a secure room at the Commerce Department, where the presidential transition offices are located.\n",
      "\tEven Biden, who has decades of experience in foreign policy, could be the victim of an old political adage that no matter how informed he thinks he is, he could learn otherwise from the PDB.\n",
      "\tFormer CIA Director Michael Hayden wrote in his book that revelations and new insight found in the PDB are known as \"aw s---\" moments. As in: \"Aw s---,\" he wrote, \"wish we hadn't said that during that campaign stop in Buffalo.\"\n",

      "CONTENT : MONTREAL -- \n",
      "\tRecently, when president-elect Joe Biden introduced the team that will handle foreign and security policy issues in his new administration, he used the slogan \"America is back”.\n",
      "\tEasier to say than achieve, I suspect.\n",
      "\tFirstly, Biden will have a lot of work to do domestically: a pandemic that continues to wreak havoc in the U.S., an economy to rebuild, and above all, trying to bring back unity after a Trump period that divided the United States in unimaginable ways.\n",
      "\tStill, the United States remains a great power, it will have no choice but to play its role on the international scene. The future secretary of state Antony Blinken is well acquainted with international affairs. The next ambassador to the United Nations, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, a career diplomat, and John Kerry, former secretary of state under Obama, appointed as special envoy on climate change are both experienced and competent.\n",
      "\tBiden has confirmed a return to multilateralism. Washington is expected to rejoin the Paris Accord on climate change and will reintegrate some international organizations such as the World Health Organization. It is to be expected that the American voice will be heard again at the United Nations in a more cooperative mode. This is good news.\n",
      "\tBiden will also need to repair the damage done by his predecessor by re-establishing normal relations with traditional allies in Europe, Canada and elsewhere.\n",
      "\tIt is expected the U.S. will reclaim its usual place in leading NATO. Trump denigrated this organization and worked to weaken it for reasons that escaped observers.\n",
      "\tHowever, the world has greatly changed during Trump's four years.\n",
      "\tFrench President Macron, German Chancellor Merkel and European Union leaders are most probably relieved that common sense will return to the White House but, having been burned, they will want to give themselves some time to see how the Americans will behave on a number of trade and other issues.\n",
      "\tBiden said that the U.S. is ready to lead the world again. Not sure it is a universally shared objective. An increased involvement perhaps, but returning to a pre-Trump era may not be possible.\n",
      "\tPrime Minister Trudeau and his team have already begun bilateral contacts, promoting the importance of Canada in the American economy. Relations with our southern neighbour will not necessarily be more favourable to our interests, but at least there will be dialogue and not insults from the president. Nevertheless, there may be a few differences, notably because of Joe Biden's (Buy America) protectionist agenda and his opposition to the Keystone XL oil pipeline project.\n",
      "\tThe big challenges for the next administration will of course be China and probably issues in the Middle East, particularly Iran. It is expected that the confrontational approach with Beijing will be abandoned in favour of an alliance with Europeans and others to make the Chinese understand that it is in their interest to better respect the rule of law and improve the human rights situation. Will this work? Beijing is becoming more and more self-confident. It took advantage of the American withdrawal from the world stage to advance its pawns. It has just signed a free-trade agreement with its Asian neighbours that corresponds to 30 per cent of world trade.\n",
      "\tBiden said the U.S. wants to join the multilateral nuclear agreement with Iran abandoned by Trump. This may not be easy to achieve because his government has adopted a long list of economic sanctions that the Iranians will want to see abandoned before making their own concessions. Negotiations are likely to be long and complicated, and Republican politicians in the Senate, if they remain the majority, will not help. The recent assassination of an Iranian nuclear scientist may not be the last attempt by opponents of the agreement to create additional difficulties before the departure of Trump from the White House.\n",
      "\tElsewhere in the region, relations between Biden and Netanyahu will not be as warm as with Trump, but the link between Israel and the United States should remain strong. Moreover, Biden said that the U.S. Embassy will stay in Jerusalem. The Palestinians hope that their situation will improve with Biden. To a certain extent, it may be the case. The Israelis will not always have the green light in the context of the settlements on the West Bank, for instance, and the U.S. financial assistance for the Palestinians will probably return. But will the US try to revive the peace process? This is doubtful. Israel has strengthened its ties with several Gulf countries recently and the momentum seems to be changing in the region. Not in the direction of a two-state solution.\n",
      "\tThe United States will likely show more interest in defending human rights. Some countries like Saudi Arabia or Egypt will not appreciate it.\n",
      "\tOther issues will attract attention, such as migrants from Central America, a region that has suffered greatly from COVID-19, but also climate change. Migration should be managed in a more humane way than under Trump.\n",
      "\tIt will also be interesting to see how relations with Trump's great friends the Turkish, Russian and North Korean despots will be. What about Cuba? Trump had scrapped Obama’s openness towards Havana.\n",
      "\tThe Americans have lost ground because of Trump's chaotic and uncoordinated policy. It is not clear that the damage is temporary. Let's hope for Biden that \"America is back\" will be a more successful theme than Trudeau's \"Canada is back”.  \n",

      "\tFirst responders and frontline workers being challenged by the deadly coronavirus pandemic are highlighted in White House Christmas decorations that also give a special nod to Melania Trump's redesigned Rose Garden.\n",
      "\tIt's the final Christmas in the White House for the Trump family, although the president continues to insist - despite evidence to the contrary - that he won the Nov. 3 election. President-elect Joe Biden will be sworn into office on Jan. 20.\n",
      "\tThe first lady said “America the Beautiful” is her theme for the decor, and that it was inspired by Americans' shared appreciation “for our traditions, values and history.”\n",
      "\tWorkers on the front lines of a pandemic that has killed more than 266,000 people in the United States and infected more than 13 million others are recognized in the Red Room with a Christmas tree dotted with handmade ornaments, as well as other decorations around the parlour.\n",
      "\tThe gingerbread White House - a sweet confection made of more than 400 pounds (181 kilograms) of dough, gum paste, chocolate and royal icing - is on display in the State Dining Room and for the first time includes the Rose Garden, which the first lady recently renovated, and the First Ladies' Garden.\n",
      "\tOrnaments on the official White House Christmas tree in the Blue Room - a Fraser fir from Shepherdstown, West Virginia, that stands more than 18 feet (5.49 metres) tall - were designed by students who were asked by the National Park Service to depict what makes their states beautiful.\n",
      "\tA buck and a crane are featured in three-dimensional art hanging in windows of the Green Room, where American wildlife is the highlight. Classical urns lining an East Wing walkway hold groupings of foliage from different regions of the country.\n",
      "\tTrees and other decorations in the East Room feature planes, trains and automobiles - including models of Air Force One - in a nod to triumphs in innovations and technology. Wrapped gifts beneath decorated trees lining the Cross Hall bear tags that say “peace,” “love,” “faith” and “joy.”\n",
      "\tMonday's unveiling of the Christmas decor came weeks after Mrs. Trump was heard on an audio recording using profanity as she complained about the pressure of having to decorate for the holiday in the past. The recording of the July 2018 conversation was made and released to CNN by Stephanie Winston Wolkoff, who was fired from the White House earlier that year.\n",

      "\tWireless carriers in the U.K. won't be allowed to install Huawei equipment in their high-speed 5G networks after September 2021, the British government said Monday, hardening its line against the Chinese technology company.\n",
      "\tThe deadline is part of a roadmap the British government is laying down to remove \"high risk\" equipment suppliers with draft legislation that aims to tighten telecommunications security requirements.\n",
      "\tThe government of Prime Minister Boris Johnson in July banned Huawei from having a role in building Britain's next-generation mobile phone networks over security concerns triggered by U.S. sanctions. Britain and other European countries have started to fall in line after the U.S. lobbied allies to shun Huawei over fears its equipment could be used by China's communist rulers to facilitate electronic espionage.\n",
      "\tTelecom operators were ordered to stop buying Huawei 5G equipment by the end of the year and have until 2027 to rip any of the company's existing gear out of their systems.\n",
      "\tWhile the ban implied operators would have to stop installing Huawei gear, the latest announcement spells out the deadline clearly - making it harder for them to stockpile equipment.\n",
      "\tHuawei declined to comment. It has previously denied the U.S. allegations and said Britain's ban was politically motivated.\n",
      "\t\"Today I am setting out a clear path for the complete removal of high risk vendors from our 5G networks,\" Digital Secretary Oliver Dowden said. \"This will be done through new and unprecedented powers to identify and ban telecoms equipment which poses a threat to our national security.\"\n",
      "\tThe Telecommunications (Security) Bill, which is set to be debated in Parliament on Tuesday, requires tougher security standards for 5G wireless and fiber optic networks and threatens heavy fines for companies that don't comply with the rules.\n",
      "\tThe government is also setting out a strategy to diversify its telecom equipment suppliers, including a research lab and investment in open radio standards technology. Huawei has just a handful of rivals including Finland's Nokia and Sweden's Ericsson, raising fears that relying on so few companies to supply critical infrastructure leaves networks open to vulnerabilities.\n",

      "\tModerna Inc. said it would ask U.S. and European regulators Monday to allow emergency use of its COVID-19 vaccine as new study results confirm the shots offer strong protection -- ramping up the race to begin limited vaccinations as the coronavirus rampage worsens.\n",
      "\tMultiple vaccine candidates must succeed for the world to stamp out the pandemic, which has been on the upswing in the U.S. and Europe. U.S. hospitals have been stretched to the limit as the nation has seen more than 160,000 new cases per day and more than 1,400 daily deaths. Since first emerging nearly a year ago in China, the virus has killed more than 1.4 million people worldwide.\n",
      "\tModerna is one of several companies to have already submitted partial data to a \"rolling review\" process offered by Health Canada. Rather than presenting regulators with a complete package of trial results, the would-be vaccine-makers file data and findings as they become available. Canada has been looking at Moderna's first results since mid-October.\n",
      "\tCanada has a different approval process than the United States and European countries, meaning that Moderna and Pfizer do not have to apply or reapply at each step. Instead, they have to submit their newest data and findings.\n",
      "\tModerna created its shots with the U.S. National Institutes of Health and already had a hint they were working, but said it got the final needed results over the weekend that suggest the vaccine is more than 94% effective.\n",
      "\tOf 196 COVID-19 cases so far in its huge U.S. study, 185 were trial participants who received the placebo and 11 who got the real vaccine. The only people who got severely ill -- 30 participants, including one who died -- had received dummy shots, said Dr. Tal Zaks, the Cambridge, Massachusetts, company's chief medical officer.\n",
      "\tWhen he learned the results, \"I allowed myself to cry for the first time,\" Zaks told The Associated Press. \"We have already, just in the trial, have already saved lives. Just imagine the impact then multiplied to the people who can get this vaccine.\"\n",
      "\tModerna said the shots' effectiveness and a good safety record so far -- with only temporary, flu-like side effects -- mean they meet requirements set by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for emergency use before the final-stage testing is complete. The European Medicines Agency, Europe's version of FDA, has signalled it also is open to faster, emergency clearance.\n",
      "\tThe FDA has pledged that before it decides to roll out any COVID-19 vaccines, its scientific advisers will publicly debate whether there's enough evidence behind each candidate.\n",
      "\tFirst up on Dec. 10, Pfizer and BioNTech will present data suggesting their vaccine candidate is 95% effective. Moderna said its turn at this \"science court\" is expected exactly a week later, on Dec. 17.\n",
      "\tIf the FDA allows emergency use, Moderna expects to have 20 million doses ready for the U.S. by year's end. Recipients will need two doses, so that's enough for 10 million people.\n",
      "\tPfizer expects to have 50 million doses globally in December. Half of them -- or enough for 12.5 million people -- are earmarked for the U.S.\n",
      "\tThis week, a different panel of U.S. experts, established by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, will meet to decide how initial supplies will be given out. They're expected to reserve scarce first doses for health care workers and, if the shots work well enough in the frail elderly, for residents of long-term care facilities. As more vaccine gradually becomes available in coming months, other essential workers and people at highest risk from the coronavirus would get in line. But enough for the general population isn't expected until at least spring.\n",
      "\tOutside the U.S., Zaks said significant supplies from Moderna would be available later, \"in the first quarter\" of next year.\n",
      "\t\"Obviously we are doing everything in our power to increase the capacity and accelerate the timelines,\" he said.\n",
      "\tBoth Moderna's and Pfizer's vaccines are made with the same technology, using a piece of genetic code for the \"spike\" protein that studs the virus. That messenger RNA, or mRNA, instructs the body to make some harmless spike protein, training immune cells to recognize it if the real virus eventually comes along.\n",
      "\tAstraZeneca last week announced confusing early results of its vaccine candidate from research in Britain and Brazil\n",
      "\tThat vaccine appears 62% effective when tested as originally intended, with recipients given two full doses. But because of a manufacturing error, a small number of volunteers got a lower first dose -- and AstraZeneca said in that group, the vaccine appeared to be 90% effective.\n",
      "\tExperts say it's unclear why the lower-dose approach would work better and that it may just be a statistical quirk.\n",
      "\tA larger U.S. study of the AstraZeneca candidate still is underway that should eventually give the FDA a better picture of how well it works. The FDA has said any COVID-19 vaccine would have to be at least 50% effective.\n",
      "\tMeanwhile Britain's government will have to decide whether its U.K. data is sufficient for an early rollout there.\n",
      "\tJohnson & Johnson also is in final-stage testing in the U.S. and several other countries to see if its vaccine candidate could work with just one dose.\n",
      "\tBoth the J&J and AstraZeneca vaccines work by using harmless cold viruses to carry the spike protein gene into the body and prime the immune system.\n",
      "\tThe different technologies have ramifications for how easily different vaccines could be distributed globally. The AstraZeneca shots won't require freezer storage like the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines.\n",
      "\tCandidates made with still other technologies are in late-stage testing, too. Another U.S. company, Novavax Inc., announced Monday that it has finished enrolling 15,000 people in a late-stage study in Britain and plans to begin recruiting even more volunteers for final testing in the U.S. and Mexico \"in the coming weeks.\"\n",
      "\tVaccines made by three Chinese companies and a Russian candidate also are being tested in thousands of people in countries around the world.\n",

      "\tChina has just joined forces with more than a dozen countries across the Asia Pacific region to sign a huge free trade deal nearly a decade in the making.\n",
      "\tThe Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership spans 15 countries and 2.2 billion people, or nearly 30% of the world's population, according to a joint statement released by the nations on Sunday, when the deal was signed. Their combined GDP totals roughly $26 trillion and they account for nearly 28% of global trade based on 2019 data.\n",
      "\tThe deal includes several of the region's heaviest economic hitters aside from China, including Japan and South Korea. New Zealand and Australia are also partners, as are Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam in Southeast Asia.\n",
      "\tThe trade agreement was first proposed in 2012 as a way to create one of the world's largest free-trade zones.\n",
      "\tIt's tough to gauge the immediate economic significance of the deal. The members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations — a group of 10 countries that signed the agreement — said that it would eliminate tariffs and quotas on 65% of the goods that are traded in the region.\n",
      "\tThe partner countries also noted the importance of the agreement as the world tries to recover from the coronavirus pandemic, saying in a joint statement that the deal \"will play an important role in building the region's resilience through inclusive and sustainable post-pandemic economic recovery process.\"\n",
      "\t\"Its symbolic value has always exceeded its actual value,\" said William Reinsch, a trade expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies who served for 15 years as president of the National Foreign Trade Council. He pointed out that India opted out of the deal late last year, lessening the importance of the agreement in terms of actual trade.\n",
      "\tReinsch said, though, that the agreement could have consequences in the long term, and added that China's involvement \"is a sign of its willingness to play a constructive role, despite its aggressive actions in the South China Sea, Hong Kong, and elsewhere.\"\n",
      "\tChina and Australia, for example, have been caught up in trade disputes lately, but that hasn't stopped them pressing ahead with the RCEP.\n",
      "\t\"Both countries see huge benefits from their deeper economic integration with other Asian countries,\" said Murray Hiebert, senior associate of the Southeast Asia Program at CSIS. \"The RCEP could potentially provide Beijing and Canberra another platform where they could discuss and hammer out their differences.\"\n",
      "\tOthers noted that the deal was further evidence of Asia's growing power. Economists at HSBC said Sunday that the agreement \"signals that Asia keeps pushing ahead with trade liberalization even as other regions have become more skeptical.\"\n",
      "\t\"It may reinforce a trend that's been already underway for decades: that the global center of economic gravity keeps pushing relentlessly to the East,\" they wrote in a research note.\n",
      "\tIt's not clear whether the deal will have an impact on the most important global trading relationship of all: That between the United States and China, who have been fighting over trade and related issues for the last few years.\n",
      "\t\"Whether it means a shift in the regional dynamic in favor of China depends on the US response,\" Reinsch said of the new trade deal. He pointed to the importance of the election of Joe Biden, who will succeed President Donald Trump in January.\n",
      "\t\"If the U.S. continues to ignore or bully the countries there, the influence pendulum will swing toward China,\" he added. \"If Biden has a credible plan to restore the US presence and influence in the region, then the pendulum could swing back our way.\"\n",

      "\tNew Kim is worth her weight in gold and then some -- actually much, much more.\n",
      "\tA wealthy Chinese pigeon racing fan put down a record price of 1.6 million euros (US$1.9 million) for the Belgian-bred bird, saying a lot more than merely what kind of money can be made in the once-quaint sport, which seemed destined to decline only a few years back.\n",
      "\tDuring a frantic last half hour Sunday at the end of a two-week auction at the Pipa pigeon centre, two Chinese bidders operating under the pseudonyms Super Duper and Hitman drove up the price by 280,000 euros ($325,000), leaving the previous record that Belgian-bred Armando fetched last year well behind by 350,000 euros ($406,000).\n",
      "\tSuper Duper got the hen, and behind the pseudonym is said to be the same wealthy Chinese industrialist who already had Armando, allowing for breeding with the two expensive birds.\n",
      "\tIt was proof again that an age-old hobby in Western Europe identified with working-class men now has a new, elitist foreign lease on life. Top breeders relying on generations of family experience can now sell their birds for prices unheard of merely a decade ago, and often China is their destination.\n",
      "\tOn this occasion, successful breeder Gaston Van de Wouwer retired at 76 and his son had too busy a professional life to continue the famed pigeon coop. All 445 birds were put on auction and the overall sale was already pushing past 6 million euros ($7 million). A second part of the auction is ending on Monday, but didn't include any bird that could match New Kim. It still amounted to an amazing weekend for one pigeon breeder.\n",
      "\tBelgians have long stood out as the best breeders, both because of their generations-long experience and the density of a network where many breeders can organize races close together. It's not a short-term endeavour, however, since becoming expert at genetic breeding with the constant mixing and mating of birds takes years, if not decades. Birds can live up to 15 years.\n",
      "\t\"Everybody is interested in our pigeons,\" Pascal Bodengien, head of the Belgian pigeon federation, told The Associated Press.\n",
      "\tOnly a decade ago, the record price for a pigeon stood at one-tenth of New Kim's price. And the current price of gold stands about 26,000 euros ($30,350) per pound.\n",
      "\tAs so often, globalization has made the difference.\n",
      "\tWith the rise of business wealth in China came also conspicuous consumption and a new venue for gambling. Somehow, pigeons fit the bill. China often features one-loft racing, where pigeons all get used to one coop for months and then are released many hundreds of miles away to make their way back with their unique sense of orientation and special speed training. Prize pots can reach into the tens of millions of euros.\n",
      "\tFor breeding, though, there is no place like Belgium. This is where, little more than a generation ago, the national weekend radio news was followed by announcements on whether pigeons were released in faraway places in France or even Spain and what weather conditions the birds were facing.\n",
      "\tAfter World War II, Belgium had over 250,000 members in the pigeon fancier federation. Now there are 18,000, Bodengien says.\n",
      "\tPigeon breeding demands constant attention, every single day of the year. Those demands had turned away many modern folk, once sending the sport into a decline.\n",
      "\t\"To be the best, it has to be your life's work. For some, it may seem boring. Day in, day out. Winter and summer, always those pigeons.\" he said.\n",
      "\tOnce bitten though, many remain committed for life. And the news that a pigeon can sell for $1.9 million could prompt new challengers to enter the sport. Bodengien welcomed that development but urged patience and a reality check.\n",
      "\t\"Anybody thinking about getting into our sport to get money out of it had better think again and move to another sport,\" he said.\n",

      "\tIt will take time to fully assess exact details of the agreement encompassing tariff schedules and rules for all 15 countries involved -- the tariffs schedule just for Japan is 1,334 pages long.\n",
      "\tIt is not expected to go as far as the European Union in integrating member economies but does build on existing free trade arrangements.\n",
      "\tThe deal has powerful symbolic ramifications, showing that nearly four years after Trump launched his \"America First\" policy of forging trade deals with individual countries, Asia remains committed to multi-nation efforts toward freer trade that are seen as a formula for future prosperity.\n",
      "\tAhead of Sunday's RCEP \"special summit\" meeting, Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga said he would firmly convey his government's support for \"broadening a free and fair economic zone, including a possibility of India's future return to the deal, and hope to gain support from the other countries.\"\n",
      "\tThe accord is also a coup for China, by far the biggest market in the region with more than 1.3 billion people, allowing Beijing to cast itself as a \"champion of globalization and multilateral co-operation\" and giving it greater influence over rules governing regional trade, Gareth Leather, senior Asian economist for Capital Economics, said in a report.\n",
      "\tChina's official Xinhua News Agency quoted Premier Li Keqiang hailing the agreement as a victory against protectionism, in remarks delivered via a video link.\n",
      "\t\"The signing of the RCEP is not only a landmark achievement of East Asian regional co-operation, but also a victory of multilateralism and free trade,\" Li said.\n",
      "\tThe agreement is expected to help China, Japan and South Korea finally reach a trilateral free trade deal after years of struggling to bridge their differences.\n",
      "\tNow that Trump's opponent Joe Biden has been declared president-elect, the region is watching to see how U.S. policy on trade and other issues will evolve.\n",
      "\tAnalysts are skeptical Biden will push hard to rejoin the trans-Pacific trade pact or to roll back many of the U.S. trade sanctions imposed on China by the Trump administration given widespread frustration with Beijing's trade and human rights records, and accusations of spying and technology theft.\n",
      "\tCritics of free trade agreements say they tend to encourage companies to move manufacturing jobs overseas. So, having won over disaffected rust-belt voters in Michigan and western Pennsylvania in the Nov. 3 election, Biden is \"not going to squander that by going back into TPP,\" Michael Jonathan Green of the Center for Strategic and International Studies said in a web seminar.\n",
      "\tBut given concerns over China's growing influence, Biden is likely to seek much more engagement with Southeast Asia to protect U.S. interests, he said.\n",
      "\tThe fast-growing and increasingly affluent Southeast Asian market of 650 million people has been hit hard by the pandemic and is urgently seeking fresh drivers for growth.\n",
      "\tRCEP originally would have included about 3.6 billion people and encompassed about a third of world trade and global GDP. Minus India, it still covers more than 2 billion people and close to a third of all trade and business activity.\n",
      "\tThe United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA, the retooled version of the North American Free Trade Agreement under Trump, covers slightly less economic activity but less than a tenth of the world's population. The EU and Comprehensive and Progressive Trans-Pacific Partnership, the revised version of the deal Trump rejected, also are smaller. RCEP includes six of the 11 remaining CPTPP members.\n",
      "\tIndia balked at exposing its farmers and factories to more foreign competition. Among other concerns, Indian dairy farmers are worried about competition from New Zealand and Australian milk and cheese producers. Automakers fear imports from across the region. But overall the biggest fear is over a flood of manufactured goods from China.\n",
      "\tTrade and investment flows within Asia have vastly expanded over the past decade, a trend that has accelerated amid feuding between the U.S. and China, which have imposed billions of dollars' worth of punitive tariffs on each other's exports.\n",
      "\tThe RCEP agreement is loose enough to stretch to fit the disparate needs of member countries as diverse as Myanmar, Singapore, Vietnam and Australia. Unlike the CPTPP and EU, it does not establish unified standards on labour and the environment or commit countries to open services and other vulnerable areas of their economies.\n",
      "\tBut it does set rules for trade that will facilitate investment and other business within the region, Jeffrey Wilson, research director at the Perth USAsia Center, said in a report for the Asia Society.\n",
      "\t\"RCEP, therefore, is a much-needed platform for the Indo-Pacific's post-COVID recovery,\" he wrote.\n",
      "\tASEAN members include Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Myanmar, the Philippines, Thailand, Brunei, Singapore, Malaysia and Vietnam.\n",

      "CONTENT : OTTAWA -- \n",
      "\tWhen Donald Trump leaves the White House, a regular feature of the last four years of Canadian politics is going to change: Conservatives will no longer constantly have to distance themselves from such a polarizing president.\n",
      "\tBut to win the next general election, they'll still face a challenge: how to appeal both to the Trump-friendly supporters within their base, and to those Canadians who abhorred the Republican president and his policies.\n",
      "\tFor four years, Trump has served as a bogeyman for Conservative opponents, who would point to his divisive hold on U.S. politics and suggest that if a Conservative were elected in Canada, Trumpism would be imported here.\n",
      "\tDuring the last federal election campaign, Elizabeth May, leader of the Green party at the time, made the comparison explicit, suggesting that then Conservative leader Andrew Scheer was literally a puppet of the U.S. president.\n",
      "\t\"I looked your policies on foreign policy today, Andrew, and I realized if anyone wants to know where you stand, just figure out what Trump wants,\" she said during the debate.\n",
      "\tBut a Democrat in the White House provides some political cover.\n",
      "\tIt will now be Justin Trudeau pressed on whether he'll follow Biden's lead on programs or policies, instead of the Tories pushed constantly on whether they'd follow Trump's.\n",
      "\tAnd if the Conservatives do form government in the next election, a Democratic president could be helpful, said Garry Keller, who served in several senior advisory roles in the last Conservative government.\n",
      "\tRepublican president George W. Bush was in office between 2000 and 2008 and the Conservatives came to power in 2006. At the time, aligning with him could be politically toxic, Keller said, even if versions of Bush's policies made sense for Canada.\n",
      "\t\"When (Barack) Obama came along, the math completely changed,\" he said.\n",
      "\tKeller said during the Obama years, it became common for ministers to \"hug\" Obama -- publicly linking policies with \"the Obama administration,\" instead of just saying they were aligning with the United States more generally.\n",
      "\t\"Canadians were obviously very favourable to President Obama,\" he said.\n",
      "\t\"So it did give room to do things with the Americans on certain things that you couldn't have done under the Bush administration.\"\n",
      "\tThe vast majority of Canadians across the political spectrum tell pollsters again and again they don't like Trump, but of those who do like him, most also tell pollsters they'd vote for the Tories. Among them: Conservative Senate leader Don Plett, who voiced his support for a second Trump term in a recent speech to the Senate.\n",
      "\tTrump will still loom large enough in the world's collective memory for Conservatives to be compared to him, said Andrea Van Vugt, who was a foreign-policy adviser to Stephen Harper.\n",
      "\t\"The Conservative party and Erin O'Toole's team should expect that,\" she said.\n",
      "\t\"They should anticipate it, they should understand how they're going to push back.\"\n",
      "\tVan Vugt pointed out, however, that if Trump had truly poisoned conservatism in voters' minds, a slew of conservative premiers wouldn't have been elected over the last four years.\n",
      "\tAmong them is Ontario's Doug Ford, whose \"man of the people\" style is seen as closest to Trump's of the group.\n",
      "\tO'Toole's approach could be seen as taking some pages from the Trump playbook.\n",
      "\tHis leadership campaign slogan, \"Take back Canada,\" was interpreted by some as a northern play on Trump's \"Make America Great Again\" line, though O'Toole has been far more pro-immigration and free trade than Trump has.\n",
      "\tHis aggressive stance against China, which also mirrors Trump's, may be one that Canadians are on side with, Van Vugt suggested.\n",
      "\t\"I think that Canadians, if they sat back and thought about it for a minute, would say, 'Well, you know, maybe it's time for us to take a strong stand on China and the only recent memory we have a politician doing that is Trump,' \" she said.\n",
      "\t\"And though we don't agree with anything else that he does, this is probably one of those areas.\"\n",
      "\tMeanwhile, a decision to expressly court the union vote can also be seen as trying for the populism that worked for Trump -- going after working-class Americans left behind by modern-day politicians and the global economy.\n",
      "\tTrump won in 2016 on their support, and the reality of the 2020 presidential election is that in many cases he still had it, said Van Vugt.\n",
      "\tBut in some ways, she said, the results in the U.S. mirror what happened in the 2019 federal election in Canada: a Liberal minority government.\n",
      "\tIn both countries, she said, voters told the incumbent government it didn't deserve another chance at full control, but they didn't entirely trust the other side either.\n",
      "\tUnderstanding what's behind that and building a message that reaches people to earn their trust and a solid mandate to govern is a must for Canadian politicians, Van Vugt said.\n",
      "\t\"For any political party -- the Conservatives, Liberals, the NDP -- that's the trick of the next election.\"\n",

      "\tU.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo discussed \"global challenges\" with a handful of members of a Paris think-tank Saturday at the start of a seven-country tour of Europe and the Middle East, travels that were certain to be awkward since all the nations on his schedule have congratulated President-elect Joe Biden for winning the White House.\n",
      "\tPompeo was an all but invisible U.S. envoy on what may be his last official trip to France, tweeting out news of his arrival and from his private meeting with members of the Institut Montaigne, accompanied by photos.\n",
      "\tThe trip is aimed at shoring up the priorities of the outgoing administration of President Donald Trump. It will include visits to Israeli settlements in the West Bank that have been avoided by previous secretaries of state.\n",
      "\tThe United States' top diplomat -- as well as its president and much of his Republican Party -- have not accepted the results of the American election, and the unusual circumstances will likely overshadow the issues.\n",
      "\tIn his latest tweet, Pompeo said he addressed \"the global challenges we are facing today, from terrorism to the COVID-19 pandemic\" with Institut Montaigne representatives. The independent think-tank says it promotes \"a balanced vision of society, in which open and competitive markets go hand in hand with equality of opportunity and social cohesion.\"\n",
      "\tPompeo arrived to a France in lockdown to fight a second wave of the coronavirus. In contrast to the few people seated around him, he did not wear a mask.\n",
      "\tPompeo may find himself doing heavy-lifting on Monday, when he is scheduled to meet French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian and President Emmanuel Macron. According to Macron's office, the French president spoke with Biden by phone four days ago and conveyed his desire to work together in areas such as climate change, terrorism and health.\n",
      "\tFor the outgoing secretary of state and the French officials, Monday's meetings will be a delicate demarche on tough issues.\n",
      "\t\"For the moment, my counterpart is Mike Pompeo, until Jan. 20,\" Le Drian said Friday on French network BFMTV, referring to the date when Trump's term ends. \"He's coming to Paris. I receive him.\"\n",
      "\tLe Drian noted the \"difficult subjects\" on the table, from the situation in Iraq and Iran to the Middle East and China.\n",
      "\tHe said he plans to speak out on any accelerated withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq and Afghanistan, clearly concerned that Trump could end his presidency with such a move.\n",
      "\t\"What he should not do, in our opinion,\" Le Drian said of a full withdrawal from Afghanistan. \"What should not be done either in Iraq, (we) will tell him.\"\n",
      "\tMacron has had a tense relationship with Trump. Both leaders initially worked to woo each other with gestures of extravagance, such as Macron making Trump the guest of honour at a Bastille Day military parade. Trump later pulled out of the Paris global climate accord, a blow to Macron.\n",
      "\tThe United States also left the hard-won Iran nuclear accord, and Pompeo said in a tweet before departing on his trip that \"Iran's destabilizing behaviour\" would be among topics of discussion.\n",
      "\tIn an arrival tweet Saturday in France, Pompeo laid out the standard diplomatic groundwork for his Paris talks, noting that France is the \"oldest friend and Ally\" of the United States. \"The strong relationship between our countries cannot be overestimated,\" he tweeted.\n",
      "\tPromoting religious freedom and countering terrorism were also among topics on the table during his trip, he tweeted. Both issues are keenly relevant to France. There have been three terror attacks in recent weeks in France that have killed four people, linked to recently republished caricatures of the prophet of Islam. Anti-France protests rolled through some Muslim countries after Macron insisted on his nation's respect for freedom of expression, including the right to draw caricatures.\n",
      "\tAfter France, Pompeo's tour takes him to Turkey, Georgia, Israel, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Saudi Arabia. The leaders of all of those countries have offered public congratulations to Biden.\n",
      "\tBeside France, Turkey, Georgia and Qatar have had fractious relationships with the Trump administration, and it was not clear whether Pompeo planned public engagements with their leaders -- or whether he would take questions from the press, with whom he has had a frosty relationship.\n",
      "\tThe administration's relations with Turkey have been particularly strained after the NATO ally's purchase of a Russian missile defence system, and Pompeo's stop in Istanbul next week will not include meetings with Turkish officials. Instead, Pompeo will meet with religious leaders to highlight his promotion of religious freedom.\n",
      "\tPalestinian officials, who have been snubbed by the Trump administration, have denounced Pompeo's plans to visit the West Bank settlement of Psagot. Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh tweeted on Friday that this was a \"dangerous precedent\" that legalizes settlements.\n",
      "\tIn keeping with Trump's refusal to concede, and orders for Cabinet agencies not to co-operate with the Biden transition team, the State Department has not been involved with facilitating Biden's calls to foreign leaders, according to officials familiar with the process.\n",
      "\tAt a news conference Tuesday, Pompeo said he would carry on as if there was no change.\n",
      "\t\"I'm the secretary of state,\" he said. \"I'm getting calls from all across the world. These people are watching our election. They understand that we have a legal process. They understand that this takes time.\"\n",
      "\tYet his French counterpart Le Drian has been looking toward the future, saying last Sunday in Cairo that \"we will work with the new president of the United States and his team in the framework of new trans-Atlantic relations, we will need to re-found this.\"\n",

      "\tNational Security Adviser Robert O'Brien said Trump regretted he was unable to attend the online summit with the 10 members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, but stressed the importance of ties with the region.\n",
      "\t\"At this time of global crisis, the U.S.-ASEAN strategic partnership has become even more important as we work together to combat the coronavirus,\" O'Brien said in remarks at the opening ceremony, which was livestreamed to ASEAN members watching from their respective countries.\n",
      "\tTrump attended the ASEAN summit in 2017, but sent only representatives during the last two meetings. A special summit with ASEAN that he was supposed to host in Las Vegas in March was called off due to the pandemic.\n",
      "\tTrump has been busy challenging the results of the Nov. 3 presidential election, insisting he was the victim of election fraud. Most countries have acknowledged Joe Biden's victory.\n",
      "\tO'Brien also represented the U.S. at an East Asia virtual summit later Saturday that included the ASEAN members as well as Australia, China, India, Japan, South Korea, New Zealand and Russia.\n",
      "\tDespite Trump's absence, the White House said in a statement that ASEAN remains central to his vision for a \"free and open Indo-Pacific,\" Washington's strategy to counter China's growing influence in the region.\n",
      "\tChina's sway in the region is set to expand with a free trade agreement that will be signed Sunday. The pact, which will cover almost a third of the world economy, includes the ASEAN nations, China, Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand.\n",
      "\tIndia backed out of the plan last year, and the agreement also does not include the United States, despite America's $2 trillion in trade with the countries in the pact.\n",
      "\tIn his remarks Saturday, O'Brien touted ASEAN as the fourth-largest trading partner for the U.S., with trade reaching over $354 billion last year.\n",
      "\t\"We deeply appreciate ASEAN partners' efforts to keep the key supply chains open, factories operating and PPE flowing,\" O'Brien said, referring to personal protective equipment used to protect against the coronavirus.\n",
      "\tHe noted that the U.S. had contributed $87 million to combat the coronavirus in Southeast Asia, including providing ventilators and PPE.\n",
      "\t\"The United States has your back and we know you have ours,\" O'Brien said.\n",
      "\tAt the East Asia summit later Saturday, UN Secretary-General Antonio Gutteres said the virus had infected at least 14 million people in Asia and killed more than a quarter million in the region. At least 39 million people could revert to extreme poverty in East Asia alone, he warned.\n",
      "\tThe UN has urged countries to put together a stimulus package amounting to at least 10% of global gross domestic product, Gutteres said.\n",
      "\tWith the global community facing its deepest recession since the Second World War, the World Bank is on track to commit a record $160 billion over 15 months, including grants and concessional financing, said its president, David Malpass.\n",
      "\tStill, the pandemic remains an enormous obstacle to development and a successful vaccination program will be key to recovery, he said.\n",
      "\tEarlier Saturday, China, Japan and South Korea sought deeper regional co-operation to battle the pandemic.\n",
      "\t\"Facing a possible second wave as winter is setting in, we can work together to mitigate the pandemic and to reopen the economy,\" said Chinese Premier Li Keqiang.\n",
      "\tSouth Korean President Moon Jae-in said the region must work together toward the development and equitable supply of vaccines and treatments, and establish an effective mechanism to prepare to battle new infectious diseases.\n",
      "\tHe said the speed of global economic recovery will be very uneven amid trade protectionism and uncertainties in the financial markets. An accelerated transition to a digital economy could also widen the gap between social classes, Moon warned.\n",

      "CONTENT : TORONTO -- \n",
      "\tAn international study of middle-aged people with an intermediate risk of heart disease or stroke has found a drug formula that can significantly reduce the risk of cardiovascular illnesses and procedures like heart surgery.\n",
      "\tThe formula, known as a “polypill,” combines three blood pressure medications with a lipid lowering medication. Researchers say when taken with aspirin, the medications can reduce the risk of heart disease by up to 40 per cent.\n",
      "\t“This is the start of a transformational approach to preventing heart disease,” Dr. Salim Yusuf, co-researcher and professor of medicine at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ont., said in a statement. “We could save millions of people from experiencing serious heart disease or stroke each year with effective use of the polypill and aspirin.”\n",
      "\tThe study says, only 4.4 per cent of those who took the polypill alone had a heart attack, stroke or some other kind of cardiovascular problem compared to 5.5 per cent of people who took the placebo.\n",
      "\tResearchers found even greater success among patients who took the combined polypill with aspirin.\n",
      "\tAccording to the study, cardiovascular diseases account for nearly 18 million deaths each year, with more than 80 per cent occurring in regions facing poverty. Researchers estimate that more than 40 million people around the world have been impacted by cardiovascular incidents like heart attacks or strokes.\n",
      "\t“A polypill is not only effective, it is likely to be cost effective since it is based on using commonly used generic drugs,” said Dr. Prem Pais, co-researcher and professor at St. John’s Medical College and Research Institute in Bangalore, India. “A polypill is convenient for patients to use as it combines several effective drugs in a single pill and is taken once a day, which would be expected to improve adherence.”\n",
      "\tPais added, “The results of the study have implications for reducing the burden of cardiovascular diseases globally. Even if only one third of eligible people receive a polypill, its use will likely avoid millions of individuals experiencing serious cardiovascular diseases worldwide.”\n",
      "\tResearch for the study was conducted across nine countries and involved more than 5,700 people, largely from India and the Philippines. The study was co-ordinated globally by the Population Health Research Institute, a joint venture between McMaster University and Hamilton Health Sciences.\n",
      "\tResearchers say they examined a variety of methods and drug combinations, including comparing the polypill alone to aspirin or a placebo.\n",
      "\tAlthough the formulation of different polypills may vary, the one used in this study included 40 mg simvastatin, 100 mg of atenolol, 25mg of hydrochlorothiazide, and 10 mg of ramipril. Researchers say it can be combined with 75 mg of aspirin a day. \n",
      "\t“The use of the polypill widely will benefit people in both the rich and poor countries as there are major gaps in treatments in populations all over the world,” Dr. Philip Joseph, associate professor at McMaster and cardiologist with Hamilton Health Sciences said in a statement.\n",
      "\tThe polypill tested in this study is currently available in India and in a few countries in Africa. Different polypills are available in Europe, South America and South Korea. New polypills are being developed in North America and China. \n",

      "\tThe Group of 20 nations, representing the world's biggest economies, announced Friday that low-income countries hardest hit by the fallout of the coronavirus pandemic could potentially get an extension on their debt payments beyond mid-2021, and in the most severe cases, a debt write-off.\n",
      "The G20 statement, released after a virtual gathering of the group's finance ministers and central bank governors, declared that the countries had agreed on a \"common framework\" for \"timely and orderly\" debt restructuring that aims to treat creditors equally and negotiate debt on a case-by-case basis.\n",
      "\tBut it did not specify which creditors would agree to possible debt cancellation. China, for instance, has repeatedly objected to portions of the debt relief plans. The country, considered to be Africa's largest creditor, is reluctant to give up the billions it is owed from its politically strategic projects across the developing world as its own economy slows.\n",
      "\tThe meeting comes a month after the G20 agreed to suspend US$14 billion in debt payments for an additional six months to support 73 of the world's neediest countries in their fight against the pandemic. Developing nations now have until June 2021 to spend on healthcare and emergency stimulus programs without fretting about grueling debt repayments to foreign creditors.\n",
      "\tAlthough the pause on debt-service payments was welcomed as a reprieve, experts have pointed to the constraints of a scheme that leaves out private lenders like investment firms, banks and bondholders. Without buy-in from the private sector, economists say that poor countries' emergency funds may just land in other lenders' pockets, regardless of the G20's concessions.\n",
      "\tThe group's new \"case-by-case approach\" to debt negotiations unveiled Friday, also endorsed by the Paris Club, a group of mostly Western sovereign lenders, requires \"fair burden sharing\" among all official creditors -- suggesting that China and its disparate lending agencies will have to get on board. It asks that private creditors offer debt treatment \"at least as favourable\" as that offered by creditor countries.\n",
      "\tMohammed al-Jadaan, the finance minister for Saudi Arabia, this year's chair of the G20, hailed the framework as \"an unprecedented agreement and a major breakthrough in international debt agenda.\"\n",
      "\tKristalina Georgieva, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, echoed the praise, saying the agreement would make the participation of private creditors \"more likely\" and \"increase the viability of our action.\"\n",
      "\tStill, she warned that the debt crisis \"is not over,\" adding that \"we need further support through debt relief and through fresh financing.\"\n",
      "\tThe group also announced Friday that it would reconvene next spring to see \"if the economic and financial situation requires\" an extension of the debt suspension by another six months. A repayment timetable of 5-6 years may be offered to eligible countries that make requests to individual creditors.\n",
      "\tBefore COVID-19 struck, much of the developing world, already in dire need of doctors and medical equipment, was spending huge shares of revenue to service external debt. Now that the pandemic has closed borders, halted tourism, pulled down oil prices and wiped out remittances, poverty is rising and resources are shrinking.\n",
      "\tInternational aid groups have pushed for greater debt relief and partial forgiveness rather than mere suspension, arguing that poor countries should not cut spending that's badly needed for stimulus measures and healthcare systems under strain.\n",
      "\tAhead of Friday's finance meeting, over a thousand medical professionals from around the world sent a letter to the G-20 urging debt cancellation for developing countries.\n",
      "\t\"It is perverse that poor countries are having to pay $3 billion per month in debt repayments to rich banks, investment funds or the World Bank, while their populations fall further into poverty and destitution,\" wrote Chema Vera, Oxfam International's interim executive director.\n",

      "\tAt least 20 people were killed as Typhoon Goni lashed the Philippines over the weekend, and about 13,000 shanties and houses were damaged or swept away in the eastern island province that was first hit by the ferocious storm, officials said Monday.\n",
      "\tGoni blasted into Catanduanes province at dawn Sunday as a super typhoon with sustained winds of 225 kilometres (140 miles) per hour and gusts of 280 kph (174 mph). But it weakened considerably after making landfall and shifted direction to spare the capital, Manila, before blowing out into the South China Sea.\n",
      "\tThe Office of Civil Defence said at least 20 people were killed in Catanduanes and nearby Albay province.\n",
      "\tCatanduanes, an island province of more than 260,000 people that is often lashed by Pacific storms, was isolated after losing power and communications due to Goni and another typhoon that had hit a week earlier. But officials there managed to connect to the outside world on Monday after disaster-response authorities flew to the devastated island with satellite phones.\n",
      "\tCatanduanes Gov. Joseph Cua and other officials said the typhoon whipped up 5-meter (16-foot) storm surges and damaged or swept away about 13,000 houses. Many residents fled to safety from their homes as the typhoon approached.\n",
      "\tMore than 66,000 other houses and huts were damaged elsewhere in the region, officials said.\n",
      "\tCua described the onslaught as \"severe\" and reported that some coastal areas were swamped by frightening storm surges.\n",
      "\tAbout 80% of the electricity posts on the island were toppled and roads linking the province's 11 towns remained impassable, Cua said.\n",
      "\tAn army general on the island appealed for more troops to help distribute food packs and water to residents. He added that the army camp was destroyed by the typhoon and soldiers have camped out at the airport, which remained open.\n",
      "\tAn air force cargo plane was to deliver food packs, drinking water, blankets and other relief goods to the province.\n",
      "\tThe typhoon also devastated the nearby province of Albay, where heavy rains washed down boulders and mudflows from Mayon Volcano, engulfing about 150 houses in a single community in the town of Guinobatan, Albay Gov. Al Francis Bichara said.\n",
      "\tPhilippine President Rodrigo Duterte led an aerial inspection of the typhoon-hit region and briefly visited Guinobatan on his way to Manila on Monday from his southern hometown, officials said. The 75-year-old leader has been criticized for his absences from public view during the coronavirus pandemic and recent storms, but aides say he's working even when away from the public.\n",
      "\tGoni, one of the most powerful typhoons in the world this year, evoked memories of Typhoon Haiyan, which left more than 7,300 people dead or missing, flattened entire villages, swept ships inland and displaced more than 5 million in the central Philippines in November 2013.\n",
      "\tThe Philippines is hit by about 20 typhoons and storms each year. It's also located on the Pacific \"Ring of Fire,\" where earthquakes and volcanic eruptions are common, making it one of the world's most disaster-prone countries.\n",

      "CONTENT : NEW YORK -- \n",
      "\tU.S. stocks are climbing Monday, kicking off a potentially turbulent stretch for markets, as Wall Street recovers some of its sharp sell-off from last week.\n",
      "\tThe S&P 500 was 0.5% higher in afternoon trading after more companies reported stronger profits for the summer than Wall Street feared and reports on manufacturing came in better than expected. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 240 points, or 0.9%, at 26,741, as of 1:20 p.m. Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite fell 0.5%.\n",
      "\tThe rally came on the heels of gains for European and Asian stocks following their own better-than-expected economic data.\n",
      "\tCaution, though, was continuing to hang over markets as the pandemic raises worries that customers will stay away from businesses and pushes more European governments to bring back restrictions. Uncertainty about Tuesday's U.S. elections is also weighing on markets, and Treasury yields were dipping.\n",
      "\t\"People are probably more than willing to hold off to see what happens tomorrow night,\" said David Trainer, CEO of investment research firm New Constructs.\n",
      "\tIt's an incredibly busy week for markets, with the Federal Reserve announcing its latest decision on interest rates Thursday, the U.S. Labor Department releasing its market-moving monthly jobs report on Friday and roughly 130 companies in the S&P 500 scheduled to report their results for the summer through the week.\n",
      "\tBlaring above them all is Election Day. Markets have veered sharply in recent weeks as investors deal with uncertainty about who will control Washington, and what that means for the chances of the U.S. government delivering more aid for the economy.\n",
      "\tMany professional investors say they plan to hold steady through whatever volatility the election creates. That's because history shows politics don't have a very strong correlation with market returns over the longer term. But Wall Street is nevertheless girding for potentially big swings in the interim.\n",
      "\tThe feared scenario for investors is a contested election, where it could take weeks for a winner of the White House to emerge. Markets famously hate uncertainty, and many along Wall Street expect stocks to drop in such a scenario.\n",
      "\tWhich party gets control of the Senate may be just as important as the presidency. If Democrats can gain complete control of Washington, many investors expect them to deliver a big dose of support for the economy. That plus \"more predictable trade policy\" could offset the higher tax rates and tighter regulations likely to come out of a Democratic-controlled Washington, says the BlackRock Investment Institute.\n",
      "\tDemocrats and Republicans have been haggling about a stimulus renewal for months, since the last round of supplemental benefits for laid-off workers and other stimulus expired. But a deep partisan divide has so far stymied them.\n",
      "\tThe U.S. economy has been showing a mixed performance recently. A Monday report on manufacturing from the Institute for Supply Management gave a reading of 59.3, where anything above 50 indicates growth. That topped economists' expectations for 56. But Friday's upcoming jobs report may show a fourth straight month of weakening job growth, according to economists' projections.\n",
      "\tInvestors and economists alike say the economy needs another shot of stimulus, particularly when coronavirus counts are accelerating at troubling rates across Europe and much of the United States. So far, the toughest restrictions on daily life and businesses have not returned. But even if they don't, the worry is that fear about the virus will keep customers away from businesses by itself.\n",
      "\tSuch worries helped drive the S&P 500 to a 5.6% loss last week. That was its worst since March, when worries about the first wave of the pandemic were sending stocks around the world into a free fall.\n",
      "\tCorporate profits, meanwhile, are weaker than year-ago levels but continue to be better than Wall Street had feared.\n",
      "\tNielsen Holdings jumped 4.6% and Clorox rose 3% after each of the companies reported better results than analysts expected. Companies in the S&P 500 are now on track to a decline of slightly less than 10% for the summer from a year earlier. That's not as bad as the nearly 21% drop analysts were expecting at the start of October, according to FactSet.\n",
      "\tIn Europe, France's CAC 40 rose 2.1%, and Germany's DAX returned 2% after a survey showed industrial output was at a strong level in October in the eurozone, just as new limits are being reimposed on public life. The FTSE 100 in London climbed 1.4%.\n",
      "\tIn Asia, a major indicator for China's manufacturing sector reported a rise on Monday, which showed that domestic demand is holding up.\n",
      "\tThat helped drive Asian stocks higher, along with encouraging data for Japan and India. Japan's Nikkei 225 rose 1.4%, South Korea's Kospi climbed 1.5%, Hong Kong's Hang Seng added 1.5% and stocks in Shanghai inched up by less than 0.1%.\n",
      "\tBut in a show of continued caution, the yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 0.84% from 0.88% late Friday.\n",

      "\tWorkers at a grocery store in the U.S. tested positive for the novel coronavirus at a rate well above the rest of their community, researchers say.\n",
      "\tThe research was published Friday in the journal Occupation and Environmental Medicine. It is based on a study of 104 adults who were working at a grocery store in the Boston area in May, when they underwent mandatory testing over three days.\n",
      "\tOf the 104 workers tracked, 21 tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.\n",
      "\tThat’s an infection rate of 20 per cent – well above the 1.3 per cent detected in the community at the time.\n",
      "\tUse of gloves and masks didn’t seem to make a difference in how likely a worker was to test positive. Neither did social distancing, using public transit or believing COVID-19 to be a greater or lesser threat than others.\n",
      "\tWhat did matter, the researchers found, was what the workers did, and how often their duties brought them into contact with shoppers.\n",
      "\tWorkers who had “significant direct customer exposure” – cashiers, cart attendants, supervisors and those working with fresh food – were found to be five times more likely to test positive than the receivers, cleaners and stockers who rarely if ever interacted with customers.\n",
      "\tOnly five of the 21 workers who tested positive were displaying symptoms of COVID-19 at the time. With the vast majority of cases both asymptomatic and involving personnel who interact with shoppers, the researchers suggest that this puts both other workers and the public at large at risk.\n",
      "\t“Once essential workers are infected with SARS-CoV-2, they may become a significant transmission source for the community they serve,” they wrote.\n",
      "\tThis new study, which did not examine how these workers contracted COVID-19 at such a high rate relative to the community, is part of a small but growing body of research looking at COVID-19 spread in individual workplaces.\n",
      "\tWhile the bulk of this research has been conducted in the health-care field, the Massachusetts grocery store is not the first workplace accessible to healthy members of the public to be studied in this way.\n",
      "\tA previous study detailed the cases of two hairstylists in Missouri who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in May – around the same time the grocery store workers were being examined – and seemingly did not pass the virus on to any of the 139 clients they saw before they entered quarantine.\n",
      "\tEarlier in the pandemic, a team of researchers in China looked at coronavirus transmission among employees and shoppers at one grocery store there, and found that 9.2 per cent of workers were infected.\n",
      "\tThe Massachusetts study also looked at workers’ mental health, and found that an inability to consistently practise social distancing at work “was a significant risk factor for anxiety and depression,” while a commute via public transport was also associated with depression.\n",
      "\tThe researchers say this backs up calls for supermarket employees and other essential workers to receive help coping with psychological distress brought on by the pandemic.\n",

      "\tBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson became the latest leader to impose a new shutdown in England that starts Thursday for at least a month, following in the steps of Austria, France and Ireland.\n",

      "\t\"I fear for the young, like my own grandchildren and great-grandchildren, they're going to suffer.\"\n",
      "\tOther countries like Germany and Greece have implemented slightly less restrictive infection-control curbs that nevertheless still involve the closure of bars, restaurants and cultural establishments in what has also caused anguish and resentment.\n",
      "BARRICADES AND STONES\n",
      "\tIn Spain, anger spilled onto the streets in sometimes violent fashion overnight Saturday, with looting and vandalism breaking out in some cities on the fringe of protests.\n",
      "\tThe country has imposed a nationwide nighttime curfew and almost all of Spain's regions have imposed regional border closures to prevent long-distance travel.\n",
      "\tThe biggest disturbances were in Madrid where scores of demonstrators chanting \"freedom!\" torched rubbish bins and set up makeshift barricades on the city's main thoroughfare, the Gran Via, images on social media showed.\n",
      "\tWhen police moved in to clear the gathering, they were pelted with stones and flares.\n",

      "\tPolice said they arrested 32 people in total.\n",
      "\tItaly was also the scene of protests last week.\n",
      "\tBut the government there is still expected to announce new restrictions on Monday, according to news reports.\n",
      "\tThese are expected to include banning travel between regions, closing shopping centres at the weekend, limiting commercial activity and imposing an earlier nighttime curfew.\n",
      "\tRestrictions also led to unrest in Argentina, where riots took place in several jails in Buenos Aires province on Saturday, as prisoners demanded the resumption of visits in the pandemic.\n",

      "\tThe coastal city that infamously held witch trials in the 17th century is a draw for chill-seekers, and while grim reapers, mad scientists and tarot readers still paraded the streets on Saturday, authorities decided to shut down the city at 8 pm to avoid crowds.\n",
      "\t\"We are discouraging people from coming into Salem on Halloween night, which is so hard for us to do,\" said Kate Fox, executive director of Destination Salem, the city's tourism office.\n",
      "\t\"We can't accommodate the crowds and shoulder-to-shoulder crowding that we usually see on a typical Halloween when we'll have over 50,000 thousand people in the streets.\"\n",
      "\tIn Germany, the sadness was palpable at the renown Bavarian State Opera House in Munich as it prepared to close.\n",
      "\tIt is \"a slap\", said baritone Michael Nagy, unable to hide his tears.\n",
      "\tDirector Nikolaus Bachler said he did not understand why public transport and shops were able to keep going while the opera had to close.\n",

      "\tAnd while hospitals in European countries have sounded the alarm about their ability to treat a rapidly rising number of patients, the situation is even worse in other, poorer parts of the world.\n",
      "\tIn war-torn northwest Syria, where almost 1.5 million people live in overcrowded camps or shelters, often with poor access to running water, fears are running high.\n",

      "\tIt’s that time again.\n",
      "\tAmericans head to the polls on Tuesday to elect a president, as they do every four years on the day after the first Monday of November.\n",
      "\tThere are also plenty of down-ballot votes, including Congressional races, 11 governorships, other state- and local-level elections, and ballot questions – think referendums – in some states.\n",
      "\tBut for Americans and outside observers alike, the presidential race is the biggest one of them all.\n",
      "\tCTVNews.ca has compiled a guide to the presidential election for Canadians and others who are interested in following election night, but haven’t been paying attention until now and may not be familiar with the American electoral system.\n",
      "\tRead on to find out how the president is chosen, which issues have dominated this year’s campaign and when results are expected to come in.\n",
      "WHO IS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT?\n",
      "\tIt’s a race between two men for whom the White House is familiar territory: Donald Trump and Joe Biden.\n",
      "\tRepublican nominee Trump is the incumbent president, having won the last election in 2016. Democratic nominee Biden was vice-president under Barack Obama from 2008 through 2016.\n",
      "\tHowever, they are not the only choices for voters. Many third-party and independent candidates will be on the ballot in one or more states, led by Libertarian Party nominee Jo Jorgensen, who will be an option in every state.\n",
      "\tWhile not generally a major factor in presidential elections, independent and third-party candidates did garner more than five per cent of the popular vote in 2016.\n",
      "\tThe most recent presidential candidate from outside the two main parties to attract significant support is Ross Perot, the Texas billionaire who won nearly 19 per cent of the popular vote in 1992 and more than 8 per cent in 1996.\n",
      "HOW IS A WINNER DETERMINED?\n",
      "\tAlthough the names of Trump and Biden will appear on ballots across the U.S., votes don’t directly decide the presidency.\n",
      "\tInstead, voters are picking the candidate they want their state’s electors, or delegates, to endorse. Those delegates – the famed “electoral college” – then meet in their states and determine the result of the presidential election.\n",
      "\tThe electoral college system has shifted since its formation, so that almost all delegates now endorse whichever candidate received the most votes in their state. This means that the candidate who garners the most votes in Texas, for example, gets all 38 of the state’s electoral votes, no matter how slim the margin is between them and the runner-up.\n",
      "\tThe only exceptions to this are Nebraska and Maine, which award some of their delegates based on results from local districts.\n",
      "\tStates are awarded electoral votes based on the number of representatives they have in the House of Representative and Senate. This means that the distribution of electoral votes is mostly population based, with some bias in favour of less-populated states, as House seats are allocated based on population while the Senate is comprised of exactly two members from each state.\n",
      "\tThere are a total of 538 electoral votes, leaving 270 as the magic number to win more than 50 per cent – and thus, the presidency.\n",
      "\tBecause of this system, it is possible for a candidate to win the election despite receiving fewer votes than their main opponent. This has only happened four times in 58 presidential elections, although two of them were recent – in 2000 and 2016.\n",
      "\tThat said, it would be hypocritical for Canadians to gloat about this bizarre quirk of the U.S. system. After all, Andrew Scheer never became prime minister despite his Conservative Party winning the popular vote in our last federal election.\n",
      "WHICH STATES MATTER MOST?\n",
      "\tBecause the presidency is decided by the electoral college and different states have different levels of representation in that body, some states carry much more weight than others.\n",
      "\tAnd because of the winner-take-all stakes of the college, “battleground” or “swing” states where both parties have strong support are seen as much more important for achieving victory than “safe” states that always vote the same way.\n",
      "\tThat’s why Michigan, Pennsylvania and other swing states traditionally see far more visits from prospective presidents during American campaigns than those that traditionally vote for the Democrats, such as New York and California, or those that traditionally vote for the Republicans, such as Georgia and Arizona. Winning those latter states is to be expected. Winning the swing states means winning the White House.\n",
      "\tEvery election cycle, strategists for both parties identify various paths to victory and focus their campaigns on ensuring the right number of votes in enough states to reach 270 electoral college votes.\n",
      "\tKey battlegrounds this time around include many of the usual suspects, including Florida, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan. Those tracking the polls closely say a number of seats normally considered safe for the Republicans could flip – potentially even Texas, which would signal a seismic shift in American electoral politics.\n",
      "WHEN WILL WE KNOW WHO WON?\n",
      "\tIt’s hard to say.\n",
      "\tFor one thing, when the polls close is decided on the state level. States that span multiple time zones may even have separate voting end times for residents of each time zone.\n",
      "\tPolls close in all but 10 states by 9 p.m. EST, although voters who are in line when the voting day ends are still eligible to cast their ballots. Some results will likely be public knowledge before this point.\n",
      "\tTypically, a winner is declared in presidential elections during the late-night hours. If the race is especially close, it might happen after most Americans have gone to bed.\n",
      "\tBut this isn’t a typical election. Between the large turnout for advance voting, the expected high levels of mail-in ballots, and the possibility of a disputed result, it’s entirely plausible that the result won’t be evident on Tuesday, or on Wednesday, or on many days thereafter.\n",
      "\tThe worst-case scenario, at least for those hoping for a speedy resolution, is a repeat of what happened in 2000. That year, the outcome of the election went all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, which ordered on Dec. 12 that a recount in Florida be stopped.\n",
      "\tThe electoral college is mandated by the U.S. Constitution to award their votes on the second Wednesday in December. This year, that’s Dec. 14.\n",
      "WHEN DOES THE WINNER BECOME PRESIDENT?\n",
      "\tNo matter when it is determined who won Tuesday’s election, the winner will be sworn in on Jan. 20, 2021.\n",
      "WHAT WILL IT MEAN FOR CANADA?\n",
      "\tThe U.S. is Canada’s closest neighbour and largest trading partner, so even the slightest shift in its political winds can have a major effect on this country.\n",
      "\tPrime Minister Justin Trudeau said last month that his government is “going to be prepared for various eventualities” following the vote.\n",
      "\tCTVNews.ca has taken in-depth looks at how either a Biden victory or a second term of Trump could affect Canada when it comes to trade, relations with China, defence and other foreign policy files, climate change, immigration and the oil and gas industry.\n",
      "HOW CAN I FOLLOW ALONG?\n",
      "\tCTV's Chief News Anchor and Senior Editor Lisa LaFlamme leads THE AMERICAN ELECTION 2020 special, with in-depth live coverage beginning at 7 p.m. ET on CTV News Channel and 8 p.m. ET on CTV.\n",

      "\tA super typhoon blew into the eastern Philippines with disastrous force Sunday, killing at least 10 people and triggering volcanic mudflows that engulfed about 150 houses before weakening as it blew away from the country, officials said.\n",
      "\tTyphoon Goni blasted into the eastern island province of Catanduanes at dawn from the Pacific with sustained winds of 225 kilometres (140 miles) per hour and gusts of 280 kph (174 mph), threatening some provinces still recovering from a deadly typhoon that hit a week ago.\n",
      "\tGoni barrelled through densely populated regions and threatened to sideswipe Manila, which shut down its main airport, but shifted southward Sunday night and spared the capital, the government weather agency said.\n",
      "\tAt least nine people were killed in the hard-hit province of Albay, including a father and son. Villagers fled to safety as the typhoon approached, but the two apparently stayed put in the community in Guinobatan town where about 150 houses were inundated by volcanic mudflow.\n",
      "\t\"The child was found 15 kilometres (9 miles) away,\" Albay Gov. Al Francis Bichara told DZMM radio, adding that the boy was swept away by mudflows and found in the next town.\n",
      "\tHe did not say whether there were any other residents trapped by the rampaging mudflows in the community and added that downed communications made it hard for people to communicate. The Office of Civil Defence reported that three Guinobatan residents were missing, but it was not immediately clear if they were from the mudflow-hit community.\n",
      "\tThe other deaths in Albay included a villager who was pinned by a fallen tree. One person was killed in Catanduanes province.\n",
      "\tRicardo Jalad, who heads the government's disaster-response agency, had feared that the typhoon could wreak major damage due to its enormous force. The Philippine weather agency reinforced those concerns, saying that within 12 hours after the typhoon's landfall, people could face \"catastrophic, violent winds and intense to torrential rainfall.\"\n",
      "\tResidents were warned of possible landslides, massive flooding, storm surges of up to 5 metres (16 feet) and powerful winds that can blow away shanties. But after hitting a mountain range and repeatedly slamming into coastal provinces, the typhoon gradually weakened, although it remained potentially deadly as it blew out into the South China Sea, forecasters said.\n",
      "\tOne of the most powerful typhoons in the world this year, Goni evoked memories of Typhoon Haiyan, which left more than 7,300 people dead or missing, flattened entire villages, swept ships inland and displaced more than 5 million in the central Philippines in November 2013.\n",
      "\tManila's main airport was ordered shut down for 24 hours from Sunday to Monday, and airlines cancelled dozens of international and domestic flights. Commuter train services were also suspended and a no-sail policy restriction was imposed by the coast guard due to initial fear over the typhoon's threatening power. The military and national police, along with the coast guard, were put on full alert.\n",
      "\tJalad said nearly a million people were preemptively moved into emergency shelters.\n",
      "\tIn a Manila gymnasium that was turned into an emergency shelter, COVID-19 outbreaks were an added worry of displaced residents. The Philippines has had more than 383,000 cases of the virus, the second-most in Southeast Asia behind Indonesia.\n",
      "\t\"We are scared -- our fears are doubled,\" said Jaqueline Almocera, a 44-year-old street vendor who took cover at the shelter.\n",
      "\tThe Philippines is lashed by about 20 typhoons and storms each year. It's also located on the so-called Pacific \"Ring of Fire,\" where earthquakes and volcanic eruptions are common, making it one of the world's most disaster-prone countries.\n",

      "\tTaiwan is at the vanguard of the burgeoning gay rights movement in Asia and became the first place in the region to allow same-sex marriage in May 2019 after a bruising political fight.\n",
      "\tIt has also achieved remarkable success against the coronavirus, recording more than 200 days in a row without a single local infection.\n",
      "\tAs a result there are few of the social distancing measures currently in place across much of the globe, allowing crowds to gather on the island.\n",
      "\tRainbow coloured flags and balloons were carried through Taipei under blue skies on Saturday afternoon.\n",
      "\tDrag queen Wu Po-sung was wearing a hand-crafted red \"wedding banquet\" dress -- the traditional colour of marriage in Taiwan -- complete with table settings.\n",
      "\t\"Gay marriage is now in its second year,\" Wu told AFP. \"I was hoping to be able to attend all of my friends' wedding banquets and that's why I am dressed like a wedding banquet.\"\n",
      "\tSaturday's parade came a day after two same-sex couples joined a mass wedding hosted by the military for the first time in another gay rights landmark in Asia.\n",
      "\tOver 4,000 gay couples have registered their marriages since the law change took effect last year when Taiwan became the first place in the region to allow same-sex nuptials.\n",
      "\tTaiwanese LGBT groups held a smaller pride march in June -- the traditional pride month -- in solidarity with gay communities around the world who were unable to celebrate because of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n",
      "\tOrganisers estimated a turnout of 130,000 on Saturday -- the 18th Pride march in Taipei -- down from last year's record 200,000 participants, when many international visitors were still able to travel to the island.\n",
      "\tTaiwan is home to a thriving LGBT community and its capital is due to host Asia's Gay Games next year.\n",
      "\tBut the issue has caused deep divisions on the island, especially among conservative religious groups and older generations.\n",
      "\tPresident Tsai Ing-wen took a considerable risk in pushing for gay marriage. But she won a second term in January with a landslide.\n",
      "\tTaiwan's gay marriage law still contains restrictions not faced by heterosexual couples, including on adoption and foreign marriages.\n",
      "\tCurrently Taiwanese people can only marry foreigners from countries that also have gay marriage laws.\n",
      "\t\"Taiwan is Asia's first, which means most of our neighbouring countries do not recognise same-sex marriages,\" Chien Chi-chieh, the secretary-general of the Taiwan Alliance to Promote Civil Partnership Rights, told AFP.\n",
      "\t\"So, if a Taiwanese has a partner from South Korea, Japan, Hong Kong, China, Malaysia, Vietnam, Philippines, they all can't get married. There's a huge number of couples like that in Taiwan,\" she added.\n",

      "\t\"There are so many people who are really in vulnerable areas,\" said Ricardo Jalad, who heads the government's disaster-response agency. \"We're expecting major damage.\"\n",
      "\tTyphoon Goni hit the island province of Catanduanes at dawn with sustained winds of 225 kilometres per hour and gusts of 280 km/h. It was blowing west toward densely populated regions, including Manila, and rain-soaked provinces still recovering from a typhoon that hit a week ago and left at least 22 dead.\n",
      "\t\"Within the next 12 hours, catastrophic violent winds and intense to torrential rainfall associated with the region of the eyewall and inner rain bands of the typhoon will be experienced,\" the Philippine weather agency said in an urgent advisory.\n",
      "\tIt said Catanduanes and four other provinces will be first hit, including Albay, where tens of thousands of villagers have been moved to safety, especially near the active Mayon volcano, where mudflows have caused deaths during past storms. Residents have been warned of likely landslides, massive flooding, storm surges of more than 5 metres and ferocious wind that can blow away shanties.\n",
      "\tOne of the most powerful typhoons in the world this year, Goni has evoked memories of Typhoon Haiyan in November 2013, which left more than 7,300 people dead and missing, flattened entire villages, swept ships inland and displaced more than 5 million in the central Philippines.\n",
      "\tJalad said nearly a million people have been preemptively moved into emergency shelters, mostly schools and government buildings. He warned of storm surges that could inundate coastal villages, including in Manila Bay.\n",
      "\tForecasters said the typhoon's eye may hit or graze metropolitan Manila, the densely populated capital region of more than 13 million, late Sunday to early Monday and asked the public to brace for the worst. The typhoon may considerably weaken after it hits the Sierra Madre mountain range, then cross the main northern Luzon island toward the South China Sea.\n",
      "\tManila's main airport was ordered shut down for 24 hours from Sunday to Monday and airlines cancelled dozens of international and domestic flights. The military and national police, along with the coast guard and firefighters, have been put on full alert.\n",
      "\tAbout 1,000 COVID-19 patients were moved to hospitals and hotels from tent quarantine and treatment centres in the capital and the northern province of Bulacan, Jalad said. More emergency shelters would be opened than usual to avoid congestion that can rapidly spark infections.\n",
      "\tThe war-like typhoon preparations will further strain government resources, which have been drained with months of coronavirus outbreaks that prompted the government to set up isolation and treatment centres when hospitals were overwhelmed and provide aid to more than 20 million poor Filipinos.\n",
      "\tThe Philippines has reported more than 380,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases, the second-highest in Southeast Asia, with 7,221 deaths.\n",
      "\tDisplaced villagers may have to stay longer in evacuation centres even after Goni exits Tuesday due to another storm brewing in the Pacific that may affect the Philippines in a few days, Jalad said.\n",

      "\tThe International Space Station was a cramped, humid, puny three rooms when the first crew moved in. Twenty years and 241 visitors later, the complex has a lookout tower, three toilets, six sleeping compartments and 12 rooms, depending on how you count.\n",
      "\tMonday marks two decades of a steady stream of people living there.\n",
      "\tAstronauts from 19 countries have floated through the space station hatches, including many repeat visitors who arrived on shuttles for short-term construction work, and several tourists who paid their own way.\n",
      "\tThe first crew -- American Bill Shepherd and Russians Sergei Krikalev and Yuri Gidzenko -- blasted off from Kazakhstan on Oct. 31, 2000. Two days later, they swung open the space station doors, clasping their hands in unity.\n",
      "\tShepherd, a former Navy SEAL who served as the station commander, likened it to living on a ship at sea. The three spent most of their time coaxing equipment to work; balky systems made the place too warm. Conditions were primitive, compared with now.\n",
      "\tInstallations and repairs took hours at the new space station, versus minutes on the ground, Krikalev recalled.\n",
      "\t\"Each day seemed to have its own set of challenges,\" Shepherd said during a recent NASA panel discussion with his crewmates.\n",
      "\tThe space station has since morphed into a complex that's almost as long as a football field, with eight miles (13 kilometres) of electrical wiring, an acre of solar panels and three high-tech labs.\n",
      "\t\"It's 500 tons of stuff zooming around in space, most of which never touched each other until it got up there and bolted up,\" Shepherd told The Associated Press. \"And it's all run for 20 years with almost no big problems.\"\n",
      "\t\"It's a real testament to what can be done in these kinds of programs,\" he said.\n",
      "\tShepherd, 71, is long retired from NASA and lives in Virginia Beach, Virginia. Krikalev, 62, and Gidzenko, 58, have risen in the Russian space ranks. Both were involved in the mid-October launch of the 64th crew.\n",
      "\tThe first thing the three did once arriving at the darkened space station on Nov. 2, 2000, was turn on the lights, which Krikalev recalled as \"very memorable.\" Then they heated water for hot drinks and activated the lone toilet.\n",
      "\t\"Now we can live,\" Gidzenko remembers Shepherd saying. \"We have lights, we have hot water and we have toilet.\"\n",
      "\tThe crew called their new home Alpha, but the name didn't stick.\n",
      "\tAlthough pioneering the way, the three had no close calls during their nearly five months up there, Shepherd said, and so far the station has held up relatively well.\n",
      "\tNASA's top concern nowadays is the growing threat from space junk. This year, the orbiting lab has had to dodge debris three times.\n",
      "\tAs for station amenities, astronauts now have near-continuous communication with flight controllers and even an internet phone for personal use. The first crew had sporadic radio contact with the ground; communication blackouts could last hours.\n",
      "\tWhile the three astronauts got along fine, tension sometimes bubbled up between them and the two Mission Controls, in Houston and outside Moscow. Shepherd got so frustrated with the \"conflicting marching orders\" that he insisted they come up with a single plan.\n",
      "\t\"I've got to say, that was my happiest day in space,\" he said during the panel discussion.\n",
      "\tWith its first piece launched in 1998, the International Space Station already has logged 22 years in orbit. NASA and its partners contend it easily has several years of usefulness left 260 miles (400 kilometres) up.\n",
      "\tThe Mir station -- home to Krikalev and Gidzenko in the late 1980s and 1990s -- operated for 15 years before being guided to a fiery reentry over the Pacific in 2001. Russia's earlier stations and America's 1970s Skylab had much shorter life spans, as did China's much more recent orbital outposts.\n",
      "\tAstronauts spend most of their six-month stints these days keeping the space station running and performing science experiments. A few have even spent close to a year up there on a single flight, serving as medical guinea pigs. Shepherd and his crew, by contrast, barely had time for a handful of experiments.\n",
      "\tThe first couple weeks were so hectic -- \"just working and working and working,\" according to Gidzenko -- that they didn't shave for days. It took awhile just to find the razors.\n",
      "\tEven back then, the crew's favourite pastime was gazing down at Earth. It takes a mere 90 minutes for the station to circle the world, allowing astronauts to soak in a staggering 16 sunrises and 16 sunsets each day.\n",
      "\tThe current residents -- one American and two Russians, just like the original crew -- plan to celebrate Monday's milestone by sharing a special dinner, enjoying the views of Earth and remembering all the crews who came before them, especially the first.\n",
      "\tBut it won't be a day off: \"Probably we'll be celebrating this day by hard work,\" Sergei Kud-Sverchkov said Friday from orbit.\n",
      "\tOne of the best outcomes of 20 years of continuous space habitation, according to Shepherd, is astronaut diversity.\n",
      "\tWhile men still lead the pack, more crews include women. Two U.S. women have served as space station skipper. Commanders typically are American or Russian, but have also come from Belgium, Germany, Italy, Canada and Japan. While African-Americans have made short visits to the space station, the first Black resident is due to arrive in mid-November on SpaceX's second astronaut flight.\n",
      "\tMassive undertakings like human Mars trips can benefit from the past two decades of international experience and co-operation, Shepherd said.\n",
      "\t\"If you look at the space station program today, it's a blueprint on how to do it. All those questions about how this should be organized and what it's going to look like, the big questions are already behind us,\" he told the AP.\n",
      "\tRussia, for instance, kept station crews coming and going after NASA's Columbia disaster in 2003 and after the shuttles retired in 2011.\n",

      "CONTENT : CALGARY -- \n",
      "\tA Medicine Hat-based produce farm is trying out a new way to package tomatoes that an environmental advocate describes as a step in the right direction towards creating sustainable produce packaging.\n",
      "Big Marble Farms is a year-round greenhouse that sells grape tomatoes, cucumbers, peppers, and eggplants, among other things, in places like Sobeys and Safeway, Loblaws and other grocers.\n",
      "\tIt's not only the largest indoor vegetable producer in Alberta but it's also the farm most likely not to be side-swiped by the ban on single-use plastics announced by the federal government in early October.\n",
      "\tEven the company's name is a nod to the need to think bigger picture.\n",
      "\t\"When you’re in space and look down at Earth, it looks like a big marble - so that’s what that name means,” said Big Marble’s marketing vice-president, Jonathan Schow, in an interview with CTV News.\n",
      "\tMidway through the pandemic, Big Marble’s grape tomatoes started to show up in the produce section at Safeway and Sobeys stores – generally a sea of plastic, single-use clamshells – in nifty recyclable cardboard containers, with air vents to let the tomatoes breathe.\n",
      "\tCompared to the tsunami of clamshells, the Big Marble cardboard carton, which contains a dry pint of grape tomatoes, feels a little bit like, dare we say it – the future?\n",
      "\tBig Marble recently expanded to grow year-round, and they aspire to do it with a minimal plasticized footprint, said Schow.\n",
      "\t“We want to do it in the most sustainable way possible,” he said. “So we’re incorporating things like integrated pest management systems – using good bugs to kill the bad bugs.”\n",
      "\tThe farm uses a heat capture system, converting the heat from the greenhouse into hot water. They use a co-generation system to generate power, to light up the grow lights that help grow produce over the winter.\n",
      "\t“We’re always looking for new technology that’s coming out – we always feel like the investment in that is worth the long-term effect it’s going to have on the environment,” Schow said.\n",
      "\tTurns out they weren't the only ones - the innovative boxes earned an Excellence Award and Achievement in Sustainability in the North American Paperboard Packaging competition, which are the Oscars of the paperboard industry.\n",
      "\t That mindset was behind the introduction of the Simply Marbleous packaging, Schow said.\n",
      "\t“It wasn’t something solicited by anyone, it was just something we saw an opportunity to show the customers – because they can’t come to the facility to see what we do – to show we are mindful of our environment,” he said.\n",
      "\tPart of the cardboard packaging experiment is because a lot of consumers don’t always recognize what sort of packaging they’re purchasing, so that even when it’s built to be sustainable, the distinction gets lost on a lot of shoppers.\n",
      "\t“One of the things we have realized is that a lot of produce companies have gone towards a compostable type of packaging, which we think is the right direction,” Schow said, “But a lot of consumers aren’t educated in how to compost, so a lot of that technology is wasted on the user.\n",
      "\t“It’s lost on them because they don’t have the ability to compost, or they don’t have that facility in the backyard. So we think the recyclable concept is the better way to go, because even if it does end up in the landfill, it’s still going to break down. It’s biodegradable.”\n",
      "\tBrianna Loughlin, at Plastic-Free YYC, said the best kind of produce packaging is no packaging at all, but added that Big Marble has the right idea.\n",
      "\t“It’s definitely a step up from the little plastic cups with the cellophane peel back,” Loughlin said. “Those are really not a blue cart-friendly packaging option.\n",
      "\t“It’s really awesome that they’re going this way. We love seeing businesses listening to consumers and doing better for our world.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\tOn the other hand, Loughlin added that recyclables are still problematic in a world filling up with them – witness the City of Calgary’s 2018 struggles to find a buyer for its recycling when China said it would no longer accept it.\n",
      "\t“As they (Big Marble) move forward, it would be really awesome to see them take this and see if it does well, but also try other options like maybe compostable,\" Loughlin said.\n",
      "\t\"Since they are really close to the Calgary area and we have an amazing compost system, where they put these boxes into the compost system, so they go into the energy and back into the earth rather than forcing them back into recycling, because recycling takes a lot of energy and water and there’s other waste related to that.”\n",
      "\tOn Oct. 7, the federal government announced a limited plastic ban, which included plastic bags and straws, but also the somewhat nebulously described “food packaging made from plastics that are difficult to recycle.”\n",
      "\tCould that be the ubiquitous clamshell that contains our tomatoes, strawberries, blueberries, raspberries and blackberries all year?\n",
      "\tAnd what would be the implications for the produce industry if that were to happen?\n",
      "\tLoughlin said the truth about recycling both plastics and cardboard is that each time it goes into a recycler, it degrades a little bit more.\n",
      "\t“The word around recycling is that plastic can never be recycled, it is only downcycled.\"\n",
      "\t“If I have a Coca-Cola bottle and I finish it – it’s the number one type of plastic – when I take it to the recycling bottle depot, it doesn’t get turned into another recyclable bottle, it gets turned into a plastic bag,” she said.\n",
      "\t“And then that plastic bag – it continually loses its original composition and it gets downcycled, as opposed to glass and aluminum, (which) are the only two forms of material that can be directly recycled.”\n",
      "\tThe same goes for paper, alas.\n",
      "\t\"Paper – like these boxes they’re going to put their tomatoes in – when it goes in a blue bin to a recycling centre, it's going to get turned into probably newspaper or toilet paper. Not into another box.\n",
      "\t“And so when I say, we want to change this crutch of recyclables and help people understand it’s not just about it goes into a blue bin and it’s good – it’s about how much waste we’re creating.\n",
      "\t“The blue bin,” she said, “is still a form of waste.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\tSchow said the price point for producing more sustainable produce and packaging in environmentally-friendly material is not substantial – and one he believes consumers are willing to pay a bit more for.\n",
      "\t“It’s not astronomical,” he said. “It’s cents on the dollar. For the price-conscious consumer, why would they want to spend 50 cents more on that size of pint instead of plastic? And we’re hoping that when we get the word out, they’ll understand the benefit of doing that – and I just picked 50 cents out of the air, that’s not the exact number.”\n",
      "\tThe grape tomato season is winding down for 2020. It's expected to end by the middle of November at the latest before relaunching in June.\n",
      "\tMeanwhile, Big Marble continues to look for smarter ways to sell a fresh veggie at a supermarket.\n",
      "\t“We’re trialing a bunch of products in those packages to see if it’s a viable option to put mini-cucumbers in them, or mini-peppers or whatever else fits.\n",
      "\t“So we’re hoping that that product line will expand and we can really get some good traction – because it’s important to us. It’s not just platitude and buzzwords we’re talking about here. We do realize it’s the direction everyone is going in.”\n",
      "\tThe federal government's prohibition on single-use plastics will come into effect by the end of 2021.\n",

      "Plague outbreaks in London spread four times faster in the 17th century than they did in the 14th century, researchers have estimated after studying troves of wills and death records.\n",
      "\tResearchers from McMaster University in Hamilton analyzed thousands of documents spanning 300 years -- including personal wills and testaments, parish registers and the London Bills of Mortality -- to search for patterns on how plague was spreading through the population.\n",
      "\tPlague, one of the deadliest bacterial infections in human history, caused an estimated 50 million deaths in Europe during the Middle Ages when it was known as the Black Death. The disease, though rare and now treatable with antibiotics, is still around today -- cases have been recorded in China and the United States as recently as this year.\n",
      "\tThere was a \"striking acceleration\" in plague transmission between the Black Death of 1348 and the Great Plague of 1665, researchers said in findings published Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences journal.\n",
      "\tDavid Earn, a professor in the department of mathematics and statistics at McMaster and lead author of the research, told CNN that while plague cases in London doubled every six weeks in the 14th century, by the 17th century, they were doubling every week and a half.\n",
      "\t\"That's an enormous difference,\" he said.\n",
      "\tBut this was not simply a case of the disease becoming more virulent -- evolutionary geneticist Hendrik Poinar told CNN that while the spread of the disease accelerated, genetic analysis to date tentatively suggests that it may have become less infectious.\n",
      "\t\"When there are shifts in the epidemiology of the disease, most of the shifts that occur can be translated to human intervention or things that go on outside of the actual genetics of the bug,\" Poinar, a professor in the department of anthropology at McMaster and a co-author of the study, said.\n",
      "\tThe estimated speed of the epidemics, coupled with what we know about the biology of the plague, suggested that plague did not spread primarily through human-to-human contact during these centuries, but instead, growth rates for early and late epidemics are more consistent with bubonic plague, transmitted by the bites of infected fleas, the researchers said.\n",
      "\tResearchers believe that factors including population density, living conditions and cooler temperatures could go toward explaining the acceleration of the disease in London -- and could help with our understanding of modern pandemics, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic.\n",
      "\t\"A given pathogen can cause very different epidemics, whether it's in the same place over time, or in different places,\" Earn explained.\n",
      "\t\"The characteristics of the community can strongly influence the pattern of the epidemic,\" he said. \"And of course, the behavioural response of individuals can also influence the pattern of the epidemic,\" he added.\n",
      "\tThe findings could also provide a blueprint to how the current pandemic and future pandemics could behave.\n",
      "\t\"Plague never went away and it won't ever go away, and (SARS-)CoV-2 will never go away,\" Poinar told CNN, explaining that the virus, like the plague, has \"natural reservoirs\" in the population.\n",
      "\t\"Fortunately we have a phenomenal scientific community, you know across the globe, working ... more or less together right now to figure out a way to come up with antibody treatment, to come up with, hopefully, a vaccine that's effective for longer-term immunity,\" he said.\n",
      "\tBut he also cautioned that pandemics will continue to threaten humans so long as people encroach on the natural world -- something scientists and environmental organizations have repeatedly warned.\n",
      "\t\"The reality is if you think that this is the only time it's going to happen, you're fooling yourself, because it's happened repeated times in human history and it's bound to happen again as we continue to encroach on lands -- the same thing with climate change and environmental deconstruction -- we're bound to run into more reservoirs that spill over into humans,\" he added.\n",

      "CONTENT : WASHINGTON -- \n",
      "\tThe Justice Department announced charges Monday against Russian intelligence officers in cyberattacks that targeted a French presidential election, the Winter Olympics in South Korea and American businesses. The case implicates the same Kremlin unit that interfered in the 2016 U.S. elections, but is not related to the November vote.\n",
      "\tThe indictment accuses the six defendants, all said to be current and former officers in the Russian military intelligence agency known as the GRU, of hacks that prosecutors say were aimed at furthering the Kremlin's geopolitical interests and in destabilizing or punishing perceived enemies. All told, the attacks caused billions of dollars in losses and disrupted a broad cross-section of life, including health care in Pennsylvania, a power grid serving hundreds of thousands of customers in Ukraine and a French election that saw the late-stage disclosure of hacked emails.\n",
      "\tThe seven-count indictment is the most recent in a series of Justice Department prosecutions of Russian hackers, often working on behalf of the government. Past cases have focused on attacks against targets like internet giant Yahoo and the 2016 presidential contest, when Russian hackers from the GRU stole Democratic emails that were released online in the weeks before the election.\n",
      "\tThe attacks in this case are \"some of the most destructive, most costly, most egregious cyber attacks ever known,\" said Scott Brady, the U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Pennsylvania, where the 50-page indictment was filed.\n",
      "\t\"Time and again, Russia has made it clear: They will not abide by accepted norms, and instead, they intend to continue their destructive, destabilizing cyber behaviour,\" said FBI Deputy Director David Bowdich.\n",
      "\tThe indictment does not charge the defendants in connection with interference in American elections, though the officers are part of the same intelligence unit that prosecutors say interfered in the 2016 U.S. election. One of the six charged in the case announced Monday was among the Russian military intelligence officers charged with hacking in special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian election interference.\n",
      "\tThe timing of the indictment was unrelated to the upcoming election in the U.S., said Assistant Attorney General John Demers. He said that despite ongoing warnings of Russian interference in the election, Americans \"should be confident that a vote cast for their candidate will be counted for that candidate.\"\n",
      "\tThe hacking targets described in Monday's case are diverse, with the indictment fleshing out details about attacks that in some instances had already received significant attention because of the havoc they had caused.\n",
      "\tThe indictment accuses the officers, for instance, of hacking into the 2018 Winter Olympics in South Korea after Russia was punished by the International Olympic Committee for a vast doping conspiracy. It also says the Tokyo 2020 Olympics were targeted. Those Olympics have been postponed until next year.\n",
      "\tThe Japanese government's chief Cabinet secretary Katsunobu Kato declined to comment on specifics. \"We cannot overlook malicious cyberattacks that could shake the foundation of democracy,\" he said.\n",
      "\tTokyo 2020 in a statement said \"no significant impact has been observed in our operations.\" It said it has been taking \"countermeasures\" but declined to disclose them.\n",
      "\tProsecutors say the hackers unleashed a devastating malicious software attack during the opening ceremony in February 2018 that deleted data from thousands of computers related to the event and left them inoperable. Russia then tried to pin blame on North Korea in what prosecutors say was a failed \"false flag\" attempt.\n",
      "\tAnother attack was aimed at disrupting the 2017 presidential election in France through hacks that targeted local government entities, campaigns and political parties, including the party of current President Emmanuel Macron.\n",
      "\tThe controversy known as the \"Macron Leaks\" involved the leak of over 20,000 emails linked to Macron's campaign in the days before his victory. The involvement of bots raised questions about the possible involvement of Vladimir Putin and the Russian government. The leaks, which gained huge media attention in France, were shared by WikiLeaks and several alt-right activists on Twitter, Facebook and others.\n",
      "\tOther attacks targeted international investigators looking into the suspected nerve agent poisoning of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter in the United Kingdom, as well as the country of Georgia, where roughly 15,000 websites were defaced.\n",
      "\t\"In many cases,\" the indictment says, \"the Conspirators replaced website home pages with an image of a former Georgian president, who was known for his efforts to counter Russian influence in Georgia, along with the caption, `I'll be back.\"'\n",
      "\tBeyond that, though, the hacks had harmful impacts on quality-of-life for everyday citizens. The attacks in Ukraine, for instance, disrupted the power supply in the middle of winter for hundreds of thousands of customers, officials say.\n",
      "\tAnd the global malware attack known as NotPetya that infected computers across the world harmed the operations of the Heritage Valley Heath System, which prosecutors say serves tens of thousands of people in western Pennsylvania. Work stations were locked, hard drives encrypted, laboratory records and other files were inaccessible, and Heritage Valley temporarily lost access to critical computer systems related to medical care.\n",
      "\tRobert Lee, a security researcher who helped uncover the malware used in one of the Ukraine hacks, said U.S. and European political leaders should have done more at the time to call out Russia and make clear that attacks on power grids are unacceptable.\n",
      "\tBut Lee, CEO of security firm Dragos, also welcomed the indictment as an important message before the U.S. presidential election about American officials' resolve to fight back against attacks on elections and civic infrastructure.\n",
      "\t\"This is a broad signal from U.S. intelligence to say, `We're watching you and we're willing to burn our resources to burn your resources,\"' Lee said. \"Leading up to the election, I think that's an important signal to send.\"\n",
      "\tThe six defendants face charges including conspiracy to conduct computer fraud and abuse, wire fraud and aggravated identity theft. None is currently in custody, but the Justice Department in recent years has eagerly charged foreign hackers in absentia in countries including Russia, China and Iran with the goal of creating a message of deterrence.\n",
      "\t\"No country has weaponized its cyber capabilities as maliciously and irresponsibly as Russia, wantonly causing unprecedented collateral damage to pursue small tactical advantages as fits of spite,\" said Demers, the Justice Department's top national security official.\n",

      "\tInside the intensive care unit at Prague's Na Bulovce Hospital some patients are hooked up to ventilators through tracheostomy tubes, others are lying face down, to help them breathe. The doctors and nurses don head-to-toe hazmat suits; as coronavirus cases surge in the Czech Republic, the country can't afford to have health workers sidelined by the virus.\n",
      "\tThere are currently more new COVID-19 cases per million people recorded in the Czech Republic than in any other major country in the world. On Friday, more than 11,100 new cases were reported in a single day, a new record. In the first 17 days of October, more people have died of the virus in the Czech Republic than during the previous eight months of the epidemic combined.\n",
      "\tThe Czech Medical Chamber and the health minister have called on Czech doctors living abroad to return home to help fight the virus. Medical students and people with medical training have also been encouraged to come forward. More than 1,000 qualified nurses who've left the profession have offered to come back to help.\n",
      "\tFor now, the Na Bulovce hospital has enough beds for everyone. But it's preparing for the worst.\n",
      "\t\"We have other back-up beds prepared in other departments in case the capacity exceeds our current possibilities,\" said Dr. Hana Rohacova, the head doctor at the hospital's infection disease clinic. This weekend, the government began setting up a temporary field hospital in Prague. Czech Health Minister Dr. Roman Prymula told CNN he expects the extra beds will be needed as soon as the end of this month.\n",
      "\tIt's a stunning development. Less than two months ago, Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis boasted his country was among the \"best in COVID.\"\n",
      "\tWhile the Czech Republic is technically experiencing the second wave of the epidemic, the first one this spring looks like an insignificant blip on the radar in comparison to the current state. The Czech Republic was once one of the most successful countries in Europe at controlling the spread of the virus. Babis' populist centrist government moved quickly to close the borders and implement a nationwide lockdown. Many other countries did the same, but what set the Czechs apart was the requirement to wear face masks by everyone, everywhere outside of the home.\n",
      "\tCzech data scientist Petr Ludwig was among those pushing for that mask mandate back in mid-March, months before western health authorities or even the World Health Organization was recommending them.\n",
      "\tLudwig had just flown from New York to Prague, and says he was the only person on his flight with a face covering. When he arrived home, he dug through the scientific evidence supporting face coverings and made a YouTube video explaining why he was convinced masks were the answer. The Czech-language video attracted more than 600,000 views, in a country of only 10 million. An English version of the video has been viewed more than 5.7 million times.\n",
      "\tDays later, Babis announced the mask mandate.\n",
      "\t\"We didn't convince the government, we convinced public by [social media] influencers and then government followed because our government is slightly populist. So they followed the opinion of the public,\" Ludwig told CNN.\n",
      "\tMedical masks were in short supply at the time, which was one of the reasons why the WHO didn't recommend their use. Faced with the shortage, thousands of Czechs dusted off their sewing machines and became part of a wartime-like effort to make and distribute masks where they were needed. One group of volunteers created an interactive map of need which resulted in more than 600,000 masks, made mostly by individual volunteers, to be handed out around the country.\n",
      "\tThe Prime Minister was converted -- he even tweeted some advice to U.S. President Donald Trump on March 29, \"Try tackling virus the Czech way. Wearing a simple cloth mask, decreases the spread of the virus by 80% ... God bless America!\"\n",
      "\tMost Czechs obeyed the mask rule. The measure wasn't particularly popular with the masses, but it was wildly effective in controlling the spread of the virus. And it made the country an outlier. \"Some people from the WHO, for example, told us that this is nonsense. Many other countries around Czech Republic told us that wearing masks is nonsense. But the Czech people were doing well,\" said microbiologist Dr. Omar Sery, who was also one of the early advocates for face masks.\n",
      "\tThe Czech Republic's first wave of infection peaked in late March at 408 cases in one day. The highest single-day death toll was just 18, in April. On June 30, the Czech Republic recorded no new COVID-19 deaths. That same day, an outdoor street party in Prague celebrated the end of the pandemic. Masks were not part of the dress code. Theaters reopened, indoor dining returned, people were allowed to travel abroad. Even Babis, the Prime Minister, went to Greece for a vacation.\n",
      "\tIn almost every way, the country had regained the normalcy that people in across Europe were craving. It wouldn't last long.\n",
      "\t\"We didn't see dead people, we didn't see people with coronavirus in hospitals -- the Czech people thought that this is nonsense and we don't need to wear masks,\" said Dr. Sery.\n",
      "\tWhen the government lifted the strict mask mandate over the summer, most people left theirs at home. The virus was slowly starting to make a comeback. Even the health minister conceded his country's victory lap was premature.\n",
      "\t\"That's true, because we had many experts -- and those were not the epidemiologists and virologists -- but they were arguing that, okay, the disease is there, but it's very mild,\" said Dr. Prymula, who has been on the job now for less than a month. \"So they tried to push politicians just to skip out of strict countermeasures.\"\n",
      "\tIn August, with case-counts rising and schools set to reopen, Rastislav Madar, a top epidemiologist and the coordinator of the government's coronavirus restrictions advisory group, called for the government to re-instate the strict mask mandate that was in force in the spring. But when the then-Health Minister Adam Vojtech announced masks would again become compulsory in most indoor spaces, Babis said no. A day later, Vojtech walked back many of the new rules. Madar resigned a few days later.\n",
      "\tWith an early October Czech Senate election approaching, Ludwig thinks Babis' decision was a populist political calculation.\n",
      "\t\"During the first wave, [the government] was convinced that people wanted masks, so they pushed masks. Now, they are convinced that people don't want to wear masks. So they are against [the mask mandate],\" he said. \"After the election, they started to push some harder rules again, but it was too late because we already had an exponential growth.\"\n",
      "\tThose measures have forced schools, restaurants and pubs to close down. Masks are required in indoor public spaces and on public transport including its outdoor stops and stations, but the same strict mask mandate that seemed so effective in the spring has not been reinstated.\n",
      "\t\"In Czech Republic, everybody hates wearing a mask, really. This is not Taiwan, this is not China where they are wearing a mask every day,\" said Sery.\n",
      "\tPrymula denies the decision was political. He says there are ongoing discussions about potentially expanding the mandate to require masks outdoors too. \"But as it's not only wearing mask, it's an issue of other countermeasures, and particularly social contact, because some people still keep social contacts, even in private settings. This is the reason why the situation is still not under control,\" he said.\n",

      "\tIn a joint statement, Fitzgerald and McCormack said the book was “for the millions of fans who love the show, and also to show how that love, hope and optimism it has engendered has been channeled into real world service and action. The show was fictional, but its legacy is very real.”\n",

      "CONTENT : TORONTO -- \n",
      "\tThe diplomatic spat between Canada and China grew more heated on Monday as Beijing denounced press criticism of its ambassador to Ottawa, only to have Canada's deputy prime minister and opposition leader echo the criticism.\n",
      "\tThe exchange comes at a moment when ties between the countries are at their lowest point in years, largely due to China' outrage over Canada's detention of a top executive of Chinese telecoms giant Huawei and the subsequent arrest of two Canadians.\n",
      "\tThe new friction arose when China's ambassador to Canada, Cong Peiwu, branded pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong as violent criminals and said if Canada grants them asylum it would amount to interference in China's internal affairs.\n",
      "\t\"If the Canadian side really cares about the stability and the prosperity in Hong Kong, and really cares about the good health and safety of those 300,000 Canadian passport-holders in Hong Kong, and the large number of Canadian companies operating in Hong Kong SAR, you should support those efforts to fight violent crimes,\" Cong said in a video news conference from the Chinese Embassy in Ottawa.\n",
      "\tAsked if his remarks amounted to a threat, Cong replied, \"That is your interpretation.\"\n",
      "\tCanada's deputy prime minister, Chrystia Freeland said in Parliament on Monday that the ambassador's comments \"are not in any way in keeping with the spirit of appropriate diplomatic countries between two countries.\"\n",
      "\tFreeland said Canada will speak out for human rights in China and said Canada will support its citizens living in Hong Kong. \"Let me also reassure the 300,000 Canadians in Hong Kong that a Canadian is a Canadian and we will stand with them.\" Freeland said.\n",
      "\tHer statements came hours after Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian told reporters that his government had complained to Canada over press criticism of Cong's remarks. He said Canadian leaders \"did not verify, but also condoned the anti-China comments spreading across the nation and made groundless accusations against China.\"\n",
      "\tHe didn't specify the media criticism, but the Toronto Sun on Saturday published an editorial calling on Cong to apologize, adding. \"If he won't apologize and retract his threats, boot him back to Beijing.\"\n",
      "\tMeanwhile, Erin O'Toole, the leader of Canada's main opposition Conservative party, said Monday that Cong had threatened Canadians in Hong Kong and called on the envoy to either apologize or leave.\n",
      "\tCherie Wong, the executive director of Alliance Canada Hong Kong, a group that advocates for Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement, called Cong's comment a \"direct threat\" to all Canadians.\n",
      "\t\"It should not be lost on Canadians living in Hong Kong or China, they could be next. Ambassador Cong suggested so himself,\" Wong said.\n",
      "\tProtests against the Hong Kong and mainland Chinese governments swelled last year, and Beijing clamped down on expressions of anti-government sentiment in the city with a new national security law that took effect June 30.\n",
      "\tThe law outlaws subversive, secessionist and terrorist activity, as well as collusion with foreign powers to interfere in the city's internal affairs. The U.S., Britain and Canada accuse China of infringing on the city's freedoms.\n",
      "\tCong also rejected Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's assertion that China is engaging in coercive diplomacy by imprisoning two Canadian men in retaliation for the arrest of a Chinese Huawei executive on an American extradition warrant. The executive, Meng Wanzhou, is living under house arrest in Vancouver while her case wends through a British Columbia court.\n",
      "\tIn December 2018, China imprisoned two Canadian men, Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, and charged them with undermining China's national security. Convicted Canadian drug smuggler Robert Schellenberg was also sentenced to death in a sudden retrial shortly after Meng's arrest.\n",

      "\tThe Indian army said it apprehended a Chinese soldier Monday in the remote Ladakh region, where the two countries are locked in a monthslong military standoff along their disputed mountain border.\n",
      "\tThe soldier, Cpl. Wang Ya Long from China's People's Liberation Army, was apprehended inside Indian-controlled Ladakh's Demchok area and was to be released soon, the army said in a statement.\n",
      "\tIt said the soldier \"had strayed\" across the de facto border along the eastern section of what's known as the Line of Actual Control, a loose demarcation separating Indian- and Chinese-controlled areas.\n",
      "\t\"As per established protocols, he will be returned back to Chinese officials at the Chushul--Moldo meeting point after completion of formalities,\" the statement said.\n",
      "\tChina did not immediately comment on the soldier's apprehension.\n",
      "\tThe high-altitude standoff between the Asian giants began in early May with a fierce brawl, and exploded into hand-to-hand combat with clubs, stones and fists on June 15 that left 20 Indian soldiers dead. China is believed to also have had casualties, but has not given any details.\n",
      "\tChina detained at least 10 Indian soldiers, including four officers, following the deadly brawl. They were returned three days later after intense military and diplomatic negotiations.\n",
      "\tThe Indian army statement Monday said the Indian side had received an inquiry from China's military \"about the whereabouts of the missing soldier.\"\n",
      "\tThe soldier \"has been provided medical assistance including oxygen, food and warm clothes to protect him from the vagaries of extreme altitude and harsh climatic conditions,\" the statement said.\n",
      "\tIndia and China have each stationed tens of thousands of soldiers backed by artillery, tanks and fighter jets and are bracing for a harsh winter in the cold-desert region, where temperatures can fall to minus 50 degrees Celsius (minus 58 Fahrenheit).\n",
      "\tThe nuclear-armed rivals have accused each other of crossing into rival territory and of firing shots for the first time in 45 years.\n",
      "\tThe sides have held several rounds of talks by military, diplomatic and political officials, including negotiations between their foreign ministers and defence ministers in Moscow last month. Although the standoff has persisted, the talks seem to have calmed the situation along the border, with no new military aggression reported for over a month now.\n",
      "\tThe fiercely contested Line of Actual Control separates Chinese-held and Indian-held territories from Ladakh in the west to India's eastern state of Arunachal Pradesh, which China claims in its entirety. It is broken in parts where the Himalayan nations of Nepal and Bhutan border China.\n",
      "\tIndia claims the Chinese-controlled Aksai Chin plateau as part of the Ladakh region.\n",
      "\tAccording to India, the control line is 3,488 kilometres (2,167 miles) long, while China says it is considerably shorter. The line divides the areas of physical control rather than territorial claims.\n",
      "\tRelations between the two countries have often been strained, partly due to their undemarcated border. They fought a border war in 1962 that spilled into Ladakh and ended in an uneasy truce. Since then, troops have guarded the undefined border and occasionally brawled. They have agreed not to attack each other with firearms.\n",
      "\tIndia unilaterally declared Ladakh a federal territory and separated it from disputed Kashmir in August 2019, ending Indian-administered Kashmir's semi-autonomous status. It also vowed to take back the Aksai Chin plateau.\n",
      "\tChina was among the first countries to strongly condemn the move, raising it at international forums including the U.N. Security Council.\n",

      "\tJapanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga, in his first overseas summit since taking office last month, agreed with his Vietnamese counterpart to step up defence and security co-operation in the face of China's expanding influence in the region.\n",
      "\tIn talks in Hanoi on Monday, Suga and Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc set a basic agreement allowing Japan to export defence equipment and technology to Vietnam. Japan has been pursuing such pacts in recent years to bolster ties with Southeast Asia and sustain its own defence industry.\n",
      "\tSuga said his four-day trip to Vietnam and later Indonesia was key to pursuing multilateral economic and security co-operation to counter China's growing power and protect sea lanes in disputed areas of the South China Sea.\n",
      "\t\"Vietnam is crucial to achieving our vision of `the Free and Open Indo-Pacific,' and our valuable partner,\"' Suga told a news conference after his meeting with Phuc. \"Japan, as an Indo-Pacific nation, will continue to contribute to the peace and stability in this region.\"\n",
      "\tSuga said Vietnam, at the centre of the region, was the most suitable destination for his first trip abroad as Japan's leader.\n",
      "\tNeither of the two leaders mentioned China by name in their news conference. Phuc said the peace and stability of the South China Sea should be protected by the rule of law, not unilaterally by force or threats.\n",
      "\t\"Vietnam appreciates that Japan, one of the world's leading powers, is actively contributing its efforts to maintain peace and stability in the region and in the world,\" Phuc said.\n",
      "\tIn a speech later Monday at Vietnam-Japan University, Suga said that Japan's \"Free and Open Indo-Pacific\" concept and \"ASEAN Outlook on the Indo-Pacific,\" formulated by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations in 2019, share values such as rule of law, openness, transparency and freedom.\n",
      "\tSuga expressed strong support for their vision and said together Japan and ASEAN can achieve a peaceful and prosperous future.\n",
      "\t\"Unfortunately in this region, there is a move in the South China Sea that goes against the rule of law and openness stated in this ASEAN Outlook, and Japan strongly opposes any attempt that escalates tensions in the South China Sea,\" Suga said in his speech, hinting at China's growing assertiveness in the area.\n",
      "\tJapan already has defence equipment transfer deals with the U.S., Britain and Malaysia, among other countries. Vietnam is a 12th partner, while Japan is still negotiating deals with Indonesia and Thailand. In its first actual delivery of such exports, Japan in August exported a radar surveillance system to the Philippines.\n",
      "\tDetails of possible equipment sales were not mentioned, but Suga called the agreement \"a major step\" for a bilateral defenceco-operation, saying he expects further developments.\n",
      "\tJapan partially lifted its ban on military equipment and technology transfer in 2014 as part of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's efforts to build Japan's defence capabilities.\n",
      "\tSuga and Phuc signed other agreements to co-operate in a range of economic fields and on anti-terrorism measures.\n",
      "\tThe two sides also agreed to ease entry bans and allow short-term business visits and reopen flights between Vietnam and Japan. Such travel has been very tightly restricted due to the pandemic, but both countries have managed to somewhat stabilize COVID-19 outbreaks.\n",
      "\tSuga also promised to provide support for Vietnamese workers in Japan affected by the pandemic's hit to the economy. Vietnamese accounts for more than half of the foreign workers Japan has accepted in recent years to make up for its declining and aging population.\n",
      "\tJapan is one of Vietnam's top trading partners with two-way trade of $28.6 billion so far this year. Japan is also Vietnam's largest overseas aid donor, providing $23 billion as of 2019 and accounting for more than a quarter of Vietnam's foreign loans.\n",
      "\tThe government has been trying to entice Japanese companies to invest in Vietnam and other Southeast Asian countries to lessen Japan's dependence on manufacturing and other businesses in China.\n",
      "\tOn Monday, Japan and Vietnam agreed on the need to co-operate on diversifying supply chains -- a lesson Japan learned from its dire shortages of surgical masks and protective gowns earlier this year due to heavy dependence on Chinese imports.\n",
      "\tIn August, Vietnam agreed to buy six coast guard patrol boats worth $345 million from Japan. The country is seeking to improve its maritime defences amid China's continuing development and militarization of artificial islands in contested waters of the South China Sea.\n",
      "\tProgress in talks between ASEAN and China over the disputes appears to be at a standstill.\n",
      "\tSuga's predecessor Abe also chose Vietnam as the first country he visited after taking office. Suga is the first foreign head of a state to visit Vietnam since the country closed its borders to contain COVID-19.\n",

      "\tChina's shaky economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic is gaining strength as consumers return to shopping malls and auto dealerships while the United States and Europe endure painful contractions.\n",
      "\tThe world's second-largest economy expanded by 4.9% over a year ago in the three months ending in September, official data showed Monday. Retail spending rebounded to above pre-virus levels for the first time and factory output rose, boosted by demand for exports of masks and other medical supplies.\n",
      "\tThe recovery is broadening out and becoming less reliant on government stimulus, Julian Evans-Pritchard of Capital Economics said in a report. He said growth is \"still accelerating\" heading into the present quarter.\n",
      "\tChina, where the pandemic began in December, became the first major economy to return to growth after the ruling Communist Party declared the disease under control in March and began reopening factories, shops and offices.\n",
      "\tIt is the only major economy that is expected to grow this year while activity in the United States, Europe and Japan shrinks.\n",
      "\tThe Chinese economy expanded by 3.2% over a year earlier in the three months ending in June, rebounding from the previous quarter's 6.8% contraction, its worst performance since at least the mid-1960s.\n",
      "\tThe economy \"continued the steady recovery,\" the National Bureau of Statistics said in a report. However, it warned, \"the international environment is still complicated and severe.\" It said China faces great pressure to prevent a resurgence of the virus.\n",
      "\tAuthorities have lifted curbs on travel and business but visitors to government and other public buildings still are checked for the virus's telltale fever. Travelers arriving from abroad must be quarantined for two weeks.\n",
      "\tLast week, more than 10 million people were tested for the virus in the eastern port of Qingdao after 12 cases were found there. That broke a two-month streak with no virus transmissions reported within China.\n",

      "\tRetail sales rose 0.9% over a year earlier. That was up from a 7.2% contraction in the first half as consumers, already anxious about a slowing economy and a tariff war with Washington, put off buying. Online commerce rose 15.3%.\n",

      "\tEconomists say China is likely to recover faster than other major economies due to the ruling party's decision to impose the most intensive anti-disease measures in history. Those temporarily cut off most access to cities with a total of 60 million people.\n",
      "\tThe International Monetary Fund is forecasting China's economic growth at 1.8% this year while the U.S. economy is expected to shrink by 4.3%. The IMF expects a 9.8% contraction in France, 6% in Germany and 5.3% in Japan.\n",

      "\tThe decision to cancel the results of Sunday's vote was made to \"prevent tension,\" Central Election Commission head Nurzhan Shaildabekova told the Interfax news agency.\n",

      "\tThe violent crackdown failed to halt the unrest, however, and protesters broke into the government complex that houses both parliament and the president's office. A fire broke out in the parliament building but was quickly extinguished, and local media reported some offices were looted.\n",
      "\tOther protesters went to Kyrgyzstan's State Committee of National Security, demanding to free former President Almazbek Atambayev, who was convicted on corruption charges earlier this year and sentenced to over 11 years in prison.

      "\t\"I call on all (political) forces to put the fate of the country above their political ambitions and return to (acting) within the law,\" he said.\n",
      "\tSeveral opposition parties formed what they called a co-ordination council to facilitate a transition of power, while several others refused to recognize the council as a legitimate body representing the opposition.\n",
      "\tThe mayors of Bishkek and Jalal-Abad, the country's third-largest city, resigned. The country's Finance Ministry issued a statement on its website, saying that it \"recognized the power of the people\" and halted all of its financial operations \"until further notice from the legitimate authorities.\"\n",
      "\tParliament announced an emergency session to discuss the crisis. Local media reported that lawmakers failed to get a quorum, but a few dozen of them gathered anyway and, with proxy votes from other lawmakers, approved new appointments to some top government posts.\n",

      "\tCanada put health-care workers at risk of contracting COVID-19 and taking it home to their families because it failed to learn lessons from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome in 2003, a new report says.\n",
      "\tMario Possamai, who authored the report and was senior adviser to a two-year commission on SARS, outlines multiple shortcomings by the Public Health Agency of Canada.\n",
      "\tThe agency was established to respond to emerging infectious diseases after an early recommendation by the commission investigating how the SARS epidemic that killed 44 people arrived in Canada and spread.\n",
      "\tHundreds of people died of SARS elsewhere, including in China and Taiwan. However, Possamai says in the report released Monday that unlike Canada, those countries heeded the warnings from SARS, which he calls \"a dress rehearsal for COVID-19.\"\n",
      "\t\"In COVID-19, Canada is witnessing a systemic, preventable failure to learn from the 2003 SARS outbreak,\" he says. \"It is a failure to both adequately prepare and to urgently respond in a manner that is commensurate with the gravest public health emergency in a century.\"\n",
      "\tPossamai says in the report, titled \"A Time of Fear: How Canada Failed Our Health-Care Workers and Mismanaged COVID-19,\" that the safety of workers, from those in long-term care homes to respiratory technicians and nurses and doctors in hospitals, has been ignored.\n",
      "\tIt says union sources suggest 16 workers died of the pandemic, though official reports put the number at 12 deaths.\n",
      "\tCanada's infection rate among health-care workers is four times that of China, the report says.\n",
      "\tWhile other countries, including the United States, have fared worse than Canada in containing COVID-19, they managed to escape SARS and did not have the opportunity to learn from it, Possamai says in the report, which was commissioned by the Canadian Federation of Nurses' Unions to evaluate the first wave of the pandemic.\n",
      "\t\"A significant systemic problem during COVID-19, as it was during SARS, is that health-care workers and unions were not seen by governments and public health agencies as collaborative partners in setting safety guidelines and procedures,\" Possamai says, adding that is still the case as parts of Canada enter a second wave of the disease.\n",
      "\tPrime Minister Justin Trudeau said front-line health-care workers across the country have done extraordinary work in incredibly difficult circumstances.\n",
      "\t\"Of course, as we look back on those first months there are a lot of things we could have done differently, we should have done differently and things we were learning from,\" he told a news conference in Ottawa.\n",
      "\t\"But at the same time, I will say that many of the things that we were able to do successfully in those first months of the COVID-19 pandemic were based on lessons learned from SARS.\"\n",
      "\tTrudeau said the government will consider the report to determine what more can be learned.\n",
      "\tPossamai says precious time was wasted as infections among health-care workers rose and the so-called precautionary principle, which aims to reduce risk of infection without waiting for scientific certainty, was not adopted as a lesson from the SARS commission.\n",
      "\tQuestions about whether COVID-19 was airborne resulted in some health-care workers being denied N95 respirators in place of surgical masks and other personal protective equipment has also been lacking. The report says that was not the case in China, Hong Kong and Taiwan, which also endured SARS.\n",
      "\tPossamai makes several recommendations, including that federal, provincial and territorial governments pass legislation requiring their chief medical health officers to report annually on the state of their jurisdiction's public health emergency preparedness and for the top doctors in each jurisdiction to be empowered to make recommendations addressing any shortcomings.\n",
      "\tHe also calls for the addition of occupational hygienists as well as safety and aerosol experts to the Public Health Agency of Canada and for provincial health and for provincial labour ministries to act independently from health ministries to enforce workplace health and safety measures.\n",
      "\tLinda Silas, president of the Canadian Federation of Nurses Unions, said it was only after pressure from nurses and doctors and ultimately from federal Health Minister Patti Hadju in February that the public health agency began weekly calls with the health sector, including psychologists and dentists, on guidelines.\n",
      "\tHowever, she said unions are still not involved in developing those guidelines and how they should be used in practice. \"That's the gist of the mistake,\" Silas said.\n",
      "\t\"It is always a joint responsibility between the employer and the union,\" she said of occupational health and safety issues.\n",
      "\tDr. Sandy Buchman, past president of the Canadian Medical Association who finished his one-year term in August, said he worked as a family doctor in Mississauga, Ont., during the SARS outbreak and remembers lining up to get into a hospital before being screened and wearing personal protective equipment when seeing patients.\n",
      "\tThe level of anxiety among health-care workers now is no comparison to that outbreak, Buchman said, adding he was shocked to learn Canada did not have enough personal protective equipment for a pandemic after the SARS commission recommended to stockpile it.\n",
      "\t\"What can I say? It's still kind of incomprehensible to me that we weren't prepared for a pandemic when it was a such a thorough report,\" he said of the commission's findings, which were released in 2007.\n",
      "\t\"My sense was, and it still is, that somehow the government expected front-line workers to put themselves in harm's way, without having adequate PPE. It's like expecting a firefighter to go into a burning building without the proper equipment to protect them.\"\n",

      "\tAgricultural officials in Washington state said Friday they are trying to find and destroy a nest of Asian giant hornets - also known as murder hornets - amid concerns they could kill honey bees crucial for pollinating raspberry and blueberry crops.\n",
      "\tEvidence of six of the hornets were found over the last week near the town of Blaine in Whatcom County, the Washington state Department of Agriculture told reporters.\n",
      "\tThe number of hornets found - nearly double the previous number discovered in the state - would indicate a nest has been established in the area, the agency said. One of the hornets was trapped alive, a first for the agency, spokeswoman Karla Salp said.\n",
      "\t“We believe we are dealing with a nest,” said Sven-Erik Spichiger, a department entomologist. “We hope to locate the nest in a couple of weeks and eradicate it.”\n",
      "\tThe Asian giant hornet - the world's largest at 2 inches (5 centimetres) - can decimate entire hives of honeybees and deliver painful stings to humans. Farmers in the northwestern U.S. depend on those honey bees to pollinate many crops.\n",
      "\tThe invasive insect found in China, Japan, Thailand, South Korea, Vietnam and other Asian countries was first documented in Washington state late last year. Officials have said it's not known how it arrived. Washington and the Canadian province of British Columbia are the only places the hornets have been found in North America.\n",
      "\tThere have been reports from Asia of the hornets stinging people so often they have died.\n",
      "\tDespite their name, the hornets kill at most a few dozen people a year in Asia, and experts say it is probably far less. Hornets, wasps and bees typically found in the United States kill an average of 62 people a year, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said.\n",
      "\tThe real threat from the hornets is their devastating attacks on honeybee hives, and the time of year when they attack those hives is nearing, Spichiger said. He called it the “slaughter phase.”\n",
      "\tA state scientist managed to trap one live Asian giant hornet near Blaine in recent days and officials tried to glue a radio tag to it so they could follow the hornet back to its nest, Spichiger said.\n",
      "\tBut the glue did not dry fast enough, the radio tag fell off and the hornet ultimately could not fly, Spichiger said. Scientists hope to capture another live hornet and try again.\n",
      "\tPeople living in the Blaine area have been reporting sightings of the hornets to agricultural officials.\n",
      "\tThere is also evidence that the giant hornets are also attacking native wasps and hornets, Spichiger said.\n",
      "\tFifteen of the hornets have been found since they were first seen in the state in 2019, the agriculture department said.\n",

      "\tThe head of emergencies at the World Health Organization said Monday the agency's \"best estimates\" indicate roughly 1 in 10 people worldwide may have been infected by the coronavirus -- more than 20 times the number of confirmed cases -- and warned of a difficult period ahead.\n",
      "\tDr. Michael Ryan, speaking to a special session of the WHO's 34-member executive board focusing on COVID-19, said the figures vary from urban to rural areas, and between different groups, but that ultimately it means \"the vast majority of the world remains at risk.\" He said the pandemic would continue to evolve, but that tools exist to suppress transmission and save lives.\n",
      "\t\"Many deaths have been averted and many more lives can be protected,\" Ryan said. He was flanked by his boss, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who minutes earlier led a moment of silence to honour victims, as well as a round of applause for the health workers who have strived to save them.\n",
      "\tRyan said southeast Asia faced a surge in cases, Europe and the eastern Mediterranean were seeing an increase, while the situations in Africa and the Western Pacific were \"rather more positive.\" Overall, though, he said the world was \"heading into a difficult period.\"\n",
      "\t\"The disease continues to spread. It is on the rise in many parts of the world,\" Ryan told attendees from governments who make up the executive board and provide much of the WHO's funding. \"Our current best estimates tell us that about 10 per cent of the global population may have been infected by this virus.\"\n",
      "\tThe estimate -- which would amount to more than 760 million people based on a current world population of about 7.6 billion -- far outstrips the number of confirmed cases as tallied by both the WHO and Johns Hopkins University, now more than 35 million worldwide. Experts have long said that the number of confirmed cases greatly undershoots the true figure.\n",
      "\tRyan did not elaborate on the estimate. Dr. Margaret Harris, a WHO spokeswoman, said it was based on an average of antibody studies conducted around the world. She said the estimated 90 per cent of people remaining without infection means the virus has \"opportunity\" to spread further \"if we don't take action to stop it\" such as by contact-tracing and tracking of cases by health officials.\n",
      "\tTedros, during his remarks, said: \"What we have learned in every region of the world is that with strong leadership, clear and comprehensive strategies, consistent communication, and engaged, empowered and enabled population, it's never too late ... Every situation can be turned around -- and hard-won gains can be easily lost.\"\n",
      "\t\"The pandemic underlines the fundamental importance of investing in public health and primary health care,\" said Tedros, wearing a stylish black, red and yellow mask. Tedros had not worn a mask during scores of COVID-19 press conferences he led at WHO headquarters this year.\n",
      "\tThe comments came during a special session of the executive board to consider the follow-up to its previous meeting, in May, that passed a resolution to look into the world's -- and WHO's -- response to the pandemic, among other things.\n",
      "\tThe two-day meeting is the first by the executive board since the Trump administration set off a one-year countdown this summer toward pulling the United States out of the WHO next July. President Donald Trump, who himself has been infected by COVID-19, has repeatedly accused the WHO of being too accepting of China's explanations of its handling of the outbreak in Wuhan late last year.\n",
      "\tOn a far more conciliatory tone, Assistant Secretary of Health Brett Giroir, the U.S. representative on the board, told the meeting by videoconference that the United States \"looks forward to working together to defeat this pandemic and move our people and economics back to normalcy.\"\n",
      "\tGiroir also pressed WHO -- albeit gently -- to clear up its relationship with the Chinese government. He said a \"key mandate\" from the resolution in May was its call for a joint mission involving the WHO, the World Organization for Animal Health, and the U.N.'s Food and Agricultural Organization to look into the animal origins of the virus and its transmission to humans.\n",
      "\tA two-person advance team for that mission has visited China, but a fuller mission isn't ready. Giroir said it was \"critical\" that WHO member states receive regular and timely updates about the mission and its \"terms of reference\" -- an allusion to working guidelines that detail just how much access the mission's members will have in China.\n",
      "\tChinese board member Zhang Yang, speaking by videoconference, said China has been \"transparent and responsible\" and has been fulfilling its responsibilities under the resolution. She said it had been communicating regularly with the WHO and keeping up its financial commitments to the U.N. agency.\n",
      "\tBoard member Clemens Auer of Austria lamented a \"political weakening\" of the WHO, citing the \"potential withdrawal of a strong WHO member state\" -- an allusion to the U.S. He appealed for a \"retreat session\" for board members, saying it should be an \"active\" body -- not a \"ceremonial\" one. U.S. representative Giroir expressed support for that idea.\n",

      "\tIn the midst of the summer scramble to get courses online at Memorial University in St. John's, Sonja Knutson realized there were political implications to remote learning she hadn't considered.\n",
      "\tA Memorial student living in Iran couldn't buy an e-book for a course because Iranians don't have access to major credit cards, Knutson, director of the university's office for international students, said. The student dropped the course.\n",
      "\tKnutson and her colleagues realized there could be a host of similar problems involving Memorial's international students, many of whom are taking courses remotely because of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n",
      "\tThe school's efforts to ensure a smooth transition to remote learning had a political blind spot, she said in a recent interview. \"The same curriculum that we could deliver privately in the classroom is now going to be subject to monitoring in countries around the world.\"\n",
      "\tShe said she flagged the issue to university officials, who sent a memo to instructors before classes began encouraging them to offer alternative course content for students who live in \"authoritarian\" states.\n",
      "\t\"This is not a call to censor the course material or guide assessments: critically exploring issues and topics deemed by authoritarian states as problematic are a keystone of the role that a university plays in supporting a democratic society and developing engaged citizens,\" the memo said.\n",
      "\tRui Hou, an expert in surveillance and authoritarian politics, said when he was at Queen's University, a few of his colleagues faced similar issues with international students.\n",
      "\tNow a postdoctoral fellow at the Munk School of Global Affairs' Asian Institute, Hou said his Queen's colleagues were asking him to help them provide course material to students in China.\n",
      "\tChina monitors its citizens' use of the internet and blocks content from sites such as Facebook and YouTube. Sensitive material such as nudes or violence is also blocked.\n",
      "\tHou suggests professors upload PDFs to their university's online learning systems for students to download directly, but notes that video will still be a challenge -- China's firewall system makes internet download speeds excruciatingly slow.\n",
      "\tProfessors, he said, should not encourage their students in China to use virtual private networks, which are encyrpted internet connections. VPNs, Hou explained, have a complicated legal status in the country, though he said he doesn't know of any students being punished for using one.\n",
      "\t\"It is not wise to adjust the course materials for Chinese students,\" he said in an email. Instead, he said, teachers should be very clear about what's in the course so students can assess the risk themselves.\n",
      "\tProfessors who teach social movements can't avoid including material on the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests in Beijing and the ensuing massacre, he explained. The Chinese state violence in 1989 is \"100 per cent sensitive content in China's censorship policy.\"\n",
      "\t\"In this way, instructors of different courses may find they are influenced by China's censorship on different levels.\"\n",
      "\tThe University of Toronto and the University of British Columbia also sent memos to instructors before the school year began. The University of Toronto asked its faculty to share a message with students explaining that online course material can violate local law.\n",
      "\tUBC encouraged instructors to include a statement on their course syllabi explaining the material could contain content that is censored by \"non-Canadian governments.\"\n",
      "\t\"This may include, but is not limited to, human rights, representative government, defamation, obscenity, gender or sexuality, and historical or current geopolitical controversies,\" the statement said. It asks students to consider postponing the course until they are back in Canada.\n",

      "\tGary Bowser, 51, is one of three people named in a federal indictment that was unsealed on Friday following an investigation by the Department of Homeland Security and the FBI.\n",
      "\tThe U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) alleges that Bowser and his co-accused – Max Louarn of France and Yuanning Chen of China – were \"leaders of one of the world's most notorious videogame piracy groups, Team Xecuter.\"\n",
      "\tAccording to a DOJ statement, Team Xecuter targeted the Xbox, PlayStation Classic and several Nintendo platforms creating and selling devices for each that \"hacked\" the consoles so that they could run pirated software.\n",
      "\t“These defendants lined their pockets by stealing and selling the work of other video-game developers – even going so far as to make customers pay a licensing fee to play stolen games,” said U.S. Attorney Brian Moran in the DOJ statement.\n",
      "\t“This conduct doesn’t just harm billion dollar companies, it hijacks the hard work of individuals working to advance in the video-game industry.”\n",
      "\tThe DOJ claims that Bowser, Louarn and Chen are only three of \"more than a dozen\" people involved in the design, production, and sale of Team Xecuter's devices.\n",
      "\tAlthough these devices were sometimes marketed as being for avid gamers who wanted to design their own games for personal use, prosecutors allege that piracy was the goal of the \"overwhelming\" majority of their users. The group also allegedly boosted demand for their products by creating and supporting \"libraries of pirated videogames\" and preloading their devices with some of these copies.\n",
      "\tBowser, a Canadian citizen, was arrested in the Dominican Republic and appeared in court in New Jersey on Friday. Chen is already in custody in the U.S., while Louarn was arrested outside the country and attempts will be made to extradite him for prosecution.\n",

      "\tTwo months after Canada lost the election to the United Nations Security Council, the country's new ambassador was there anyway, speaking frankly about the Syrian civil war. He wasn't making many new friends.\n",
      "\tBob Rae, the career politician appointed as Canada's new UN envoy in New York, was addressing a special session of the UN's most powerful body this past Tuesday, on behalf of Australia and New Zealand.\n",
      "\tRussia intervened in Syria's nine-year-old civil war in 2015, to support a longtime ally while prolonging a conflict that has left 400,000 people dead.\n",
      "\tRussia is also one of the five permanent members of the Security Council, with China, the United States, Britain and France.\n",
      "\tThat has allowed Russia to wield a veto that has largely paralyzed the council in preventing further suffering in Syria.\n",
      "\t\"It was a tough discussion with the Russians. They were not happy with us. But they have to know where you stand,\" Rae said in an interview from New York this past week.\n",
      "\t\"Being a diplomat doesn't mean you have nothing to say.\"\n",
      "\tFew, especially Rae's fiercest critics, would accuse the 72-year-old career politician of having little to say.\n",
      "\tThat has not changed since Rae arrived in New York in August, to replace Marc-Andre Blanchard, a diplomatic shuffle that occurred after Canada lost its bid for a two-year stint on the council to Ireland and Norway in mid-June.\n",
      "\tThe loss thumped the morale of Canadian diplomats but Rae said no one was preoccupied with it when he arrived in late summer.\n",
      "\t\"It's over. And the other reality is that the Security Council has not exactly been a beacon of leadership and decision-making in the last while,\" he said.\n",
      "\tCanada's UN work is continuing, with Rae pushing forward the same agenda the country unsuccessfully campaigned on to win a council seat: working with other countries and international organizations to help rebuild a global economy that has been battered by COVID-19.\n",
      "\tThis past week, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, his Jamaican counterpart Andrew Holness, and UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres convened the second major meeting of the UN's High-Level Event on Financing for Development in the Era of COVID-19 and Beyond. It featured numerous world leaders and heads of major international organizations, including the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.\n",
      "\tThey first met in late May, less than three weeks before the Security Council vote.\n",
      "\tRae said the council is \"not functioning as well as it needs to\" so other countries, including Canada, are forming other alliances. \"The Canada-Jamaican initiative is an example of that. Countries just say, 'If we're not going to get any leadership from there, we better figure out where it's going to come from.\"'\n",
      "\tBefore arriving in New York, Rae tabled a report for the prime minister on his work as envoy on refugee and humanitarian issues, an appointment he accepted in January.\n",
      "\tIt is a sweeping document that reads like a foreign-policy manifesto. It calls for a co-ordinated response to the pandemic, forced displacement and higher spending on foreign aid.\n",
      "\tForeign Affairs Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne said Rae's insights as well as his most recent work as a special envoy for the government on the crises in Myanmar and on global migration will make him effective at the UN.\n",
      "\t\"Certainly, Ambassador Rae's experience and knowledge comes at an important time in how we see the world. Pax Americana is probably behind us,\" Champagne said in an interview.\n",
      "\t\"Now we need to see what's our interests, our values and our principles. We can advance them with our traditional partners, and also with new alliances around the world.\"\n",
      "\tRae's report highlights Canada's continually low spending on foreign aid, something that appeared to be addressed this week when Trudeau announced an added $400 million to the budget in his event with Holness and Guterres.\n",
      "\t\"The numbers speak for themselves. And I think it's important for us to, to continue to deal with that as Canadians. It's not just an issue of one government or another, if you look back historically. It's an issue that really transcends political parties,\" said Rae.\n",
      "\tIn his report, Rae noted \"Canada has never come close\" to the UN benchmark on aid spending that was established by former Canadian prime minister Lester Pearson: 0.7 per cent of gross national income.\n",
      "\tAfter having been an MP, NDP premier in Ontario, interim leader of the federal Liberals and the party's foreign-policy critic, he feels he has come full circle. His father, Saul, spent 40 years in Canada's foreign service, serving stints as UN ambassador in New York and Geneva.\n",
      "\t\"I grew up in that household and I grew up thinking about foreign policy and Canada's place in the world. So, I never lost interest in it.\"\n",
      "\tRae said his new diplomatic career is also informed his experience dealing with the crisis in Myanmar that forced 700,000 Rohingya Muslims to flee to neighbouring Bangladesh in 2017 after their country's military killed, raped and burned villages.\n",
      "\tRae visited Cox's Bazar in Bangladesh, a town that has become the world's largest refugee outpost, and has publicly pushed the government to do more to help. He has also consulted on a case in the International Court of Justice that is trying to bring the perpetrators of genocide to justice.\n",
      "\t\"I think it's important for us to really appreciate just how really, really difficult life is for a lot of people: the combination of climate and disease and political conflict -- the pain that is inflicted on people,\" he said.\n",
      "\t\"When you see things first hand and experience it, you come to understand it,\" Rae added. \"When I hear speeches about this, or that, denying the reality of certain situations, you just sort of say, 'well, no, that's just not true.\"'\n",

      "\tNorth Korean leader Kim Jong Un on Saturday sent a message of sympathy to President Donald Trump and his wife Melania, wishing they would recover from the COVID-19 illness, state media reported.\n",
      "\t“He sincerely hoped that they would recover as soon as possible. He hoped they will surely overcome it,” the Korean Central News Agency reported. “He sent warm greetings to them.”\n",
      "\tTrump said Friday he and his wife had tested positive for the coronavirus, and leaders across the world have sent messages of goodwill to the couple.\n",
      "\tKim and Trump once exchanged threats of destruction and crude insults after North Korea in 2017 carried out a series of high-profile weapons tests aimed at acquiring ability to launch nuclear strikes on the U.S. mainland. Trump had said he would rain “fire and fury” on North Korea and derided Kim as “little rocket man” on a suicide mission, while Kim responded he would “tame the mentally deranged U.S. dotard with fire.”\n",
      "\tBut they stopped such rhetoric and instead developed a personal relationship after Kim abruptly reached out to Trump in 2018 for talks on the fate of his advancing nuclear arsenal.\n",
      "\tThey met three times in 2018-2019, starting with a summit in Singapore that made Trump the first sitting U.S. president to meet a North Korea leader since the end of the 1950-53 Korean War. But their meetings made little headway since their second summit in Vietnam in early 2019 ended without any deal following disputes over U.S.-led sanctions on North Korea.\n",
      "\tBefore their nuclear talks entered a stalemate, Trump said that he and Kim “fell in love.” According to journalist Bob Woodward's recently published book “Rage,” Kim, in a letter to Trump, called the U.S. president “your excellency” and said he believed the “deep and special friendship between us will work as a magical force.”\n",
      "\tSome observers said Trump's coronavirus diagnosis would quell speculation that the two leaders could have planned an “October surprise” in arranging their fourth meeting ahead of the U.S. presidential election in November.\n",
      "\tDespite the deadlocked talks, Kim hasn't lifted his self-imposed moratorium on nuclear and long-range missile tests in an apparent effort to keep chances for diplomacy alive. North Korea's economy is believed to have worsened due to the sanctions and the pandemic that forced it to close its border with China, its biggest trading partner, in January.\n",
      "\tNorth Korea has said there hasn't been a single virus outbreak on its soil, a claim widely disputed by foreign experts.\n",

      "CONTENT : TOKYO -- \n",
      "\tThe only thing more difficult than staging next year's Tokyo Olympics in a pandemic might be convincing sponsors to keep their billions of dollars on board in the midst of economic turbulence and skepticism.\n",
      "\tTo make the point this week, IOC President Thomas Bach will join a number of Japanese government and city officials, local organizers and other top International Olympic Committee leaders in repeating a message they've failed to convey forcefully enough to deep-pocketed sponsors: Trust us, the Tokyo Olympics will open on July 23, 2021.\n",
      "\tBach and IOC vice-president John Coates -- who oversees Tokyo preparations -- are expected to speak remotely to Japanese officials as they meet on Thursday and Friday. The agenda includes plotting countermeasures against COVID-19: quarantines, rules for athletes entering the country, testing, vaccines and the presence or absence of fans.\n",
      "\tFew firm details are expected until late in the year or early in 2021, which accounts for the uncertainty.\n",
      "\tThe subtext is assuring sponsors that the Olympics will happen. Tokyo organizing committee CEO Toshiro Muto has acknowledged the word's not getting out.\n",
      "\t\"The fact the Olympics are going to take place -- the fact itself -- is not fully distributed to the public,\" Muto, speaking in Japanese, said last week. \"People need to be more convinced that, yes, the Olympics will be taking place for sure.\"\n",
      "\tA former deputy governor of the Bank of Japan, Muto has been vague about how many domestic sponsors are renewing their contracts. He says of the 68 sponsors: \"They are all positive.\"\n",
      "\t\"We're still in the middle of negotiations. We're not in the phase of speaking about any concrete results,\" he said.\n",
      "\tSurveys have shown a majority of Japanese companies and the pubic don't think the Olympics will happen next year -- or should happen. A poll published in June by Japanese broadcaster NHK said two-thirds of sponsors were undecided about extending for another year.\n",
      "\tKeeping domestic sponsors on board is financially critical. Recruited by the giant Japanese advertising agency Dentsu Inc., domestic sponsors have paid a record $3.3 billion -- at least twice any previous Olympics -- to the local organizing committee. This is over and above a dozen permanent Olympic sponsors who have signed long-term with the IOC. Some also have individual contracts with Tokyo organizers.\n",
      "\tJohn Grady, who teaches sports law at the University of South Carolina, said the postponement has \"created countless problems and ripple effects.\"\n",
      "\t\"With the uncertainty of the Tokyo Games occurring with few or limited fans, local sponsors would be right to be cautious in investing more sponsorship dollars if they cannot reach fans on site,\" Grady wrote in an email to The Associated Press. \"The lack of a wider international fan base that is typical at an Olympics would shrink the global audience who has access to seeing local sponsors' activation efforts around Olympic venues in the host city.\"\n",
      "\tDespite the uncertainty, it will be difficult for sponsors to step away in a country where conformity and teamwork are valued and national loyalty could be called into question.\n",
      "\tJapan also has a long history of supporting the Olympics, and many in decision-making roles recall fondly the positive impact of the 1964 Tokyo Games, which showed the country's rebirth just 19 years after defeat in World War II.\n",
      "\t\"There's a strong underlying narrative that this event is really good for the country,\" Robin Kietlinski, who teaches and researches Japanese sports and history at LaGuardia Community College in New York, said in an interview with the AP.\n",
      "\t\"I think there is almost historic pressure to have it go smoothly and to benefit Japan in some way,\" she added. \"Whether that's financially, or whether that is getting their companies seen. There is something, too, about the rising China and -- especially compared to 1964 -- how Japan is somewhat in the shadow of this huge economy next door.\"\n",
      "\tJapanese organizers are saying little about how 15,400 Olympic and Paralympic athletes, staff and officials will be safe in Tokyo.\n",
      "\t\"The environment, when it comes to Tokyo, will be different than from the environment today,\" Bach said this month. \"We only do not know which way.\"\n",
      "\tBach has said that even if rapid tests and a vaccine were available, they will not be the \"silver bullet.\"\n",
      "\tA study last week from the University of Oxford showed Tokyo to be the most expensive Summer Olympics dating from 1960. And the meter is still running.\n",
      "\tThe Kyodo news agency also reported again this week on more details about the bribery scandal that seemed to have helped Tokyo land the Olympics.\n",
      "\tDavid Leheny, who teach politics as Japan's Waseda Univeristy, suggested \"hard-fought\" talks are taking place with sponsors.\n",
      "\t\"My guess is that there will be a round of negotiation for lighter sponsorship contracts, with the firms holding most of the cards on the terms if they remain cohesive,\" Leheny said in an email.\n",
      "\t\"The organizers don't want to give up on any sponsors but also don't want to look like extortionate bullies in the midst of a pandemic/recession ... none wants to be the first to be seen as abandoning them.\"\n",

      "\tThe former chairman of a state-owned real estate company who publicly criticized President Xi Jinping's handling of the coronavirus pandemic was sentenced to 18 years in prison on Tuesday on corruption charges, a court announced.\n",
      "\tRen Zhiqiang, who became known for speaking up about censorship and other sensitive topics, disappeared from public view in March after publishing an essay online that accused Xi of mishandling the outbreak that began in December in the central city of Wuhan.\n",
      "\tXi, party leader since 2012, has suppressed criticism, tightened censorship and cracked down on unofficial organizations. Dozens of journalists, labour and human rights activists and others have been imprisoned.\n",
      "\tRen, 69, was convicted of corruption, bribery, embezzlement of public funds and abuse of power, the Beijing No. 2 Intermediate People's Court announced on its social media account. It cited Ren as saying he wouldn't appeal.\n",
      "\tThe former chairman and deputy party secretary of Huayuan Group was expelled from the ruling party in July.\n",
      "\tIn a commentary that circulated on social media, Ren criticized a Feb. 23 video conference with 170,000 officials held early in the pandemic at which Xi announced orders for responding to the disease.\n",
      "\tRen didn't mention Xi's name but said, \"standing there was not an emperor showing off his new clothes but a clown who had stripped off his clothes and insisted on being an emperor.\"\n",
      "\tRen criticized propaganda that portrayed Xi and other leaders as rescuing China from the disease without mentioning where it began and possible mistakes including suppressing information at the start of the outbreak.\n",
      "\t\"People did not see any criticism at the conference. It didn't investigate and disclose the truth,\" Ren wrote, according to a copy published by China Digital Times, a website in California. \"No one reviewed or took responsibility. But they are trying to cover up the truth with all kinds of great achievements.\"\n",
      "\tRen had an early military career and his parents were both former high officials in the Communist party. Some called him a princeling, a term for offspring of the founders of the communist government, a group that includes Xi.\n",
      "\tHe appeared to have crossed a political line by criticizing Xi's personal leadership.\n",

      "\tThe United Nations marked its 75th anniversary Monday with its chief urging leaders of an increasingly polarized, go-it-alone world to work together and preserve the organization's most important success since its founding: avoiding a military confrontation between the major global powers.\n",
      "\tSecretary-General Antonio Guterres' appeal for a revival of multilateralism -- the foundation of the United Nations -- was echoed by leaders of countries large and small, rich and poor.\n",
      "\tBut despite largely positive speeches, it was clear that challenges lie ahead in collaborating to beat back the coronavirus pandemic, end numerous smaller conflicts from the Middle East to Africa, and achieve U.N. goals to eradicate extreme poverty and preserve the environment by a 2030 target.\n",
      "\t\"Today, we have a surplus of multilateral challenges and a deficit of multilateral solutions,\" the U.N. chief said, stressing that COVID-19 has \"laid bare the world's fragilities,\" which can only be addressed together.\n",
      "\t\"Climate calamity looms, biodiversity is collapsing, poverty is rising, hatred is spreading, geopolitical tensions are escalating, nuclear weapons remain on hair-trigger alert,\" Guterres said.\n",
      "\tAppealing for a new multilateralism that draws on civil society, cities, businesses, local authorities and young people, Guterres said \"no one wants a world government -- but we must work together to improve world governance.\"\n",
      "\tThe United Nations marked its actual 75th anniversary -- the charter's signing in San Francisco on June 26, 1945 -- at a scaled-down event.\n",
      "\tMonday's mainly virtual official commemoration was a sobering assessment of the state of the world, the impact of the 193-member world body over seven decades and the struggles ahead. Some leaders appeared in native dress and in unusual settings, adding some colour to prerecorded speeches.\n",
      "\tThe commemoration was suspended with 58 countries waiting to speak, primarily because many leaders spoke far longer than the three minutes they were allotted. No date was set to hear the remaining speakers.\n",
      "\tAs a sign of the commemoration's importance, heads of government like Chinese President Xi Jinping and French President Emmanuel Macron spoke. U.S. President Donald Trump was first on the list of 182 speakers, but he didn't offer remarks.\n",
      "\tIn a snub to the United Nations, the United States instead was represented by its acting deputy U.N. ambassador, Cherith Norman Chalet. The White House had no immediate comment.\n",
      "\t\"In many ways, the United Nations has proven to be a successful experiment,\" Chalet said. But for too long, she added, it has resisted \"meaningful reform,\" lacked transparency and been \"too vulnerable to the agenda of autocratic regimes and dictatorships.\"\n",
      "\tChina's Xi urged U.N. members to recommit to multilateralism and \"work to promote a community with a shared future for mankind.\"\n",
      "\t\"Unilateralism is a dead end,\" he said. \"No country has the right to dominate global affairs, control the destiny of others or keep advantages in development all to itself. Even less should one be allowed to do whatever it likes and be the hegemon, bully or boss of the world.\"\n",
      "\tMacron said the United Nations has remained true to its promises made three-quarters of a century ago: \"To save future generations from the scourge of war, to assert human rights and the equality of nations, and to promote social progress in greater freedom.\"\n",
      "\tBut he warned that \"our common home is in disarray, just like our world.\"\n",
      "\t\"Faced with the health emergency, faced with the climate challenge, faced with the decline in rights,\" Macron said, \"it is here and now that we have to act, with those who want to and with those who can, by exploiting all possible spaces for co-operation.\"\n",
      "\tGuterres and many others said the founding of the United Nations in 1945 and the commitment to co-operation after two world wars and the Holocaust produced results.\n",
      "\t\"Never in modern history have we gone so many years without a military confrontation between the major powers,\" the secretary-general said. \"This is a major achievement of which member states can be proud -- and which we must all strive to preserve.\"\n",
      "\tGuterres cited other major U.N. victories over 75 years: peace treaties, decolonization, setting human rights standards, the end of apartheid in South Africa, eradication of diseases, a reduction in hunger, development of international law and landmark pacts to protect the environment.\n",
      "\tBut 25 years after world leaders adopted a platform to achieve equality for women, he said \"gender inequality remains the greatest single challenge to human rights around the world.\"\n",
      "\tGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel stressed that \"the United Nations can be only as effective as its members are united\" and urged new efforts \"to do everything in our power\" to find common responses and end \"the most intractable security issues,\" including conflicts in Libya and Syria.\n",
      "\tGuyana's President Irfaan Mohamed Ali, the head of what's called the Group of 77 and China -- the main U.N. bloc of developing countries that now has 134 member states -- said the commemoration \"must send a strong and positive signal to the peoples of the world of our commitment to multilateralism and our resolve to strive for peace, justice and development.\"\n",
      "\tEchoing broader global concerns, the president of Equatorial Guinea, Teodoro Obiang, said, \"There is no justification for the huge economic gap between rich and poor countries today.\"\n",
      "\tSimilarly, Seychelles President Danny Faure warned that issues like climate change know no borders.\n",
      "\t\"I assure you that the smallest, poorest and weakest of nations can contribute ideas as innovative ... as the biggest, wealthiest and most powerful countries,\" Faure said.\n",
      "\tDiplomats from the U.N. member nations managed to agree after sometimes difficult negotiations on a declaration to mark the U.N.'s anniversary, which was adopted Monday. It recalls the body's successes and failures and vows to build a post-pandemic world that is more equal, works together and protects the planet.\n",
      "\tRichard Gowan, U.N. director for the Crisis Group, a Brussels-based think-tank , said the declaration was weakened by the U.S. opposing strong language on climate change and Britain and others objecting to China trying to insert language including its hallmark phrase, \"win-win.\"\n",
      "\tPresident Xi used it Monday in speaking about \"Cold War mentality,\" declaring \"what we need to do is to replace conflict with dialogue, coercion with consultation and zero-sum with win-win.\"\n",
      "\tGowan said the dispute over the declaration was minor but \"captures the real question that has emerged over the U.N. in 2020, exacerbated by COVID, which is: How is this organization going to navigate an era of U.S.-China tension?\"\n",
      "\tAmid those questions, the U.N. released results of \"a global conversation\" it launched in January, using surveys, polls and gatherings to determine what all kinds of people thought about the future.\n",
      "\tGuterres said the U.N.'s 75th anniversary is an ideal time to realize goals that were expressed, including speeding up the transition to zero carbon emissions, ensuring universal health coverage and ending racial injustice.\n",
      "\t\"We face our own 1945 moment,\" he said. \"We must meet that moment. We must show unity like never before to overcome today's emergency, get the world moving and working and prospering again.\"\n",

      "\t\"Too many people are not taking it seriously and down there we see a very politicized situation,” he told CTV News.\n",
      "\tOn Monday, the state of Florida reported 1,701 new cases of COVID-19 on Monday, bringing their overall total to 685,439 cases since the pandemic began. Canada reported 1,308 new cases of COVID-19 on Monday, hitting a total of 145,418 confirmed cases of the virus.\n",
      "\tWhile the Canada-U.S. border is closed to non-essential travel until Oct. 21 and may be extended, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection says Canadian air passengers can still enter the country, provided they haven’t visited Brazil, China, Iran, Ireland, the U.K. or countries in the Schengen Area in the 14 days prior.\n",
      "\tDepending on the state, Canadians entering the U.S. may have to self-isolate upon arrival.\n",
      "\tJoanne Atherton faces a similar decision. She spends her summers at a gated RV resort in Peterborough County, Ont. but drives down to Northport, Fla. every winter.\n",
      "\tAtherton said she isn’t comfortable taking a flight, meaning she may have to stay with family members this year if the border isn’t opened sometime soon.\n",
      "\t\"I don't think I’m COVID crazy,” she said. “I’m cautious.”\n",
      "\tDue to the growing demand for international travel, several insurance companies have begun offering COVID-19 medical coverage as part of their travel insurance.\n",
      "\tMedipac, a service with ties to the Canadian Snowbirds Association, offers four months of coverage for less than $900, depending on the customer's age and general health.\n",
      "\t\"There was a large outcry from Canadian snowbirds at the beginning of this travel season, asking if there was going to be coverage for COVID-19 related illness,” said Christopher Davidge, Medipac vice president of sales and marketing.\n",
      "\tManulife announced a similar service last week, designed to provide medical coverage for COVID-19 infections and some coverage in the event a trip is cancelled or interrupted.\n",
      "\tWhile the Canadian government continues to advise against all non-essential travel, there are several destinations Canadians can fly to with few, if any, restrictions, including Cuba, Mexico, the Dominican Republic and much of Europe.\n",
      "\tExperts do point out, however, that many of the attractions may be limited or closed down as countries experience a second wave of cases.\n",

      "CONTENT : TORONTO -- \n",
      "\tAs scientists around the world race to create a vaccine for the novel coronavirus, some researchers predict that belief in conspiracy theories could hinder the uptake of a safe vaccine once it becomes publicly available.\n",
      "\tA new study published today in the journal Social Science & Medicine found that conspiracy theories regarding COVID-19 have been persistent from March to July and are associated with the reluctance to adopt preventive behaviours, such as mask-wearing and vaccination in the future.\n",
      "\t“Belief in pandemic conspiracy theories appears to be an obstacle to minimizing the spread of COVID-19,” said Dan Romer, research director at the University of Pennsylvania’s Annenberg Public Policy Center in a statement.\n",
      "\t\"To control the pandemic we need high rates of mask-wearing, physical distancing, and hand-washing now - and of vaccination when a safe and effective vaccine is available.\"\n",
      "\tResearchers found the most common COVID-19-related conspiracies had to do with three main issues: the perceived threat of the pandemic, taking preventive actions (such as mask wearing) and the safety of vaccines.\n",
      "\tBased on a survey of 840 U.S. adults, researchers found that 28 per cent of survey participants reported believing in March that the Chinese government created the coronavirus as a bioweapon. By July the number of people who believed that conspiracy theory increased to 37 per cent. The study also found that nearly one in seven participants believed that the pharmaceuticals industry created the virus to increase the sale of drugs and vaccines.\n",
      "\tIn a White House briefing on April 30, U.S. President Donald Trump promoted the idea that COVID-19 accidentally escaped from a lab in Wuhan, China. Experts have said there is no evidence to support this claim and Chinese officials have vehemently rebuked the allegation.\n",
      "\tResearchers say they were able to predict the use of face masks among participants based on political ideology and “conservative media reliance,” however when it came to vaccinations there was a wide range of responses, indicating that vaccines are more of a bipartisan concern.\n",
      "\tBelievers of COVID-19 conspiracies were also more likely to have doubts about the safety of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine.\n",
      "\t\"Conspiracy theories are difficult to displace because they provide explanations for events that are not fully understood, such as the current pandemic, play on people's distrust of government and other powerful actors, and involve accusations that cannot be easily fact-checked,\" co-researcher Kathleen Hall Jamieson said in a statement.\n",
      "\tThe study suggests that those who did not believe in the conspiracies were 1.5 times more likely to wear a face mask every day outside of the home when in contact with others compared to those who most strongly believed in the conspiracies.\n",
      "\tResearchers say that counteracting the effects of conspiracy beliefs will require persistent public health campaigns and straightforward messaging particularly on platforms where COVID-related conspiracies have flourished. \n",

      "CONTENT : COLUMBUS, OHIO -- \n",
      "\tPeggy Lehner, a Republican state senator in Ohio, doesn't sugarcoat what she has seen happen to support for U.S. President Donald Trump in her suburban Dayton district.\n",
      "\t\"It hasn't ebbed. It's crashed,\" said Lehner, who is not seeking reelection in the district of working-class and white-collar communities the president won comfortably four years ago. \"He is really doing poorly among independents.\"\n",
      "\tTrump's chances for a second term rest heavily on being able to maintain the margins he won by in 2016, particularly in suburban areas. Trump campaigned outside Dayton and Toledo Monday, as liberal Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's death stoked questions of whether the sudden court vacancy would energize more suburban voters who support abortion rights or social conservatives in small-town and rural areas who oppose them.\n",
      "\tDuring his Ohio visit, Trump credited himself with boosting manufacturing in the state prior to the pandemic and warned of economic devastation if Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden beats him in six weeks. \"Put simply, if Biden wins, China wins,\" Trump said. \"If we win, Ohio wins and most importantly, in all fairness, America wins.\"\n",
      "\tBut Republican lawmakers and strategists in Ohio say they are seeing research that shows a near-uniform drop in support from his 2016 totals across every suburban region of the state.\n",
      "\tThey say that Trump, who won Ohio by 8 percentage points in 2016, maintains a yawning advantage in more rural areas and small towns. Still, Republicans are concerned that if he is losing badly in suburban areas in Ohio, it is a signal that Trump's hold on other states in the industrial heartland that delivered him the presidency may be in peril.\n",
      "\t\"The million-dollar question becomes, how does that translate in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania?\" said Corry Bliss, a Republican strategist who managed Ohio Sen. Rob Portman's 2016 reelection campaign. \"It translates into probably not a very good night.\"\n",
      "\tOhio has long been a bellwether. No Republican has won the White House without carrying the state since the advent of the modern two-party system, and no Democrat has since 1960.\n",
      "\tTrump is faring worse than four years ago in communities in essentially all suburban areas around Ohio, from its major cities to its several mid-size metro areas, more than a half-dozen Republican operatives tracking races across Ohio say.\n",
      "\tTrump has slipped in suburbs to the east and west of Cleveland, where he narrowly edged Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in 2016, they say. In the blue-collar suburbs of Youngstown, where Trump won by double digits, the same appears to be true.\n",
      "\tIn affluent suburbs, such as Dublin northwest of Columbus, 2012 GOP nominee Mitt Romney won by almost 20 percentage points. Four years later, Trump narrowly lost to Clinton. Less than two months before the 2020 election, Republicans were concerned about signs the trend in Dublin has continued, according to several GOP operatives following legislative and congressional races.\n",
      "\tThere is debate among state Republican strategists about how many new voters there are left to lift Trump in rural and small town Ohio.\n",
      "\tFormer Ohio Republican Party Chairman Kevin DeWine, a second-cousin to Gov. Mike DeWine, said, \"I just don't see him getting more votes.\"\n",
      "\tBut veteran Ohio GOP strategist Doug Preisse countered, saying, \"I perceive a commensurate intensification in the support for Trump in small towns.\"\n",
      "\tThere is less debate in other states. Pennsylvania Republicans say across the longtime GOP stronghold of Chester County west of Philadelphia, for instance, Trump has slipped as far as he has in Ohio's suburbs, though in more populous towns and in a state he carried by fewer than 45,000 votes.\n",
      "\tFormer Pennsylvania Rep. Ryan Costello, a Republican, said that the suburban electorate is rapidly diversifying in ways that hurt Trump, especially among young families and among those concerned about the coronavirus.\n",
      "\t\"I think Trump has proved to be the accelerant,\" said Costello.\n",
      "\tHillary Clinton carried Chester County by almost 10 percentage points, the first Democrat to win there since Lyndon Johnson in 1964. Chester is also steadily growing, with a population of about 525,000, the fourth largest in the state.\n",
      "\t\"I think that there is a higher likelihood at this moment in time that Trump performs worse in the suburbs,\" Costello said. \"It's his tone. It's the chaos. Perhaps a combination. But certainly the pandemic, the mismanagement of the pandemic.\"\n",
      "\tBut there are other more nuanced suburban concerns for Trump in Pennsylvania.\n",
      "\tJust west of the state capital, Harrisburg, Cumberland County's rapid development is diversifying the Capital City's longtime Republican-leaning suburbs. The combination of growth and declining support for Trump generally across suburbs has hurt the president in south-central Pennsylvania's competitive 10th Congressional District, where Trump won by 9 percentage points in 2016, said Terry Madonna, director of the Center for Politics and Public Affairs at Franklin and Marshall College in Lancaster, Pennsylvania.\n",
      "\tA central question is whether Trump can, as his campaign predicts, spur even more support than in 2016 from rural voters in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin.\n",
      "\t\"Trump is leading in these areas but nowhere near by the percentage he won them by in 2016,\" said Madonna, who has conducted polls in the state for more than three decades.\n",
      "\tRepublicans have similar concerns about suburbs in Michigan, notably in Oakland County, Detroit's more upscale northwestern neighbour and Michigan's second-most populous county. Democrats have consistently carried it, though Republican George W. Bush came very close in 2000 and 2004, while Mitt Romney was competitive in 2012.\n",
      "\tTrump did worse there than any Republican in the past 20 years, with the exception of John McCain in 2008.\n",
      "\tBut Trump appears less concerned about shoring up those losses, and is instead mining rural, small-town and working-class regions in all three states for more of the white conservative base that propelled him to office.\n",
      "\tTrump campaigned near Bay City, Michigan, last week, a struggling former automotive manufacturing city on Lake Huron where he won in 2016, after Obama had carried Bay County twice.\n",
      "\tLikewise, Trump has lost support in the populous suburbs of southeast Wisconsin since 2016, according to the Marquette University Law School poll. And instead, he has been campaigning in blue-collar Oshkosh and the Wausau area, far north of the Republican epicenter encircling Milwaukee.\n",
      "\tWisconsin Republicans promoting legislative candidates in typically GOP-leaning suburbs of Ozaukee County north of Milwaukee and Waukesha County to the city's west warned this month that \"Republicans should be worried because President Donald Trump is currently under-performing in the districts,\" according to GOP website rightwisconsin.com.\n",
      "\t\"It's a combination of blunting the departures in the suburbs and juicing the rural areas,\" said John Selleck, who ran Romney's 2012 Michigan campaign. \"But can he make up the lost suburban votes elsewhere?\"\n",
      "\tThat was his formula for winning Ohio four years ago. He received the highest or second-highest per cent of Republican votes of any candidate since 1980 in 60 of Ohio's 88 counties, according to state voting data compiled by Mike Dawson, a public policy consultant and creator of ohioelectionresults.com.\n",

      "\tDemocratic presidential nominee Joe Biden said U.S. President Donald Trump \"seems to have no conception of what constitutes national security\" after Trump revealed in interviews with Bob Woodward the existence of a classified nuclear weapons system.\n",
      "\tIn an interview with CNN's Jake Tapper, the former vice president said Trump's comments to Woodward -- made in a series of 18 interviews for the journalist's upcoming book \"Rage\" -- were \"not a surprise.\"\n",
      "\t\"You wonder why people in the intelligence community wondered from the very beginning whether you could share data with him, 'cause they don't trust him. They don't trust what he'll say or do,\" Biden said. \"He seems to have no conception of what constitutes national security, no conception of anything other than, what can he do to promote himself?\"\n",
      "\tBiden cited an Axios report that Trump asked whether nuclear bombs could be dropped in the middle of hurricanes to dissipate them before landfall, which Trump has denied. He also pointed to Trump's comment last year that the Continental Army \"took over the airports\" from the British in the Revolutionary War, more than a century before airplanes existed. Trump blamed a faulty teleprompter at the time.\n",
      "\t\"This is the guy who said maybe the way to deal with hurricane is drop a nuclear bomb on them. I mean -- seriously, he said it!\" Biden said. \"I mean, God. Or you know, the problem with the Revolutionary War was they didn't have enough airports. I mean, I just -- it is beyond my comprehension.\"\n",
      "\tBiden then pointed to The Atlantic's recent report that Trump had referred to those killed and injured at war \"losers\" and \"suckers.\" He highlighted his deceased son Beau Biden's service in Kosovo and in the Iraq war, \"and all the people with him, the people who died. They're suckers? I mean I can't fathom.\"\n",
      "\t\"They're heroes. They really are heroes. Duty, honor, country,\" Biden said. \"He talks about can you repeat four words in a row or whatever his little IQ test or dementia test he took, he doesn't understand duty, honor, service, country. He doesn't get it. Or if he gets it he doesn't care about it.\"\n",
      "\tHe added: \"Unrelated to my running, he should not be the commander-in-chief of the United States military. It's just -- no commander-in-chief's ever, ever, ever, acted like this man.\"\n",
      "\tThe interview took place the day Biden visited Macomb County, a key swing region in Michigan. Trump won Macomb County by 12 percentage points in 2016, making him the first Republican to win the county since 1988. It's representative of the type of territory that Barack Obama won twice, then Trump won four years ago, that Biden hopes to shift back into the Democratic column on November 3.\n",
      "\tAsked whether Trump could claim victories -- renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement and ending trade advantages for China -- that eluded Biden, the former vice president conceded that Trump's renegotiated US-Mexico-Canada Agreement is \"better than NAFTA.\"\n",
      "\t\"But look what the overall trade policy has done even with NAFTA. We now have this gigantic deficit in trade with Mexico. Not because NAFTA wasn't made better, because overall trade policy and how he deals with it made everything worse,\" Biden said.\n",
      "\tBiden also touted his role in the Obama administration's economic recovery effort in 2009, and pointed to the auto industry bailout. And he complained that Trump has not enforced \"Buy America\" laws.\n",
      "\tBiden criticized Trump's dealings with countries like North Korea and Iran, saying he has lent them credibility.\n",
      "\t\"I mean, this 'America First' has made America alone,\" he said.\n",
      "\tHe also criticized the tax cuts enacted by Trump and a then-Republican-led Congress. Biden also said he would raise taxes on those making more than $400,000 per year, lift corporate income taxes to 28%, and would impose new penalties for corporations that send jobs overseas to manufacture goods that are then sold back into the United States.\n",
      "\t\"We've got to get people investing. And so the idea that we take that money and put it into new investments and manufacturing and education, and health care, I mean, you know, these are things that matter to middle class families,\" Biden said.\n",
      "\tThe 77-year-old Biden said he would not conceal anything about his health status if he is elected president.\n",
      "\tPrevious presidents, including Franklin D. Roosevelt, John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan, have not disclosed issues related to their health.\n",
      "\tTrump made a surprise visit to the Walter Reed Army medical center last year. Trump had undergone a \"quick exam and labs\" as part of his annual physical out of anticipation of a \"very busy 2020,\" the White House had said of the trip at the time.\n",
      "\tIn a new book, The New York Times' Michael Schmidt writes, however, that he learned \"in the hours leading up to Trump's trip to the hospital, word went out in the West Wing for the vice president to be on standby to take over the powers of the presidency temporarily if Trump had to undergo a procedure that would have required him to be anesthetized.\"\n",
      "\tTrump and his doctor asserted after Schmidt's reporting that an ambiguous trip to Walter Reed last year was not in response to a mini-stroke -- though neither Schmidt nor other news outlets had suggested Trump had suffered a mini-stroke.\n",
      "\t\"Anything can happen. I've become a great respecter of fate -- a great respecter of fate. I've seen too much of it in my family related to accidents alone. And so I guarantee you, I guarantee you, I will be totally transparent in terms of my health, and all aspects of my health,\" Biden said.\n",
      "\t\"And when it comes to Donald Trump versus me, just look at us. OK? Just look at us. Who seems to be in shape? Who's able to move around?\" Biden said, laughing about Trump and his allies calling him \"Slow Joe.\"\n",
      "\t\"Donald Trump -- just look at us both, watch us, and determine whether or not you think I'm misleading anyone. Not you personally, but the public,\" Biden said. \"You know, look at me. Judge me based on -- I know what the job takes. I've sat for hundreds of hours in the Situation Room. For eight years I was vice president in every major decision. I know how difficult the job is.\"\n",
      "\tHe added: \"And one more thing I'll do, I'll take responsibility. I'll acknowledge my mistakes when I make them and I'll level with the American people.\"\n",

      "\tThe same Russian military intelligence outfit that hacked the Democrats in 2016 has attempted similar intrusions into the computer systems of more than 200 organizations including political parties and consultants, Microsoft said Thursday.\n",
      "\tThose efforts reflect a broader increase in targeting of U.S. political campaigns and related groups, the company said. \"What we've seen is consistent with previous attack patterns that not only target candidates and campaign staffers but also those who they consult on key issues,\" Tom Burt, a Microsoft vice-president, said in a blog post. U.S. political organizations were also probed, the company said.\n",
      "\tMost of the infiltration attempts by Russian, Chinese and Iranian agents were halted by Microsoft security software and the targets notified, he said. The company would not comment on who may have been successfully hacked or the impact.\n",
      "\tAlthough U.S. intelligence officials said last month that the Russians favour President Donald Trump and the Chinese prefer his Democratic challenger, former Vice-President Joe Biden, Microsoft noted Thursday that Chinese state-backed hackers have targeted \"high profile individuals associated with the election,\" including people associated with the Biden campaign.\n",
      "\tChina's hackers largely gather intelligence for the nation's economic and political advantage, while Russia tends to weaponize stolen data to destabilize other governments.\n",
      "\tMicrosoft did not assess which foreign adversary poses the greater threat to the integrity of the November presidential election. The consensus among cybersecurity experts is that Russian interference is the gravest. Senior Trump administration officials have disputed that, although without offering any evidence.\n",
      "\t\"This is the actor from 2016, potentially conducting business as usual,\" said John Hultquist, director of intelligence analysis at the cybersecurity firm FireEye. \"We believe that Russian military intelligence continues to pose the greatest threat to the democratic process.\"\n",
      "\tThe Microsoft post shows that Russian military intelligence continues to pursue election-related targets undeterred by U.S indictments, sanctions and other countermeasures, Hultquist said. It interfered in the 2016 campaign seeking to benefit the Trump campaign by hacking the Democratic National Committee and emails of John Podesta, the campaign manager of Hillary Clinton, and dumping embarrassing material online, congressional and FBI investigators have found.\n",
      "\tThe same GRU military intelligence unit, known as Fancy Bear, that Microsoft identifies as being behind the current election-related activity also broke into voter registration databases in at least three states in 2016, though there is no evidence it tried to interfere with voting.\n",
      "\tMicrosoft, which has visibility into these efforts because its software is both ubiquitous and highly rated for security, did not address whether U.S. officials who manage elections or operate voting systems have been targeted by state-backed hackers this year. U.S. intelligence officials say they have so far not seen no evidence of infiltrations.\n",
      "\tThomas Rid, a Johns Hopkins geopolitics expert, said he was disappointed by Microsoft's refusal to differentiate threat level by state actor. \"They're lumping in actors that operate in a very different fashion, probably to make this sound more bipartisan,\" he said. \"I just don't understand why.\"\n",
      "\tMicrosoft said in the past year it has observed attempts by Fancy Bear to break into the accounts of people directly and indirectly affiliated with the U.S. election, including consultants serving Republican and Democratic campaigns and national and state party organizations -- more than 200 groups in all.\n",
      "\tAlso targeted was the centre-right European People's Party, the largest grouping in the European Parliament. A party spokesperson said the hacking attempts were unsuccessful. The German Marshall Fund of the United States, a think-tank , was another target. A spokesperson said there was no evidence of intrusion.\n",
      "\tMicrosoft did not say whether Russian hackers had attempted to break into the Biden campaign but did say that Chinese hackers from the state-backed group known as Hurricane Panda \"appears to have indirectly and unsuccessfully\" targeted the Biden campaign through non-campaign email accounts belonging to people affiliated with it.\n",
      "\tThe Biden campaign did not confirm the attempt, although it said in a statement that it was aware of the Microsoft report.\n",
      "\tThe blog post said Iranian state-backed hackers have unsuccessfully tried to log into accounts of Trump campaign and administration officials between May and June of this year. \"We are a large target, so it is not surprising to see malicious activity directed at the campaign or our staff,\" Trump campaign deputy press secretary Thea McDonald said. She declined further comment.\n",
      "\tTim Murtaugh, the campaign's communications director, said: \"President Trump will beat Joe Biden fair and square and we don't need or want any foreign interference.\"\n",
      "\tIn June, Google disclosed that Hurricane Panda had targeted Trump campaign staffers while Iranian hackers tried to breach accounts of Biden campaign workers. Such phishing attempts typically involve forged emails with links designed to harvest passwords or infect devices with malware.\n",
      "\tAlthough both Attorney General William Barr and National Security Advisor Robert O'Brien have both said China represents the greatest threat to U.S. elections, the only mention of a Trump administration official targeted by Chinese hackers is \"at least one prominent individual formerly associated\" with the administration.\n",
      "\tGraham Brookie, director of digital forensic research at The Atlantic Council, disputes Barr and O'Brien's claim that China poses the greater threat to this year's election. His lab is at the forefront of unearthing and publicizing Russian disinformation campaigns.\n",
      "\tBrookie confirmed that his employer was among targets of Hurricane Panda but said there was no evidence the hacking attempts, which he said were unsuccessful, had anything to do with the 2020 election.\n",
      "\t\"We have every indication that this was an instance of cyber-espionage, information gathering, as opposed to electoral interference,\" he said.\n",
      "\tBy contrast, Brookie said, \"it's pretty evident that the Russian attempts (Microsoft disclosed) were focused on electoral processes and groups working on that.\"\n",
      "\tMicrosoft noted a shift toward greater automation in Fancy Bear methods for trying to steal people's log-in credentials, which previously largely relied on phishing. In recent months, the group has employed so-called brute-force attacks that barrage an account login with short rapid bursts of potential passwords.\n",
      "\tFancy Bear has also stepped up its use of the Tor anonymizing service to hide its hacking, Microsoft said.\n",

      "\tChina is offering state-sponsored marriage counselling to couples before they tie the knot in an attempt to slow rising divorce rates.\n",
      "\tMarriage breakups have surged over the last two decades as divorce laws were liberalised and many women have become more financially independent, choosing careers first and families later.\n",
      "\tLast year 4.15 million Chinese couples untied the knot, according to the Ministry of Civil Affairs -- up from 1.3 million in 2003, when couples were first allowed to divorce by mutual consent without going to court.\n",
      "\tIn a bid to stop the trend, marriage registration bureaus across the country should offer premarital counselling services to prevent disputes \"from the get-go,\" according to a directive issued Tuesday by the civil affairs ministry and the All-China Women's Federation.\n",
      "\tIt is not clear whether it is mandatory for all couples to seek counselling before getting married, or who would pay for it.\n",
      "\tRising divorce rates have become a headache for officials who want to boost birth rates and prevent China from greying before it gets rich.\n",
      "\tBut state interference in private relationships has sparked outrage in the past.\n",
      "\tA month-long cooling-off period for couples filing for divorce -- included in a civil code that takes effect next year -- was met with widespread online criticism when it was approved in March.\n",
      "\tThe new guidelines also want to make the marriage registration process more \"solemn and serious.\"\n",
      "\tCurrently city hall marriages can take just minutes.\n",

      "\tThe guidelines have been met with derision, with over 670 million views on the hashtag \"My country wants to strengthen marriage registration\" on popular social media app Weibo.\n",

      "\tThe global climate crisis could see more than a billion people displaced from their homes in the next 30 years, as ecological disasters drive mass migrations and greater armed conflict, according to a new report released Wednesday.\n",
      "\tThe Ecological Threat Register, conducted by the Sydney-based Institute for Economics and Peace (IEP), projected that as many as 1.2 billion people around the world could be displaced by 2050. No country will be able to escape the impact of the climate crisis -- but the world's poorest and most vulnerable populations will be hardest hit.\n",
      "\t\"Ecological threats and climate change pose serious challenges to global development and peacefulness,\" the report said. \"The world's least resilient countries, when faced with ecological breakdowns, are more likely to experience civil unrest, political instability, social fragmentation and economic collapse.\"\n",
      "\tThe report drew on data from international organizations like the United Nations, the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre, the Food and Agriculture Organization, and the IEP's prior research on countries' resilience levels. Using these figures, the IEP then calculated the relative threats of population growth, water stress, food insecurity, droughts, floods, cyclones, and rising temperature and sea levels.\n",
      "\tIt found that more than a billion people lived in 31 countries that had low resilience -- meaning they aren't equipped to withstand the impact of ecological change in the coming decades.\n",
      "\tThe regions facing the highest number of threats are Sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, the Middle East and North Africa, the report said.\n",
      "\t\"Not all of these people will be displaced, however it is likely that a large number of them will be,\" said the IEP.\n",
      "\tBetter-resourced countries in places like North America and Europe will be more able to manage the effects of these disasters -- but they'll likely face huge flows of climate refugees, the report warned.\n",
      "\t\"This will have huge social and political impacts, not just in the developing world, but also in the developed, as mass displacement will lead to larger refugee flows to the most developed countries,\" said IEP founder Steve Killelea in a news release, adding that ecological change was \"the next big global threat to our planet.\"\n",
      "\tThe global population currently stands at 7.8 billion. That number is expected to reach 10 billion by 2050 -- straining the world's already stretched natural resources, the report said, citing data from the UN's Department of Economic and Social Affairs.\n",
      "\tMost of this population growth is expected to take place in countries with ongoing armed conflict, like those in Sub-Saharan Africa, the report said.\n",
      "\tCiting research from the global non-profit organization World Resource Institute, the report projected that by 2050, global demand for food will increase by 50% and 3.5 billion people could suffer from food insecurity.\n",
      "\tWater scarcity may be an even bigger issue -- already, there are more than 2.6 billion people facing high or extreme water stress, meaning they either don't have enough water for their needs or that their water supply is at risk of disruption, the report said.\n",
      "\tClimate change has caused disrupted rainfall, rising temperatures, and other ecological impacts that are already creating water crises -- in 2019, Chennai, India's sixth biggest city, nearly ran out of water. Water had to be trucked in daily from other states, with people standing in line for hours in the sun to fill up jugs with their daily water ration.\n",
      "\tBy 2040, a total of 5.4 billion people -- or more than half of the world's projected population -- will live in countries facing high or extreme water stress. India and China, the world's top two most populous countries, will be among those countries, the report said.\n",
      "\tIt could also spell even greater violence and conflict, which not only destabilizes economies and governments but drives mass migration. In the past decade alone, water-related violent incidents have increased by 270% worldwide, the IEP said, citing water solutions company WorldWater.\n",
      "\tRecent years have seen dramatic increases in natural disasters around the world, which experts have long warned are the symptoms of a worsening climate crisis -- raging wildfires in California, heat waves across Europe, fears of a dam collapse in China and a record-breaking hurricane in the southern United States.\n",
      "\tAsia-Pacific has been the most affected region; 29% of all natural disasters in the past 30 years have taken place there, the study found. Europe had the second highest numbers of natural disasters globally.\n",
      "\tIn 2019, India faced the largest population displacement due to natural disasters, with 5 million people having to leave their homes, the study said. Globally, natural disasters displaced 25 million people last year -- and the number will likely keep rising, the research team found.\n",
      "\tAnd these natural disasters strike hardest in poorer countries; they kill seven times more people in the least developed nations than in highly developed ones, the report found, using socioeconomic indicators from the IEP's previous research on ecological resilience. It's not because the disasters in poorer countries happen more frequently or with greater severity -- but because those nations are less able to handle the shock.\n",
      "\tAll these threats combined will create a migration crisis that can then cause spinoff effects like heightened political instability, global insecurity and greater hostility toward immigrants.\n",
      "\tInternational cooperation and foreign climate-related aid will be essential in mitigating these effects and helping developing countries build better resilience, the report said. This type of international aid has already increased 34 fold from 2000 to 2018 as the full extent of the crisis became clear -- but they still \"fall well short of what is needed to address these issues going forward,\" the report warned.\n",

      "\tInstead of closing in on a future trade deal, the European Union and Britain fought bitterly Thursday over a planned British law that the EU says would constitute a serious violation of the Brexit divorce agreement and destroy what little trust remains between the two sides.\n",
      "\tThe 27-nation bloc said Britain must withdraw the planned law dealing with Northern Ireland trade by the end of the month or face a legal battle even before the transition period following Britain's EU departure ends on Dec. 31.\n",
      "\t\"By putting forward this bill, the U.K. has seriously damaged trust between the EU and the U.K.. It is now up to the U.K. government to reestablish that trust,\" European Commission Vice-President Maros Sefcovic said, using language that, by the EU's diplomatic standards, was furious.\n",
      "\tHe spoke after meeting Britain's chief Brexit minister, Michael Gove, at a hastily arranged meeting in London.\n",
      "\tLess than a year ago the two sides signed and ratified a withdrawal agreement that Britain now acknowledges it will violate with its Internal Market Bill, which would diminish the EU's oversight of trade between mainland Britain and Northern Ireland. That's a sensitive issue because Northern Ireland has the U.K's only land border with an EU member state, Ireland.\n",
      "\t\"If the bill were to be adopted, it would constitute an extremely serious violation of the Withdrawal Agreement and of international law,\" Sefcovic said.\n",
      "\tHe said that if Britain didn't change course by the end of September, \"the Withdrawal Agreement contains a number of mechanisms and legal remedies to address violations of the legal obligations contained in the text -- which the European Union will not be shy in using.\"\n",
      "\tThe British government announced this week that it plans to legislate to give itself the power to deviate from some of the provisions in the agreement about Northern Ireland trade.\n",
      "\tThe U.K. has acknowledged that the proposed legislation breaks international law \"in a very specific and limited way.\" But it argues that it is acting legally under British law because according to the \"fundamental principle of Parliamentary sovereignty ΓÇª treaty obligations only become binding to the extent that they are enshrined in domestic legislation.\"\n",
      "\tBritain and the EU have jointly promised in the Brexit divorce agreement to ensure there are no customs posts and other obstacles on the Northern Ireland-Ireland border.\n",
      "\tAn open border underpins the peace agreement that ended decades of violence in Northern Ireland. Any hardening of the border could anger nationalists who want a united Ireland. But any new barriers to trade across the Irish Sea would rile Unionists who want Northern Ireland to stay British.\n",
      "\tBoth Britain and the EU claim to be acting to preserve peace.\n",
      "\tBritain says its law is intended to ensure there are no barriers to trade between Northern Ireland and the rest of the U.K. in the event that there is no deal with the EU. On Thursday, it said it would try to push the bill into law quickly, scheduling it for debate in Parliament starting Monday.\n",
      "\tGove said Britain \"could not and would not\" withdraw the bill.\n",
      "\t\"This legislation is critical to ensuring there is unfettered access for goods from Northern Ireland to the rest of the United Kingdom,\" he said.\n",
      "\tSefcovic said the EU \"does not accept the argument that the aim of the draft Bill is to protect\" Northern Ireland's peace agreement.\n",
      "\t\"In fact, it is of the view that it does the opposite,\" he said.\n",
      "\tThe EU has an ally in Nancy Pelosi, speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives. She said Britain would have no chance of striking a coveted trade deal with the United States if it breached an international treaty and undermined Northern Ireland's peace accord\n",
      "\t\"How can they walk away from an international agreement? How do you trust that?\" Pelosi said at a news conference at the U.S. Capitol Thursday.\n",
      "\t\"What were they thinking?\" Pelosi said. \"They're not thinking of the U.K.-U.S. bilateral trade agreements.\"\n",
      "\tMany British politicians and lawyers have also expressed alarm, saying that reneging on a legally binding international commitment would trash Britain's reputation for upholding law and order.\n",
      "\tThe top civil servant in the government's legal department resigned this week, reportedly because of opposition to the proposed law.\n",
      "\tFormer Conservative leader Michael Howard, a supporter of Brexit, said the government was damaging \"our reputation for probity and respect for the rule of the law.\"\n",
      "\t\"How can we reproach Russia or China or Iran when their conduct falls below internationally accepted standards, when we are showing such scant regard for our treaty obligations?\" he said in Parliament.\n",
      "\tBritain left the political structures of the EU on Jan. 31 and will make an economic break when an 11-month transition period ends on Dec. 31. The two sides are trying to strike a new trade deal by then, but talks have bogged down over issues including fishing rights in U.K. waters and fair-competition rules for businesses.\n",
      "\tThe two sides' chief negotiators, David Frost and Michel Barnier, are due to end their latest round of negotiations on Thursday. Both sides say that unless there is an agreement by next month, Britain is facing an economically disruptive no-deal exit on Jan. 1.\n",

      "\tThe Chinese embassy in the United Kingdom has called on Twitter to investigate after its ambassador's official account appeared to \"like\" a pornographic post.\n",
      "\tThe apparent sexually explicit \"like\" was first identified by a London-based human rights campaigner on Wednesday. It quickly set off a storm online as Twitter users speculated about whether ambassador Liu Xiaoming's account had been hacked.\n",
      "\tThe account also appeared to \"like\" at least one other post which was critical of the ruling Chinese Communist Party. It is not clear how long the apparent \"likes\" remained active, or when they first appeared.\n",
      "\tA \"like\" on Twitter does not necessarily mean that the user is endorsing the content; \"likes\" are often used as bookmarks.\n",
      "\tAll of the \"liked\" tweets on the account have now been removed, apart from just two of his own posts from October 2019. The ambassador has more than 85,000 followers on his official account.\n",
      "\tIn a statement Wednesday, the Chinese embassy in London asked for Twitter to open an investigation.\n",
      "\t\"Recently, some anti-China elements viciously attacked Ambassador Liu Xiaoming's Twitter account and employed despicable methods to deceive the public. The Chinese Embassy strongly condemns such abominable behavior,\" the statement said.\n",
      "\t\"The Embassy has reported this to [Twitter] and urged the latter to make thorough investigations and handle this matter seriously. The Embassy reserves the right to take further actions and hope that the public will not believe or spread such a rumor.\"\n",
      "\tLiu himself retweeted the statement from the Chinese embassy, adding cryptically that \"a good anvil does not fear the hammer.\"\n",
      "\tA spokeswoman for Twitter told CNN Business that there was nothing for them to comment on at present.\n",
      "\tTwitter is one of several U.S.-based social media platforms that are blocked in China, along with Facebook and Instagram. Despite this, Chinese diplomats have increasingly been using Twitter to promote Beijing's interests around the world.\n",
      "\tLiu was appointed China's ambassador to the United Kingdom in 2009. An outspoken defender of China in the media and online, he has been a keen adopter of Beijing's new breed of \"wolf warrior\" diplomacy, which encourages a rapid and aggressive response to any perceived slights against the Chinese government.\n",
      "\tDuring a debate in July over whether the United Kingdom should ban Chinese tech giant Huawei from its 5G network, for example, Liu said at a news conference that \"the way you are treating Huawei will be followed very closely by other Chinese businesses.\"\n",
      "\tAnd while speaking to the BBC that month, Liu denied accusations of human rights abuses in China's far western Xinjiang region, including the mass incarceration of minority Muslim citizens, saying that the Chinese government treated \"every ethnic group as equal.\"\n",

      "\tA Department of Homeland Security official said in a whistleblower complaint that he was pressured by more senior officials to suppress facts in intelligence reports that U.S. President Donald Trump might find objectionable, including information about Russian interference in the election and the rising threat posed by white supremacists.\n",
      "\tThe official, Brian Murphy, alleged that senior DHS officials also pressed him to alter reports so they would reflect administration policy goals and that he was demoted for refusing to go along with the changes and for filing confidential internal complaints about the conduct.\n",
      "\tMurphy, a former FBI agent and Marine Corps veteran, was demoted in August from his post as principal deputy under secretary in the Office of Intelligence and Analysis. He is seeking to be reinstated in a complaint filed with the DHS Office of Inspector General.\n",
      "\tRep. Adam Schiff, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, on Wednesday released the complaint, which he said contained \"grave and disturbing\" allegations. He said Murphy has been asked to give a deposition to Congress as part of an investigation into intelligence collection by DHS related to its response to protests in Portland, Oregon, and elsewhere.\n",
      "\t\"We will get to the bottom of this, expose any and all misconduct or corruption to the American people, and put a stop to the politicization of intelligence,\" the California Democrat said.\n",
      "\tA Homeland Security spokesman, Alexei Woltornist, said the department generally does not comment on referrals to the inspector general but denied Murphy's allegations. \"DHS looks forward to the results of any resulting investigation and we expect it will conclude that no retaliatory action was taken against Mr. Murphy,\" he said.\n",
      "\tThe complaint came the same day that acting Secretary Chad Wolf, who has been nominated by Trump to lead the agency, gave a \"state of the Homeland\" speech in which he said DHS is working to thwart election interference from any foreign power and all threats regardless of ideology.\n",
      "\t\"DHS stands in absolute opposition to any form of violent extremism whether by white supremacist extremists or anarchist extremists,\" Wolf said. \"We will continue our daily efforts to combat all forms of domestic terror.\"\n",
      "\tMurphy said in his complaint that he was directed by Ken Cuccinelli, the acting deputy DHS secretary, to modify a section of a report to make the threat posed by white supremacists less severe. He was told to play up the threat posed by left-wing groups to echo administration talking points around civil unrest following the protests over the killing of George Floyd.\n",
      "\tMurphy said he refused to alter the report because doing so would \"constitute an abuse of authority and improper administration of an intelligence program.\" He was then taken off the project.\n",
      "\tHe said he made a number of reports on Russian disinformation efforts to senior DHS and administration officials between March 2018 and March 2020. The details are classified and not included in the whistle-blower complaint.\n",
      "\tThen, in July, Wolf told him to hold back any reports on Russian election interference because they \"made the president look bad,\" according to the complaint. He also said Wolf told him to report on interference by China and Iran, instead of Russia, and those instructions came from White House national security adviser Robert O'Brien. Murphy said he objected and was excluded from future meetings on the subject.\n",
      "\tTrump has repeatedly resisted claims of Russian interference, including doubting findings by U.S. officials and lawmakers that Russia meddled in the 2016 campaign to help him and sow chaos in the electoral process. He has dismissed reports that Russia is continuing to interfere in the 2020 race, claiming that China is the more pernicious threat, even though a statement from intelligence officials last month said Moscow was directly trying to undermine Democrat Joe Biden.\n",
      "\tMurphy said that, after he was removed from working on a DHS intelligence report, a draft was leaked to the media in which Russia's interference was placed on an equal footing as activities by Iran and China in a way that was \"misleading and inconsistent with the actual intelligence,\" the complaint said.\n",
      "\tMurphy came to DHS in March 2018 from the FBI, where his career included being assigned to the New York field office on Sept. 11, 2001. In his complaint, he alleged that efforts to manipulate the intelligence he oversaw started under former Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen.\n",
      "\tHe said Nielsen and her deputies pressed him to vastly overstate the number of migrants apprehended at the southwest border who have confirmed links to any terrorist organization. That occurred as the Trump administration was rolling out tougher measures against illegal immigration. Murphy said he declined to confirm an inflated figure, saying to do so would be not only improper but illegal. The secretary nonetheless provided the incorrect figure to Congress.\n",
      "\tCuccinelli, he said, pressed him to change reports on conditions in El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras as the administration was seeking to halt a surge of people seeking asylum from Central America at the U.S.-Mexico border.\n",
      "\t\"Mr. Cuccinelli expressed frustration with the intelligence reports, and he accused unknown `deep state intelligence analysts' of compiling the intelligence information to undermine President Donald J. Trump's policy objectives with respect to asylum,\" he said in the complaint.\n",
      "\tMurphy said that over the summer he was instructed by Wolf and Cuccinelli to alter assessments on protests to make sure \"they matched up\" with Trump's statements on the involvement of antifa and anarchists in the demonstrations in Portland and elsewhere. He said he told them he would only report accurate information.\n",
      "\tShortly thereafter, Wolf reassigned him to the management division. That followed media reports that Murphy's unit collected information on journalists covering the DHS response to the protests. Murphy said the reports were incorrect and Wolf agreed but said it would be \"politically good\" to move him while the acting secretary hoped to be nominated to the secretary post by Trump.\n",
      "\tThe complaint, which also asks that officials who retaliated against Murphy be given written reprimands, was filed by Mark Zaid, a prominent attorney who also represented the whistle-blower who spurred the Trump impeachment inquiry.\n",
      "\tZaid said in a statement that Murphy \"followed proper, lawful whistleblower rules in reporting serious allegations of misconduct\" and would co-operate with congressional investigations into the matter, especially in a classified setting.\n",

      "\tPompeo spoke with counterparts from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations in an annual conference by video due to the coronavirus pandemic. Four of the members -- the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia and Brunei -- have been locked in the long-raging territorial conflict with China, along with Taiwan, over the busy waterway, which Beijing claims almost in its entirety.\n",
      "\tAlthough the U.S. lays no claim to the South China Sea, the Trump administration has recently imposed sanctions on Chinese officials responsible for Beijing's military buildup in the area. It includes airfields and radar and missile stations on islands constructed atop coral reefs, raising fears China may interfere with freedom of navigation in international waters.\n",
      "\t\"I think keep going, don't just speak up but act,\" Pompeo told top diplomats from the 10-nation bloc, without elaborating. A State Department spokeswoman said he pressed for a peaceful resolution of the disputes.\n",
      "\t\"Don't let the Chinese Communist Party walk over us and our people. You should have confidence and the American will be here in friendship to help you,\" he said.\n",
      "\tChina does not respect democratic values and principles of sovereignty, quality and territorial integrity enshrined in the ASEAN charter, Pompeo said. He cited the U.S. blacklisting of Chinese companies for their roles in constructing islands in the disputed waters that infringe on other states' claims.\n",
      "\tThe U.S. has deployed warships and fighter jets for what it calls freedom of navigation and overflight patrols.\n",
      "\tThere was no immediate comment from China or its foreign minister, Wang Yi, who was participating in the ASEAN meetings and separately met the group's ministers Wednesday. China has insisted it has right to safeguard its national interests and accuses Washington of interfering in regional affairs.\n",

      "\tASEAN, founded in 1967, has struggled to stay away from the escalating rivalry between Washington and Beijing. It has often asserted its \"centrality\" and regional leadership although some critics dismiss the group as a talk shop that is often vulnerable to the sway of world powers.\n",
      "\tDepending on how ASEAN deals with issues, \"they can either result in disaster or a new dawn of peace and stability for our region,\" Malaysian Foreign Minister Hishammuddin Hussein told colleagues on Tuesday.\n",

      "\tA new study suggests that cats may be catching the novel coronavirus at far higher rates than thought before, which could mean they have unique ways of fighting off the virus.\n",
      "\tThe findings were published last week in the journal Emerging Microbes & Infections, and describe how researchers from Huazhong Agricultural University took serum samples from 102 cats in Wuhan, China following its COVID-19 outbreak.\n",
      "\tAntibodies that fight against COVID-19 were found in 15 cats out of the 102.\n",
      "\tEleven of these cats also had neutralizing antibodies, which bind so tightly to the virus that they prevent infection.\n",
      "\tOut of the 11 cats, four were from pet hospitals, four had been abandoned, and three belonged to owners who had been diagnosed with COVID-19.\n",
      "\t“The three cats with the highest levels of antibodies were all owned by patients who had been diagnosed with COVID-19,” a press release on the study stated.\n",
      "\tBecause the antibodies were found in the cats after the human outbreak in Wuhan, researchers say it strongly suggests that the cats in question got the virus from humans.\n",
      "\tHowever, none of the cats with antibodies actually tested positive for COVID-19, had symptoms, or died from the virus.\n",
      "\tPrevious reports have shown that cats can test positive for COVID-19. This new research suggests that if these cats did not test positive, there could be more cats out there who have contracted the virus and developed antibodies, but didn’t test positive.\n",
      "\tTwo of the cats with the highest levels of antibodies belonged to the same owner, who had contracted COVID-19. Researchers were able to track these two cats over a longer period of time than the others to measure how long the antibodies were active within the cats. They reached their peak around 10 days after the antibodies were first detected in early March, but then decreased rapidly.\n",
      "\tBy June, there were virtually no neutralizing antibodies left.\n",
      "\tResearchers noted that although the cats developed antibodies, the transient nature of the antibody response in their bodies was closer to the reaction to a seasonal virus, as opposed to a more long-lasting immunity, indicating that the cats could now be at risk of reinfection.\n",
      "\tSo far, there has been no evidence of cat-to-human transmission of the virus, and not much is known about human-to-cat transmission, but researchers noted that caution should still be taken with pets.\n",
      "\t“Some preventive measures should be implemented to maintain a suitable distance between COVID-19 patients and companion animals such as cats and dogs, and hygiene and quarantine measures should also be established for those high-risk animals,” the study said. \n",

      "\tJapan's longest-serving prime minister, Shinzo Abe, said Friday he is stepping down because a chronic health problem has resurfaced. He told reporters that it was \"gut wrenching\" to leave many of his goals unfinished.\n",
      "\tAbe has had ulcerative colitis since he was a teenager and has said the condition was controlled with treatment. Concerns about his health began this summer and grew this month when he visited a Tokyo hospital two weeks in a row for unspecified health checkups. He is now on a new treatment that requires IV injections, he said. While there is some improvement, there is no guarantee that it will cure his condition and so he decided to step down after treatment Monday, he said.\n",
      "\t\"It is gut wrenching to have to leave my job before accomplishing my goals,\" Abe said Friday, mentioning his failure to resolve the issue of Japanese abducted years ago by North Korea, a territorial dispute with Russia and a revision of Japan's war-renouncing constitution.\n",
      "\tHe said his health problem was under control until earlier this year but was found to have worsened in June when he had an annual checkup.\n",
      "\t\"Faced with the illness and treatment, as well as the pain of lacking physical strength ... I decided I should not stay on as prime minister when I'm no longer capable of living up to the people's expectations with confidence,\" Abe said at a news conference.\n",
      "\tIn a country once known for its short-tenured prime ministers, the departure marks the end of an unusual era of stability that saw the Japanese leader strike up strong ties with U.S. President Donald Trump even as Abe's ultra-nationalism riled the Koreas and China. While he pulled Japan out of recession, the economy has been battered anew by the coronavirus pandemic, and Abe has failed to achieve his cherished goal of formally rewriting the U.S.-drafted pacifist constitution because of poor public support.\n",
      "\tAbe said he achieved a stronger Japan-U.S. security alliance and the first visit by a serving U.S. president to the atom-bombed city of Hiroshima. He also helped Tokyo gain the right to host the 2020 Olympics by pledging that a disaster at the Fukushima nuclear plant was \"under control\" when it was not.\n",
      "\tRecently, \"The coronavirus's impact on the economy was a blow to Abe, who was stuck at home and lacking an opportunity to make any achievement or show off his friendship with Trump, and was pushed into a corner,\" said Koichi Nakano, an international politics professor at Sophia University in Tokyo.\n",
      "\tAbe continued to bolster Japan's defence capability to respond to America's needs, Nakano said. \"For those who believe the Japan-U.S. alliance is paramount, that was his major achievement,\" he said. But Abe bulldozed his expanded defence policy and other contentious issues through parliament, repeatedly neglecting public opinion, Nakano said.\n",
      "\tAbe is a political blue blood who was groomed to follow in the footsteps of his grandfather, former Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi. His political rhetoric often focused on making Japan a \"normal\" and \"beautiful\" nation with a stronger military and bigger role in international affairs.\n",
      "\tAbe, whose term ends in September 2021, is expected to stay on until a new party leader is elected and formally approved by the parliament, a process which is expected to take several weeks.\n",
      "\tAbe became Japan's youngest prime minister in 2006, at age 52, but his overly nationalistic first stint abruptly ended a year later because of his health.\n",
      "\tIn December 2012, Abe returned to power, prioritizing economic measures over his nationalist agenda. He won six national elections and built a rock-solid grip on power, bolstering Japan's defence role and capability and its security alliance with the U.S. He also stepped up patriotic education at schools and raised Japan's international profile.\n",
      "\tAbe on Monday became Japan's longest-serving prime minister by consecutive days in office, eclipsing the record of Eisaku Sato, his great-uncle, who served 2,798 days from 1964 to 1972.\n",
      "\tBut his second hospital visit Monday accelerated speculation and political manoeuvring toward a post-Abe regime.\n",
      "\tUlcerative colitis causes inflammation and sometimes polyps in the bowels. People with the condition can have a normal life expectancy but serious cases can involve life-threatening complications.\n",
      "\tAfter his recent hospital visits were reported, top officials from Abe's Cabinet and the ruling party said he was overworked and badly needed rest.\n",
      "\tHis health concerns came as his support ratings plunged due to his handling of the coronavirus pandemic and its severe impact on the economy, on top of a stream of political scandals, including his own.\n",
      "\tThere are a slew of politicians eager to replace Abe.\n",
      "\tShigeru Ishiba, a 63-year-old hawkish former defence minister and Abe's archrival, is a favourite next leader in media surveys, though he is less popular within the governing party. A low-key former foreign minister, Fumio Kishida, Defence Minister Taro Kono, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga, and economic revitalization minister Yasutoshi Nishimura, who is in charge of coronavirus measures, are widely mentioned in Japanese media as potential successors.\n",
      "\tAbe was often upstaged in dealing with the coronavirus pandemic by Tokyo Gov. Yuriko Koike, a former governing party conservative who is seen as a potential prime minister candidate by some. But she would have to first be elected to parliament to be in the running for the top job.\n",
      "\tAnalysts say no major change of policy is expected whoever succeeds Abe, though Japan may return to an era of short-lived leadership.\n",
      "\tThe end of Abe's scandal-laden first stint as prime minister was the beginning of six years of annual leadership change, remembered as an era of \"revolving door\" politics that lacked stability and long-term policies.\n",
      "\tWhen he returned to office in 2012, Abe vowed to revitalize the nation and get its economy out of its deflationary doldrums with his \"Abenomics\" formula, which combines fiscal stimulus, monetary easing and structural reforms.\n",
      "\tPerhaps Abe's biggest regret was his inability to fulfil a long-cherished goal of his grandfather and himself to formally rewrite the pacifist constitution. Abe and his ultra-conservative supporters see the U.S.-drafted constitution as a humiliating legacy of Japan's World War II defeat.\n",
      "\tHe was also unable to achieve his goal of settling several unfinished wartime legacies, including normalizing ties with North Korea, settling island disputes with neighbours and signing a peace treaty with Russia formally ending their hostilities in World War II.\n",
      "\tAbe said he will focus on his treatment for now and \"continue his political activity and support a new administration as a lawmaker.\"\n",

      "\tAn opportunity to test a potential COVID-19 vaccine in Canadian clinical trials is now \"over\" because Chinese customs did not approve it for shipment to Canada, according to the National Research Council (NRC).\n",
      "\tThe NRC confirmed to CTV News on Thursday that CanSino Biologics \"does not have the authority\" from the Chinese government to ship the Ad5-nCoV vaccine candidate \"at this time.\"\n",
      "\t\"Due to the delay in the shipment of the vaccine doses to Canada it is evident this specific opportunity is over and the NRC is focusing its team and facilities on other partners and COVID-19 priorities,\" reads the emailed statement from the NRC.\n",
      "\tHeadquartered in Tianjin, China, CanSino signed an agreement with the NRC in May. After Health Canada's review and approval, the Canadian Center for Vaccinology was preparing to start clinical trials as early as June, but progress came to a standstill after Canadian authorities said the Chinese government was stalling the shipment process.\n",
      "\t\"The agreement between the NRC and CanSino was reviewed prior to signature by CanSino’s collaborators in the Chinese Government – the Beijing Institute of Technology and the Ministry of Science and Technology – who had provided funding to CanSino,\" the statement says.\n",
      "\t\"Subsequent to signing, the Government of China introduced process changes regarding shipping vaccines to other countries. The process is not clear to the NRC.\"\n",
      "\tCanSino Biologics did not respond to CTVNews.ca’s request for comment at the time this story was published.\n",
      "\tThe Ad5-nCoV vaccine candidate has already been sent to other countries including Russia, Chile, Argentina, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia for Phase 3 trials or large-scale testing on humans.\n",
      "\tHuman trials of the vaccine candidate are also in Phase 3 in China, with results promising enough that the Chinese government has approved it for use in its military. The vaccine was one of the first in the world to enter the second phase of human clinical trials after it presented no major safety issues.\n",
      "\tNormally, testing a vaccine can take five to seven years, but the anticipated Canadian clinical trials were expected to be fast-tracked through typical regulatory hurdles due to the urgency of the pandemic.\n",
      "\tCanSino's vaccine was developed using a cell line from the NRC that was previously used to produce an Ebola vaccine. The two organizations have worked together since 2013.\n",
      "\tMeanwhile, Canada's Foreign Affairs Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne downplayed suggestions that the vaccine partnership failed because of ongoing political tensions between Canada and China.\n",
      "\t\"I don't necessarily think so,\" Champagne told reporters Thursday. \"I can only speak for the Canadian side. I would not necessarily link whether that particular opportunity is linked to anything else.\"\n",
      "\tRelations have been tense since the Chinese detained Canadians Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor in apparent retaliation for the RCMP's arrest of Chinese tech executive Meng Wanzhou on an American extradition warrant in December 2018.\n",
      "\tDr. Scott Halperin, director of the Canadian Centre for Vaccinology, added that losing access to the vaccine may set Canada back in the fight against COVID-19.\n",
      "\t\"The CanSino vaccine is one of the most furthest along of any of the candidate vaccines so it would have been nice to do that study,\" Halperin said. \"It's not the only vaccine that we are working with ... but we certainly don't like to lose access to any one of them because we need multiple vaccines.\"\n",
      "\tHe notes that had his lab received the vaccine its study would have been \"well along by now.\"\n",
      "\t\"We thought the shipment would be coming any day, as did the company,\" he said. \"There was no bad faith on the company -- they were trying everything but they could not get (Chinese) government approval to ship it. The request for shipment hasn't been denied it just hasn't been approved.\"\n",
      "\tClinical pharmacologist Sabina Vohra-Miller says handing over that kind of asset without securing intellectual property rights on the vaccine was a major missed opportunity for Canada.\n",
      "\t\"This is a miss because you wouldn’t have that by-product if you didn’t have that foundational system of the cell line,\" she told CTV News.ca.\n",
      "\t\"We’re trying to be the noblest citizens in terms of advancing science and making sure that there is no gatekeeping with that, and you would expect that there would be a reciprocity on that.\"\n",
      "\tOn Wednesday, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told reporters several contracts are in the works to ensure Canada gets early access to potential COVID-19 vaccines.\n",
      "\t\"We’ve actually signed a number of deals with potential vaccine producers around the world. The issue is nobody yet has a vaccine and nobody knows who’s going to develop the vaccine so like many, many countries around the world, we’re working with a range of partners to ensure that when someone does find a vaccine Canadians will have access to it.\"\n",
      "\tThe Canadian government also announced in May that it was planning a $44-million upgrade to a NRC facility in Montreal to prepare for the possibility of a large-scale Ad5-nCoV manufacturing effort should human trials be successful.\n",
      "\tWhile multiple trials around the world are progressing, there is currently no accepted cure or vaccine for the novel coronavirus.\n",

      "\tCriminal networks are profiting from an \"overwhelming\" surge in plastic waste being shipped from rich countries to Asia and stoking pollution by burning and dumping waste that was supposed to be recycled, a report by Interpol said Thursday.\n",
      "\tPlastic consumption has exploded in the last decade, with some 360 million metric tons of waste generated just in 2018, mainly by wealthier nations, Interpol said.\n",
      "\tAt least 8 million tons of plastic are thought to end up in oceans every year.\n",
      "\tSome countries have imposed recycling targets, rising above 30 per cent in Europe, and the report said this had helped drive a lucrative market for used plastic that is projected to reach $50.36 billion by 2022.\n",
      "\tBut it has also spurred unscrupulous operators to cash in on an industry that is difficult to police, Interpol said, adding there was an \"urgent\" need to identify how criminals were exploiting loopholes in regulation.\n",
      "\tThe France-based intergovernmental crime-fighting agency said organised criminal networks use legitimate pollution management businesses as a cover for illegal operations, and that waste crime was behind environmental destruction and even murder.\n",
      "\t\"Global plastic pollution is one of the most pervasive environmental threats to the planet today, and its correct regulation and management is of critical importance to global environmental security,\" said Calum MacDonald, who heads Interpol's Environmental Compliance and Enforcement Committee Advisory Board, in a statement.\n",
      "\tThe report, written with input from 40 countries, said that many recycling targets were impossible to verify given the \"poor visibility\" into whether waste was in fact recycled.\n",
      "\tThis is of particular concern in countries that do not have the capacity to process even their own domestic rubbish and struggle to enforce regulations.\n",
      "\tInterpol said some major destination countries report high waste mismanagement rates, including India (87 per cent), Indonesia (83 per cent) and Malaysia (57 per cent).\n",
      "\t\"Those numbers indicate that exporting nations may report artificially high recycling rate for their plastic waste, while in fact strong uncertainties remain on how plastic waste shipped overseas is treated,\" the report said.\n",
      "\tIllicit shipments of waste -- from homes and supermarkets in Europe and North America among others -- have surged towards South and Southeast Asian nations in the last two years after restrictions on imports were tightened in China in early 2018.\n",
      "\tAs the market shrank in China, which previously processed almost half the world's plastic waste, firms moved their business to neighbouring countries, the report said, adding that the quantities of waste had proved \"overwhelming\" for some nations.\n",
      "\tIt said this had spurred growing illegal waste treatment in emerging destination countries, with a pronounced increase in plastic waste being diverted to unauthorized recycling facilities.\n",
      "\tAn example is the small town of Jenjarom, not far from Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia, where plastic processing plants suddenly appeared in large numbers in 2018, with huge mounds of waste piled up in the open and burned, pumping out noxious fumes.\n",
      "\tSeveral Southeast Asian nations are trying to push back on this onslaught of international refuse, but Interpol said efforts to repatriate waste remain \"long and challenging\" and shipments can end up stuck in ports for months or even years.\n",
      "\tEarlier this year Malaysia sent back dozens of shipping containers of plastic waste to mostly wealthier nations, saying it would not be the world's \"garbage dump\".\n",
      "\tChallenges include identifying where the waste has come from, as networks re-route illegal shipments and use transit countries to disguise their origin, Interpol said.\n",
      "\tIt warned that even as restrictions tighten in some nations, traders would re-route shipments to \"new and vulnerable countries,\" noting illegal plastic waste shipments had already been detected heading towards Laos and Myanmar.\n",
      "\tThe illegal activity does not only touch Asian nations.\n",
      "\tInterpol said organized crime groups were operating in parts of Europe, warning that related waste crimes were becoming \"more complex and increasingly threatening\".\n",
      "\tIn France, it said the mayor of the town of Signes was murdered in August 2019 for trying to prevent illegal waste being dumped.\n",
      "\tThe report said greater international co-operation was needed to curb waste crime, even as rules are set to be tightened from 2021.\n",
      "\tCommenting on the research, WWF-International called for \"systemic change and greater accountability\" in the way plastic waste is used and disposed of.\n",
      "\t\"Waste crime is a rising threat with roots in a more fundamental problem: the inability to manage our plastic use and production,\" said Eirik Lindebjerg, global plastics policy manager at WWF-International.\n",

      "\tFor now, the basketball courts in the NBA's virus-free bubble at Disney World remained empty. And other athletes across the sports world also said they weren't ready to resume playing.\n",
      "\tThey are still angry and emotional after the shooting of Jacob Blake, a Black man, by police in Kenosha, Wisconsin. NBA players considered not playing again the rest of the post-season and going home to their communities, although they decided Thursday they wanted to continue, according to a person with knowledge of the details. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because no official announcement had been made.\n",
      "\t\"We obviously agree that whether we play or not, we still have to do our best to make change and we still have to do our part in the community,\" Orlando guard Michael Carter-Williams said in a video interview with a Magic public relations official.\n",
      "\t\"It's obviously not easy, given everything that's going on. But I think that if we can go out there and do our best and also have a list of things that we want to accomplish, everything gets completed.\"\n",
      "\tThe NBA decided to postpone three more games Thursday to join the three that weren't played a day earlier.\n",
      "\tNBA spokesman Mike Bass said the league hoped to resume Friday or Saturday. He added in as statement that a group of players at Disney would hold a video conference call later Thursday with representatives of the owners, including Michael Jordan, and National Basketball Players Association to discuss the next steps.\n",
      "\tThe tennis tours had already decided they would pause play Thursday at the Western & Southern Open in Flushing Meadows, New York; a number of NFL teams cancelled practices; and pressure was being put on the NHL by members of the Hockey Diversity Alliance to postpone its two second-round playoff games.\n",
      "\tA second night of WNBA games were also postponed and other teams and sports pondered whether they would play on.\n",
      "\t\"This is not a strike. This is not a boycott. This is a affirmatively day of reflection, a day of informed action and mobilization,\" WNBA players' union president Nneka Ogwumike said on ESPN.\n",
      "\tThe Oakland Athletics decided not to play their game against the Texas Rangers. Three Major League Baseball games were postponed Wednesday, although others went on.\n",
      "\tThe sudden stoppages was reminiscent of March, when the NBA suspended its season after Utah centre Rudy Gobert tested positive for the coronavirus. Other sports quickly followed until the worldwide sporting landscape had almost completely come to a halt.\n",
      "\tNBA players agreed to resume their season in July at Disney, making clear they intended to chase social justice reform just as passionately as a championship. But the video of Blake's shooting on Sunday left them so disgusted and dispirited that they wondered whether they should continue playing.\n",
      "\tThe players voiced their frustrations in a meeting Wednesday night, then continued talks Thursday morning. As they prepared to do that, NBA referees led a march around campus to show their support in the fight against racism.\n",
      "\tPlay had been set to resume at 4 p.m. with Game 6 of the Western Conference series between Utah and Denver. Boston and Toronto were also to begin their second-round series before the Clippers and Dallas met in the nightcap.\n",
      "\tIt was the Raptors and Celtics who had been most vocal about the idea of not playing, but the Milwaukee Bucks acted first when they opted to remain in their locker room instead of playing their Game 5 against Orlando on Wednesday. Kenosha is about 40 miles south of Milwaukee.\n",
      "\tBefore coming to Disney, many NBA players wrestled for weeks about whether it was even right to play, fearing that a return to games would take attention off the deaths of, among others, Breonna Taylor and George Floyd in recent months.\n",
      "\tThey ultimately decided that playing would give them the largest platform -- while also providing a bigger target for critics.\n",
      "\tThe NBA's relationship with the White House eroded when Donald Trump was elected after President Barack Obama was close with some players and officials. Trump was critical of the league again Thursday.\n",
      "\t\"They've become like a political organization, and that's not a good thing,\" Trump told reporters, noting that the league's ratings are down from previous seasons. \"I don't think that's a good thing for sports or for the country.\"\n",
      "\tEarlier Thursday, Vice-President Mike Pence's chief of staff Marc Short said in a CNN interview that the NBA protests are \"absurd and silly\" when compared to their response to ongoing to human rights violations in China.\n",

      "\tGermany and France drew up tougher rules on Thursday in line with a growing number of countries battling a resurgence in coronavirus infections with Paris making masks obligatory in all public places in a bid to curb a rise of new cases in the city.\n",
      "\tEuropean countries are seeing an increase in infections even as they struggle to balance new restrictions against the need for their economies to recover from the devastating impact of the first round of lockdowns.\n",
      "\tBritain, South Korea and Rwanda are also tightening their restrictions as fears rise of a return to the draconian anti-virus curbs put in place earlier in the year.\n",
      "\tThe pandemic has killed more than 826,000 people worldwide since surfacing in China late last year and more than 24 million infections have been recorded.\n",
      "\tGermany, the European Union's biggest economy, will impose tougher rules on mask wearing and keep football fans out of stadiums until at the least the end of the year, under a draft proposal seen by AFP.\n",
      "\tThe measures -- such as a minimum fine of 50 euros ($59) for flouting requirements on mask wearing -- are likely to be officially agreed later Thursday.\n",
      "\tAs in other countries, Germany's surge in coronavirus cases in recent weeks has been mainly blamed on summer travel and friends and family gatherings.\n",
      "\tFrench Prime Minister Jean Castex announced on Thursday masks will be compulsory in all public places in the capital Paris, one of the hardest hit regions in France.\n",
      "\tOfficial figures released in France on Wednesday showed more than 5,400 confirmed new cases in just 24 hours, with admissions to hospital and intensive care units on the rise.\n",
      "\tCastex has warned a new lockdown cannot be ruled out even if the government will try to do everything to avoid one.\n",
      "\tEuropean government officials are also trying to instill discipline in their ranks to retain public trust in measures that restrict freedoms.\n",
      "\tEuropean Union trade boss Phil Hogan was forced to step down over a breach of guidelines in his home country of Ireland.\n",
      "'HIGHLY UNCERTAIN'\n",
      "\tBritain, which left the EU in January, meanwhile reversed course and has called on students to wear masks when they return to class from next week.\n",
      "\tKeeping mask wearing and other restrictions in place, Rwanda has lengthened its evening curfew and prevented movement in and out of the western area of Rusizi after a recent infections surge.\n",
      "\tRwanda on Tuesday hit a record 217 cases in one day and has recorded a third of its 3,625 cases in the past 10 days, with authorities blaming the spike on complacency and fatigue with social distancing measures.\n",
      "\tIn South Korea, the parliament was shut down on Thursday and a group of lawmakers were in self-quarantine as the country recorded more than 400 new coronavirus infections.\n",
      "\tThe country endured one of the worst early outbreaks of COVID19 outside mainland China before bringing it broadly under control with extensive tracing and testing.\n",
      "\tThe United States, however, broke with the toughening trend even though it leads the world in virus deaths and infections.\n",
      "\tU.S. authorities now say asymptomatic people don't need to test for COVID-19 if they have been exposed to someone diagnosed with the virus.\n",
      "\tThey had previously encouraged such people to get tested, but U.S. media reported political interference from the White House.\n",
      "'HISTORIC' SWISS PLUNGE\n",
      "\tU.S. President Donald Trump has long been accused by critics of trying to play down the scale of the pandemic and focus on economic recovery ahead of his re-election bid in November.\n",
      "\tThe U.S. recovery from the coronavirus economic downturn is \"highly uncertain\" and many businesses will continue to struggle, a top Federal Reserve official said Wednesday.\n",
      "\tSwitzerland was the latest example to show how the pandemic has brought the global economy to its knees.\n",
      "\tSwitzerland, official figures showed, has plunged into recession after the coronavirus pandemic caused a \"historic\" 8.2-percent slump in economic activity in the second quarter.\n",
      "\tEconomies have picked up generally since then though there are concerns that the recovery appears to be slowing as coronavirus cases mount again, stoking fears of a repeat of the economically damaging lockdowns seen earlier this year.\n",
      "\tIn the growing toll on the air transport sector that has seen aircraft grounded worldwide, British aerospace giant Rolls-Royce on Thursday logged a £5.4 billion ($7.1 billion) net loss for the first half of 2020.\n",
      "\tAnd flag carrier Air New Zealand announced a roughly US$300 million annual net loss after demand plummeted due to the pandemic.\n",
      "\tHopes for economic revival are partly pinned on the development of a vaccine, which companies and governments worldwide are racing to develop.\n",
      "\tPeru on Wednesday began registering volunteers for clinical trials of a Chinese vaccine against the coronavirus.\n",

      "\tThe third night of the Republican National Convention was filled with both egregious dishonesty and careless inaccuracy.\n",
      "\tLike nights one and two, Wednesday's proceedings featured false claims related to the coronavirus pandemic, Democrats, the economy, immigration and other important subjects.\n",
      "\tOn Wednesday, some of the speakers also just got things wrong for no apparent strategic reason — one citing a fake Abraham Lincoln quote, one wrongly claiming James Madison signed the Declaration of Independence.\n",
      "\tHere is a list of fact checks of both consequential and minor claims:\n",
      "\tVice President Mike Pence addressed the pandemic with words of hope for Americans, claiming, \"We're on track to have the world's first safe, effective coronavirus vaccine by the end of this year.\"\n",
      "Facts First: Though there are several vaccine candidates in different phases of testing, there is no guarantee that the Food and Drug Administration will have approved a vaccine by the end of the year. And even once one is approved, it will likely still be many months before it's widely available across the U.S.\n",
      "\tA vaccine developed by the biotechnology company Moderna and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) is in the final phase of its clinical trial, after promising initial results.\n",
      "\tIn interviews last month, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of NIAID, made clear that while a vaccine could be approved by or possibly before November, as the president has previously proposed, it would likely not be available widely until \"several months\" into 2021.\n",
      "\t-- Tara Subramaniam\n",
      "\tIn his speech, Pence claimed that \"Joe Biden is for open borders.\"\n",
      "Facts First: No matter how many times this is repeated, it remains untrue. \n",
      "\tWhile Biden is proposing a much less restrictive immigration policy than President Donald Trump's, he is not proposing completely unfettered migration.\n",
      "\t-- Holmes Lybrand\n",
      "\tPence claimed that the Trump administration banned all travel from China to the U.S. in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak.\n",
      "\"[T]he President took unprecedented action and suspended all travel from China,\" Pence said. \n",
      "Facts First: This is incorrect. Trump never suspended \"all\" travel from China. His travel restrictions banned most foreign nationals who had been in China within the past 14 days - but exempted U.S. citizens, permanent residents, and many of the family members of both groups. Flights from China continued, and tens of thousands of people traveled from China to the U.S. in the months after Trump's travel restriction went into place.\n",
      "\t-- Holmes Lybrand\n",
      "\tIn his remarks, Pence highlighted Dave Patrick Underwood, a law enforcement officer who was shot and killed earlier this year.\n",
      "\tPence commended Underwood, \"an officer in the Department of Homeland Security's Federal Protective Service, who was shot and killed during the riots in Oakland, California.\"\n",
      "Facts First: Underwood was killed in a drive-by shooting, not in a riot.\n",
      "\tAt the time of his murder, there was a protest against police brutality happening nearby.\n",
      "\tOne of the suspects in the shooting is allegedly linked to the extremist Boogaloo movement, and federal authorities, according to the Washington Post, argue he was trying to use the protests to stoke racial violence.\n",
      "-- Tara Subramaniam\n",
      "\tDenouncing former Vice President Joe Biden's record on foreign policy, Pence claimed that Biden \"even opposed the operation that took down Osama Bin Laden.\"\n",
      "Facts First: There is a solid basis for this accusation: Biden himself said in 2012 that he had advised Obama \"don't go\" -- don't launch the raid -- without first obtaining more information. \n",
      "\tBiden's account of his private advice to Obama has changed over time, but former top officials in the Obama administration have written in their memoirs that Biden was \"against the operation,\" that he was \"firmly in favor of waiting for more information,\" and that he was concerned about the risks of a raid.\n",
      "\tIn a revised October 2015 account of what happened, Biden said that he did not actually give Obama a \"don't go\" opinion at the 2011 meeting. (He said he had merely suggested that they should make \"one more pass\" with a surveillance drone to make sure bin Laden was present.)\n",
      "\tRather, he said, he withheld his opinion until he was alone with Obama after the meeting -- then made clear to Obama, \"as we walked out of the room, and walked upstairs,\" that \"I thought he should go.\"\n",
      "\t(You can read a longer CNN fact check here.)\n",
      "\t-- Daniel Dale\n",
      "\tPence touted the Trump administration's efforts to reform the VA, and suggested that as a result, \"Veterans Choice is now available to every veteran.\"\n",
      "Facts First: The Veterans Choice bill was a bipartisan initiative that was signed into law by President Barack Obama in 2014. In 2018, Trump signed the VA Mission Act, which expanded and changed the program.\n",
      "\tWith this claim, Pence took a page from the President's book. Trump has lied about getting veterans choice more than 150 times.\n",
      "\t-- Tara Subramaniam\n",
      "\tPence claimed that the Trump administration inherited \"an economy struggling to break out of the slowest recovery since the Great Depression.\"\n",
      "Facts First: While it's true that the US economy recovered more slowly after the Great Recession than after any other on record, this needs context. \n",
      "\tIn terms of the average pace of GDP growth, the recovery from the Great Recession is the slowest expansion since World War II, when the government started tracking quarterly GDP.\n",
      "\tBut while the recovery was slow, it was one of the longest expansions on record, lasting more than 10 years. It ended just this year due to the pandemic. Since World War II, the American economy has typically grown for about five years and then slowed down.\n",
      "\tIn terms of job creation, the recovery from the Great Recession was stronger than the 2001 to 2007 expansion under President George W. Bush.\n",
      "-- Katie Lobosco\n",
      "\tLara Trump, the President's daughter-in-law, claimed that \"4.3 million new jobs have been created for women\" during the Trump administration.\n",
      "Facts First: This is false. While female employment grew by 3.7 million between January 2017, when Trump took office, and February of this year, Lara Trump completely disregarded the devastating force of the COVID-19 pandemic. Including the pandemic, female employment has actually fallen by 3.9 million between January 2017 and July 2020.\n",
      "\tWomen have been hit harder by this recession than by previous ones. The crisis wiped out more jobs in sectors that employ more women than men, such as hospitality. While many jobs have resurfaced since the lockdown shock, female employment is still down 7.6 million from February of this year.\n",
      "\tThe spring lockdown to curb the spread of the virus collapsed America's job market. In April alone, more than 20 million jobs vanished. As of July, the country is still nearly 13 million jobs short compared with February .\n",
      "-- Anneken Tappe\n",
      "\tLara Trump also said, \"Abraham Lincoln once famously said, 'America will never be destroyed from the outside. If we falter and lose our freedoms, it will be because we destroyed ourselves.' \"\n",
      "\tShe added that even those words were spoken long ago, \"never have they been more relevant.\"\n",
      "Facts First: While this quote has circulated online, Lincoln did not say it in those words, according to PolitiFact and Snopes. \n",
      "\tChristian McWhirter, a historian at the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum, told PolitiFact that the quote mangles a speech the 16th president made in 1838.\n",
      "\tIn it, Lincoln said, \"At what point then is the approach of danger to be expected? I answer, if it ever reach us, it must spring up amongst us. It cannot come from abroad. If destruction be our lot, we must ourselves be its author and finisher. As a nation of freemen, we must live through all time, or die by suicide.\"\n",
      "-- Alex Rogers\n",
      "\tAfter sharing a personal story about getting a phone call from Trump following her preventative mastectomy, White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said, \"This president stands by Americans with preexisting conditions.\" She added, that \"the same way President Trump has supported me, he supports you.\"\n",
      "Facts First: This needs context. Though the President has repeatedly asserted his support for covering individuals with preexisting conditions, his administration has consistently taken steps to undermine the Affordable Care Act without presenting alternative plans that would offer similar benefits. \n",
      "\tThe Trump administration and congressional Republicans have repeatedly put forward bills and filed lawsuits that would weaken Obamacare's protections for people with preexisting conditions.\n",
      "\tTrump is also supporting a Republican lawsuit that is seeking to declare all of Obamacare void. He has not issued a plan to reinstate the law's protections for people with preexisting conditions if the suit succeeds.\n",
      "\tIn early August, he promised he would issue an executive order to require health insurers to \"cover all preexisting conditions for all customers,\" but has not yet done so.\n",
      "\t-- Tara Subramaniam\n",
      "\tNew York Rep. Elise Stefanik said that the impeachment of President Donald Trump was not only \"baseless\" and a \"sham\" but \"illegal.\"\n",
      "Facts First: The impeachment of Trump was not illegal. The Constitution grants the House \"the sole power of impeachment.\" \n",
      "\tIn December, the House exercised that power for the third time in U.S history, charging Trump with two crimes: abuse of power, for pressuring Ukraine to investigate his political rival Joe Biden while withholding U.S. security assistance and a coveted White House meeting, and obstructing Congress in its investigation.\n",
      "\tThe House voted to impeach the President and the Senate voted to acquit him largely on party lines.\n",
      "-- Alex Rogers\n",
      "\tFormer acting Director of National Intelligence and US Ambassador to Germany Ric Grenell claimed the \"Obama-Biden administration secretly launched a surveillance operation on the Trump campaign.\"\n",
      "Facts First: There is no evidence that Obama or Biden personally directed the FBI to surveil people in the Trump campaign. \n",
      "\tThe investigation opened by the FBI in the summer of 2016 was probing Russia's efforts to meddle in the presidential election and whether any Trump campaign associates were involved in that effort.\n",
      "\tA report by the Justice Department inspector general found that there was no political conspiracy to undermine Trump's 2016 campaign and that the start of the probe was justified. It did find that there were major errors in how the FBI conducted the probe.\n",
      "\t-- Jenny Hansler\n",
      "\tJack Brewer, a former NFL player and a member of Black Voices for Trump, claimed that Donald Trump didn't call white supremacists \"very fine.\"\n",
      "\t\"Are you going to allow the media to lie to you by falsely claiming that he said there were 'very fine white supremacists' in Charlottesville? He didn't say that, it's a lie.\"\n",
      "Facts First: The media never claimed that Trump said \"there were 'very fine white supremacists' in Charlottesville\", so while Brewer is correct that Trump didn't say that, he's wrong to suggest the media reported Trump as specifically saying that. \n",
      "\tIn the aftermath of 2017's Unite the Right rally that took place in Charlottesville, Virginia, Trump said of the organizers \"you had some very bad people in that group, but you also had people that were very fine people, on both sides.\"\n",
      "\tTrump's comments came at a news conference on August 15, 2017, and he was referring to a march that took place on August 11. It was widely reported in the media that the march was organized by white nationalists, led by white nationalists and that the people in the march were chanting white nationalist slogans.\n",
      "\tTrump did condemn white nationalists at the same press conference -- \"I'm not talking about the neo-Nazis and the white nationalists, because they should be condemned totally,\" Trump said -- but then said, \"But you had many people in that group other than neo-Nazis and white nationalists, OK? And the press has treated them absolutely unfairly.\"\n",
      "\tThe Trump campaign and his supporters routinely claim that this proves Trump condemned White supremacists at the rally, but there's no evidence that anyone other than white supremacists attended the Unite the Right rally that sparked the protests and ensuing violence, so his claim that when he talked about \"very fine\" people in the march, he wasn't talking about white supremacists, is specious.\n",
      "-- Nate McDermott\n",
      "\tTennessee Sen. Marsha Blackburn said of Democrats she didn't identify: \"They say we can't gather in community groups, but encourage protest, riots, and looting in the streets.\"\n",
      "Facts First: Blackburn's claim about riots and looting is an exaggeration. While there are scattered examples of Democrats making comments that can be seen as supporting riots, the party and Democratic leadership have not \"encourage(d)\" violent protests. \n",
      "\tBiden has explicitly condemned such protest, both in a speech in June and in a Wednesday video statement released after Blackburn recorded this speech.\n",
      "\t\"[T]here is no place for violence,\" Biden said. \"No place for looting or destroying property or burning churches, or destroying businesses -- many of them built by people of color who for the first time were beginning to realize their dreams and build wealth for their families.\"\n",
      "\tCongressman James Clyburn told the Washington Post on June 3 that \"peaceful protest is our game. Violence is their game,\" adding, \"This looting and rioting, that's their game. We cannot allow ourselves to play their game.\" These are just two examples of the many Democratic leaders who have criticized the riots and looting.\n",
      "\tBlackburn could, like other conservatives, make a subjective argument that Democratic cities and states have not done enough to denounce or discourage protest violence -- and it's possible she could find some Democratic official somewhere in the country who has cheered on a riot. But her suggestion that Democrats as a group have encouraged riots and looting is misleading.\n",
      "\t-- Daniel Dale and Holmes Lybrand\n",
      "\tBlackburn exaggerated Democrats' views on coronavirus restrictions, then misleadingly described a remark about China by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.\n",
      "\tBlackburn exaggerated by claiming that Democrats want people locked in their homes until they become \"dependent on the government for everything.\" (While some Democrats have called for additional stay-home orders to help stop the spread of the coronavirus, they are not seeking endless lockdowns for the purpose of fostering dependence.) Blackburn then said that this supposed Democratic position is reminiscent of \"Communist China.\" (It's worth noting that many vibrant industrialized democracies had longer mandatory lockdowns than the US)\n",
      "\tAnd then she continued: \"Maybe that's why Joe Biden is so soft on them. Why Nancy Pelosi says that 'China would prefer Joe Biden.' Yeah. I bet they would.\"\n",
      "Facts First: Blackburn's claim about Pelosi was misleading in two ways. First, Pelosi did not personally argue that China would prefer Biden. Rather, in a CNN interview on August 9, Pelosi made clear that she was quoting the view of the US intelligence community, not speaking for herself. Second, the intelligence community reported that China wants Trump to lose because it sees him as \"unpredictable,\" not because Biden is perceived to be friendly to Chinese interests. \n",
      "\tSpeaking to CNN's Dana Bash on August 9, Pelosi argued that what the intelligence community has concluded about China is \"not equivalent\" to its conclusion about Russia. She noted that the intelligence community has found that China would prefer Biden, but that Russia has been actively interfering in the election to hurt Biden.\n",
      "\tPelosi's exact words: \"What they said is, China would prefer Joe Biden. Whether they do -- that's their conclusion, that they would prefer Joe Biden. Russia is actively, 24/7 interfering in our election.\"\n",
      "\t-- Daniel Dale\n",
      "\tSister Dede Byrne, a member of the Little Workers of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary, asserted, \"President Trump will stand up against Biden-Harris, who are the most anti-life presidential ticket ever, even supporting the horrors of late-term abortion and infanticide.\"\n",
      "Facts First: This is false. No politician from either party -- and, really, no one -- supports infanticide, or killing a baby that's been born, which is illegal. \n",
      "\tDemocrats generally favor less restrictive abortion laws and several states allow abortions later in pregnancy.\n",
      "\tAccording to their campaign website, Biden and Harris support codifying Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 Supreme Court ruling that legalized abortion nationwide prior to viability, which can occur at about 24 weeks of pregnancy.\n",
      "-- Caroline Kelly\n",
      "\tIowa Sen. Joni Ernst said, \"The Democratic Party of Joe Biden is pushing this so-called Green New Deal.\" She continued by alleging that \"if given power, they would essentially ban animal agriculture...\"\n",
      "Facts First: This claim about animal agriculture is baseless. While we can't definitively fact-check what might happen in the future, Biden's platform does not include anything even close to a ban. The Green New Deal resolution introduced by other Democrats in 2019 also does not include anything resembling a ban. \n",
      "\tBiden's climate plan says he will \"create new opportunities to support deployment of methane digesters,\" which turn waste produced by cattle and other animals into electricity. The plan also says Biden will \"invest in climate-friendly farming such as conservation programs for cover crops and other practices aimed at restoring the soil and building soil carbon, and in the process, preventing run-off and helping family farmers deploy the latest technologies to maximize productivity.\"\n",

      "CONTENT : OTTAWA -- \n",
      "\tCanada's foreign minister was bound for London for private talks with a trusted ally after butting heads with leading figures from Lebanon and China, capping a bubble-bursting, four-country tour amid an unprecedented global pandemic.\n",
      "\tForeign Affairs Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne met face to face Thursday with Lebanese President Michel Aoun in Beirut, exhorting him to bend to the will of his country's \"street\" and heed their calls for reform.\n",
      "\tA day earlier in Rome, Champagne crossed paths, unexpectedly, with his Chinese counterpart, the hard-nosed Wang Yi, and told him in no uncertain terms that Canada has the world's liberal democracies on its side as he ratcheted up his push for the release of Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor.\n",
      "\t\"I was very clear that coercive diplomacy is not going to lead to the desired outcome,\" Champagne said in a conference call from Lebanon on Thursday, where he had the first chance to rebut a Chinese ministry spokesman dismissing his latest advocacy for \"the two Michaels.\"\n",
      "\t\"He (Wang) is well-aware that the international community is seized of that issue. This is not just two Canadians being detained arbitrarily. Those are two citizens of liberal democracy, and every liberal democracy in the world should be concerned.\"\n",
      "\tChampagne said his meeting with Wang -- a \"robust\" 90-minute talk that focused on the \"two Michaels\" and human rights concerns -- was brokered by the Italian foreign ministry after he discovered they were in the same city.\n",
      "\tKovrig and Spavor have been imprisoned in China since December 2018 in what is widely seen as retaliation for Canada's arrest of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou on an American extradition warrant.\n",
      "\tChampagne pushed Wang to allow Canadian diplomats to visit Kovrig and Spavor, access that has been denied since early this year. China says it can't allow access to their prisons during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n",
      "\t\"I reminded him that Canada will always insist of having consular access to both Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, and that we expect them to respect the spirit and the letter of the Vienna Convention,\" said Champagne, referring to the international agreement on consular access.\n",
      "\tWhile winning the release of Kovrig and Spavor remains Champagne's top priority, the Aug. 4 explosion in Beirut, which exacerbated a simmering political crisis in Lebanon, is also galvanizing the minister for a very real domestic political reason -- the 200,000-strong Lebanese community in Canada has also been loudly calling for change in their homeland.\n",
      "\tThe Aoun meeting was the centrepiece of a four-country trip this week that saw Champagne shed his COVID-19 cocoon of video diplomacy and join the likes of Wang and U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in taking to the world's skies. He flew on commercial airlines and will have to quarantine for 14 days when he returns to Canada.\n",
      "\tPrior to arriving in Lebanon, he visited Switzerland and Italy, where he also met a series of politicians and host of representatives from international agencies.\n",
      "\tChampagne appeared grim faced in a tweeted photo of his meeting with Aoun, in which he affirmed Canada's solidarity with the people of Lebanon who have been demanding change since the explosion that killed 200 people, injured 6,000 and flattened districts of Beirut.\n",
      "\t\"My key messages to President Aoun today was: There cannot be aid without real reforms. That impunity must cease. That youth, young women, the street has spoken. And that the way forward is clear now,\" Champagne said.\n",
      "\tLebanese people have taken to the streets demanding an independent investigation into the explosion and to protest widespread corruption in their country. Champagne also met with victims, rank-and-file Lebanese, first responders and international agencies trying to help the country.\n",
      "\t\"I thought there was something symbolic to be one of the first foreign ministers to come here and to show support and to listen to the people,\" he said.\n",
      "\t\"And to speak loud and clear to the authorities as to what we see is needed to ensure a more inclusive and better future for Lebanon.\"\n",
      "\tChampagne posted a video on Twitter from the burned-out hulk of the city's decimated port after his meeting with Aoun.\n",
      "\t\"You can smell destruction. You can feel destruction, you can see also the resilience of the Lebanese people,\" the minister said, against a vast backdrop of brown and grey ruin.\n",
      "\t\"We have said we will be there for Lebanon and I can assure you what you're seeing is only part of the destruction. You cannot even see with your own eyes the size of that destruction.\"\n",
      "\tChampagne's trip will end in London where he will meet in person with British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab.\n",
      "\tThe two will talk behind closed doors -- face-to-face and without the long-distance digital link that already brings them together at least once a week.\n",
      "\tChina, as well as the instability in Hong Kong, Belarus and Mali, along with his first-hand account of Lebanon, and descriptions of his meetings with various figures were all going to feature in his discussion with Raab, said Champagne.\n",
      "\tHe said the talks would be part of his efforts to \"broaden an alliance of liberal democracies\" to confront various global crises.\n",
      "\t\"I'm sure we could spend a day,\" Champagne quipped. \"With Secretary Raab, we have one of the closest relationships I have built between a foreign minister, and I think it's serving Canadian interests very well.\"\n",

      "\tWalmart said Thursday it may join Microsoft to buy the U.S. business of TikTok, the popular Chinese-owned video app that has come under fire from the Trump administration.\n",
      "\tMicrosoft and TikTok declined to comment.\n",
      "\tTikTok, through its fun, goofy videos, has gained hundreds of millions of users globally. But the White House is pushing TikTok's Chinese owner ByteDance to sell its U.S. business if it wants to keep operating in the country, citing security risks.\n",
      "\tWalmart said in a statement that a deal with Microsoft and TikTok could help it expand its advertising business and reach more shoppers.\n",
      "\tThe Trump administration is forcing a sale of TikTok's U.S. operations because of its Chinese ownership and has threatened to ban the app, which TikTok says has 100 million U.S. users. TikTok has sued to stop the ban, but not the sale order. Microsoft has confirmed discussions with TikTok; other tech companies such as Oracle are also reportedly interested in a possible acquisition.\n",
      "\tOver past year, TikTok has tried to put distance between its app and its Chinese ownership. It installed former top Disney executive Kevin Mayer as its American CEO, but he resigned Thursday after just a few months on the job.\n",
      "\tIn a letter to employees, Mayer said that his decision to leave comes after the \"political environment has sharply changed.\"\n",
      "\tByteDance launched TikTok in 2017, then bought Musical.ly, a video service popular with teens in the U.S. and Europe, and combined the two. A twin service, Douyin, is available for Chinese users.\n",
      "\tU.S. authorities are concerned that TikTok would turn over user data to Chinese authorities and that it censors content that would upset China. TikTok denies that it has shared user data with the Chinese government and would not do so if asked, nor censored videos at Chinese authorities' request, and says it is not a national-security threat.\n",
      "\tThe sale situation has been unusual, with President Donald Trump demanding payment for the U.S. government for its part in orchestrating a deal, a step that experts say is unprecedented. The president said on Aug. 18 that Oracle was \"a great company\" that \"could handle\" buying TikTok. He declined to state a preference between Oracle and Microsoft as buyers.\n",
      "\tMicrosoft and Walmart are already business partners, with Microsoft providing cloud computing services that help run the retailer's stores and online shopping. The two companies signed a 5-year partnership in 2018, enabling them to join forces against shared rival Amazon.\n",

      "\tA group of some of Canada's leading doctors and pharmacists have issued an open letter to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, urging the federal government to address shortages for critical drugs such as Azithromycin, Lorazepam and Remdesivir that could \"imperil the lives\" of Canadians amid the COVID-19 pandemic\n",
      "\tThe Critical Drugs Coalition issued the letter on Thursday, asking the government to bring attention and resources to Canada's drug supply challenges. These challenges have existed for the past decade but doctors say they have been \"greatly exacerbated\" due to the novel coronavirus.\n",
      "\t\"We simply cannot afford to jeopardize the lives and wellbeing of our patients due to an inadequate supply of critical drugs,\" the letter reads.\n",
      "\tSome of the drugs currently in shortage include forms of Azithromycin, Ceftriaxone, Dexamethasone, Lorazepam, Midazolam, Propofol, Remdesivir, Salbutamol and Tocilizumab, among others. The letter says that health-care professionals have also seen shortages in antibiotic drugs, some of which are on the Tier 3 list, including Penicillin G.\n",
      "\tAccording to the letter, 15 out of 24 drugs on Health Canada's Tier 3 shortage list are essential for treating COVID-19. Medications on the Tier 3 list are drugs experiencing an active significant shortage and have no suitable alternatives.\n",
      "\tWith these critical drugs typically prescribed for various condition such as epilepsy, high blood pressure, pain, and asthma, many pharmacies across the country have been limiting patients to one month's worth of medication at a time to discourage people from stockpiling medication amid the uncertainties around the pandemic.\n",
      "CTV News previously reported that doctors are also experimenting with different treatments using existing medications to help hospitalized COVID-19 patients, which in some cases, have led to misinformed members of the public stockpiling the medicine and causing shortages for patients suffering from other serious diseases requiring the drugs.\n",
      "\t\"As frontline pharmacists and physicians, we have seen and heard of serious shortages of essential, critical medications. These drugs are often used simultaneously in ORs, ERs and palliative care wards, as well as ICUs,\" the letter reads.\n",
      "\tWhile Canada’s ICUs are seeing fewer COVID-19 patients, the Critical Drugs Coalition says the pandemic has placed a burden on their drug supply with patients often requiring weeks of treatment on ventilators.\n",
      "\tDeputy Minister of Health Canada Stephen Lucas said in April that the COVID-19 pandemic will likely lead to shortages of drugs and medical devices for Canadians.\n",
      "\tLucas said the federal government has a team dedicated to addressing the problem and is working with regulators in the U.S., Australia and Europe to identify where the supply-chain disruptions are occurring.\n",
      "\tIn response to the letter, a spokesperson for Health Minister Patty Hajdu pointed to this international partnership as a step forward in a statement to CTVNews.ca.\n",
      "\t\"We’re also working with international regulatory partners, including the European Medicines Agency, the United States Food and Drug Administration, the United Kingdom’s Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency and the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration, as well as the World Health Organization to share information on any signs of global supply disruptions,\" said Cole Davidson.\n",
      "\tHe said Health Canada is also working with provinces and territories to work out domestic supply chain kinks.\n",
      "\tThe federal government has also issued an interim order to allow certain international drugs that may not fully meet regulatory requirements to be imported and sold in Canada to help address drug shortages. However, pharmacists and physicians say they’re still facing shortages.\n",
      "\tHealth experts behind the letter worry that a likely second wave of infections in Canada will further increase drug shortages and put Canadians lives at risk by compromising the optimal care for their health unless certain measure are put in place.\n",
      "\tWhile the letter is addressed to Trudeau, the Critical Drugs Coalition is calling for immediate action by all levels governments including provincial, territorial, and municipal with national support. The letter said Canada will \"perpetually face drug shortages\" unless concrete action is taken.\n",
      "\tThe Critical Drugs Coalition is a grassroots, volunteer-run coalition of physicians, pharmacists and others concerned by drug shortages amid the pandemic. The coalition recommends that Canada find a long-term solution to the problem, starting with the robust stockpiling of critical medications.\n",
      "\t\"Many of the critical care drugs should be part of the National Strategic Emergency Stockpile. However, it is clear that Canada simply did not have enough stockpiled to meet the demand during the COVID-19 pandemic and that there has been under allocation and underspending for the emergency stockpile,\" according to the letter.\n",
      "\tSome of Canada’s national medical bodies including the Canadian Medical Association (CMA) and the Canadian Association of Emergency Physicians (CAEP) have also signed the letter.\n",
      "\tIn order for the stockpiling strategy to be effective, the letter says governments must work closely with hospitals across Canada to establish a comprehensive list of essential medications for hospital-based care. Additionally, it suggests governments develop a plan to obtain medications in a co-ordinated manner to prevent unintended competition.\n",
      "\tThe letter is also calling for a publicly owned or supported critical drugs manufacturer as a safeguard against future drug shortages.\n",
      "\tChina and India supply some 80 per cent of the active ingredients and raw materials for many of the medications, and while some drugs are assembled in Canada, none are completely manufactured here from start to finish.\n",
      "\tThe letter explained that this national manufacturer would specialize in creating the critical drugs on the Critical Medications List, and \"would be primarily involved in satisfying significant portions\" of national medication demands.\n",
      "\tGoing forward, the letter is urging greater transparency and communication from governments to the health sector and the public on the supply of critical medicines to ensure drug supply issues are addressed before they pose any serious risks to sick patients.\n",
      "\t\"We encourage our government to give this urgent issue attention and efforts now, so that Canadians can have the confidence that their healthcare system will be there when they most need it,\" the letter said.\n",

      "\tStephanie Scherrer was settling in for her two-hour Southwest Airlines flight from Denver, Colorado to her home in Los Angeles, California. Her face covering was on, her hand sanitizer was ready, she'd wiped down the seats and her two kids were also masked up.\n",
      "\tIt was July 15. Scherrer, a high school counsellor, had thought long and hard about whether she felt safe flying during the Covid-19 pandemic, researching driving routes and poring over airline policies. But she was reassured by Southwest's compulsory mask rule, plus its pledge to keep the middle seats open.\n",
      "\tThe aircraft had left the gate when Scherrer says she spotted a commotion several rows ahead: a flight attendant was confronting a man and a woman who were refusing to wear face masks.\n",
      "\t\"I hear him saying: 'Well, there's going to be a lot of lawsuits,\" Scherrer tells CNN.\n",
      "\tThe flight attendant, Scherrer says, reiterated the rules and the couple continued to refuse to comply.\n",
      "\t\"I got mad, because I feel like people wear masks for my safety. I'm wearing one for theirs,\" Scherrer says.\n",
      "\tThe next thing she knew, the aircraft was returning to the gate.\n",
      "\t\"At that point, people started getting angry, because I think they realized that we weren't taking off on time, because they needed to take care of this.\"\n",
      "\tScherrer says a Southwest employee boarded the airplane and started talking to the passengers in question.\n",
      "\t\"And as soon as that happened, it kind of opened the floodgates of other people going, 'I can't believe that you were so rude. Why? Why couldn't you just wear a mask?'\n",
      "\tOther people were like: 'Yeah, I might miss my connecting flight.'\"\n",
      "\tScherrer couldn't hear everything transpiring, but she could see things were escalating. She took out her cell phone and started to record the incident.\n",
      "\tIn her video, supplied to CNN, one passenger is heard saying they will not wear a mask because \"it's against my constitutional right.\"\n",
      "\tThe situation concluded with the Southwest representative asking the couple to deplane. Once they had disembarked, the remaining passengers applauded the air crew and Scherrer breathed a sigh of relief.\n",
      "\tSouthwest Airlines declined to comment on the incident, pointing CNN towards its no exceptions mask policy, which the airline said is made clear to passengers during booking, a pre-trip email and the check-in process.\n",
      "\t \n",
      "\t \n",
      "\tBack in the spring, as COVID-19 induced lockdowns hit the United States and Europe, many airplanes were flying at severely reduced capacity as travel plans were canceled and people retreated into their homes.\n",
      "\tBut this last weekend, the U.S. Transportation Security Administration reported airport security checkpoint traffic had reached a new high, crossing 800,000 for the first time in the pandemic.\n",
      "\tIt's still far less than before -- 31% of the equivalent 2019 numbers, when the TSA saw over 2.6 million people on the same day last year.\n",
      "\tBut the figures suggest passengers are returning to the skies and airlines -- amid reports of job uncertainty and continuing fears about the spread of coronavirus -- are trying to operate as smooth and hassle-free an experience as possible.\n",
      "\tPre-pandemic, many passengers already found air travel stressful. Missed connections, delays, increasingly busy aircraft all adding to heightened anxiety.\n",
      "\tAnd the past few years have seen more visible episodes of air rage -- a term used for disruptive and unruly passenger behavior from passengers getting aggressive with air crew, refusing to comply with flight regulations, fighting with another flier or even, in the most extreme situations, trying to enter the flight deck or open the emergency exit door.\n",
      "Data from the International Air Transport Association (IATA) suggested that incidents involving unruly passengers were rising pre-pandemic.\n",
      "\tThe latest available statistics, from 2017, indicated an average of one incident for every 1,053 flights. In 2016, IATA reported one incident for every 1,434 flights.\n",
      "\tHowever, the data isn't comprehensive: not every global airline is part of IATA -- and not every incident is going to be recorded. Plus, the Federal Aviation Administration, which compiles statistics for US flights, suggests numbers were down from 2018 to 2019.\n",
      "\tBut one thing's for certain, now that almost everyone carries a smart phone, we've seen more and more videos of brawling passengers splashed across social media, which has drawn further attention to the issue.\n",
      "\tCOVID-19 has changed the face of flying, with passenger tensions possibly higher than ever due to fears surrounding the virus. New regulations such as compulsory face masks add to the list of potential points of conflict.\n",
      "\tAn IATA representative told CNN that the group didn't have any statistics on unruly passenger data since March and that unruly passenger incidents \"are still a tiny percentage of overall flights.\"\n",
      "\t\"We are aware of a very small number of instances where passengers have not complied with these requirements,\" added the representative.\n",

      "\t \n",
      "\tAllie Malis is a flight attendant for American Airlines and the government affairs representative at the Association of Professional Flight Attendants, a union representing American Airlines air crew.\n",
      "\t\"Flying has totally changed,\" Malis tells CNN. \"We've changed our policies; we are concerned about safety. We're concerned about job security.\"\n",
      "\tMalis recalls flights she worked on earlier in the year which should've had 160 passengers and instead carried just 20. It was easier, she says, to socially distance back then.\n",
      "\tNow, numbers are rising and, says the flight attendant, so is the potential for more problems.\n",
      "\t\"Our reports at our union of passenger misconduct have skyrocketed, and a lot of these are driven by mask compliance on the airplane,\" says Malis. \"Most incidents of passenger misconduct on planes have been related to face coverings and mask.\"\n",
      "\tMalis says that the Association of Professional Flight Attendants has been advocating masks on aircraft since January, when COVID-19 first surfaced in China.\n",
      "\tThe policy has evolved over time and mask wearing is now compulsory for all crew and passengers over the age of two.\n",
      "\t\"If you are not able or not willing to wear a mask, we ask that you find another mode of transportation to get to where you need to go,\" says Malis. \"I think flight attendants feel like we have a responsibility during this pandemic to do what we can to stop the spread.\"\n",
      "\tMalis has worked as a flight attendant for several years and she's become used to dealing with potentially difficult passenger interactions.\n",
      "\tThere's always the worry about a passenger assaulting a crew member -- which has added implications in the age of coronavirus.\n",
      "\tMalis is also concerned about incidents being videoed.\n",
      "\t\"You never know when you're being recorded and when any type of video could be taken out of context,\" she says.\n",
      "\t \n",
      "\t \n",
      "\tDuring a flight, passengers can take off their mask to eat and drink. Sometimes, notes Malis, travelers might genuinely forget to put the face covering back on afterwards.\n",
      "\tOther times, they could be using this policy to attempt to beat the system. It's a flight attendant's job to mitigate these situations.\n",
      "\tOnce the airplane has taken off, the flight won't divert if someone takes off their mask -- unless the incident derails further -- but Malis says staff will take names and politely remind customers to comply.\n",
      "\t\"The company is supposed to follow up with those customers and figure out what the situation was, and possibly deny future travel,\" she says.\n",
      "\tAmerican Airlines is one of the US carriers, among them American Airlines and United, that has pledged to ban passengers from future flights if they refuse to wear a mask.\n",
      "Delta recently told CNN that \"well over 100 people\" have refused to wear a face covering for the duration of the journey and been subsequently banned from flying on the carrier.\n",
      "\tMalis says one of the difficulties is that, in the US, there is no blanket rule for face coverings on flights. The FAA hasn't issued a federal requirement, so it is up to individual US airlines to decide their policy and what, if any, exceptions they make to the rule.\n",
      "\tFor many carriers, the no exceptions rule now extends to those with medical conditions.\n",
      "CNN affiliate KRPC reported that Southwest Airlines recently removed a passenger and her three-year-old son from a Monday flight after the boy, who has autism, refused to wear a face mask and became upset.\n",
      "\tIn a CNN interview on Wednesday, Southwest CEO Gary Kelly emphasized the no-exceptions policy when asked about the incident.\n",
      "\t\"What we have concluded is there shouldn't be any exceptions, because the exception could be someone who has the virus,\" Kelly told CNN's Poppy Harlow.\n",
      "\t\"I'm very empathetic. I'm a grandfather. I have small grandchildren and I know how kids can be, but it's just a matter of making sure that it's a safe environment for everyone including all those families.\"\n",
      "\t \n",
      "\t \n",
      "\tOne of the prevailing worries among air crew is that unruly passengers could get aggressive.\n",
      "\tPassenger Scherrer said the situation she observed didn't become violent, but other passengers were getting increasingly irritated.\n",
      "\t\"I just felt like people were getting frustrated -- I think everybody's nervous about the pandemic, or you think they are,\" she says.\n",
      "\tAir crew are trained to deal with aggressive or violent incidents and aim to de-escalate any situation that has the potential to go in that direction.\n",
      "\tEarlier in August, two passengers on board a KLM flight from Amsterdam were arrested after they refused to wear face masks and became unruly.\n",
      "\tOn KLM flights, passengers can be exempt from wearing face masks due to medical reasons.\n",
      "\tKLM spokesperson Paul Weber told CNN the travelers were drunk and began \"troubling other passengers physically and verbally.\" They were detained by the captain on board and then arrested by local authorities when the flight landed.\n",
      "\tHistorically, the role of alcohol is often cited as a factor in air rage incidents, in the wake of COVID-19 several airlines banned alcohol on flights -- although some have since reinstated alcoholic drink options, and this doesn't stop passengers stocking up on booze before they board.\n",
      "\t \n",
      "\t \n",
      "\tPassengers refusing to comply with regulations can be concerning for fellow travelers and air crew, but what's it like for the people in the cockpit?\n",
      "Pilot Anny Divya commands a Boeing 777 for Air India. When she started her role a few years ago, she was the youngest female commander of a Boeing 777 aircraft in the world.\n",
      "\t\"There's nothing normal anymore about flying,\" says Divya, speaking from her home in India before piloting a flight to Chicago. \"It's difficult for everyone.\"\n",
      "\tLike her passengers, Divya wears a mask while transiting through the airport, boarding the plane and, often, while flying the aircraft.\n",
      "\tIt's possible to social distance with two people in the cockpit, so pilots are permitted to take them off for a while, but Divya still describes face coverings as having \"become part of our life.\"\n",
      "\t\"In the beginning, it was uncomfortable breathing,\" she recalls. \"Now, without even knowing, we do have masks on most of the time without even realizing it.\"\n",
      "\tDivya has been flying throughout the pandemic, repatriating passengers and delivering medical supplies.\n",
      "\tMeanwhile Italy-based pilot Lindy Kats, who flies the Boeing 717 for a European airline, says she only recently returned to the skies after Italy's lockdown began to lift.\n",
      "\tKats, who flies short haul journeys across the Mediterranean, says she stays in constant communication with the air crew about any incidents on the aircraft.\n",
      "\t\"If a passenger is already aggressive on the ground, it can become a bigger issue when taking off,\" she explains.\n",
      "\t\"It's important for the cabin crew to indeed realize, is this passenger calm enough to stay on board? And otherwise other precautions have to be taken, unfortunately.\"\n",
      "\t \n",
      "\t \n",
      "\tKats acknowledges that flying can be stressful, even disregarding the current COVID-19 threat.\n",
      "\t\"There's never an excuse for being aggressive. But yes, I can understand how someone can be triggered by multiple things that are accumulating, adding to stress,\" she says. \"And then maybe one little thing can be the drop that makes the bucket flow over.\"\n",
      "\tOverall, both Kats and Divya say passengers have been largely compliant with the new restrictions.\n",
      "\tFrom the flight attendant perspective, Malis also says most passengers have been appreciative and understanding, with travelers recognizing the risk now inherent to working on an aircraft.\n",
      "\tShe hopes that a more uniform policy is implemented by the US government, which she feels could make the situation \"less confusing for everyone.\"\n",
      "\t\"I think we do need to make sure that everyone is wearing a mask on a plane that we can make sure that air travel does not contribute to the spreading of the COVID-19 virus and to make sure that critical goods and emergency personnel have the option to get to where they need to go,\" she says.\n",
      "\t\"And that flight attendants and all the other other aviation workers have a job to come back to after this pandemic.\"\n",

      "\tA sample of frozen chicken wings imported from Brazil has tested positive for the novel coronavirus in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen, authorities said Thursday, the latest in a series of reports of contaminated imported food products.\n",
      "\tThe coronavirus was detected Wednesday on a surface sample taken from a batch of chicken wings during screening of imported frozen food in Longgang district of Shenzhen, the municipal government said in a statement. Officials did not name the brand.\n",
      "\tHealth authorities, including the World Health Organization (WHO) and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), have said the possibility of catching the virus through food is low.\n",
      "\tShenzhen health authorities immediately traced and tested people who might have come into contact with the product, and all results came back negative; all related products in stock have been sealed off and tested negative, the statement said.\n",
      "\tAuthorities are now tracing related products from the same brand that have already been sold, and have disinfected the area where the contaminated chicken wings were stored.\n",
      "\tThe Brazilian Association of Animal Protein (ABPA) said in a statement that it is analyzing the incident and reiterated that \"there is no scientific evidence that meat transmits the virus.\"\n",
      "\t\"It is not yet clear when the packaging was contaminated, and whether it occurred during the export transportation process,\" ABPA added.\n",
      "\tThe Brazilian agriculture ministry released a note stating that it has not been officially notified by Chinese authorities of the incident.\n",
      "\tBrazil has so far reported more than 3.1 million coronavirus cases, the second highest in the world after the United States, according to Johns Hopkins University's tally.\n",
      "\tNews of the contaminated chicken wings comes a day after coronavirus was found on the packaging of shrimps imported from Ecuador, another South American country, at a restaurant in eastern Anhui province during a routine inspection, China's state broadcaster CCTV reported.\n",
      "\tSince July, there have been seven instances where the virus was detected on the packaging of imported seafood products across the country, from Shandong province on the eastern coast to the municipality of Chongqing in the west, according to state media reports.\n",
      "\tThese incidents have sparked concerns over the safety of imported foods. Chinese health authorities have repeatedly told the public to be cautious about buying imported meat and seafood. On Chinese social media, some have called for the suspension of all frozen food imports.\n",
      "\tThe WHO says it is \"highly unlikely that people can contract COVID-19 from food or food packaging.\" According to the CDC, the risk of infection by the virus from food products, food packaging, or bags is \"thought to be very low.\"\n",
      "\tBoth organizations point out that the coronavirus spreads mostly person to person through respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs, sneezes or talks.\n",
      "\tWhile it is possible to catch COVID-19 by touching a surface or object -- including food or food packaging that has the virus on it -- and then touching your mouth, nose, or possibly eyes, it is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads, according to the CDC.\n",
      "\t\"There is no evidence to date of viruses that cause respiratory illnesses being transmitted via food or food packaging. Coronaviruses cannot multiply in food; they need an animal or human host to multiply,\" the WHO says.\n",
      "\tDavid Hui Shu-cheong, a respiratory medicine expert at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, said the imported food products that tested positive in China were almost certain to have been contaminated during packaging.\n",
      "\tBut he said it doesn't necessarily mean that they're infectious -- the nucleic acid tests could be picking up the RNA of dead virus. These remnants of the virus are known to have caused false positive results on patients who have recovered from the coronavirus, such as in South Korea.\n",
      "\tIf the virus taken from the food products can be grown in labs, however, then they are infectious, he said, adding that the coronavirus can survive freezing temperatures and still be active when thawed.\n",
      "\tChinese authorities have increased screening of imported meat and seafood products since June, when a coronavirus outbreak in Beijing emerged from the city's largest wholesale food market.\n",
      "State media reported at the time that the virus was discovered on a chopping board used for imported salmon at the market, prompting supermarkets in the Chinese capital to remove salmon from their shelves.\n",
      "\tBut officials at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention have tried to allay concerns. \"We cannot conclude that salmon is the source of infection just because novel coronavirus was detected on a chopping board of a seller,\" Wu Zunyou, chief epidemiologist at the Chinese CDC, told the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection.\n",
      "\tWu said the chopping board could instead have been contaminated by an infected owner or customers, or other products that carried the virus.\n",
      "\tIn July, a fresh coronavirus outbreak in the city of Dalian in northern China's Liaoning province was linked to a seafood company, which processes both imported and domestic seafood.\n",

      "\tJimmy Lai had just finished his morning exercise and was catching up on the news when the police arrived.\n",
      "\t\"There were 15, 20 policemen there, and they said I was under arrest and that they were from the national security department,\" the Hong Kong media tycoon recounted in a live-streamed video chat Thursday.\n",
      "\tHis arrest Monday morning at his home was the highest-profile detention under a new national security law that took effect in the semi-autonomous Chinese territory on June 30. He has not been charged but was held for 36 hours on suspicion of colluding with a foreign country or entity. He was released on bail.\n",
      "\tLai, 71, said he was worried he could be sent to the mainland, where the legal system has fewer protections. His fears were allayed when he realized that the officers were not speaking in Mandarin, the mainland Chinese language.\n",
      "\t\"I kind of settled down a little bit because ... knew that I wouldn't be sent to China at least,\" he said.\n",
      "\tThe national security law says that certain cases can come under the jurisdiction of mainland China. Chinese and Hong Kong officials say most cases will be handled locally.\n",
      "\tIn the hours after his arrest, Lai was taken to his office and his personal yacht as police searched for evidence. He was also shifted between several police stations, as there was an electricity blackout in one, while in another the fingerprint machine was not working.\n",
      "\t\"A lot of the time I was sitting there waiting,\" he said, adding it was the first time he had spent so much time in handcuffs as police took him from place to place.\n",
      "\tThe headquarters of his Next Digital media group, which operates the pro-democracy Apple Daily tabloid, was raided by hundreds of officers after his arrest, stoking fears that press freedom would be curtailed.\n",
      "\tHong Kong has long enjoyed freedoms not found on the mainland under a \"one country, two systems\" framework.\n",
      "\tLai expressed surprise that his arrest came so quickly, saying that he thought authorities would keep a low profile because of the strong condemnation of the law by some in the international community.\n",
      "\tHe has been a harsh critic of the new law and China's ruling Communist Party.\n",
      "\t\"If I knew that I will end up here or eventually in prison, would I have changed myself in other way? I thought about it, and I said no, because this is my character,\" he said. \"This is the way I react to things. My character is my destiny.\"\n",
      "\tFollowing Lai's arrest on Monday, investors rushed to buy Next Digital stock in a show of support. The stock surged more than 1,100% to 1.61 Hong Kong dollars before settling around 0.38 Hong Kong dollars on Thursday. That's still nearly five times higher than before Lai's arrest.\n",
      "\tHe urged people not to engage in a buying spree of Next Digital shares.\n",
      "\t\"I advise nobody to touch it,\" he said. \"Because this is just a very ephemeral phenomenon that's not going to last.\"\n",

      "CONTENT : ATLANTA, GEORGIA -- \n",
      "\tOne of the questions I am getting more than any other: Am I going to send my children back to school? As a father of three teen and preteen girls, this has been a constant discussion in our household, and it hasn't been easy. My girls want to go back to school, and they are placing enormous pressure on us parents to make it so. They miss their friends, the social structure and the immersion in humanity that kids need and crave at this age. Virtual learning has played an important role for them, but it is not a substitute for in-person learning, especially for younger kids. As things stand now, my children are scheduled to start school next week.\n",
      "\tMany schools around the country have already made the decision for the students. At least 63 of the 101 largest school districts in the country decided to start the year with virtual learning. There are other school districts that have decided to go in-person, though many with virtual options. My own kids' school left the choice up to the individual families, and while it's difficult, I'm grateful we have options. Families all over the country are struggling with access to childcare, technology and even food -- all of which can make a physical return to school a necessity.\n",
      "\tKnowing my family would have to make a decision about school, we started doing our homework a few weeks ago, looking at the data and existing criteria, to come up with the best science-based choice for us.\n",
      "\tFor starters, I visited my kids' school and spent time with the head of the school to best understand the safety precautions they were putting in place. They are very much in line with recommendations from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. There will be a mask mandate, plenty of hand hygiene stations, physical distancing plans, frequent disinfecting of surfaces and even outdoor classes when possible. Students will eat lunch in the classroom, and there won't be any mass gatherings or assemblies. While physical distancing is the toughest challenge, the school has made creative use of space in libraries, gymnasiums and cafeterias to obtain the necessary square footage to try and address this. It has been a herculean effort over the past few months, but of course, none of this works if the students themselves aren't diligent about following these practices on buses, in hallways and in classrooms.\n",
      "\tOur school also took the extra step of testing all the students and faculty and staff this past week, and the results were made available within 96 hours. My girls all tested negative, and that gives us some reassurance for those kids who choose to attend school, as those students testing positive will be asked to isolate at home. I fully realize this sort of \"assurance\" testing is sadly still not nearly available enough in this country, and it is also not a perfect tool. Some tests have been known to give a considerable amount of false negatives, depending on the type of test you take and how early you take it. And, while someone may test negative today, there is no guarantee they won't test positive for the virus tomorrow.\n",
      "\tMuch of the discussion about returning to school revolves around the risk to the health of our children. According to the CDC, the largest pediatric study out of China found that 90% of children with COVID-19 develop mild or moderate symptoms, 4% were entirely asymptomatic and 6% became severely or critically ill.\n",
      "\tBy the first week of August, 90 children in the US had died of COVID-19, which represents less than 1% of all deaths, according to an analysis by the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Children's Hospital Association.\n",
      "\tAs of August 6, MIS-C, a multi-system inflammatory syndrome, was identified in at least 570 kids across the country, ranging in age from less than 1 to 20. About two-thirds of those children didn't have underlying conditions before being diagnosed with MIS-C, like Juliet Daly, a Louisiana 12-year-old who nearly died in April.\n",
      "\tIt is true that children are far less likely to get sick from COVID-19, as compared to adults, but they are by no means immune. They can become infected and they can spread it quickly. A widely cited study out of South Korea showed that kids 10 to 19 were spreading the virus just as much as adults. In fact, they had the highest rate of COVID-19 among household contacts. Interestingly, in that same study, children younger than 10 did not account for a significant amount of viral spread. This was surprising because a recent study published in JAMA Pediatrics concluded younger kids may carry higher amounts of the virus in their nose, as compared to adults. And any parent will tell you how easily little kids spread viruses in their own homes. (When our kids were very young, a single cold in any one of them meant the whole family was going to soon become infected.)\n",
      "\tSo, I decided to take a closer look at the South Korean study, and noticed a very important detail: It included fewer than 30 positive cases younger than 10 years old. Of the nearly 60,000 contacts that were traced in that study, only 237 were from children under 10. The low rate of spread among young kids may not have been because they are less likely to transmit the virus, but because they have largely been home over the last few months, and had few contacts as a result.\n",
      "\tAs our kids become increasingly mobile, they will become part of a large national experiment, and there is little doubt the infection rates will increase. Just over the past four weeks, the number of children infected in the United States has increased by 90% to more than 380,000 cases, according to that same analysis by AAP and CHA. While some of that increase may be due to increased testing, younger kids starting to emerge from their homes for the first time also play a role. And, for much of the country, schools haven't even yet reopened.\n",
      "\tIt is also important to remember that a school community is made up of more than just young students. According to one recent analysis, nearly a quarter of teachers working in the United States school system are at higher risk of serious illness from COVID-19, either because of age or pre-existing conditions. I was particularly struck by the stories of worried teachers around the country who said they were writing out their wills in anticipation of returning to school.\n",
      "\tMy family also took a closer look at the overall rate of viral spread in our own area. Within the Fulton County Schools system, where we live, the guidelines for schools to return to full-time, face-to-face instruction requires the county rate of new cases per 100,000 people to be fewer than 100 for the last 14 days. Fulton County's current rate? 316.2. Atlanta Public Schools have decided to go all-virtual for the first nine weeks. Additionally, our county, which includes part of Atlanta, doesn't meet the federal government's criteria for return to school either. According to the gating criteria from the Coronavirus Task Force, we would have had to pass through two phases, each requiring a 14-day downward trajectory of documented cases and the ability to treat all patients without crisis care. We are simply not there yet.\n",
      "\tFinally, the positivity rate in Georgia over the seven days (ending August 10) is 11.3%, based on data from the Covid Tracking Project, which means we still aren't doing enough testing in our area. Recently, the Surgeon General said he would like to see positivity rates at less than 10% in communities before schools consider reopening. We are close, but it is still worrisome to place students back into an environment with that much community viral spread. It is worth noting that when we started pulling kids out of school around mid-March, there were fewer than 5,000 known cases people known to have been infected in the United States and confirmed deaths were in the double digits. Now, school districts are considering reopening as more than 5 million people have been infected and more than 164,000 people have died in the US, according to Johns Hopkins University.\n",
      "\tJust over the past few weeks, we have been given several clues of what may happen as schools start to reopen. An overnight summer camp in North Georgia had nearly 260 attendees become infected, though the CDC noted some could've contracted COVID-19 another way. A high school in Woodstock, Georgia, is temporarily closed after at least 14 positive COVID-19 cases in its first week. Hundreds are under quarantine in the county. Another school in Dallas, Georgia, opened and then closed its doors after six students and three faculty became infected. Their plan is to reopen after disinfecting the school, though it is not clear how much of a difference that will make, as there is no mask requirement -- and a single sneeze or cough could once again contaminate a classroom.\n",
      "\tIt is a lot to consider, but in the minds of our family, the evidence is clear. After considering all the objective criteria and assessing the situation in our own community, we have made the decision to keep our girls out of school for the time being. This was not an easy decision, but one that we believe best respects the science, decreases the risk of further spread and follows the task force criteria. As a compromise, we will allow our children to have a physically distanced orientation meeting with their new teachers so they can meet them in person before starting to interact with them on a screen. And, after two weeks, we will reassess. It will also be important for us to understand what the triggers will be in our school, in terms of newly diagnosed infections or illnesses, that will require a return to virtual learning. Full and honest transparency from everyone will be more necessary than ever.\n",
      "\tNone of this is easy, and some families may arrive at a different conclusion after looking at the same data. In the age of COVID-19, it seems we are all forced to become amateur epidemiologists, while also being the best parents we can be.\n",

      "CONTENT : \n",
      "\tTwo decades ago, Rosa María Ruiz purchased 4,000 hectares of land along the Beni River, near the small village of Rurrenabaque, with the goal of transforming it from a heavily logged patch of the Bolivian Amazon into a thriving private wildlife reserve.\n",
      "\tThe Bolivian eco-warrior had just had success creating what the Wildlife Conservation Society believes is the most biodiverse protected area on the planet, the nearby Madidi National Park, but her vocal criticism of Madidi's protections under government control got her kicked out. Undeterred, she set up her own private park upriver and named it Serere after a gangly bird with a blue face and punk rock hair.\n",
      "\tFast-forward to early 2020, and Serere Eco-Reserve was home to more than 300 species of birds and some of South America's most elusive mammals, including dwarf leopards, night monkeys, jaguars, tapirs and giant anteaters. The revival of this small swath of the Amazon was made possible thanks to the support of foreign eco-tourists who paid around US$100 a day for all-inclusive overnight stays filled with hiking, conservation lessons and family-style meals sourced from the on-site garden.\n",
      "\tThen, of course, the pandemic hit, and Serere hasn't welcomed a single visitor since March 23. With no incoming funds, and little in the way of savings, Ruiz had to cut staff from 40 to just seven rangers who've already chased off poachers and seen around seven acres of forest pillaged for lumber (a trend echoed across the Amazon Basin).\n",
      "\t\"We can't keep going at the rate we are now without further support,\" she says, noting a GoFundMe campaign created to tackle the emergency. \"It's evident that if we don't have a presence and protection in Serere, especially because of the economic crisis everyone's living now, then those who are hard-up will continue cutting down the trees and selling lumber for easy money.\"\n",
      "\tIt's a predicament faced by highly respected conservation projects across the developing world, who have spent much of 2020 navigating the new reality of trying to protect wild animals while dealing with the fiscal fallout of COVID-19.\n",
      "\tIn the early days of the pandemic, the internet was abuzz with stories of wild boars in Barcelona, pumas in the Chilean capital of Santiago and dolphins in Venice canals (the latter was viral fake news). Animals, it seemed, were thriving in the era of coronavirus lockdowns.\n",
      "\tThese \"good news\" stories of animals roaming freely were what we all craved at the time, but they overshadowed a more unfortunate reality.\n",
      "\tTourism has been the fragile pillar on which thousands of conservation projects stood for decades, helping to protect wild, trafficked and refugee animals, restore vital habitats and educate the public about sustainability. When that pillar crumbled overnight amid global travel bans, the system collapsed.\n",
      "\tWildlife reserves in the developing world are, unlike U.S. National Parks at the moment, empty. Contrary to popular belief, this is not a good thing for the animals.\n",
      "\tNot only does the presence of eco-tourists keep poachers and loggers at bay, but at well-managed reserves, their money funds rangers, veterinary programs and animal rescue centers in parts of the globe that lack robust public park systems.\n",
      "\tIt also provides a vital source of revenue for rural and disenfranchised communities.\n",
      "\tA 2019 estimate from the World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC) put the direct value of wildlife tourism at US$120 billion. It generates 21.8 million global jobs and is particularly vital in Africa (where it makes up 36.3% of the travel and tourism sector), Latin America (where it's 8.6%) and Asia-Pacific (where it's 5.8%).\n",
      "\tThis income has virtually evaporated as a result of Covid-19, leaving the animals -- and those who care for and depend on them -- at risk.\n",
      "\tThe Elephant Conservation Center (ECC) is a 6,000-hectare reserve in northern Laos that cares for 34 rescued Asian elephants, helping them to reherd and, eventually, return to the wild. Laos has fewer than 400 wild elephants and about the same number in captivity, according to government estimates, making programs like this essential to tip the scale.\n",
      "\tSome 85% of the ECC's revenue is derived from paid visitors and voluntourists, who spend around US$110 per day for multiday educational stays that involve no invasive riding or bathing with the animals.\n",
      "\tEven though Laos so far has been largely spared by the coronavirus, with just 20 confirmed cases, tourism at the ECC is limited to a few expats and locals. Now, it's searching for donors and grant money to stay afloat, keep its 34 mahouts (elephant trainers) employed and carry out its greater mission of using elephants as a symbol to raise awareness for conserving regional habitats that house less-iconic endangered species.\n",
      "\t\"I was quite happy with the ECC's business model because we were sort of independent from donor money thanks to this income generated by tourists,\" explains founder Sebastien Duffillot. \"Going back to begging for money isn't ideal as funds are not so easy to get these days and the tourism model was much more sustainable.\"\n",
      "\tAfrica has, arguably, been most affected by the sudden decline in ecotourism. Some 67 million tourists visited the continent in 2018, according the UN World Tourism Organization, with many enticed by the chance to go on a once-in-a-lifetime safari.\n",
      "\t\"Thanks to the pandemic, we are looking at massive numbers of people who are completely out of a job,\" says Soraya Shattuck, executive director of the Adventure Travel Conservation Fund (ATCF), a nonprofit that harnesses the travel community's environmental and cultural conservation efforts for maximum impact.\n",
      "\t\"Not only have hotels and lodges had to shut their doors, but think about the impact this has had on the ancillary people who are involved in these industries,\" she adds. \"That means the cooks, the drivers, the hotel staff, the craft sellers, the rangers -- all these people that depend on visitors no longer have an income, and they may be the primary income-generator for their entire family.\"\n",
      "\tShattuck says that without extra eyeballs in the continent's parks, some communities have been drawn into poaching out of desperation. They're not necessarily targeting elephants and rhinos, she explains, but are setting up snares for other bushmeats they can either sell or use to feed their families.\n",
      "\tThe ATCF is trying to combat the issue with a campaign to fund rangers in hopes of keeping money flowing for those on the front lines of the environmental crisis.\n",
      "\tA 2019 WTTC study found that the average time from impact to economic recovery following disease outbreaks is 19.4 months for the travel industry. That is, of course, just an estimate. If there is one thing certain about the current pandemic, it's that everything remains uncertain.\n",
      "\tYet, there are some signs of hope on the horizon.\n",
      "\tChina, the largest market for illegal wildlife products, has suspended wildlife trade and vowed to impose a permanent ban on the sale and consumption of wild animals (though this has yet to be finalized). Moreover, a recent Wildlife Justice Commission report found that the trade has been severely crippled by current travel restrictions.\n",
      "\tSeveral travel brands, including luxury outfit andBeyond, are offering virtual safaris that keep guides paid and raise funds for community development projects, while others, such as Desert & Delta Safaris, are selling vouchers for future trips, a percentage of which goes directly toward urgent conservation initiatives in local communities living near wildlife.\n",
      "\tAcross the ecotourism industry, Shattuck says she's seen a rise in partial financial resource-sharing where companies will add a mandatory fee (per guest, per night) that goes directly to conservation efforts.\n",
      "\t\"The goal is to protect the communities that protect these natural habitats,\" she says. \"So, if you had to cancel your $5,000 safari, you might have an extra $50 in your pocket today to make sure that when you go next year the place is still intact.\"\n",
      "\tGovernments have been so preoccupied by the human emergency of COVID-19 that there has been little investment in the natural emergency. Yet, the two are intrinsically linked.\n",
      "\tCoronavirus is caused by zoonotic disease transmission, which occurs most often when wild animals come in close contact with each other and humans. There is the greatest likelihood of this at wildlife markets and in human-animal conflict such as poaching.\n",
      "\tBy protecting wild animals and their natural habitats, we might just protect ourselves from the next pandemic.\n",

      "\tThe early efforts by the Chinese community in Toronto to quell the spread of coronavirus at the beginning of the year were largely overshadowed by stigma and Sinophobia at the time, according to new research.\n",
      "The York University research project, which was funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, aimed to examine the discrimination and stigmatization of the Chinese community in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n",
      "\tAaida Mamuji, a professor in the disaster management department at York University who led the research, said they conducted interviews with dozens of individuals from the Chinese diaspora in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) and in Nairobi, Kenya in order to learn about their lived experiences during the beginning of the crisis.\n",
      "\tMamuji said they learned that in January and February, as news of the virus’ spread in China and other countries first arrived in Canada, members of the Chinese community in the GTA were already taking precautions, such as mask wearing and physical distancing, long before those measures became mandatory anywhere in the country.\n",
      "\tShe listed further examples, such as the cancellation of numerous Chinese New Year festivities, restaurant owners in Chinatown requiring their employees to undergo temperature checks as early as January, and those who had travelled to China voluntarily self-quarantining when they arrived home.\n",
      "\t“There's so many examples that we really need to focus on because the Chinese community, in fact, helped us cope with COVID-19,” she told CTV’s Your Morning on Wednesday. “You can only wonder where our numbers would be had they not taken those measures so early on.”\n",
      "\tThese efforts were largely unnoticed, according to Mamuji, because of Sinophobia and misplaced blame for the disease on the Chinese community.\n",
      "\tIn Nairobi, where there’s a large Chinese diaspora, Mamuji said researchers discovered the fear of stigma was so great during the pandemic that individuals from the Chinese community were seeking out Chinese medicine for care instead of visiting public health-care facilities.\n",
      "\tMamuji said the information they collected for the project will be shared with emergency management professionals so it can be used to develop culturally-specific public education and de-stigmatization campaigns to counter misinformation and stigma against certain groups in the future.\n",
      "\t“We really need to work together to address these issues of stigma, especially during a pandemic, because ultimately what it does is exacerbate the spread of the disease,” she said.\n",

      "CONTENT : DETROIT -- \n",
      "\tChina Cochran met Kamala Harris at a campaign event in Detroit last year and was swept away by her ambition, charisma and leadership. She hoped the California senator would advance in politics.\n",
      "\tSo when Joe Biden named Harris on Tuesday as his running mate -- making her the first Black woman on a major party's presidential ticket -- Cochran wasn't just struck by the history. It represented a full-circle moment for Black women, who for generations have fought for their voices to be heard and political aspirations recognized.\n",
      "\t\"It tells Black girls that they can be president,\" said Cochran, who recently ran for state representative in Michigan. \"If you look back at Shirley Chisholm, she ran so that Kamala could lead at this moment. I think it's important for us to look at that and see other young women of colour realize that they can go after their dreams and really make change in our world.\"\n",
      "\tHarris' selection is historic in many senses. It also marks the first time an Asian American would be on the presidential ticket. Born to a Jamaican father and Indian mother, she often speaks of her deep bond with her late mother, whom she has called her single biggest influence.\n",
      "\tHarris' boundary-breaking potential serves as an affirmation of the growing power of voters of colour, according to nearly a dozen interviews with political strategists, potential voters and activists.\n",
      "\t\"Joe Biden understood this historic moment required a tough, smart and respected public servant,\" said Donna Brazile, who managed Al Gore's campaign in 2000 and served as Democratic National Committee chair in 2016.\n",
      "\tBlack women in particular helped rescue Biden's campaign earlier this year by delivering a resounding victory in the South Carolina primary, powering him to the Democratic nomination. As he prepares for the general election, Biden is trying to recreate the multi-racial and cross-generational coalition that twice sent Barack Obama to the White House.\n",
      "\tThat will hinge on Black voters in battleground states like Michigan to turn out in force in November.\n",
      "\t\"We've seen from an electoral process what happens if we don't vote, that can mean the difference between winning and losing a state,\" said Karen Finney, a senior Democratic strategist and spokesperson for Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign. \"We're in this moral inflection point of this country and Vice-President Biden is someone who's talked about healing the soul of our country and certainly one of the ways to do that is to uplift the voices of Black women.\"\n",
      "\tStrategists said that Harris will help that effort.\n",
      "\t\"It sends a strong signal about not only the current state of our party but what the future of our party looks like,\" said Antjuan Seawright, a veteran political strategist in South Carolina. \"And what better way to reward a group of people who have been the political glue in this party than to put an African American woman on the ticket.\"\n",
      "\tRavi Perry, Howard University's political science chair, said Harris' elevation also represents the first time that a graduate of a historically Black college or university will be represented on the ticket. Harris graduated from the Washington-based university and is a member of the storied Black sorority Alpha Kappa Alpha.\n",
      "\tWhile Harris' selection has largely been applauded among the Democratic Party and voters, some have raised concerns. She joins the ticket at a time of immense racial tensions and crises in the nation. The coronavirus pandemic has disproportionately affected Black Americans and other people of colour. Protests against systemic racism and brutality are top of mind for potential voters.\n",
      "\tAnd Harris' record as California attorney general and district attorney in San Francisco could make it difficult for Biden to galvanize support among younger Black and Latino voters.\n",
      "\tLindsey Roland, a 31-year-old Black woman and Michigan real estate agent, said that background gave her pause.\n",
      "\t\"While I fully appreciate her scope of responsibilities while she was in that role, I still think she was empowered to stand up more for minorities, and I think it was just a really missed opportunity,\" she said. \"But I absolutely will be voting. We have far too much at stake. And for me, as a mother, I'm frightened and I just feel like another four years with this administration will be catastrophic.\"\n",
      "\tSome of the nation's leading activists who have long fought for criminal justice reform see Harris as a potential ally in their push for change. Color of Change President Rashad Robinson said Harris has evolved over time and declared herself a \"progressive prosecutor\" who backs reform.\n",
      "\t\"What I appreciate about her is that she's been willing to listen and willing to evolve, and she's been willing to put legislation behind that evolution and policy platforms behind that evolution,\" Robinson said. \"Yes, I think there will be very real things that people will raise, but I think that she has been listening and working to address those things.\"\n",
      "\tAlicia Garza, the co-founder of the Black Lives Matter movement, said the nation is in a moment where \"deep and profound change is needed.\"\n",
      "\t\"For some activists, it is important that a Black woman is represented on this ticket, and for other activists, substance is going to be much more important than symbolism,\" Garza said. \"The trick of getting people out to vote will be a successful combination of the two. This is an incredible moment of opportunity, it's a moment that is rife with possibility and I'm still hopeful that this newly announced ticket will rise to meet the moment.\"\n",
      "\tIt's also not lost on many that the selection comes nearly 100 years after the 19th Amendment was ratified, giving women the right to vote.\n",
      "\tBut for Black women, the freedom to vote didn't come until much later, part of a historical pattern of being denied justice offered to others.\n",
      "\tAnd for Nse Ufot, CEO of the New Georgia Project, that's a call for action and a reminder how much more work needs to be done. Ahead of the election, her organization is working to register more than 1 million Black, Latino and Asian American voters. So, far they've registered 425,000 in the state.\n",
      "\t\"It took an additional 45 years of organizing to secure the rights to vote for Black women and other women of colour,\" Ufot said. \"And so, you know, there is a long history of, sort of, uncredited work. I think the Biden-Harris ticket is going to make it easier for us to have conversations, particularly in places like Georgia's rural Black Belt about why they need to vote.\"\n",
      "\tMelanie Campbell, president and CEO of the National Coalition on Black Civic Participation, was overcome with emotion after the announcement.\n",
      "\tShe wished her late mother could have lived to see the historic moment. She also wished that Black women who came before Harris -- civil rights activists Fannie Lou Hamer, Dorothy Height, Ella Baker and many others -- could know how their legacy and hard work culminated into this powerful moment.\n",
      "\t\"I thought about my mother, my grandmother. I thought about my sisters. I thought about in this moment that as a Black woman, we are seen,\" Campbell said. \"This moment is more than about the VP slot. It affirms Black women and all we did for this country. I'm glad I lived to see it.\"\n",

      "\t\"Alstom and Bombardier are leading providers of state-of-the-art trains used every day by millions of passengers across the European Union,\" said Margrethe Vestager, the EU commission vice-president in charge of competition. \"Thanks to the comprehensive remedies offered to solve the competition concerns in the areas of very high-speed, mainline trains and mainline signalling, the Commission has been able to speedily review and approve this transaction.\"\n",
      "\tThe commission's approval is conditional on several requirements, including the transfer of Bombardier's contribution to the Zefiro very high-speed train and an offer of intellectual property licence to Hitachi for the train co-developed by Hitachi and Bombardier Transportation for use in future very high-speed tenders in Britain, sale of two Alstom production sites in France, and sale of the Bombardier Talent 3 train platform and German production facilities.\n",
      "\tThe EU approval was welcomed by the chairman of Bombardier's rail division, which last year made almost US$8.5 billion in sales.\n",
      "\t\"Today's decision marks a positive step for the growth opportunities of the European rail sector, which is a world leader thanks to strong domestic competition and commitment to the next generation of green and digital mobility solutions,\" Daniel Desjardins said in an email.\n",
      "\tBombardier says the required sales of its components will be done in consultation with employee representative groups.\n",
      "\tThe Alstom transaction remains subject to regulatory approvals in other jurisdictions and is expected to close in the first half of 2021.\n",
      "\tBuying Bombardier Transportation will help Alstom compete with China's CRRC, which has been growing its business outside of its home country.\n",
      "\tThe move will also give more heft to Alstom after its bid to merge with Germany's Siemens was blocked by European Union regulators worried that it would make it a dominant presence in the region.\n",
      "\tThe decision to nix that deal was criticized by some European governments who want to create large European companies in various sectors that are capable of competing with state-backed companies in China and as well as U.S. multinationals.\n",

      "CONTENT : OTTAWA -- \n",
      "\tThe Royal Canadian Navy is poised to enter a new era by taking possession of the first armed warship under the federal government's multibillion-dollar shipbuilding plan, and the first built for Arctic military operations in decades.\n",
      "\tHMCS Harry DeWolf was welcomed in a ceremony at Canadian Forces Base Halifax on Friday, five years after Irving Shipbuilding first started cutting steel on the Arctic offshore patrol ship -- and two years later than originally scheduled.\n",
      "\tTop navy officers marked the occasion along with representatives from Irving, which is slated to build five more such vessels for the navy and two for the Canadian Coast Guard in the next few years.\n",
      "\t\"These ships will be at the core of an enhanced Canadian Arctic presence, effectively complementing the capabilities of our other current and future warships through critical reconnaissance and surveillance operations,\" said Vice-Admiral Art McDonald, the commander of the navy, in a statement.\n",
      "\tHarry DeWolf was a career navy officer who retired as chief of the naval staff in 1960. He rose to prominence as commander of HMCS Haida during the Second World War, known for daring tactical manoeuvres and sinking numerous enemy vessels, especially in the English Channel.\n",
      "\tWhile the DeWolf's delivery is a major milestone for the federal government's shipbuilding plan -- through which Ottawa is replacing nearly all of the large ships in the navy and coast guard -- it wasn't easy coming.\n",
      "\tThen-prime minister Stephen Harper first announced plans to build up to eight armed Arctic patrol vessels in July 2007 and Irving was selected in October 2011 to produce them before building replacements for the navy's frigates and destroyers.\n",
      "\tBut the following years saw several cost overruns and delays in the program.\n",
      "\tAfter work started on the DeWolf in 2015, Irving said it would only be able to build five ships with the $3.1 billion budgeted for the project. The government ended up increasing the budget to $4.1 billion for six.\n",
      "\tThat money does not include the two ships for the coast guard, which are expected to cost about $400 million each.\n",
      "\tTechnical problems were also blamed for pushing the delivery date back several times. Then Irving closed its Halifax shipyard in March for several months because of COVID-19.\n",
      "\tDespite those setbacks, University of Calgary professor Rob Huebert described the DeWolf's arrival as an \"amazing step forward\" for the Royal Canadian Navy. It's the first vessel specially built for military operations in the Arctic since the 1950s.\n",
      "\tAnd it couldn't come at a better time, as more and more countries are starting to increase their interest -- and military footprints -- in the Far North, which is becoming easier to access due to climate change, said Huebert, who is an expert on Arctic policy.\n",
      "\t\"Even the most profound Arctic exceptionalist who says the Arctic is just peace, love and 'Kumbaya' will recognize there is a growing need to have at least a presence in the Arctic as it opens up and becomes a greater part of the geopolitical environment,\" he said.\n",
      "\t\"But once again, this is going to now give us a capability to operate that we haven't had since a short little period between 1956 to '57 with (HMCS) Labrador.\"\n",
      "\tThe Labrador was an icebreaker built for the navy but was in the fleet just a few years before being transferred to non-military use.\n",
      "\tThe navy was actually disdainful when Harper announced the new Arctic ships in 2007. Part of it was their slow speed and light armament, as the ships have only one small cannon. But mostly it was because the navy saw the Arctic as coast guard territory.\n",
      "\t\"Because they had not done this since '57, there was a little bit of: OK, what the hell do we do with these ships? We know what we need to do with NATO and in the Pacific. But this is going to sort of require us to scratch our head,\"' Huebert said.\n",
      "\t\"Once the navy got comfortable and started realizing what it could do with it, that has subsequently changed.\"\n",
      "\tThe Royal Canadian Navy is only the latest naval force to join the fray in the Far North. Russia, the U.S., China and some European countries have been increasing their maritime capabilities in the region in recent years as part of a seemingly slow military buildup.\n",

      "CONTENT : \n",
      "\tHong Kong leader Carrie Lam announced Friday that the government will postpone highly anticipated legislative elections by one year, citing a worsening coronavirus outbreak in the semi-autonomous Chinese city.\n",
      "\tThe Hong Kong government is invoking an emergency ordinance in delaying the elections. Lam said the government has the support of the Chinese government in making the decision to hold the elections on Sept. 5, 2021.\n",
      "\t\"The announcement I have to make today is the most difficult decision I've had to make in the past seven months,\" Lam said at a news conference.\n",
      "\t\"We want to ensure fairness and public safety and health, and need to make sure the election is held in an open, fair and impartial manner. This decision is therefore essential,\" she said.\n",
      "\tThe postponement is a setback for the pro-democracy opposition, which was hoping to capitalize on disenchantment with the current pro-Beijing majority to make gains. A group of 22 lawmakers issued a statement ahead of the announcement accusing the government of using the outbreak as an excuse to delay the vote.\n",
      "\t\"Incumbent pro-democracy legislators, who represent 60% of the public's opinion, collectively oppose the postponement and emphasize the responsibility of the SAR government to make every effort to arrange adequate anti-epidemic measures to hold elections in September as scheduled,\" the group said, referring to the territory's official name, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.\n",
      "\t\"Otherwise, it is tantamount to uprooting the foundation of the establishment of the SAR.\"\n",
      "\tThe city of 7.5 million people has had a surge in coronavirus infections since the beginning of July. Hong Kong has recorded 3,273 infections as of Friday, more than double the tally on July 1.\n",
      "\tThe government has tightened social distancing restrictions, limiting public gatherings to two people, and banned dining-in at restaurants after 6 p.m.\n",
      "\tThe lead-up to the elections had been closely watched after a national security law that took effect in late June stipulated that candidates who violated the law would be barred from running.\n",
      "\tThe new law was seen as Beijing's attempt to curb dissent in the city after months of pro-democracy and anti-government protests rocked Hong Kong last year over a controversial -- but now withdrawn -- extradition bill that would allow suspects to be sent to the mainland for trial.\n",
      "\tThe monthslong protests plunged Hong Kong into its largest ever political crisis, with clashes between protesters and police turning violent at times. Over 8,000 people have been arrested in connection to the protests since June 2019.\n",
      "\tDissatisfaction with the Hong Kong government helped the pro-democracy bloc achieve a landslide victory in district council elections last November, a momentum that the opposition was hoping to ride to gain a majority in the legislature.\n",
      "\tIn Washington, White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said Friday the Trump administration strongly disapproved of Hong Kong's decision to postpone the election.\n",
      "\t\"We condemn the Hong Kong government's decision to postpone for one year its legislative council elections and to disqualify opposition candidates,\" McEnany said. \"This action undermines the democratic processes and freedoms that have underpinned Hong Kong's prosperity and this is only the most recent in a growing list of broken promises by Beijing which promised autonomy and freedoms to the Hong Kong people until 2047 in the Sino-British joint declaration.\"\n",
      "\tChina's foreign ministry insisted that Hong Kong's legislative elections are an \"internal affair.\"\n",
      "\t\"It is the responsibility of the Hong Kong SAR government to ensure that the elections for the 7th Legislative Council are held in a safe, orderly, fair and just environment,\" ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said Friday. \"We believe that the Hong Kong SAR government will proceed from the current anti-epidemic situation in Hong Kong and handle relevant matters in accordance with the law.\"\n",
      "\tOn Thursday, 12 pro-democracy candidates including prominent pro-democracy activist Joshua Wong were disqualified from running for not complying with the city's mini-constitution or pledging allegiance to the local and national governments.\n",
      "\t\"Beyond any doubt, this is the most scandalous election ever in Hong Kong history,\" Wong said at a news conference Friday. \"I wish to emphasize that no reasonable man would think that this election ban is not politically driven.\"\n",
      "\t\"Beijing has staged multiple acts to prevent the opposition bloc from taking the majority in the Hong Kong legislature,\" he said.\n",
      "\tGermany, which currently holds the European Union's rotating 6-month presidency, said it was suspending its extradition agreement with Hong Kong to protest the decision to postpone the elections and disqualify the candidates.\n",
      "\t\"We have repeatedly made clear our expectations that China will comply with its obligations under international law,\" German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said. \"This includes protecting the freedoms and rights guaranteed in the Basic Law, and this includes the right to free and fair elections.\"\n",
      "\tThe postponement also drew criticism from the New York-based group Human Rights Watch.\n",
      "\t\"Postponing the September elections for a year is a cynical move to contain a political emergency, not a public health one. This simply allows Hong Kong chief executive Carrie Lam to deny Hong Kong people their right to choose their government,\" said Sophie Richardson, the group's China director.\n",
      "\t\"Without making any attempt to look at alternative methods of voting, or ensuring all voting rights will be respected, Lam and her backers in Beijing are merely masking repression under the guise of public health,\" she said.\n",
      "\tSeparately, mainland state broadcaster CCTV said Friday that Hong Kong pro-democracy activist Nathan Law, former British Consulate employee Simon Cheng and four others were wanted under the national security law on suspicion of inciting secession and collusion with foreign forces.\n",
      "\tThe six are currently overseas, according to CCTV. Law fled Hong Kong for the U.K. in early July and Chen was granted political asylum in Britain.\n",
      "\tHong Kong police declined to comment.\n",

      "\t\"Hong Kong police officially ordered the arrests of six trouble-makers who have fled overseas,\" CCTV state television said.\n",
      "\tA crackdown on Hong Kong's democracy movement has increased apace in the month since Beijing imposed a sweeping national security law on the restless city.\n",

      "\tIt would be the first time the city's police have used the extraterritorial power in the new law to go after activists who are not in the territory.\n",
      "\tBesides Law, the other activists sought include former British consulate staffer Simon Cheng, pro-independence activists Ray Wong, Wayne Chan, Honcques Laus, and Samuel Chu, according to CCTV.\n",
      "\tThe report said the six were sought for \"incitement to secession and collusion with foreign forces\". \n",
      "\tHowever, in an email to AFP, the Hong Kong police said they \"do not comment on media reports\".\n",

      "\tBut it has also hastened the unravelling of Hong Kong's political freedoms and autonomy, supposedly guaranteed for 50 years after the 1997 handover from Britain.\n",
      "\tIn just a month since the new security law came into effect, a dozen leading pro-democracy campaigners have been disqualified from running in legislative elections and four students have been arrested on suspicion of \"inciting succession\" with social media posts.\n",

      "\tPeople who had visited Italy accounted for more than a quarter of the first reported cases of the new coronavirus outside China, according to a new study that found most initial infections were linked to just three countries. \n",
      "\tResearchers from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention used publicly-available data to trace the early spread of COVID-19 to dozens of affected countries in the 11 weeks before the World Health Organization declared it a pandemic.\n",
      "\tThey found that 27 percent of all the first reported cases were people with travel links to Italy, while 22 percent had been to China and 11 percent had travelled from Iran.  \n",
      "\t\"Our findings suggest that travel from just a few countries with substantial SARS-CoV-2 transmission may have seeded additional outbreaks around the world before the characterisation of COVID-19 as a pandemic on March 11, 2020,\" said the CDC's Fatimah Dawood, who co-led the research.\n",
      "\tThe study, which was published in the journal The Lancet Infectious Diseases this week, found that overall three quarters of the first cases in affected countries were linked to recent travel.\n",
      "\tOther initial cases were travellers from Southeast Asia, Europe, Africa and the Americas.\n",
      "\tResearchers examined online reports from health ministries and other government agency websites, social media feeds, and press releases for information on first cases and early outbreaks.  \n",
      "TRANSMISSION CLUSTERS\n",
      "\tMore than 17 million cases have so far been recorded worldwide since the virus first emerged in the Chinese city of Wuhan late last year.\n",
      "\tIts spread prompted China to quarantine millions of people in January. \n",
      "\tDays before the pandemic was declared on March 11, northern Italy went into lockdown, quickly followed by the rest of the country. \n",
      "\tThe study also looked at the characteristics of the early spread of infections, identifying 101 clusters -- involving 386 cases -- in 29 countries during the period before the pandemic was declared.\n",
      "\tThree quarters of these were attributed to relatively limited household transmission, with an average of 2.6 cases per cluster, the report said.\n",
      "\tThe 11 clusters relating to community gatherings -- for example tour groups, religious meetings and dinner parties -- were associated with much greater levels of infection, with 14.2 cases on average per cluster.\n",
      "\tTransmission in non-healthcare workplaces was associated with an average of 4.3 cases per cluster, researchers said, adding that the findings supported social distancing measures as a means to stop the spread.  \n",
      "\tThe authors cautioned that the first confirmed cases may not have been the true beginning of a country's outbreak given differences in different nation's abilities to detect the virus.\n",

      "\tEven a guy with decades of experience servicing elevators is creeped out by pushing the up and down buttons.\n",
      "\tLonnie Mackenzie, owner of Abco Elevator in Regina, has posted a video that offers three tips for a germ-free elevator ride.\n",
      "\tAs you approach an elevator, he says, “think about how many interesting and unique people have touched this button and if you’re like me, it kind of gives you that icky feeling in your stomach,” he says.\n",
      "\tHe always carries a pen to press those buttons, but using gloves or knuckles work, too.\n",
      "\tThat four-minute video is a telling window into the world we live in, where the risk of contracting COVID-19 is transforming a whole range of mundane, routine experiences. A trip on an elevator is certainly at the top of that list.\n",
      "\tIf the pandemic is causing people to fear small indoor spaces crowded with strangers, and having to touch surfaces that many others touch, the steel box that is an elevator is just about the worst imaginable place to be.\n",
      "\tThat threat is real, say experts.\n",
      "\tAccording to a study by the Centers for Disease Control, it took just riding in the same elevator at different times for a woman to contract the novel coronavirus from her upstairs neighbour, an asymptomatic carrier, in China.\n",
      "\tHealth authorities are recommending elevator behaviour that once would have seemed, at best, anti-social. In Calgary, riders are advised to face the wall and some office buildings in Toronto have decals on the floor instructing passengers to stand with their feet pointed into the corner.\n",
      "\tEven elevator executives are wary right now.\n",
      "\t“I don’t think you or I will be getting on an elevator with 10 or 12 people on board for a long time,” said Kelly Leitch, managing director of KONE Canada.\n",
      "\t“We all want to feel safer right now and I think this changes things forever.”\n",
      "\tHe and other elevator industry insiders who spoke to CTVNews.ca largely agree that the future of the elevator is touchless, highly automated, mobile and dedicated to moving people with optimal efficiency.\n",
      "\tCOVID-19 is rapidly shifting the conversation among developers, builders, and property managers about elevators, says industry consultant Rob Isabelle. What were seen as gadgets just six months ago, are now seen as necessary to reassuring the public.\n",
      "\t“Just about every contractor has a pilot technology in somewhere that will be a standard five years from now,” Isabelle told CTVNews.ca from Toronto.\n",
      "\tBut right now, elevators are a pinch point in many workplaces as a growing number of people return to work but have to spread out as they get there.\n",
      "\tIsabelle says modelling shows it would take three hours for just half of the 10,000 employees at the four-tower Commerce Court in Toronto’s financial district to get to their office in the morning.\n",
      "\tCOVID-19 is accelerating the adoption and creation of elevator technology, says Jon Clarine, head of digital services for ThyssenKrupp Elevator, who is based in Atlanta.\n",
      "\tHe expects more investment in sophisticated elevator systems because tenants will be willing to pay that cost.\n",
      "\t“The optimum experience now has great value. Every building is looking for solutions to help tenants feel comfortable to return to work. It’s not about bells and whistles any more. It’s health and safety.”\n",
      "\tGeorge Foleanu, vice-president with Dupar Controls in Cambridge, Ont., says some in-demand solutions include glass-fronted touchscreens that are sealed just like a smartphone, meaning they can withstand disinfection, touchless call buttons that will summon an elevator with a wave of the hand, or direct it with just a hovering finger.\n",
      "\t“Long term, no one wants to touch buttons and not just for COVID-19, but for colds and the flu,” said Shaun Harper, a field supervisor with West Coast Elevator. The company has collaborated with NZ Technologies that develops touchless devices for operating rooms.\n",
      "\tTogether, they’ve created a tablet-like device for elevators that allows users to hover a finger over their desired floor. It’s being prototyped in a building at the University of British Columbia.\n",
      "\t“We believe it’s the most adaptable solution because it can be used in any type of elevator. And the existing mechanical buttons remain if someone can’t understand the technology.”\n",
      "\tMajor elevator companies are also exploring the use of voice commands and facial recognition to operate elevators. Technology has been being developed in China that uses a hologram to project virtual buttons into the air.\n",
      "\tOne technology that is found in high-end office towers across the country is a system dubbed destination dispatch in which riders enter their floor on a touchscreen and are directed to a specific elevator with others going to the same floor or those in the same vicinity. No more stopping at every floor.\n",
      "\t“Four people going to the same floor on four different elevators slows everything down,” said elevator consultant Ray Eleid, who is based in Mississauga, Ont.\n",
      "\tBundling runs together improves efficiency by 30 to 40 per cent, but also improves pandemic physical distancing. ThyssenKrupp’s Agile system has been programmed so that it only directs two or three people to an elevator, says Clarine.\n",
      "\t“It can be defined depending on that size of the car. In some cases, only one person is sent to each elevator.”\n",
      "\tAdvanced destination dispatch systems are tied into turnstiles where employees swipe their cards for entry to office towers. The system automatically summons an elevator and directs the user to which one to take.\n",
      "\tThose systems are found in a few New York City office towers and KONE Canada is installing its first such platform in an office building in Saskatchewan.\n",
      "\tKONE uses the same technology to direct crowds at sporting events and concerts in Boston based on a QR code on their ticket.\n",
      "\t“This contributes to better traffic flow from the minute you come into a building and there is no need to push a button or touch a door,” said Leitch. “I think COVID will automate all of that.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\tThe next layer is an app that ties into proximity sensors in a building so that the system knows where you are and will call an elevator as you approach. Preregistered users are already cleared for access to restricted floors and the elevator takes you to your default floor.\n",
      "\tIf a user needs another destination – to attend a meeting or get a coffee – they can override the default floor.\n",
      "\t“If it’s to be truly hands-free and germ-free, then an app is where it’s at,” said Eleid.\n",
      "\tBut Bluetooth connectivity remains a challenge. A rider would connect in the hallway, but then has to switch to a transmitter within the car, a steel box that isn’t the best environment for stable connections. Depending on the phone, its software and its version of Bluetooth, it can be tricky, says Eleid.\n",
      "\tNear-field communications, like what’s embedded into credit and debit cards to allow the tap touchless payment function, could be another solution, but it is still being explored.\n",
      "\t“If there is any lag in speed of connecting, you could end up going in the wrong direction on the elevator. That could lead to frustrations.”\n",
      "\tNo building in Canada as of yet has elevators that can be controlled through apps, says Eleid, but at least two buildings in New York City are using the technology.\n",
      "\tThere is a “huge appetite” for touchless, and ultimately, mobile-based elevator systems, he says. But of course, they have to be highly secure and hack-proof. Workplace elevator apps would be tied to a having a security profile in a building.\n",
      "\t“It can’t be vulnerable to a disgruntled tenant calling elevators repeatedly and paralyzing the system.”\n",
      "\tTouchless, sensor based systems work for robots that deliver items in hospitals, hotels and factories because the robots are able to command the elevators to move from floor to floor. Elevators will be smart enough one day to tell occupants to stop jumping or to hold the door longer for someone accompanying children or juggling shopping bags, says Eleid.\n",
      "\tState-of-the-art dispatching platforms are impressive and efficient, but only make sense in buildings with four to eight elevators, says Doug Guderian, president of Elevator One in Barrie, Ont.\n",
      "\tMost buildings are small – five storeys or less – and there isn’t a return on large investment in touchless or mobile systems, says Guderian.\n",
      "\t“Tying different technologies together can be difficult. Many elevators still run on old relay systems. There isn’t even a computer in them. They are 40 years old and very reliable but how do you get a cellphone app to talk to that?”\n",
      "\tSome of the innovation coming to an elevator near you is more low-tech.\n",
      "\tThat includes large buttons mounted at floor level in halls and elevators that are hit with a shoe, or replacement of plastic or stainless steel buttons – surfaces believed to host the coronavirus for up to seven days – with copper, which has anti-microbial properties.\n",
      "\t“It is quite remarkable because it’s very antibacterial,” said epidemiologist Colin Furness.\n",
      "\t“Nothing survives on copper for long because it doesn’t reproduce and we don’t really know why.”\n",
      "\tIf he has to touch an elevator button, he uses a knuckle and always has hand sanitizer in his pocket.\n",
      "\tDupar Controls’ George Foleanu says technology is ramping up in elevators but he expects there will always be a place for the button.\n",
      "\t“They are easy, intuitive and reliable. They always give you want you want. I’m not sure that buttons will disappear,” he said.\n",
      "\t“Radio wave communication has been around since the 1960s and we are still pushing buttons.”\n",
      "\tExisting technology is also being repurposed to handle the pandemic.\n",
      "\tFor instance, load weighing devices that sense how many people are on board an elevator can be used to monitor physical distancing, said Bogdan Rus, vice-president of operations at Toronto’s Element Elevators.\n",
      "\t“If that was above 80 per cent before, it’s now set at about 20 per cent. So if two people get on the ninth floor, the elevator will skip a call at the fifth floor to go back to the lobby. Once those people get off, it will go back to that call on five.”\n",
      "\tKONE has entered a partnership with NanoSeptic, a Virginia-based company that has developed self-cleaning products that adhere to high-touch areas such as elevator buttons, touchscreen surfaces and elevator car handrails.\n",
      "\tThey use available light and mineral nano-crystals to continually oxidize organic contaminants, which the company claims is more effective than bleach.\n",
      "\tUltra-violet light devices are being embedded into the handrails of escalators to disinfect as they roll underneath and systems are being used that detect when an elevator is empty and then bath the cabin with UV light or even mist disinfectant spray.\n",
      "\n",
      "\tOther innovators are developing antimicrobial coatings or sprays that can be applied to buttons and handrails.\n",
      "\tEnvisionSQ in Guelph, Ont. has developed a self-sterilizing clear coating for hard surfaces the company says kills viruses and bacteria on contact and provides long-lasting protection. The company has scaled up production to more than 1,000 litres a week, which it says is enough to cover the interior of 8,750 elevators.\n",
      "\tIf this pandemic experience leads to a permanent reluctance to ride packed elevators in the future, that means buildings will need either more elevators or better efficiency from existing ones. And since the square footage given over to mechanical systems like elevators make no monthly income, the pressure is on to move more people within less space.\n",
      "\tClarine sees a growing demand for ropeless elevators, first developed by ThyssenKrupp in 2017. The company’s MULTI system travels through magnetic levitation, the same technology used by high-speed trains and would transform the elevator in a way not seen since its invention 166 years ago.\n",
      "\tInstead of mechanical cables to raise and lower a cabin, mag-lev means multiple individually powered elevator cars float up and down and sideways within elevator shafts. The technology, which is being installed in its first building, the East Side Tower in Berlin slated for completion in 2021, allows for a loop system within a building or series of connected buildings.\n",
      "\tThink of it like a mini-transit system, with sections of track rotating between vertical and horizontal to change directions of cabins.\n",
      "\t“That gives a dramatic improvement in capacity with a smaller footprint for elevators,” said Carline.\n",
      "\tIt also overcomes a limiting factor in tall buildings – the interference building sway causes on traditional elevator rope mechanics that mean they can’t rise above about 500 metres.\n",
      "\tThe 830-metre, 163-storey Burj Khalifa in Dubai, the world’s tallest building, also includes the world’s longest elevator at 504 metres.\n",

      "CONTENT : BEIJING -- \n",
      "\tChina is celebrating the completion of its BeiDou Navigation Satellite System that could rival the U.S. Global Positioning System and significantly boost China's security and geopolitical clout.\n",
      "\tPresident Xi Jinping, the leader of the ruling Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army, officially commissioned the system Friday at a ceremony at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing.\n",
      "\tThat followed a declaration that the 55th and final geostationary satellite in the constellation launched June 23 was operating after having completed all tests.\n",
      "\tThe satellite is part of the third iteration of the BeiDou system known as BDS-3, which began providing navigation services in 2018 to countries taking part in China's sprawling \"Belt and Road\" infrastructure initiative along with others.\n",
      "\tAs well as being a navigation aid with an extremely high degree of accuracy, the system offers short message communication of up to 1,200 Chinese characters and the ability to transmit images.\n",
      "\tForeign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said the system is already in use in more than half the world's nations and stressed China's dedication to the peaceful use of space and desire to work with other countries.\n",
      "\t\"China is willing to continue to strengthen exchanges and co-operation in space and share the achievements of space development with other countries on the basis of mutual respect, openness, inclusiveness, equality and mutual benefit,\" Wang said at a daily briefing.\n",
      "\tWhile China says it seeks co-operation with other satellite navigation systems, BeiDou could ultimately compete against GPS, Russia's GLONASS and the European Union's Galileo networks. That's similar to how Chinese mobile phone makers and other producers of technically sophisticated hardware have taken on their foreign rivals.\n",
      "\tThe official Xinhua News Agency said BeiDou is compatible with the three other systems but gave no details on how they would work together.\n",
      "\tFor China, among the chief advantages of the system, whose construction began 30 years ago, is the ability to replace GPS for guiding its missiles, especially important now amid rising tensions with Washington.\n",
      "\tIt also stands to raise China's economic and political leverage over nations adopting the system, ensuring that they line up behind China's position on Taiwan, Tibet the South China Sea and other sensitive matters or risk losing their access.\n",
      "\tKey to China's success was the China Academy of Space Technology's development of rubidium atomic clocks that provide time and frequency standards for BDS satellites, Xinhua said.\n",
      "\tIt said the system was proof that attempts by Washington to impose a \"tough hi-tech blockage\" and crackdown on Chinese companies such as Huawei had failed.\n",
      "\t\"In spite of such measures, China's innovation capability has only grown stronger. Just as President Xi recently said at a symposium on China's economic work: 'No country nor individual can stop the historical pace of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation,\" Xinhua said.\n",

      "\tThe Royal Canadian Navy is poised to enter a new era by taking possession of the first armed warship under the federal government's multibillion-dollar shipbuilding plan, and the first built for Arctic military operations in decades.\n",
      "\tHMCS Harry DeWolf was welcomed in a ceremony at Canadian Forces Base Halifax on Friday, five years after Irving Shipbuilding first started cutting steel on the Arctic offshore patrol ship -- and two years later than originally scheduled.\n",
      "\tTop navy officers marked the occasion along with representatives from Irving, which is slated to build five more such vessels for the navy and two for the Canadian Coast Guard in the next few years.\n",
      "\t\"These ships will be at the core of an enhanced Canadian Arctic presence, effectively complementing the capabilities of our other current and future warships through critical reconnaissance and surveillance operations,\" said Vice-Admiral Art McDonald, the commander of the navy, in a statement.\n",
      "\tHarry DeWolf was a career navy officer who retired as chief of the naval staff in 1960. He rose to prominence as commander of HMCS Haida during the Second World War, known for daring tactical manoeuvres and sinking numerous enemy vessels, especially in the English Channel.\n",
      "\tWhile the DeWolf's delivery is a major milestone for the federal government's shipbuilding plan -- through which Ottawa is replacing nearly all of the large ships in the navy and coast guard -- it wasn't easy coming.\n",
      "\tThen-prime minister Stephen Harper first announced plans to build up to eight armed Arctic patrol vessels in July 2007 and Irving was selected in October 2011 to produce them before building replacements for the navy's frigates and destroyers.\n",
      "\tBut the following years saw several cost overruns and delays in the program.\n",
      "\tAfter work started on the DeWolf in 2015, Irving said it would only be able to build five ships with the $3.1 billion budgeted for the project. The government ended up increasing the budget to $4.1 billion for six.\n",
      "\tThat money does not include the two ships for the coast guard, which are expected to cost about $400 million each.\n",
      "\tTechnical problems were also blamed for pushing the delivery date back several times. Then Irving closed its Halifax shipyard in March for several months because of COVID-19.\n",
      "\tDespite those setbacks, University of Calgary professor Rob Huebert described the DeWolf's arrival as an \"amazing step forward\" for the Royal Canadian Navy. It's the first vessel specially built for military operations in the Arctic since the 1950s.\n",
      "\tAnd it couldn't come at a better time, as more and more countries are starting to increase their interest -- and military footprints -- in the Far North, which is becoming easier to access due to climate change, said Huebert, who is an expert on Arctic policy.\n",
      "\t\"Even the most profound Arctic exceptionalist who says the Arctic is just peace, love and 'Kumbaya' will recognize there is a growing need to have at least a presence in the Arctic as it opens up and becomes a greater part of the geopolitical environment,\" he said.\n",
      "\t\"But once again, this is going to now give us a capability to operate that we haven't had since a short little period between 1956 to '57 with (HMCS) Labrador.\"\n",
      "\tThe Labrador was an icebreaker built for the navy but was in the fleet just a few years before being transferred to non-military use.\n",
      "\tThe navy was actually disdainful when Harper announced the new Arctic ships in 2007. Part of it was their slow speed and light armament, as the ships have only one small cannon. But mostly it was because the navy saw the Arctic as coast guard territory.\n",
      "\t\"Because they had not done this since '57, there was a little bit of: OK, what the hell do we do with these ships? We know what we need to do with NATO and in the Pacific. But this is going to sort of require us to scratch our head,\"' Huebert said.\n",
      "\t\"Once the navy got comfortable and started realizing what it could do with it, that has subsequently changed.\"\n",
      "\tThe Royal Canadian Navy is only the latest naval force to join the fray in the Far North. Russia, the U.S., China and some European countries have been increasing their maritime capabilities in the region in recent years as part of a seemingly slow military buildup.\n",
      "This report by The Canadian Press was first published July 31, 2020.\n",

      "\tFormer Taiwanese President Lee Teng-hui, who brought direct elections and other democratic changes to the self-governed island despite missile launches and other fierce saber-rattling by China, has died. He was 97.\n",
      "\tTaipei Veterans General Hospital said Lee died Thursday evening after suffering from infections, cardiac problems and organ failure since being hospitalized in February.\n",
      "\tLee strove to create a separate, non-Chinese identity for Taiwan, angering not only China, which considers the island part of its territory, but also members of his Nationalist Party who hoped to return victorious to the mainland.\n",
      "\tLee later openly endorsed formal independence for the island but illness in his later years prompted him to largely withdraw from public life.\n",
      "\t\"President Lee's contribution to Taiwan's democratic journey was irreplaceable and his death is a great loss for the country,\" current President Tsai Ing-wen said in a statement.\n",
      "\tTsai's predecessor, Ma Ying-jeou of the Nationalists, who earlier served in Lee's Cabinet, said Lee's contribution to Taiwan's democratization \"deserves recognition from the people.\"\n",
      "\t\"Although former President Lee's political philosophy has undergone tremendous changes after his resignation, former President Ma is still grateful for his dedication to the country and believes that history will have a fair and objective evaluation,\" a statement from Ma's office said.\n",
      "\tPhysically imposing and charismatic, Lee spanned Taiwan's modern history and was native to the island, unlike many who arrived with Chiang Kai-shek in 1949, at the end of the Chinese civil war.\n",
      "\tAt times gruff, at times personable, he left little doubt he was the man in charge in almost any setting.\n",
      "\t\"A leader must be tough and strong enough so he can put an end to disputes and chaotic situations,\" he wrote in his autobiography.\n",
      "\tHe was born in a farming community near Taipei on Jan 15, 1923, near the midpoint of Japan's half-century colonial rule. The son of a Japanese police aide, he volunteered in the Imperial Japanese Army and returned to Taiwan as a newly commissioned second lieutenant to help man an anti-aircraft battery.\n",
      "\tHe earned degrees in Japan and Taiwan, as well as at Iowa State University and Cornell University in New York. He worked for the U.S.-sponsored Joint Commission on Rural Reconstruction, which sought to encourage land reform and modernize Taiwanese agriculture. He was a member of overwhelmingly Buddhist Taiwan's Christian minority.\n",
      "\tJapanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, noting Lee's close ties with Japan, praised him for his contributions to bolster friendship between Japan and Taiwan. \"Many Japanese people have developed special attachment to President Lee as a leader who had established freedom, democracy and universal values in Taiwan and cornerstone of Japan-Taiwan relation,(asterisk) Abe said Friday.\n",
      "\tIn 1971, Lee joined the governing Nationalist Party. As a descendant of the people who migrated to the island from China in the 17th and 18th centuries, he was part of the party's effort to broaden its base beyond the 1949 arrivals from the mainland. He was Taipei mayor, Taiwan province governor and vice-president before succeeding to the presidency in 1988.\n",
      "\tIn his early years as president, Lee met significant resistance from Nationalist hard-liners who favoured the party's tradition of mainlander domination and resented Lee's native status. He beat back the resistance, largely by giving his detractors important political positions.\n",
      "\tIn 1990, Lee signalled his support for student demands for direct elections of Taiwan's president and vice-president and the end of reserving legislative seats to represent districts on the Chinese mainland. The following year he oversaw the dismantling of emergency laws put into effect by Chiang Kai-shek's government, effectively reversing the Nationalists' long-standing goal of returning to the mainland and removing the Communists from power.\n",
      "\tCommunist China saw the democratic steps as a direct threat to its claim to Taiwan, and its anger was exacerbated when Lee visited the United States in 1995. To Beijing, Lee's visit to Cornell signalled the United States was willing to accord special recognition to the ruler of a \"renegade\" Chinese province.\n",
      "\tThe U.S. made sure Lee did not meet with high-ranking American officials, including then-President Bill Clinton, but its attempts to dampen Chinese anger were unsuccessful.\n",
      "\tChina soon began a series of threatening military manoeuvrs off the coast of mainland Fujian province that included the firing of missiles just off Taiwan's coast. More missiles were fired immediately before the March 1996 presidential elections, and the U.S. response was to send aircraft carrier battle groups to Taiwan's east coast in a show of support. Taiwanese were uncowed and the elections went ahead, with Lee victorious.\n",
      "\tIn a celebrated interview in late 1996, Lee declared that relations between Taiwan and China had the character of relations between two separate states. This was heresy, not only in the eyes of Beijing, but also for many Nationalists, who continued to see Taiwan as part of China, and looked forward to eventual union between the sides, though not necessarily under Communist control.\n",
      "\tIn 2000, Taiwan elected Chen Shui-bian of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party as president, ending a half-century of Nationalist monopoly. His election was virtually guaranteed by a split in the Nationalist Party, which had two representatives in the race. The retiring Lee had supported one of them but was still blamed for the split, and the party moved to expel him.\n",
      "\tIn 2001, supporters of Lee formed a new pro-independence party. The Taiwan Solidarity Union also wanted to break the cultural and political connection between the island and the mainland.\n",
      "\tLee himself backed away from wanting a formal declaration of independence for Taiwan, insisting it already was, given the island was not Chinese Communist-controlled.\n",
      "\tIn 2012, he backed independence-minded candidate Tsai of the DPP, who lost to Ma, an avatar of closer ties between China and Taiwan.\n",
      "\tTsai ran again and was elected in 2016, upping tensions again with China. Lee was ailing by that time and played little role in the election. Tsai won re-election this year by a healthy margin over her Nationalist challenger.\n",
      "\tLee is survived by his wife of seven decades, Tseng Wen-hui, and their two daughters. A son died in 1982 from cancer.\n",
      "\tThere was no immediate announcement about funeral arrangements.\n",

      "CONTENT : WASHINGTON -- \n",
      "\tSecretary of State Mike Pompeo said Thursday that he and his team have warned Russian officials about all threats that Russia poses to Americans and U.S. interests in various parts of the world. Pompeo also defended the Trump administration's tough line on China, saying the communist nation represents a potent threat to the U.S. and Western-style democracy.\n",
      "\tPompeo would not say whether he had specifically raised allegations that Russia is paying bounties to Taliban fighters to kill American troops in Afghanistan, but he said the discussions with the Russians involved all manner of threats. He told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that threats from Russia against Americans in Afghanistan, Libya, Syria, Ukraine and elsewhere had been covered.\n",
      "\tPompeo's testimony came a day after U.S. President Donald Trump told an interviewer he had not raised the bounty allegations in numerous phone calls with Russian President Vladimir Putin despite concerns about them from the intelligence community. Among the Russian officials, Pompeo said he has discussed threats generally with Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, as has the U.S. ambassador to Russia, John Sullivan.\n",
      "\t\"Yes, I can assure you that each time I have spoken to Foreign Minister Lavrov, I have raised all of the issues that put any Americans at risk,\" Pompeo said in response to a question from the committee's top Democrat, Sen. Bob Menendez of New Jersey. \"We have raised this at my level and not only at my level.\"\n",
      "\tPompeo declined to say whether he would recommend that Trump raise the matter with Putin but said the Russian leader understood full well the U.S. position. He pointed to military action taken against several hundred Russian mercenaries who were advancing on American forces in Syria in 2019. Those fighters \"are no longer on this planet,\" Pompeo noted.\n",
      "\tMenendez, a vocal critic of Pompeo, challenged him about the Russian threats and Wednesday's announcement by the Trump administration about the redeployment of several thousand U.S. troop s from Germany. Trump's top diplomat rejected complaints that the administration has been soft on Russia.\n",
      "\t\"We're the toughest administration ever on Russia,\" Pompeo said, noting the many steps, including sanctions, that have been taken to counter Russian disinformation, Moscow's dominance over European energy supplies and aggressive actions in Ukraine and Georgia.\n",
      "\tNumerous critics, including some former Trump administration officials, have said Trump's self-acknowledged personal affinity for Putin has undercut U.S. efforts to both counter Russian aggression and enlist allies to join its cause. They have pointed to Trump's refusal to accept intelligence findings that Russia tried to help him win election in 2016, the president's willingness to praise Putin, and his efforts to condition vital military assistance to Ukraine on a political favour.\n",
      "\tPompeo rejected those assertions.\n",
      "\t\"This administration has acted to protect our interests and our friends,\" Pompeo said, adding that he and others would act to counter Russian attempts to meddle in the 2020 presidential election. \"We're taking seriously the threats that the Russians will engage in disinformation campaigns.\"\n",
      "\tPompeo said the administration is acting with sanctions and threats of such penalties to prevent Russia from completing the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which would carry natural gas to Europe, in particular Germany, and increase the continent's dependence on Moscow for fuel.\n",

      "CONTENT : BEIJING -- \n",
      "\tChina's latest coronavirus outbreak has spread to a second city in the northwestern region of Xinjiang.\n",
      "\tOne of the 17 new cases reported on Monday was in the ancient Silk Road city of Kashgar, the regional government said on its official microblog. The remainder were in the regional capital of Urumqi, where all other cases have been reported since the outbreak that has now infected at least 47 people emerged earlier this month.\n",
      "\tAuthorities in Urumqi have tried to prevent the spread by closing off communities and imposing travel restrictions.\n",
      "\tXinjiang is a vast, thinly populated region of mountains and deserts and had seen little impact from the pandemic that emerged from the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year and was largely contained within China in March.\n",
      "\tAnother five new cases reported Monday by the National Health Commission were imported.\n",
      "\tChina also said 5,370 people had been arrested for pandemic-related crimes between January and June. More than 40% were charged with fraud, the state prosecutor's office announced on its official microblog. Another 15% were charged with obstruction of law enforcement, with others accused of producing and selling fake and shoddy goods, creating public disturbances, and transporting and selling endangered species.\n",
      "\tChina has strengthened protection for wild animals following the emergence of the virus, which may have originated in bats before jumping to humans via an intermediary species such as the anteater-like pangolin.\n",
      "\tNo specific figures were given for those accused of violating quarantine rules and travel restrictions, although there have been relatively few such cases reported in official media.\n",
      "\tAlthough faulted for allowing the virus to spread from Wuhan, China's government has been credited with imposing rigid and sometimes draconian measures to contain the outbreak, and people have overwhelmingly complied with orders to wear masks, display certificates of good health and maintain social distancing.\n",
      "\tIn other developments in the Asia-Pacific region:\n",
      "\t- A record surge of 40,425 reported cases of coronavirus in the past 24 hours took India's total to 1,118,043. The Health Ministry on Monday also reported another 681 deaths, taking total fatalities to 27,497. India has the third most cases and eighth most deaths in the world. A country of 1.4 billion people, India has been conducting nearly 10,000 tests per million population. More than 300,000 samples are being tested daily, according to the Indian Council of Medical Research, India's top medical research body. With India's national lockdown largely lifted, local governments have been ordering focused lockdowns on high-risk areas where new outbreaks are surging.\n",
      "\t- India has started human trials of an indigenously developed coronavirus vaccine at the country's top hospital. The human trials of COVAXIN started Monday at All India Institute of Medical Sciences in New Delhi, hospital director Dr. Randeep Guleria said. He said it would take at least three months for researchers to gather the first set of data. The hospital is among 12 sites selected by the Indian Council for Medical Research to conduct phase 1 and phase 2 human trials of the vaccine. COVAXIN has been developed by Bharat Biotech, a pharmaceutical company based in the southern city of Hyderabad. At least half a dozen Indian companies are developing vaccines for the virus.\n",
      "\t- Australia's hard-hit Victoria state reported 275 more COVID-19 cases on Monday, a third daily figure that was below last Friday's peak. Victoria Premier Daniel Andrews said the impact of the lockdown on Australia's second-largest city Melbourne should become apparent Wednesday, which is two weeks after the six-week shutdown began. “It is a wicked enemy, it is unstable and until we bring some stability to this, I don't think we'll be able to talk about a trend,” Andrews said. Victoria had conducted more than 1.3 million coronavirus tests among a population of 6.5 million, which represented one of the highest testing rates in the world, he said.\n",
      "\t- South Korea has reported its smallest daily jump in local COVID-19 transmissions in two months as health authorities express cautious optimism that the outbreak is being brought under control. South Korea's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Monday still reported 26 newly confirmed cases of the coronavirus, including 22 that were tied to international arrivals. Vice Health Minister Kim Gang-lip said the four local cases were the first below 10 since May 19. He continued to plead for vigilance, encouraging people to avoid crowded places or even stay at home during the summer holiday period.\n",
      "\t- Hong Kong reported 73 new coronavirus infections on Monday, 66 of which were locally transmitted, as the city grapples with a new outbreak. Of the locally transmitted infections, 27 were from unknown sources while the remaining 39 were linked to previously known clusters. Among the new patients was a doctor who visited an elderly care home. Hong Kong's health officials said tighter anti-virus measures may be required if the trend does not come down over the next few days. Hong Kong has reported a total of 1,958 coronavirus infections, with 12 deaths.\n",

      "\tChinese are enthusiastic movie goers and the country was expected to surpass the U.S. this year as the world's biggest box office before the pandemic hit.\n",
      "\tThe cinema re-openings come as China is relaxing many restrictions while maintaining mask wearing, temperature checks and social distancing. A cluster of cases in the far western region of Xinjiang is China's only current outbreak of domestic infections, and mandatory two-week quarantines remain in effect for Chinese arriving from abroad to guard against imported cases.\n",
      "\tEconomic activity has gradually recovered and China reported an unexpectedly strong 3.2% expansion in its GDP during the latest quarter after lockdowns were lifted and factories and stores reopened.\n",
      "\tThat made China the first economy to resume economic growth since the pandemic began in its central city of Wuhan. The 6.8% contraction in January-March was the country's worst downturn since at least the mid-1960s.\n",

      "\tMalaysia has discovered 110 containers of illegally dumped toxic waste in what authorities are calling \"the biggest finding of its kind\" in the country's history, according to state media Bernama.\n",
      "\tThe containers were dumped last month at the Port of Tanjung Pelepas, in Johor state, Bernama reported on Sunday. Inside was 1,864 tonnes of electric arc furnace dust (EAFD) -- a hazardous by-product of steel production, containing toxic elements such as lead and chromium.\n",
      "\tThey were brought into the country from Romania and falsely declared as concentrated zinc, officials said.\n",
      "\t\"The discovery of the EAFD, on transit in Malaysia and bound for Indonesia, is the biggest finding of its kind in Malaysian history,\" said Environment and Water Minister Tuan Ibrahim Tuan Man in the Bernama report.\n",
      "\tMalaysia is sending the waste back to Romania and asking Interpol to investigate.\n",
      "\tSince China banned plastic waste imports in 2018 in an attempt to clean up its environment many countries have looked for alternative dumping grounds for their trash, creating problems for countries including Cambodia, Malaysia and the Philippines.\n",
      "\tTo limit irresponsible dumping, last year 187 countries added plastic to the Basel Convention, a treaty that regulates the movement of hazardous materials from one country to another. But the problem has continued regardless.\n",
      "\tEAFD, the illegal shipment found in Malaysia, is classified as toxic waste under the Basel Convention, of which Malaysia is a signatory. Only the U.S., one of the world's biggest plastic producers, and Haiti have not ratified the agreement.\n",
      "\t \n",
      "\t \n",
      "\tThe waste dumping crisis has garnered greater global attention in recent years, as countries like Malaysia and the Philippines have begun naming and shaming waste exporters and sending dumped trash back to their ports of origin.\n",
      "Last May, Malaysia sent back 450 tonnes of plastic waste to their countries of origin, including the the United Kingdom, Canada, the U.S., Japan, and the Netherlands.\n",
      "\t\"We urge the developed countries to review their management of plastic waste and stop shipping garbage to developing countries,\" said Yeo Bee Yin, Malaysia's then-minister of energy, science, technology, environment and climate change.\n",
      "\tBut the problem has persisted; Malaysian authorities have already identified and halted at least 28 attempts to illegally import waste this year, Tuan Man said according to Bernama.\n",
      "\tWaste dumping has even escalated into highly publicized diplomatic clashes; last year, Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte recalled his ambassador to Ottawa after Canada missed a deadline to take back tonnes of its garbage. The Canadian government finally repatriated their trash after Duterte said he was prepared to \"declare war\" over the issue.\n",
      "\tMany of these governments, as well as non-profit and environmental organizations, hailed the 2019 Basel Convention amendment as a step in the right direction. It specifically addressed the issue of plastic waste -- a huge concern for health and environmental experts.\n",
      "\tMost types of plastic aren't biodegradable, and are extremely durable. That means the plastic products made today will probably persist for centuries, if not millennia, according to the Basel Convention site. Over time, some products break down and add to the vast collections of microplastics in our seas, air and food.\n",
      "\tThe trash industry has also created a rise in unlicensed plastic recyclers. Last year, Malaysian authorities found at least 148 unlicensed recycling factories that pollute local communities with toxic fumes and contaminate bodies of water.\n",
      "\tWhen investigators searched through one such factory in the rural town of Jenjarom, they found tons of plastic from overseas -- a wrapper for Poland Spring bottled water from Connecticut, a bottle of Palmer's Cocoa Butter Formula manufactured in New Jersey, and a bag of Metcalfe's Skinny Popcorn packaged in the United Kingdom.\n",
      "\tA new amendment to the Basel Convention, which will come into effect in 2021, will allow only clean, homogeneous, and readily recyclable nonhalogenated polymers to be freely traded globally.\n",

      "CONTENT : LONDON -- \n",
      "\tScientists at Oxford University say their experimental coronavirus vaccine has been shown in an early trial to prompt a protective immune response in hundreds of people who got the shot.\n",
      "\tBritish researchers first began testing the vaccine in April in about 1,000 people, half of whom got the experimental vaccine. Such early trials are designed to evaluate safety and see what kind of immune response was provoked, but can't tell if the vaccine truly protects.\n",
      "\tIn research published Monday in the journal Lancet, scientists said that they found their experimental COVID-19 vaccine produced a dual immune response in people aged 18 to 55 that lasted at least two months after they were immunized.\n",
      "\t\"We are seeing good immune response in almost everybody,\" said Dr. Adrian Hill, director of the Jenner Institute at Oxford University. \"What this vaccine does particularly well is trigger both arms of the immune system,\" he said.\n",
      "\tHill said that neutralizing antibodies are produced -- molecules which are key to blocking infection. In addition, the vaccine also causes a reaction in the body's T-cells which help to fight off the coronavirus.\n",
      "\tThe experimental COVID-19 vaccine caused minor side effects like fever, chills and muscle pain more often than in those who got a control meningitis vaccine.\n",
      "\tHill said that larger trials evaluating the vaccine's effectiveness, involving about 10,000 people in the U.K. as well as participants in South Africa and Brazil are still underway. Another big trial is slated to start in the U.S. soon, aiming to enrol about 30,000 people.\n",
      "\tHow quickly scientists are able to determine the vaccine's effectiveness will depend largely on how much more transmission there is, but Hill estimated they might have sufficient data by the end of the year to decide if the vaccine should be adopted for mass vaccination campaigns.\n",
      "\tHe said the vaccine seemed to produce a comparable level of antibodies to those produced by people who recovered from a COVID-19 infection and hoped that the T-cell response would provide extra protection.\n",
      "\t\"There's increasing evidence that having a T-cell response as well as antibodies could be very important in controlling COVID-19,\" Hill said. He suggested the immune response might be boosted after a second dose; their trial tested two doses administered about four weeks apart.\n",
      "\tHill said Oxford's vaccine is designed to reduce disease and transmission. It uses a harmless virus -- a chimpanzee cold virus, engineered so it can't spread -- to carry the coronavirus' spike protein into the body, which should trigger an immune system response.\n",
      "\tHill said Oxford has partnered with drugmaker AstraZeneca to produce their vaccine globally, and that the company has already committed to making 2 billion doses.\n",
      "\t\"Even 2 billion doses may not be enough,\" he said, underlining the importance of having multiple shots to combat the coronavirus.\n",
      "\t\"There was a hope that if we had a vaccine quickly enough, we could put out the pandemic,\" Hill said, noting the continuing surge of infections globally. \"I think its going to be very difficult to control this pandemic without a vaccine.\"\n",
      "\tNumerous countries including Germany, France, the Netherlands, Italy, U.S. and the U.K. have all signed deals to receive hundreds of millions of doses of the vaccine -- which has not yet been licensed -- with the first deliveries scheduled for the fall. British politicians have promised that if the shot proves effective, Britons will be the first to get it.\n",
      "\tChinese researchers also published a study on their experimental COVID-19 vaccine in the Lancet on Monday, using a similar technique as the Oxford scientists. They reported that in their study of about 500 people, an immune response was detected in those who were immunized. But they noted that because the participants weren't exposed to the coronavirus afterwards, it wasn't possible to tell if they were protected from the disease.\n",
      "\tCanSino Biologics' vaccine is made similarly to Oxford's except the Chinese shot is made with a human cold virus, and the study showed people whose bodies recognized it didn't get as much of the presumed COVID-19 benefit. Still, China's government already gave special approval for the military to use CanSino's vaccine while it explores final-stage studies.\n",
      "\tIn an accompanying editorial, Naor Bar-Zeev and William Moss of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health called both the Oxford and Chinese results \"encouraging\" but said further judgment should wait until the vaccine is tested on much bigger populations.\n",
      "\tBar-Zeev and Moss also called for any effective COVID-19 vaccine to be distributed equitably around the world.\n",
      "\t\"Global planning is underway, but should be underpinned and informed by specific local realities,\" they wrote. \"Only this way can these very encouraging first earlyphase randomised trial results yield the global remedy for which we all yearn.\"\n",
      "\tLast week, American researchers announced that the first COVID-19 vaccine tested there boosted people's immune systems just as scientists had hoped and the shots will now enter the final phase of testing. That vaccine, developed by the National Institutes of Health and Moderna, produced the molecules key to blocking infection in volunteers who got it, at levels comparable to people who survived a COVID-19 infection.\n",
      "\tNearly two dozen potential vaccines are in various stages of human testing worldwide, with a handful entering necessary late-stage testing to prove effectiveness.\n",
      "\tBritish officials said Monday they had also signed a deal to buy 90 million doses of experimental COVID-19 vaccines being developed by the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer and others.\n",
      "\tIn a statement, the British government said it had secured access to a vaccine candidate being developed by Pfizer and BioNTech, in addition to another experimental vaccine researched by Valneva.\n",

      "\tU.S. President Donald Trump just offered a telling glimpse into his priorities as the coronavirus lengthens its trail of death and sickness.\n",
      "\tNot bothering to hide his indifference and contempt for science, the President made clear on Sunday that it's more important to him to be ultimately proven right about the pandemic than to reconsider his disastrous approach that is doing little to stop its deadly spread.\n",
      "\tUntil then, America must endure crammed ICUs in virus-ravaged states, thousands more deaths and the prospect of cities slumping back into economically crippling lockdowns that crush hopes of a return to work and school with normal life as only a memory.\n",
      "\tTrump's passive leadership becomes more neglectful the worse the crisis gets -- with more than 140,000 Americans now dead.\n",
      "\t\"I'll be right eventually. I will be right eventually. You know I said, 'It's going to disappear.' I'll say it again,\" Trump said in an interview on \"Fox News Sunday.\"\n",
      "\tIgnoring how the coronavirus is raging out of control and that other nations have done far better in suppressing its spread, Trump called Dr. Anthony Fauci's truth telling about the situation \"alarmist.\" The White House is meanwhile pushing back against Senate Republicans' requests for more money for a belated testing and tracing operation deemed critical to finally crushing the virus and helping America emerge from its nightmare.\n",
      "\tTrump's willingness to accept an elevated level of victims while leaving the impression there's nothing to be done but wait until the storm passes shows an extraordinarily disengaged and callous interpretation of the duties of the presidency. It doesn't even seem to make much sense from an objective view of his political self-interest. A Washington Post/ABC News poll published Sunday, for instance, showed that Democratic presumptive nominee Joe Biden had a 20-point lead over Trump in public confidence in handling the pandemic.\n",
      "\tDespite finding every 2020 campaign aspiration blocked -- a return to rallies, a rebound in the polls, an economic bounce back and attention for his assaults on Biden -- Trump is unwilling or unable to admit the depth of the emergency.\n",
      "\tWhile there is a strong desire in the country to return to regular life -- a feeling on which Trump is playing with his demand to reopen all schools -- the President is ignoring public concern over whether such a step is safe. Similarly, his semantic quibbles about the mortality rate from the disease show that he cares about the situation far less than his top priority -- reelection.\n",
      "\tIn fact, as he escalates his campaign of fear and race baiting, he is making clear that he is betting he can win in November while ignoring a disease killing hundreds of Americans every day. To that end, the President is spending more energy on concocting excuses, blaming others and peddling falsehoods about the crisis than he is directing his government to help alleviate the disaster.\n",
      "\tHis approach suggests that he does not believe he needs to triumph over a threat to the American people but merely needs to convince sufficient numbers of them that he's won a great victory. It is a gamble that contradicts multiple polls showing plummeting support for his handling of the situation. And it is putting his fellow Republicans -- still wary of alienating Trump's base -- in a tough spot.\n",
      "\t\"I have confidence in this administration,\" Ohio Republican Gov. Mike DeWine said on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" -- dodging carefully when asked whether he had confidence in Trump. Other Republican governors, watching the virus take hold of their states, have broken with Trump on issues like mask wearing.\n",
      "\tThe President spent the weekend spewing misinformation and lies about the pandemic and cranking up an ever more extreme reelection campaign in a series of telephone town halls, including a warning that he might not accept the verdict of voters in November. He also doubled down on his strategy of fanning fear of other races among White voters: \"They're going to destroy our suburbs,\" Trump said, apparently referring to Democratic bureaucrats likely to uphold rules meant to promote the desegregation of housing and more diverse suburban areas.\n",
      "\tThe latest data shows coronavirus cases rising in 32 states, steady in 14 and decreasing in only four, in the fifth month of a crisis lengthened by sporadic state efforts to fight the virus and a lack of federal leadership.\n",
      "\tNew coronavirus cases have averaged more than 60,000 a day over the last week. Deaths are averaging 700 a day and rising. While physicians are getting better at treating the disease, these figures guarantee many more deaths. Overflowing emergency rooms in states like Texas, Arizona and Florida mean some people may not get the care they need and will die as a result.\n",
      "\tYet Trump's focus was not on the reality of the disaster on Sunday. He told Fox's Chris Wallace that \"if we tested half as much, those numbers would be down.\" In a counter-logical argument, Trump attributed Europe's suppression of the virus following a terrible time early this year to a lack of testing.\n",
      "\tExperts say that the unrestrained spread of virus throughout the United States belies such claims by the President.\n",
      "\tTrump then rebuked Wallace for using Johns Hopkins University data contradicting his claims the U.S. leads the world with regard to COVID-19 mortality rates and went on to attack two of the country's top health officials.\n",
      "\tAsked to respond to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Robert Redfield, who has warned of a grim winter ahead, Trump said: \"I don't know and I don't think he knows.\"\n",
      "\tHe described Fauci, who was proven right when he said premature state openings could cause rising infections, as \"a little bit of an alarmist.\" And the President accused public health experts of believing the theory of which he has been the most prominent exponent -- that hot weather would kill off the virus.\n",
      "\t\"So they got that one wrong,\" he told Wallace.\n",
      "\tThe true death rate from the disease has been very difficult to pin down. But it is likely to end up at 1% or less.\n",
      "\tTrump's supporters use such data to argue that it was unwise to shut down the economy for a disease that is not lethal for almost everyone who catches it. Apart from ignoring the human dimension of the disease, this view discounts the highly infectious nature of the virus, which could in theory infect hundreds of millions of Americans and lead to a staggering death toll if left unchecked. Moreover, the impact on hospital infrastructure -- and on the health workers who care for the sick -- could be horrific were it not for lockdowns and social distancing.\n",
      "\tThere is also increasing evidence of long-term health effects including breathing difficulties and organ damage among people who have suffered from the disease -- even among younger patients, who Trump correctly says are less likely to die of COVID-19.\n",
      "\tThe reality of the pandemic crisis as the week begins confounds Trump's commentary over the weekend.\n",
      "\tThere are currently no ICU beds available in 49 Florida hospitals. The Sunshine state recorded more than 12,000 new cases of the virus on Sunday -- the fourth time it has reached that benchmark. Louisiana Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards said Sunday the virus \"is more rampant\" in the state than it has ever been. Arizona recorded its highest daily death toll -- 147 -- in the pandemic on Saturday.\n",
      "\tThe Democratic Mayor of Los Angeles, Eric Garcetti, said on CNN's \"State of the Union\" that he was on the \"brink\" of declaring a new city-wide lockdown. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Sunday, responding to a question from CNN, that Trump wanted to \"sweep the facts\" of the virus under the rug.\n",
      "\t\"Whenever the President has tried to avoid the problem, like 'this will go away, this won't affect many people,' it's gotten worse,\" the New York Democrat said.\n",
      "\tBut Trump, the President who praised China for its handling of the virus before turning on Beijing and who said it would never be an issue in the United States, is unrepentant.\n",
      "\t\"I've been right probably more than anybody else,\" he told Fox.\n",

      "CONTENT : \n",
      "In just three years since its launch outside of China, TikTok's popularity has skyrocketed.\n",
      "\tThe video-sharing social media platform is the No. 1 app on the Google Play Store and number two on Apple App Store, and has been downloaded more than 165 million times by US consumers. The app is now a source for everything from viral dance routines to pranks on the President, and has propped up the plush lifestyles of teen influencers living in Los Angeles \"collab houses.\" \n",
      "\tBut TikTok's success — and its status as the first Chinese-owned social media platform to garner widespread adoption outside its home market — is looking increasingly tenuous.\n",
      "\tUS officials say they're considering banning the app over security concerns related to TikTok and its parent company, Beijing-based internet company ByteDance, following a similar decision by India. In the meantime, at least one US corporation is already taking action to restrict use of the app on company phones. The situation has TikTok scrambling to try to prove its reliability.\n",
      "\tAt the same time, the company joined other big tech firms in pulling out of Hong Kong after China imposed a controversial national security law. And TikTok's competitors have proven eager to pounce on its challenges and try to win over its audience with similar offerings.\n",
      "\t\"One of the things that troubles me about it is, it's something that is counter to the spirit of the internet,\" said Mark Lemley, a law professor at Stanford who teaches internet law.\n",
      "\t\"I think something significant is lost there if the only apps we get are US apps or apps from approved countries. We lose out as consumers on technology that people like ... but in the long run the US also loses out economically, because we have been the great driver of the Internet.\"\n",
      "\t \n",
      "\tTikTok has already lost access to one of the world's largest digital markets.\n",
      "\tIndia banned TikTok and 58 other Chinese apps last month following a border clash between India and China, citing a \"threat to sovereignty and integrity.\" The app had been downloaded in India more than 660 million times since 2017, and some of its top stars live in the country.\n",
      "\tNow, Trump administration officials are considering a similar measure.\n",
      "\tSecretary of State Mike Pompeo told Fox News' Laura Ingraham earlier this month that the White House is \"looking at\" banning Chinese apps, including TikTok, and said US officials are \"taking this very seriously.\" Pompeo added that people should only download TikTok \"if you want your private information in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party.\"\n",
      "\tOn Wednesday, Pompeo said, \"we hope to have a set of decisions shortly\" with regards to the app.\n",
      "\t\"We're working through a process where all the relevant agencies and the private sector are getting to say their piece,\" Pompeo said in a live interview with The Hill. \"Whether it's TikTok or any of the other Chinese communications platforms, apps, infrastructure, this administration has taken seriously the requirement to protect the American people from having their information end up in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party.\"\n",
      "\tUS politicians have repeatedly criticized TikTok, accusing it of being a threat to national security because its parent company is based in China and could be compelled to share data with the Chinese government. TikTok has called the concerns \"unfounded\" and security experts say it's not clear that the app presents a true national security concern.\n",
      "\tTalk of the potential ban also comes amid larger tensions between the United States and China over technology.\n",
      "\tIt's not just the Trump administration — lawmakers, including Missouri Republican Sen. Josh Hawley, have also introduced legislation that would ban TikTok from US government devices. Both Democratic and Republican national committees have warned their staffs about using the app.\n",
      "\tWells Fargo on Monday banned its employees from using the app on company devices because of security concerns.\n",
      "\t\"Due to concerns about TikTok's privacy and security controls and practices, and because corporate-owned devices should be used for company business only, we have directed those employees to remove the app from their devices,\" a statement from a Wells Fargo spokesperson said.\n",
      "\tThe Wells Fargo decision came after Amazon told employees to delete TikTok from work phones — but Amazon quickly backtracked on the request, saying it had been sent \"in error.\"\n",
      "\t \n",
      "\tFor its part, TikTok says it operates separately from ByteDance.\n",
      "\tTikTok's head of US public policy Michael Beckerman said in a statement to CNN there is a lot of \"misinformation about TikTok right now.\"\n",
      "\tThe company says it stores US user data in Virginia, with backup in Singapore, and \"we work to minimize access across regions,\" Beckerman said. TikTok also hired an American CEO earlier this year, Disney veteran Kevin Mayer, a move widely seen at least in part as an effort to win over US lawmakers.\n",
      "\tBut it appears even those steps may not be enough to alleviate the security concerns that threaten to undermine its growth, so the company is now considering a corporate restructuring aimed further distancing itself from China.\n",
      "\tThe changes could include establishing a headquarters for the video app outside of China or a new management board to distance the service from the country, according to The Wall Street Journal.\n",
      "\tThe company is also quickly expanding its presence in Washington DC. Beckerman said the company is creating so-called \"Transparency Centers\" in the nation's capital and in Los Angeles \"so that lawmakers and invited experts can see for themselves how we moderate content and keep our users' data secure.\"\n",
      "\t\"We remain fully committed to protecting our users' privacy and security as we build a platform that inspires creativity and brings joy for hundreds of millions of people around the world,\" a TikTok spokesperson said in a statement to CNN last week.\n",
      "\tStanford's Lemley said the app's dedicated teen fanbase could also end up proving helpful.\n",
      "\t\"Is there a revolt among the teenagers of the world?\" Lemley said. \"I say that jokingly, but only half jokingly. If a bunch of congressmen go to their teenagers and say they've banned their favorite app, there might be a lot of pushback and that could matter.\"\n",
      "\t \n",
      "\tFacebook's efforts to overtake TikTok with a copycat app have so far been unsuccessful, but new bans could change that.\n",
      "\tDays after India banned TikTok, Facebook-owned Instagram began testing its own app, Reels, in the country. On Friday, Instagram said it's preparing to launch reels in the United States and 50 other countries, just one week after it began testing the platform in India.\n",
      "\tIndian companies are also looking to benefit. One homegrown video-sharing app, Roposo, said that before the TikTok ban was announced, it had recorded 50 million downloads since its 2014 launch. After the announcement, the company said it received another 22 million downloads in just two days.\n",
      "\tAnd while TikTok is still fully functional in the United States, some creators on the app are already trying to transition their audiences to other platforms, including Instagram and YouTube, in anticipation of a ban.\n",
      "\tYouTube plans to launch a competitor to TikTok, called Shorts, by the end of the year, according to The Information.\n",

      "\tIn response, the Chinese ambassador to Britain warned that China will deliver a \"resolute response\" to any move by Britain to sanction officials over the alleged rights abuses.\n",
      "\tTensions between the U.K. and China have heightened over several issues, including China's alleged rights violations against the Uighur minority population and a new, sweeping national security law imposed on Hong Kong. Britain's decision this week to prohibit Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei from involvement in the U.K.'s superfast 5G mobile network has further frayed bilateral relations.\n",
      "\tForeign Secretary Dominic Raab said Sunday that Britain's government has reviewed extradition arrangements with Hong Kong, and that he plans to make a statement in parliament on Monday over the topic.\n",
      "\tEarlier this month Australia suspended its extradition treaty with Hong Kong in response to China's imposition of security legislation on the semi-autonomous territory. Critics see the new law as a further erosion of the rule of law and freedoms promised to the former British colony.\n",
      "\tRaab added that while Britain wants good relations with China, it could not stand by amid reports of forced sterilization and mass education camps targeting the Uighur population in Xinjiang.\n",
      "\t\"It is clear that there are gross, egregious human rights abuses going on. We are working with our international partners on this. It is deeply, deeply troubling,\" he told the BBC.\n",
      "\tLiu Xiaoming, the Chinese ambassador, denied there are concentration camps in Xinjiang during an interview with the BBC and insisted there are \"no so-called restriction of the population.\" He said there are many \"fake accusations\" against China.\n",
      "\tBeijing was ready to respond in kind should Britain impose sanctions on Chinese officials, Liu added.\n",
      "\t\"If the U.K. goes that far to impose sanctions on any individuals in China, China will certainly make a resolute response to it,\" he said. \"You have seen what happened between China (and) the United States ΓÇª I do not want to see this tit-for-tat between China-U.S. happen in China-U.K. relations.\"\n",

      "\tEven with a fresh victory on behalf of international students, U.S. universities fear they're losing a broader fight over the nation's reputation as a place that embraces and fosters the world's best scholars.\n",
      "\tUniversity leaders see it as a steady erosion. They say the Trump administration's repeated attempts to curb immigration have sent students a message that they aren't welcome in the United States. Colleges say foreign students are listening: Since President Donald Trump was elected in 2016, the number of new international students coming to the U.S. has fallen by 10 per cent after years of growth.\n",
      "\tAlready, there's concern that the coronavirus pandemic and a slowdown of visa processing could prevent thousands of students from returning this fall. Foreign students now face even more uncertainty after seeing how quickly policies can change, and on nothing more than a political whim, said Kim Wilcox, chancellor of the University of California, Riverside.\n",
      "\t\"Higher education in the United States is still seen as the gold standard around the globe, but access to it comes with all kinds of risks,\" Wilcox said. \"There's a growing sense that we're just not a welcoming place.\"\n",
      "\tTrump's latest policy would have forced international students in the U.S. to transfer or leave the country if their schools held classes entirely online because of the pandemic. Even those at universities offering a mix of online and in-person classes would have been forbidden from taking all their classes online.\n",
      "\tMore than 200 colleges signed legal briefs supporting a federal lawsuit by Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Seven other suits followed as colleges and states challenged the guidance. Called to court to defend the guidance, federal officials revoked it instead.\n",
      "\tIt was widely seen as part of Trump's recent campaign to pressure the nation's schools and colleges to reopen this fall, even as the coronavirus continues to surge.\n",
      "\tBut even in defeat, the policy fed a narrative that American universities are no longer the welcoming places they once were, said Denis Wirtz, vice provost for research at Johns Hopkins University. It comes as schools in Canada, Australia and other nations push to attract more international scholars. Over time, Wirtz said, those countries may win the world's top talent.\n",
      "\tIt's painful for Wirtz to see. He came to the U.S. from Belgium in 1988 and recalls how warmly he was welcomed. Now, he warns prospective students and researchers that, beyond campus borders, there's growing hostility toward immigrants.\n",
      "\t\"All those great scholars, wherever they are, India, China, Europe, may now elect to go elsewhere or simply to stay home,\" he said. \"We will see its effect four, five years from now. It's not falling off a cliff, but over time you have this creep down the slope toward mediocrity.\"\n",
      "\tThe concern is shared by leaders at other elite research universities. Only hours after the administration retreated from its policy, MIT's president published an op-ed warning that other countries \"are working hard to attract students who have soured on the United States because of growing anti-immigrant hostility or bureaucratic roadblocks.\"\n",
      "\t\"Our competitors openly envy our capacity to welcome and adopt talent from everywhere. I fear lately that we will recognize this strategic U.S. strength only once it is lost,\" L. Rafael Reif wrote.\n",
      "\tThere's also a looming fear that the administration will return with a revised rule, as it did after a 2017 travel ban faced legal challenges. Hoping to ease nerves, dozens of colleges have issued statements pledging to support their international students, and many say they're prepared to return to court if needed.\n",
      "\tDaniel Diermeier, chancellor of Vanderbilt University, said it isn't too late to repair the damage. America's higher education system is still viewed as the best in the world, he said, but that could change .\n",
      "\t\"We're going to have to fix this very quickly. We're going to have to recommit to the policy that has brought so much benefit to the the United States,\" he said. \"Talent will go where it sees the best opportunity for itself.\"\n",
      "\tU.S. colleges already were bracing for sharp decreases in the number of students coming from abroad. It's still to be seen how many will arrive this fall, but it's expected to be far below the nearly 1.1 million who came last year. The decline could devastate budgets at colleges that rely on tuition from foreign students, who typically pay higher rates.\n",
      "\tBut the impact extends far beyond budgets, Diermeier said. International students account for a major share of the nation's research force, he said, especially in science and engineering fields that attract fewer Americans. They make significant contributions to the economy, and without them it would suffer, he said.\n",
      "\tCollege leaders called the latest legal battle a significant victory that showed their power when they unite. But they already see other skirmishes on the horizon. The administration has signalled that it wants to limit a program that lets foreign students work up to one year during college or after graduation, or up to three years for those in science and technology fields. Colleges have also opposed Trump's recent suspension of new H-1B work visas, which many international students use to find work after graduation.\n",
      "\tHelping lead the fight for universities is the Presidents' Alliance on Higher Education and Immigration, a group of college leaders that formed in 2017 to advocate on immigration issues. It helped orchestrate colleges' recent legal campaign, and it says it's ready to stand up for international students again.\n",
      "\t\"This was not a blip,\" said Miriam Feldblum, the organization's executive director. \"We have to continue to monitor this closely, we have to be prepared to act, and we have to be creative when we act.\"\n",
      "\tThe defeat of the latest policy was a relief to Aron Ricardo Perez-Lopez of Hungary, who's studying computer science at MIT. But the episode added to a growing feeling of uncertainty about his place here, and it gives him pause as he starts applying to doctorate programs. Until recently, he was confident he wanted to continue his education in the U.S. Now he isn't so sure.\n",
      "\t\"I'm also exploring options abroad now, because you never know what's going to happen,\" he said. \"I don't want to be worried about this for another five years.\"\n",

      "\tA United Arab Emirates spacecraft rocketed into blue skies from a Japanese launch centre Monday at the start of a seven-month journey to Mars on the Arab world's first interplanetary mission.\n",
      "\tThe liftoff of the Mars orbiter named Amal, or Hope, starts a rush to fly to Earth's neighbour that is scheduled to be followed in the next few days by China and the United States.\n",
      "\tAt the space centre in Dubai, people watching were transfixed by the liftoff, then cheered and clapped, with one woman with offering a celebratory cry common for weddings.\n",
      "\tAmal blasted off from the Tanegashima Space Center aboard a Mitsubishi Heavy Industries' H-IIA rocket on time at 6:58 a.m. (2158 GMT Sunday) after being delayed five days by bad weather.\n",
      "\tMitsubishi later said the probe successfully separated from the rocket and was now on its solo journey to Mars.\n",
      "\tThe probe was sending signals that would be analyzed later but everything appeared good for now, Omran Sharaf, the UAE Mars mission director told journalists in Dubai about an hour and a half after liftoff.\n",
      "\tAmal is set to reach Mars in February 2021, the year the UAE celebrates 50 years since the country's formation. In September that year, Amal will start transmitting Martian atmospheric data, which will be made available to the international scientific community, Sharaf said.\n",
      "\t\"The UAE is now a member of the club and we will learn more and we will engage more and we'll continue developing our space exploration program,\" UAE Space Agency chief Mohammed Al Ahbabi told a joint online news conference from Tanegashima.\n",
      "\tAt Mohammed bin Rashid Space Center in Dubai, Emirati men in their traditional white kandora robes and women in their black abayas watched the liftoff. As its stages separated, a cheer went out from men seated on the floor. They began clapping, one using his face mask, worn due to the coronavirus pandemic, to wipe away a tear.\n",
      "\t\"It was great to see everything going according to schedule today. It looks like things are all on track. It's a huge step in terms of space exploration to have a nation like the UAE taking that giant leap to send a spacecraft to Mars,\" said Fred Watson, Australia's astronomer-at-large. \"Being on route to a planet like Mars is an exceptional achievement.\"\n",
      "\tA newcomer in space development, the UAE has successfully put three Earth observation satellites into orbit. Two were developed by South Korea and launched by Russia, and a third -- its own -- was launched by Japan.\n",
      "\tA successful mission to Mars would be a major step for the oil-dependent economy seeking a future in space, coming less than a year after the launch of the first UAE astronaut, Hazzaa Ali Almansoori. He spent over a week at the International Space Station last fall.\n",
      "\tThe UAE has set a goal to build a human colony on Mars by 2117.\n",
      "\t\"It sends a very strong message to the Arab youth that if the UAE is able to reach Mars in less than 50 years, they could do much more,\" Sharaf told The Associated Press on Sunday as his colleagues prepared for the launch.\n",
      "\tThe Emiratis also acknowledged it represented a step forward for the Arab world, the home of mathematicians and scientists for centuries before the wars and chaos that have gripped wide swathes of it in recent times.\n",
      "\t\"So the region has been going through tough times in the past decades, if not centuries,\" Sharaf said. \"Now we have the case of the UAE, a country that's moving forward with its plans, looking at the future and the future of region also.\"\n",
      "\tFor its first Mars mission, the UAE chose partners instead of doing it all on its own.\n",
      "\t\"Developing a spacecraft is not easy even if there is ample funding,\" said Junya Terazono, an astronomer at Aizu University.\n",
      "\tEmirati scientists worked with researchers at the University of Colorado Boulder, University of California, Berkeley, and Arizona State University. The spacecraft was assembled at Boulder and transported to Japan as the two countries looked to expand their ties with the rich and politically stable Middle Eastern nation.\n",
      "\tThe Amal spacecraft, along with its launch, cost $200 million, according to Sharaf. Operation costs at Mars have yet to be divulged.\n",
      "\tAmal, about the size of a small car, carries three instruments to study the upper atmosphere and monitor climate change while circling the red planet for at least two years. It is set to follow up on NASA's Maven orbiter sent to Mars in 2014 to study how the planet went from a warm, wet world that may have harboured microbial life during its first billion years, to the cold, barren place of today. Hope also plans to send back images of weather changes.\n",
      "\tJapan has long collaborated with the U.S. and other partners in defence and space technology, and the resource-poor country has traditionally kept friendly ties with Middle Eastern countries. Japan's launch services are known for accuracy and an on-time record, but the providers are working to cut costs to be more internationally competitive.\n",
      "\tTwo other Mars missions are planned in coming days. China aims to explore the Martian surface with an orbiter and rover and to search for water and ice with a launch expected around Thursday. The U.S. plans to send a rover named Perseverance to search for signs of ancient life and collect rock and soil samples for return to Earth. Liftoff is targeted for July 30.\n",
      "\tJapan has its own Mars mission planned in 2024. It plans to send spacecraft to the Martian moon Phobos to collect samples to bring back to Earth in 2029.\n",

      "\tRepresentatives of Alberta-based Cargill Protein say they are still \"determining\" how to proceed after China announced a partial ban on beef products from a number of nations around the world, including Canada.\n",
      "\tThe country announced last week it was expanding its order prohibiting meat imports from certain markets under the guise of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n",
      "\tAmong the countries affected are Brazil, Germany, the Netherlands and Canada. Chinese authorities initiated the ban on products from Cargill Protein's High River facility on June 28.\n",
      "\tA spokesperson for Cargill told CTV News in an email they are still working out what the ban would mean for their business.\n",
      "\tIt did say China's ban would not have any effect on the plant's production capacity, which remains at about 95 per cent since it temporarily shut down as a precaution because of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n",
      "\t\"For now, all that’s changed is where we send product originally meant for export to China, which is a small percentage of our output at the facility,\" said Cargill's Daniel Sullivan.\n",
      "\t\"We care about local producers, trade and are working closely with Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) to determine next steps. We recognize it is important for farmers and ranchers to have access to markets and are working to process cattle and honor our commitments to producers. I also want to be clear that we also stand strongly by our commitment to producing high-quality, safe beef out of our High River facility.\"\n",
      "\tThe High River processing facility was shut down in late April after hundreds of cases of COVID-19 were found among workers.\n",
      "\tTwo workers, Bui Thi Hiep and Benito Quesada, died from complications of their illnesses.\n",
      "\tLast week, Cargill said it was back at full capacity, but it would take some time before a backlog of cattle is cleared. The plant processes 4,500 cattle per day or approximately 35 per cent of Canada's total production.\n",
      "\tThe move to ban beef products is the latest questionable policy to come from China. A few weeks ago, its companies asked food suppliers around the world to sign a document attesting to the fact their cargoes meet safety standards and aren't infected with COVID-19.\n",
      "\tExporting nations and regulatory agencies have pushed back, declaring there’s no evidence linking infections to food.\n",

      "\tDespite widespread censorship and tight government control, China has one of the world's largest internet user bases, with more 850 million people having access to the web, including around 200 million online users aged between 15 and 35.\n",
      "\tTreatment camps saw a boom in popularity in the years following China's decision to officially recognize internet addiction as a mental disorder in 2008, but a raft of negative headlines and allegations of serious physical abuse has led to growing concerns in recent years.\n",
      "\tIn 2014, a 19-year-old girl died in the city of Zhengzhou in Henan Province, after she was reportedly beaten by instructors at an internet detox center, according to Chinese state media reports.

Eleven of the victims were less than 18 years old at the time.\n",
      "\tWu was sentenced to almost three years in prison, while Ren and Zhang received two years and seven months and one year and ten month-terms respectively. Qu was sentenced to 11 months.\n",
      "\tThe facility made headlines as far back as 2017, after the local government announced that it would investigate allegations of strict corporal punishment being used on students in an attempt to \"cultivate teenagers' moral character,\" according to reports in state media.\n",
      "\tAccording to state-run tabloid Global Times, former students accused staff at the Yuzhang Academy of putting new students in \"little black rooms\" with nothing but a blanket and a pot for a toilet.\n",
      "\t\"I was being watched all the time,\" one former student, surnamed Xuan, told the Global Times in 2017.\n",
      "\tThe Chinese government has taken a range of measures in recent years to crack down on internet addiction. In November, Beijing announced a curfew for people under the 18 to stop them playing online video late into the night. On weekdays, they can play up to 90 minutes, and up to three hours on weekends.\n",
      "\tMinors in China are banned from playing online video games between 10 p.m. and 8 a.m.\n",
      "\tIn May 2019, the Chinese government introduced an anti-addiction system for children by adding a \"juvenile mode\" to 18 popular video sites, which restricted the users' usage times and content.\n",

      "\tThe encyclopedia, known as the Yongle Dadian, was originally commissioned by the Yongle Emperor, the third ruler of the Ming Dynasty, who reigned from 1402 to 1424.\n",
      "\tMore than 2,000 scholars worked on the encyclopedia between 1404 and 1408, according to a press release from Beaussant Lefèvre, the Paris-based auction house that made the sale.\n",
      "\tThe Yongle Dadian is the largest encyclopedia in the world, and originally consisted of 22,877 chapters.\n",
      "\tIn 1562, the Jiajing Emperor, the 11th Ming ruler, ordered two copies of the encyclopedia to be made, but the original was lost due to the many wars, thefts and fires that occurred under the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644), the auction house said.\n",
      "\tWhile the two volumes sold Tuesday are copies, they are extremely rare, with only 400 known volumes, or 4 per cent of the original encyclopedia, left in existence, according to Beaussant Lefèvre.\n",
      "\tThe books, which measure 20 inches by 12 inches, were written in red and black ink on paper. While printing techniques had been developed at the time, the encyclopedia was written by hand due to its length.\n",
      "\tOne volume is about the lakes of China and the other informs readers about funeral rites. Together, they were bought by an unnamed buyer for €8.128 million including fees. Before the auction, they carried a price estimate of €5,000-€8,000.\n",
      "\tThe British Library has 24 volumes of the encyclopedia, equivalent to 49 chapters.\n",
      "\tThe Yongle Emperor was a strong leader who presided over the most powerful years of the Ming Dynasty.\n",
      "\tIn 1412, he ordered the construction of the famous Porcelain Tower in Nanjing.\n",
      "\tThe tower took 17 years to complete and was known as one of the Seven Wonders of the Medieval World.\n",
      "\tIt was built with glazed, white porcelain bricks and rose more than 250 feet from an octagonal foundation, but the original was thought to have been destroyed during the Taiping Rebellion in the 19th century.\n",
      "\tHowever, a new version of the tower has been constructed following a 1 billion yuan (about US$150 million) donation from Chinese billionaire Wang Jianlin in 2010.\n",

      "\t\"Unfortunately, if the US policies against (extremely qualified) immigration continue, we'll be forced to move jobs (and inspiration) to Toronto,\" Duolingo CEO and co-founder Luis von Ahn said Monday in a tweet.\n",
      "\tDuolingo is currently based in Pittsburgh, with two other offices in the U.S. and one in China. The company, which  is valued at US$1.5 billion, has more than 200 employees and is currently advertising 36 open positions on its website – 23 of them in Pittsburgh.\n",

      "\tPrior to the ban, 85,000 of these visas were issued per year for workers moving to Canada from the U.S. Critics of the visas say they make it easier for companies to outsource jobs that could otherwise be given to American workers, while proponents including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce argue that there are not enough qualified Americans to handle all the positions filled by H-1B workers.\n",
      "\tThere are fears that some Canadians will not be able to continue working in the U.S. due to the ban. According to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, some 4,600 Canadians were issued new or renewed H-1B visas in 2019.\n",
      "\tLeaders in the Canadian tech industry have suggested that the H-1B ban could benefit firms on this side of the border, as companies finding it more difficult to get foreign workers into the U.S. could choose to set up or expand Canadian offices for them instead – just as von Ahn seems to be suggesting Duolingo may do.\n",

      "\tDonald Trump promised an absent Prime Minister Justin Trudeau some in-person presidential face time Wednesday as the U.S. commander-in-chief and his Mexican counterpart went ahead celebrating North America's new trade deal without Canada.\n",
      "\tTrudeau last week declined to join Trump and Mexico's President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador at the White House, citing the challenges of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and this week's pressing parliamentary business -- not to mention the looming threat of renewed U.S. tariffs against Canadian aluminum exports.\n",
      "\tTrump offered no hint of any such tensions before he and Lopez Obrador signed a joint declaration of solidarity during an outdoor Rose Garden ceremony under a sweltering summer sun.\n",
      "\tInstead, \"we'll have a separate day with Canada -- they're coming down at the appropriate time,\" the president said, declaring the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA, the \"largest, fairest and most advanced\" trade deal ever signed, and deriding its NAFTA predecessor as precisely the opposite.\n",
      "\t\"We want to thank Canada also; I spoke with and will be speaking to the prime minister in a little while,\" Trump said. \"We want to congratulate Canada, and the people of Canada, and the prime minister.\"\n",
      "\tEarlier Wednesday, Trudeau extended congratulations of his own, calling the agreement a win for all three countries at a time of serious economic uncertainty.\n",
      "\t\"I think it's really important that at a time of economic strain and stress that we continue to have access to the world's most important market. This is good for Canadian workers and Canadian jobs right across the country.\"\n",
      "\tThe formal debut of the agreement, which took effect last week, has nonetheless been sullied by the U.S. trade representative's claim that Canada has exceeded limits on aluminum exports to the United States established when Trump lifted national-security tariffs on Canadian-made steel and aluminum in May 2019.\n",
      "\tTrump made no mention of the latest dispute in his Rose Garden remarks, and neither leader took questions. Trudeau, however, said the threat of renewed tariffs \"is a little bit difficult to understand,\" given the potential impact of such a move.\n",
      "\t\"The U.S. doesn't make nearly enough aluminum to be able to cover its needs, particularly at a time when we want economies to get going again across North America,\" he said in Ottawa. \"What tariffs would do would be to raise prices for manufacturers in the United States and put extra stresses on them at a time when stresses abound.\"\n",
      "\tHigher prices may be precisely the goal: the two U.S. producers that are urging the USTR to take action have ties to a Swiss metals company that holds the exclusive rights to sell Russian-made aluminum in the United States. China, Russia, India and Canada are the four largest aluminum producers in the world.\n",
      "\tLopez Obrador's visit to Washington, his first foreign trip since being elected in 2018, has prompted widespread criticism at home for a leader whose campaign trafficked heavily in criticizing Trump. Since then, the leader known in Mexico as AMLO has been pilloried for his deference to a U.S. president famous for aggressive anti-immigration policies at the southern border.\n",
      "\tWith a U.S. presidential election now just four months away, it's Trump who stands to benefit politically from a bilateral visit, experts told a Wilson Center panel discussion Wednesday -- and if Lopez Obrador hopes to secure safe harbour from Trump's unpredictable foreign-policy whims, he may be sadly mistaken.\n",
      "\t\"If he thinks that going to Washington in this moment ... is going to insulate him or protect him from future actions by this president, especially in a campaign year -- against tariffs, against some kind of other punitive measure -- I think he's fooling himself,\" said Roberta Jacobson, a former U.S. ambassador to Mexico under both Trump and his predecessor Barack Obama.\n",
      "\t\"Witness the fact that obviously we have the discussion of aluminum tariffs vis-a-vis Canada right now, as we're celebrating USMCA. This is not a president who necessarily says, 'These are my new partners, I will not penalize them no matter what.\"'\n",
      "\tConservative Leader Andrew Scheer made a similar point, but not without twisting the partisan knife a little.\n",
      "\t\"Usually when Justin Trudeau leaves the country, it hurts Canada's position on the world stage, so maybe it's a good thing he stayed home,\" Scheer said. \"He has a perfect losing record when it comes to Donald Trump, so maybe we're better off that he didn't go.\"\n",
      "\tNew Democrat trade critic Daniel Blaikie, meanwhile, is urging the federal Liberal government to spell out during a House of Commons trade committee meeting Thursday how it plans to protect Canada's aluminum sector from the threat of an \"arbitrary attack.\"\n",
      "\t\"A second tariff levelled at an industry that is already hurting could very well be devastating,\" Blaikie wrote in a letter this week to International Trade Minister Mary Ng. \"The current global pandemic only makes matters worse.\"\n",

      "\tPounding rain that already caused deadly floods in southern Japan was moving northeast Wednesday, battering large areas of Japan's main island, swelling more rivers, triggering mudslides and destroying houses and roads. At least 58 people died in several days of flooding.\n",
      "\tParts of Nagano and Gifu, including areas known for scenic mountain trails and hot springs, were flooded by massive downpours.\n",
      "\tPublic broadcaster NHK showed a swollen river gouging into its embankment and destroying a highway. In the city of Gero, the rising river was flowing just below a bridge.\n",
      "\tFlooding and mudslides blocked parts of a main road connecting Kamikochi and Matsumoto, two major tourist destinations in Nagano, stranding hundreds of residents and visitors, though they were believed to have safely evacuated. In neighbouring Gifu, hundreds were isolated in the hot spring towns of Gero and Ontake.\n",
      "\tIn the scenic mountainous town of Takayama, several houses were hit by a mudslide, but their residents were safely rescued.\n",
      "\tAs of Wednesday morning, the death toll from the heavy rains which started over the weekend had risen to 58, most of them from hardest-hit Kumamoto prefecture. Four others died in Fukuoka, another prefecture on Kyushu, Japan's third-largest island.\n",
      "\tAt the peak, as many as 3.6 million people were advised to evacuate, although it wasn't mandatory and the number who sought shelter was not known. About half of the advisories had been lifted by Wednesday afternoon.\n",
      "\tIn places where rain has subsided, residents were busy cleaning up their homes and workplaces.\n",
      "\tIn Gero, a man washed off mud at the entrance of his riverside house despite the evacuation advisory. \"I was told to run away and my neighbours all went, but I stayed,\" he said. \"I didn't want my house to be washed away in my absence.\"\n",
      "\tIn Oita, teachers at a nursery school were wiping the floor and drying wet furniture. \"I hope we can return to normal life as soon as possible,\" Principal Yuko Kitaguchi told NHK.\n",
      "\tAs the rains pounded central Japan, flooding continued to affect the southern region. Search and rescue operations continued in Kumamoto, where 14 people remained missing.\n",
      "\tTens of thousands of army troops, police and other rescue workers mobilized from around the country to assist. Rescue operations have been hampered by the rains, flooding, mudslides and disrupted communications.\n",
      "\tIn Kagoshima, a pickup truck was hit by a mudslide and fell into the ocean, but the driver was airlifted out with a head injury, according to Fuji Television. In another town in Oita, two brothers in their 80s were extracted alive after a mudslide smashed into their hillside house, NHK said.\n",
      "\tChief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga urged residents to use caution. \"Disasters may happen even with little rain where ground has loosened from previous rainfall,\" he said.\n",
      "\tSuga pledged continuing search and rescue efforts, as well as emergency funds for affected areas.\n",
      "\tJapan is at high risk of heavy rain in early summer when wet and warm air from the East China Sea flows into a seasonal rain front above the country. In July 2018, more than 200 people, about half of them in Hiroshima, died from heavy rain and flooding in southwestern Japan.\n",

      "\tThe Trump administration has formally notified the United Nations of its withdrawal from the World Health Organization, although the pullout won't take effect until next year, meaning it could be rescinded under a new administration or if circumstances change. Former Vice-President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, said he would reverse the decision on his first day in office if elected.\n",
      "\tThe withdrawal notification makes good on President Donald Trump's vow in late May to terminate U.S. participation in the WHO, which he has harshly criticized for its response to the coronavirus pandemic and accused of bowing to Chinese influence.\n",
      "\tThe move was immediately assailed by health officials and critics of the administration, including numerous Democrats who said it would cost the U.S. influence in the global arena.\n",
      "\tBiden has said in the past he supports the WHO and pledged Tuesday to rejoin the WHO if he defeats Trump in November. “Americans are safer when America is engaged in strengthening global health. On my first day as president, I will rejoin the WHO and restore our leadership on the world stage,” he said.\n",
      "\tTrump is trailing Biden in multiple polls and has sought to deflect criticism of his administration's handling of the virus by aggressively attacking China and the WHO.\n",
      "\tThe withdrawal notice was sent to U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Monday and will take effect in a year, on July 6, 2021, the State Department and the United Nations said on Tuesday.\n",
      "\tThe State Department said the U.S. would continue to seek reform of the WHO, but referred to Trump's June 15 response when asked if the administration might change its mind. “I'm not reconsidering, unless they get their act together, and I'm not sure they can at this point,” Trump said.\n",
      "\tGuterres, in his capacity as depositary of the 1946 WHO constitution, “is in the process of verifying with the World Health Organization whether all the conditions for such withdrawal are met,” his spokesman, Stephane Dujarric, said.\n",
      "\tUnder the terms of the withdrawal, the U.S. must meet its financial obligations to the WHO before it can be finalized. The U.S., which is the agency's largest donor and provides it with more than $450 million per year, currently owes the WHO some $200 million in current and past dues.\n",
      "\tOn May 29, less than two weeks after warning the WHO that it had 30 days to reform or lose U.S. support, Trump announced his administration was leaving the organization due to what he said was its inadequate response to the initial outbreak of the coronavirus in China's Wuhan province late last year.\n",
      "\tThe president said in a White House announcement that Chinese officials “ignored” their reporting obligations to the WHO and pressured the organization to mislead the public about an outbreak that has now killed more than 130,000 Americans.\n",
      "\t“We have detailed the reforms that it must make and engaged with them directly, but they have refused to act,” Trump said at the time. “Because they have failed to make the requested and greatly needed reforms, we will be today terminating the relationship.”\n",
      "\tThe withdrawal notification was widely denounced as misguided, certain to undermine an important institution that is leading vaccine development efforts and drug trials to address the COVID-19 outbreak.\n",
      "\tThe Republican chairman of Senate health committee, Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, said he disagreed with the decision.\n",
      "\t“Certainly there needs to be a good, hard look at mistakes the World Health Organization might have made in connection with coronavirus, but the time to do that is after the crisis has been dealt with, not in the middle of it,” he said.\n",
      "\t“To call Trump's response to COVID chaotic and incoherent doesn't do it justice,” said New Jersey Sen. Bob Menendez, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. “This won't protect American lives or interests - it leaves Americans sick and America alone.”\n",
      "\tSen. Patty Murray of Washington, the top Democrat on the Senate health committee, called Trump's decision to withdraw an “abdication of America's role as a global leader.”\n",
      "\t“It is the opposite of putting America first - it will put America at risk,” Murray said in a statement. “Refusing to work with our partners across the world to fight this pandemic will only prolong the crisis, further undermine our international standing, and leave us less prepared for future crises.”\n",
      "\tUN Foundation President Elizabeth Cousens called the move “short-sighted, unnecessary, and unequivocally dangerous. WHO is the only body capable of leading and co-ordinating the global response to COVID-19. Terminating the U.S. relationship would undermine the global effort to beat this virus - putting all of us at risk.”\n",
      "\tThe ONE Campaign, which supports international health projects, called it an “astounding action” that jeopardizes global health.\n",
      "\t“Withdrawing from the World Health Organization amidst an unprecedented global pandemic is an astounding action that puts the safety of all Americans and the world at risk. The U.S. should use its influence to strengthen and reform the WHO, not abandon it at a time when the world needs it most,” ONE president Gayle Smith said.\n",

      "CONTENT : VANCOUVER -- \n",
      "\tA significant drop in sea traffic brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic has created what scientists call a rare opportunity to study how quieter waters affect southern resident killer whales off the British Columbia coast.\n",
      "\tOcean Networks Canada, which has been monitoring noise from ships and sounds made by marine mammals such as orcas, said it believes the change will be a boon for the animals.\n",
      "\t“The anticipation is that the quieter environment will help the killer whales in communicating, in socializing, in navigating and most importantly, in finding food,” said Richard Dewey, the organization's associate director of science.\n",
      "\tA paper published last month in the Journal of the Acoustical Society of America said there has been about a 30 per cent decrease in commercial shipping traffic into the Port of Vancouver from China due to COVID-19 in just the first four months of the year.\n",
      "\tDewey said it's not just commercial traffic that's gone down - there's also been a pause in whale watching boats, cruise ships, recreational vessels and tankers. That's led to a noise reduction of about 75 per cent, he said.\n",
      "\t“What we are seeing in the Salish Sea is levels of shipping noise that haven't been present for three or four decades,” he said. “So we would have to go back to the 1980s before we would have heard such a quiet environment.”\n",
      "\tOne of the major concerns for the endangered southern resident killer whales is that shipping noises have been increasing and almost doubling every decade, he said.\n",
      "\tThese mammals have a hearing that is similar to that of humans, and they communicate in a frequency band similar to ours, Dewey said.\n",
      "\tThey use vocalizations to communicate within the pod, to navigate and most importantly to find their prey, he said.\n",
      "\t“They echo-locate to find their salmon. It's a very sophisticated sort of acoustic capability and the quieter the environment, they would have more success in finding prey.”\n",
      "\tIn the ocean, Dewey said whales use sound “continuously and all the time.”\n",
      "\tTheir eyesight helps them see up to a distance of about five to 10 metres while using sounds helps them scope out kilometres, he said, adding that the Salish Sea is a “very murky environment.”\n",
      "\tScientists believe the loud noises caused by humans increase stress hormones in orcas because they have to shout and cannot communicate over large distances, Dewey said.\n",
      "\tHe compared it to someone going into a loud club and having to pause until noise passes, to speak more loudly or give up. He noted that unlike people in a club, orcas can't just leave for a quieter space.\n",
      "\tScientists will be using 30 hydrophones to record sounds made by the killer whales when they come into the Salish Sea, which should be any time now, Dewey said. Hydrophones are underwater recording devices that record how loudly the whales talk when it's noisy or if they just give up.\n",
      "\tThe team is hoping this study will yield much-needed data to make policy and regulation changes to help the animals survive, he said.\n",
      "\t“If we see them returning and staying in their critical habitat for longer periods ... if we have evidence of successful feeding on the salmon, then those are all good signs and in some sense the quieter environments can only have helped their survival,” he said.\n",
      "\tThe director of the University of British Columbia's marine mammal research unit said that in the past, killer whales would be seen in the Salish Sea in May and June, but for the past four years they have been coming in much later, sometimes as late as September.\n",
      "\tAndrew Trites said one of the reasons could be that there is not enough salmon, although mathematically there is enough fish for the 72 remaining southern resident killer whales.\n",
      "\tThis has left scientists wondering whether the trouble is that the whales cannot hunt because of disruption from vessels, he said.\n",
      "\t“And there is an opportunity to see whether or not the behaviour of whales is different with fewer boats on the water and less noise.”\n",

      "CONTENT : TORONTO -- \n",
      "\tA spokesman for the World Health Organization (WHO) says Canada is seeing success in battling back the novel coronavirus, but the faster-rising infection numbers around the world could pose trouble here, too.\n",
      "\t\"The curve is going up, globally, not down, despite the efforts and the successes in many countries,\" the WHO's Christian Lindmeier told CTV News Channel on Sunday.\n",
      "\t\"Central Europe is doing pretty well; Canada is doing pretty well.\"\n",
      "\tLindmeier's comments came shortly after the world surpassed 10 million confirmed cases of COVID-19, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University, and following a week in which the global health agency repeatedly warned that the pandemic is accelerating.\n",
      "\tThis week marks six months since Chinese health authorities first notified the world about a mysterious cases of pneumonia in Wuhan, in what is now considered the first evidence of the existence of the virus.\n",
      "\tIt wasn't until April 2, more than three months later, that the world hit one million cases of COVID-19. The five-million mark was surpassed seven weeks later, and it took only a little over five weeks for the next five million cases to be detected – backing up the WHO's claim that the pandemic situation is worsening on a worldwide basis.\n",
      "\tLindmeier said this acceleration should stop Canadians from thinking the battle has been won just because the curve here is relatively flat at the moment.\n",
      "\t\"It doesn't help if one country is doing great and another is not,\" he said.\n",
      "\t\"No country is in this alone. We have to fight this all together.\"\n",
      "\tThe COVID-19 map looks a lot different today than it did even three months ago, when Canadians were waking up to the realization that business and school closures weren't going to be short-term measures.\n",
      "\tForget about China, Italy and New York. If you want to know where the novel coronavirus is wreaking the most havoc now, focus on Latin America, India and Arizona. And Florida. And Texas. And some other southern states.\n",
      "\tThe U.S. is hitting record highs in its daily new case counts, largely driven by skyrocketing totals in states that had been among the first to reopen schools and businesses. Many aspects of life in these states are once again being closed, including bars in Texas and beaches in the Miami area.\n",
      "\tDr. Matthew Oughton, an infectious disease specialist based at the Jewish General Hospital in Montreal, told CTV News Channel on Sunday that these states had removed their lockdown-like measures \"far too soon, before they were even close to having flattened their curve,\" which directly caused the current high caseloads.\n",
      "\t\"This allowed lots of opportunities for the virus that was still there … to spread exponentially,\" he said.\n",
      "\tDr. Ronald St. John, the first director-general of the Public Health Agency of Canada's Centre for Emergency Preparedness, told CTV News Channel on Sunday that part of the blame for the escalating numbers lies with states being allowed to largely direct their own responses to the virus, without a strong overarching federal plan.\n",
      "\t\"There is no cohesive control across all of the different states,\" he said.\n",
      "\tWhile several southern states appear to be faring worse than the rest of the U.S. in repelling the virus, it is clear that COVID-19 remains a national problem. Only two states are reporting lower numbers of new cases than they were last week: Connecticut and Rhode Island.\n",
      "\tOutside the U.S., the highest numbers of new daily cases are now being reported in India, Russia and Mexico. The Middle East, South Asia and Central and South America are heavily represented in the list.\n",
      "\tSt. John said that Peru is \"having a terrible time\" dealing with the virus and described the situation in Brazil as \"almost chaotic.\" Brazil's president, Jair Bolsonaro, was ordered by a judge this week to wear a face mask in public.\n",
      "\tMany European countries, meanwhile, have successfully flattened their curves and slowly reopened their societies. There has even been talk of reopening Europe to travellers from outside the continent – although at this point, it does not appear Americans will be among those allowed in.\n",
      "\tThe return of global travel poses another problem, as experts believe some asymptomatic COVID-19 patients will surely slip through the screening and unwittingly spread the virus into areas from which it had virtually been eradicated.\n",
      "\t\"No matter how much you screen at the airports or how much you screen on the airplane … there's still this problem of [the] asymptomatic person who can spread the disease,\" St. John said.\n",
      "\t\"We will have to be putting out fires all over the place.\"\n",
      "\tSt. John said managing these outbreaks effectively will involve countries disclosing every time they learn of a new case, even though doing so will discourage other tourists from visiting. He pointed to China's new lockdown affecting nearly 500,000 people outside Beijing, due to new cases linked to a wholesale food market, as a good example of this.\n",
      "\t\"That's the kind of thing that we're going to see, in different places at different periods of time,\" he said.\n",
      "\tOverall, China's curve has remained relatively flat since March, with all of the new outbreaks being isolated in order to prevent them from suddenly ramping up the number of new cases. South Korea, another early COVID-19 hotspot that quickly got a handle on the virus, is now dealing with fears of a second wave amid new daily case counts in the dozens.\n",
      "\tLindmeier said it is still too early to determine when a second wave of the virus might hit or how severe it might be. However, he said that case levels increasing as countries reopen is to be expected, and should not be seen as a reason to return to blanket lockdowns.\n",
      "\t\"It's important for our social lives, it's important for the economy, it's important for our physical and mental health – but it has to be done with caution,\" he said, warning that strong programs of testing, isolating suspected cases and tracing the contacts of those who test positive will be necessary to keep the resurgence from growing out of control.\n",
      "\tCanada's curve has not yet flattened to the extent of China's or even South Korea's, but it is clear that the pandemic is slowly abating.\n",
      "\tThe new daily case counts this week were lower every day than had been recorded here since the big increases began in late March.\n",
      "\tWith more than 100,000 cases of COVID-19 now confirmed in the country, Canada's total is higher than the official numbers from more populated nations such as China, Indonesia and Ukraine. Per capita, we've been hit harder than France, Germany and Greece, among others.\n",
      "\tThe Johns Hopkins data puts Canada among the top 20 countries in the world in total cases and top 15 in total deaths – and that's with the tight border controls that have severely curtailed the number of new arrivals in the country.\n",
      "\tDespite those overall numbers, Oughton said he sees reason for optimism in how Canada has handled the pandemic more recently.\n",
      "\t\"Canada, overall, is doing exceptionally well compared to many other countries,\" he said.\n",
      "\t\"We certainly will still have many challenges in the weeks and months to come – but right now, we are certainly at a lull. Numbers continue to drop. Numbers of patients who are hospitalized in the ICU continue to drop.\"\n",
      "\tCanada also stands out, less positively, for its death rate. According to the Johns Hopkins data, 8.2 per cent of COVID-19 cases in Canada have resulted in death. That's less than several countries in western Europe – France, the United Kingdom and Spain included – but more than most of the rest of the developed world. In the U.S., that number is five per cent. In South Korea, it's 2.2 per cent. In Australia, it's even less.\n",
      "\tThis can largely be explained by the crisis in Canada's long-term care (LTC) homes. One recent study found that 81 per cent of all those who died of COVID-19 in Canada lived in LTC homes, while the average across the 17 developed nations studied was 42 per cent.\n",
      "\tOther outbreaks have been linked to migrant worker camps and other facilities where distancing is a challenge. But as Canada reopens, new dangers are becoming clear, such as the nail salon in Kingston, Ont. that had been linked to 21 confirmed COVID-19 cases as of Sunday.\n",
      "\tSt. John said he hopes Canadians will take the lesson of the nail salon to heart, and understand that businesses reopening does not mean life is back to normal.\n",
      "\t\"I'm dismayed by the pictures that we get from the U.K. … and from Florida, of the people flocking, jamming the beaches, and basically ignoring the social distancing rules,\" he said.\n",
      "\t\"Complacency is my biggest worry – that as we open, people start to say 'I guess we're back to normal and I don't have to worry so much.' We must avoid that complacency.\"\n",

      "CONTENT : VANCOUVER -- \n",
      "\tA significant drop in sea traffic brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic has created what scientists call a rare opportunity to study how quieter waters affect southern resident killer whales off the British Columbia coast.\n",
      "\tOcean Networks Canada, which has been monitoring noise from ships and sounds made by marine mammals such as orcas, said it believes the change will be a boon for the animals.\n",
      "\t“The anticipation is that the quieter environment will help the killer whales in communicating, in socializing, in navigating and most importantly, in finding food,” said Richard Dewey, the organization's associate director of science.\n",
      "\tA paper published last month in the Journal of the Acoustical Society of America said there has been about a 30 per cent decrease in commercial shipping traffic into the Port of Vancouver from China due to COVID-19 in just the first four months of the year.\n",
      "\tDewey said it's not just commercial traffic that's gone down - there's also been a pause in whale watching boats, cruise ships, recreational vessels and tankers. That's led to a noise reduction of about 75 per cent, he said.\n",
      "\t“What we are seeing in the Salish Sea is levels of shipping noise that haven't been present for three or four decades,” he said. “So we would have to go back to the 1980s before we would have heard such a quiet environment.”\n",
      "\tOne of the major concerns for the endangered southern resident killer whales is that shipping noises have been increasing and almost doubling every decade, he said.\n",
      "\tThese mammals have a hearing that is similar to that of humans, and they communicate in a frequency band similar to ours, Dewey said.\n",
      "\tThey use vocalizations to communicate within the pod, to navigate and most importantly to find their prey, he said.\n",
      "\t“They echo-locate to find their salmon. It's a very sophisticated sort of acoustic capability and the quieter the environment, they would have more success in finding prey.”\n",
      "\tIn the ocean, Dewey said whales use sound “continuously and all the time.”\n",
      "\tTheir eyesight helps them see up to a distance of about five to 10 metres while using sounds helps them scope out kilometres, he said, adding that the Salish Sea is a “very murky environment.”\n",
      "\tScientists believe the loud noises caused by humans increase stress hormones in orcas because they have to shout and cannot communicate over large distances, Dewey said.\n",
      "\tHe compared it to someone going into a loud club and having to pause until noise passes, to speak more loudly or give up. He noted that unlike people in a club, orcas can't just leave for a quieter space.\n",
      "\tScientists will be using 30 hydrophones to record sounds made by the killer whales when they come into the Salish Sea, which should be any time now, Dewey said. Hydrophones are underwater recording devices that record how loudly the whales talk when it's noisy or if they just give up.\n",
      "\tThe team is hoping this study will yield much-needed data to make policy and regulation changes to help the animals survive, he said.\n",
      "\t“If we see them returning and staying in their critical habitat for longer periods ... if we have evidence of successful feeding on the salmon, then those are all good signs and in some sense the quieter environments can only have helped their survival,” he said.\n",
      "\tThe director of the University of British Columbia's marine mammal research unit said that in the past, killer whales would be seen in the Salish Sea in May and June, but for the past four years they have been coming in much later, sometimes as late as September.\n",
      "\tAndrew Trites said one of the reasons could be that there is not enough salmon, although mathematically there is enough fish for the 72 remaining southern resident killer whales.\n",
      "\tThis has left scientists wondering whether the trouble is that the whales cannot hunt because of disruption from vessels, he said.\n",
      "\t“And there is an opportunity to see whether or not the behaviour of whales is different with fewer boats on the water and less noise.”\n",

      "\tSouth Korea said Sunday it will begin allowing limited numbers of spectators at sports games as it seeks to return to normal after months of strict social distancing rules to combat the coronavirus.\n",
      "\tThe country endured one of the worst early outbreaks of the disease outside China but appears to have brought it broadly under control with an extensive \"trace, test and treat\" program while never imposing a compulsory lockdown.\n",
      "\tSocial distancing rules were relaxed in early May and some professional sports -- including baseball and soccer -- started new seasons albeit behind closed doors.\n",

      "\tThe world surpassed two sobering coronavirus milestones Sunday -- 500,000 confirmed deaths, 10 million confirmed cases -- and hit another high mark for daily new infections as governments that attempted reopenings continued to backtrack and warn that worse news could be yet to come.\n",
      "\t\"COVID-19 has taken a very swift and very dangerous turn in Texas over just the past few weeks,\" said Gov. Greg Abbott, who allowed businesses to start reopening in early May but on Friday shut down bars and limited restaurant dining amid a spike in cases.\n",
      "\tCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom rolled back reopenings of bars in seven counties, including Los Angeles. He ordered them to close immediately and urged eight other counties to issue local health orders mandating the same.\n",
      "\tMore Florida beaches will be closing again to avoid further spread of the new coronavirus as officials try to tamp down on large gatherings amid a spike in COVID-19 cases. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said interactions among young people are driving the surge.\n",
      "\t\"Caution was thrown to the wind and so we are where we are,\" DeSantis said.\n",
      "\tSouth Africa's health minister warned that the country's current surge of cases is expected to rapidly increase in the coming weeks and push hospitals to the limit. Health Minister Zwelini Mkhize said the current rise in infections has come from people who \"moved back into the workplace.\n",
      "\tNew clusters of cases at a Swiss nightclub and in the central English city of Leicester showed that the virus was still circulating widely in Europe, though not with the rapidly growing infection rate seen in parts of the U.S., Latin America and India.\n",
      "\tPoland and France, meanwhile, attempted a step toward normalcy as the held elections that had been delayed by the virus.\n",
      "\tWearing mandatory masks, social distancing in lines and carrying their own pens to sign voting registers, French voters cast ballots in a second round of municipal elections. Poles also wore masks and used hand sanitizer, and some in virus-hit areas were told to mail in their ballots.\n",
      "\t\"I didn't go and vote the first time around because I am elderly and I got scared,\" said Fanny Barouh as she voted in a Paris school.\n",
      "\tIn Texas, Abbott appeared with Vice-President Mike Pence, who cut campaign events from upcoming visits to Florida and Arizona because of rising virus cases in those states.\n",
      "\tPence praised Abbott for both his decision to reopen the state, and to roll back the reopening plans.\n",
      "\t\"You flattened the curve here in Texas ... but about two weeks ago something changed,\" Pence said.\n",
      "\tPence urged people to wear masks when unable to practice social distancing. He and Abbott wore face masks as they entered and left the room, taking them off while speaking to reporters.\n",
      "\tHealth and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, meanwhile, defended the fact that President Donald Trump has rarely worn a mask in public, saying he doesn't have to follow his own administration's guidance because as a leader of the free world he's tested regularly and is in \"very different circumstances than the rest of us.\"\n",
      "\tAddressing spikes in reported coronavirus cases in some states, Azar said on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" that people \"have to take ownership\" of their own behaviours by social distancing and wearing masks if possible.\n",
      "\tA reported tally Sunday from Johns Hopkins University researchers said the death toll from the coronavirus pandemic had reached 500,108.\n",
      "\tAbout 1 in 4 of those deaths -- more than 125,000 -- have been reported in the U.S. The country with the next highest death toll is Brazil, with more than 57,000, or about 1 in 9.\n",
      "\tThe true death toll from the virus, which first emerged in China late last year, is widely believed to be significantly higher. Experts say that especially early on, many victims died of COVID-19 without being tested for it.\n",
      "\tTo date, more than 10 million confirmed cases have been reported globally. About a quarter of them have been reported in the U.S.\n",
      "\tThe World Health Organization announced another daily record in the number of confirmed coronavirus cases across the world - topping over 189,000 in a single 24-hour period. The tally eclipses the previous record a week earlier at over 183,000 cases, showing case counts continue to progress worldwide.\n",
      "\tOverall the U.S. still has far and away the most total cases. At more than 2,450,000 - roughly twice that of Brazil. The number of actual cases worldwide is much higher.\n",
      "\tNew York, once the nation's pandemic epicenter, is now \"on the exact opposite end,\" Gov. Andrew Cuomo said in an interview with \"Meet the Press.\"\n",
      "\tThe state reported five new virus deaths Saturday, its lowest reported daily death toll since March 15. During the state's peak pandemic in April, nearly 800 people were dying every day. New York still leads the nation in COVID-19 deaths with nearly 25,000.\n",
      "\tIn the state of Washington, Gov. Jay Inslee put a hold on plans to move counties to the fourth phase of his reopening plan as cases continue to increase. But in Hawaii, the city of Honolulu announced that campgrounds will reopen for the first time in three months with limited permits to ensure social distancing.\n",
      "\tBritain's government, meanwhile, is considering whether a local lockdown is needed for the central English city of Leicester amid reports about a spike in COVID-19 among its Asian community. It would be Britain's first local lockdown.\n",
      "\t\"We have seen flare-ups across the country in recent weeks,\" Home Secretary Priti Patel told the BBC on Sunday.\n",
      "\tPolish voters were casting ballots, in person and by mail, for a presidential election that was supposed to have taken place in May but was chaotically postponed amid the pandemic. President Andrzej Duda, a 48-year-old conservative backed by the nationalist ruling Law and Justice party, is running against 10 other candidates as he seeks a second five-year term.\n",
      "\tIwona Goge, 79, was encouraged to see so many people voting in Warsaw.\n",
      "\t\"It's bad. Poland is terribly divided and people are getting discouraged,\" she said.\n",
      "\tFrench voters were choosing mayors and municipal councillors in Paris and 5,000 towns and cities in a second round of municipal elections held under strict hygiene rules. Key battlegrounds include Paris, where the next mayor will preside over the 2024 Summer Olympics.\n",
      "\tItaly was honouring its dead later Sunday with an evening Requiem concert in hard-hit Bergamo province. The ceremony in the onetime epicenter of the European outbreak came a day after Italy registered the lowest daily tally of COVID-19 deaths in nearly four months: eight.\n",
      "\tEuropean leaders were taking no chances in tamping down new clusters. German authorities renewed a lockdown in a western region of about 500,000 people after about 1,300 slaughterhouse workers tested positive.\n",
      "\tAfrica's confirmed cases of COVID-19 continued to climb to a new high of more than 371,000, including 9,484 deaths, according to figures released Sunday by the African Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n",

      "CONTENT : \n",
      "\tPeople on six continents already are getting jabs in the arm as the race for a COVID-19 vaccine enters a defining summer, with even bigger studies poised to prove if any shot really works -- and maybe offer a reality check.\n",
      "\tAlready British and Chinese researchers are chasing the coronavirus beyond their borders, testing potential vaccines in Brazil and the United Arab Emirates because there are too few new infections at home to get clear answers.\n",
      "\tThe U.S. is set to open the largest trials -- 30,000 people to test a government-created shot starting in July, followed about a month later with another 30,000 expected to test a British one.\n",
      "\tThose likely will be divided among Americans and volunteers in other countries such as Brazil or South Africa, Dr. Anthony Fauci of the National Institutes of Health told The Associated Press.\n",
      "\tWhile he's optimistic, \"we've been burned before,\" Fauci cautioned.\n",
      "\tMultiple successes, in multiple parts of the world, are vital.\n",
      "\t\"This isn't a race of who gets there first. This is, get as many approved, safe and effective vaccines as you possibly can,\" Fauci said.\n",
      "\tVaccine experts say it's time to set public expectations. Many scientists don't expect a coronavirus vaccine to be nearly as protective as the measles shot.\n",
      "\tIf the best COVID-19 vaccine is only 50% effective, \"that's still to me a great vaccine,\" said Dr. Drew Weissman of the University of Pennsylvania.\n",
      "\t\"We need to start having this conversation now,\" so people won't be surprised, he added.\n",
      "\tAnd for all the government promises of stockpiling doses in hopes of starting vaccinations by year's end, here's the catch: Even if a shot pans out -- and it's one that your country stockpiled -- only some high-risk people, such as essential workers, go to the front of a very long line.\n",
      "\t\"Will you and I get vaccinated this year? No way,\" said Duke University health economist David Ridley.\n",
      "\tVaccines train the body to rapidly recognize and fend off an invading germ. About 15 experimental COVID-19 vaccines are in various stages of human studies worldwide.\n",
      "\tAnd while there's no guarantee any will pan out, moving three different kinds into final testing offers better odds -- especially since scientists don't yet know just how strong an immune reaction the shots must spark to protect.\n",
      "\tMeasuring that with the first proven vaccine will \"really help us understand for all the other vaccines in development, do they also have a chance?\" said Oxford University lead researcher Sarah Gilbert.\n",
      "\tOnly China is pushing out \"inactivated\" vaccines, made by growing the new coronavirus and killing it. Vaccines by Sinovac Biotech and SinoPharm use that old-fashioned technology, which requires high-security labs to produce but is dependable, the way polio shots and some flu vaccines are made.\n",
      "\tMost other vaccines in the pipeline target not the whole germ but a key piece -- the \"spike\" protein that studs the surface of the coronavirus and helps it invade human cells. Leading candidates use new technologies that make shots faster to produce but haven't yet been proven in people.\n",
      "\tOxford's method: Genetically engineer a chimpanzee cold virus so it won't spread but can carry the gene for that spike protein into just enough cells to trick the immune system that an infection's brewing.\n",
      "\tAnother vaccine made by the NIH and Moderna Inc. simply injects a piece of the coronavirus genetic code that instructs the body to produce harmless spike copies that the immune system learns to recognize.\n",
      "\tResearchers must test thousands of people not where COVID-19 is surging -- because then it's too late -- but where it's smouldering, Fauci said.\n",
      "\tOnly if the virus starts spreading through a community several weeks after volunteers receive either a vaccine or a dummy shot -- time enough for the immune system to rev up -- do scientists have the best chance at comparing which group had more illness.\n",
      "\tLacking a crystal ball, the NIH has vaccine testing networks in the U.S., South America and South Africa on standby while finalizing decisions on the summer tests.\n",
      "\t\"We're going to be doing it in multiple sites with a degree of flexibility\" so researchers can rapidly shift as the virus moves, Fauci said. \"Nothing is going to be easy.\"\n",
      "\tThe Oxford shot, with a 10,000-person study underway in England, already encountered that hurdle. Gilbert told a Parliament committee last week that there's \"little chance, frankly\" of proving the vaccine's effectiveness in Britain after infections plummeted with the lockdown.\n",
      "\tSo her team looked abroad. In addition to the planned U.S.-run study, Brazil last week began a last-stage test of the Oxford shot in 5,000 health workers, the first experimental COVID-19 vaccinations in South America. In another first, South Africa opened a smaller safety study of the Oxford shot.\n",
      "\tWith few new infections in China, Sinovac next month will begin final tests in 9,000 Brazilian volunteers. And SinoPharm just signed an agreement with the United Arab Emirates; that study's size isn't clear.\n",
      "\tAnimal research suggests COVID-19 vaccines could prevent serious disease but may not completely block infection. One study that dripped the coronavirus into monkeys showed vaccinated animals avoided pneumonia but had some virus lurking in their noses and throats. Whether it was enough to spread to the unvaccinated isn't known.\n",
      "\tStill, that would be a big win.\n",
      "\t\"My expectations have always been that we'll get rid of symptomatic disease. From what we've seen of the vaccines so far, that's what they do,\" said Penn's Weissman.\n",
      "\tThe initial vaccines might be replaced with later, better arrivals, as historically happens in medicine, noted Duke's Ridley.\n",
      "\tAnd while shots in the arm are the fastest to make, those for respiratory diseases require virus-fighting antibodies to make their way into the lungs. Gilbert said Oxford eventually will explore nasal delivery.\n",
      "\tSome U.S. lawmakers worry about pressure from the Trump administration to push out an unproven shot during the fall election season.\n",
      "\t\"We want a vaccine, not a headline,\" Sen. Jack Reed, a Democrat from Rhode Island, said at a recent Senate committee hearing.\n",
      "\tDr. Stephen Hahn, commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, pledged to a House committee last week that any decision would be based on science.\n",
      "\tDifferent countries have different rules about when to release a vaccine. For the U.S., Fauci insisted there will be no safety shortcuts, a key reason NIH is investing in such huge studies.\n",
      "\tRegardless of how and when a vaccine arrives, each country also will prioritize who's first in line as doses become available. Presumably they'll start with health workers and those most vulnerable to severe disease -- as long as each shot is proven to work in at-risk groups such as older adults.\n",
      "\tBecause each vaccine works differently, \"which population group it will protect, we don't know yet,\" said Dr. Mariangela Simao of the World Health Organization, which is advising countries on how to choose.\n",

      "\tChina's legislature on Sunday began reviewing a controversial national security bill for Hong Kong that critics worldwide say will severely compromise human rights in the semi-autonomous Chinese territory.\n",
      "\tThe National People's Congress Standing Committee took up the bill at the start of a three-day session, China's official Xinhua News Agency reported. China has said it is determined to enact the law, and its passage is expected by Tuesday.\n",
      "\tThe U.S. says it will respond by ending favourable trading terms granted to the former British colony after it passed to Chinese control in 1997. The Senate on Thursday unanimously approved a bill to impose sanctions on businesses and individuals -- including the police -- that undermine Hong Kong's autonomy or restrict freedoms promised to the city's residents.\n",
      "\tThe Senate bill targets police units that have cracked down on Hong Kong protesters, as well as Chinese Communist Party officials responsible for imposing the national security law. The measure also would impose sanctions on banks that do business with entities found to violate the law.\n",
      "\tLast week, a former United Nations human rights chief and eight former U.N. special envoys urged the body's secretary-general to appoint a special envoy on Hong Kong over what they said is a pending \"humanitarian tragedy.\" Britain has said it would grant passports to as many as 3 million of Hong Kong's 7.8 million people.\n",
      "\tBeijing has denounced all such moves as gross interference in its internal affairs.\n",
      "\tThe law would criminalize secession, subversion of state power, terrorist activities and colluding with foreign forces to endanger national security. Critics say Hong Kong's legal statutes already account for such matters and that Beijing is determined to use the law to pursue political opponents.\n",
      "\tThe central government in Beijing also would set up a national security office in Hong Kong to collect and analyze intelligence and deal with criminal cases related to national security.\n",
      "\tFew details have been released, but it appears that Beijing will have ultimate power over government appointments, further reducing the relative independence it promised to Hong Kong in a 1984 joint declaration with Britain that is considered an international treaty.\n",
      "\tThe measures have been widely seen as the most significant erosion to date of Hong Kong's British-style rule of law and high degree of autonomy that China promised Hong Kong would have under a \"one country, two systems\" principle.\n",
      "\tChina has long demanded such a law for Hong Kong, but efforts were shelved in the face of massive protests in 2003. Beijing appeared to have lost its patience in the face of widespread and often violent anti-government demonstrations in Hong Kong last year, moving to circumvent the city's own legislative council and enact the law at the national level on what critics say are weak legal grounds.\n",
      "\tOn Sunday, opponents of the bill staged a protest in Hong Kong, with police using pepper spray and arresting 53 people \"on suspicion of unlawful assembly,\" according to Hong Kong broadcaster RTHK.\n",
