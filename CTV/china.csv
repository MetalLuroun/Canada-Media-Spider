	Jimmy Lai, the 73-year-old Hong Kong media tycoon and advocate for democracy, was denied bail Saturday after being charged the previous day under the semi-autonomous Chinese territory's new national security law.
	Lai faces a charge of collusion with foreign elements to endanger national security, apparently for tweets he made and interviews or commentaries he did with foreign media.
	The Apple Daily, a feisty pro-democracy tabloid owned by Lai, said he is accused of asking a foreign country, organization or individual to impose sanctions or engage in other hostile activities against Hong Kong or China.
	His case was adjourned to April 16 at the request of prosecutors, who said police needed time to review more than 1,000 tweets and comments made on his Twitter account, the Apple Daily reported.
	The newspaper said his charge sheet listed several foreign politicians who followed Lai on Twitter and cited commentaries he wrote and interviews he did with foreign media.
	Lai, who was already being held on other fraud charges after police raided his media company, could be seen handcuffed to a chain around his waist as guards led him to a van to go from prison to court. He wore a navy blazer and an open-neck shirt.
	Beijing imposed the national security law on Hong Kong earlier this year after stormy protests in 2019 that started over an extradition bill and expanded to include demands for greater democracy in the former British colony.
	The new law outlaws secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces to intervene in Hong Kong's affairs. It has constricted free speech in the city, and democracy activists see it as a way to suppress dissent.
	U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo tweeted Saturday morning Asia time that the security law ""makes a mockery of justice."" He called for Lai's release, saying his only crime is speaking the truth about China's authoritarian Communist Party government.
	Lai, the highest-profile person charged under the security law, has also been arrested for other alleged offences this year. He has been charged with taking part in unauthorized protests and with fraud over alleged violations of office lease terms.
	He has advocated for other countries to take a harsher stance on China, and met with Pompeo and Vice-President Mike Pence in the U.S. last year to discuss the extradition bill, which the Hong Kong government eventually withdrew.
	Pence also tweeted about Lai, saying the charges against him are ""an affront to freedom loving people around everywhere."""

              Relatives make plea for info on Hong Kong detainees in China

	Relatives of a dozen Hong Kong residents who have been detained in mainland China for more than 3 1/2 months made a plea Saturday to be informed of the timing of any trials and whether they can attend.
	The request underscored the sharp contrast between the relatively open legal system in Hong Kong, a semi-autonomous Chinese territory, and that of the mainland, where often little information is divulged until a trial is over.
	""I miss my son so much,"" the mother of Wong Wai-yin, one of the detainees, said, choking up. ""I want to visit him so badly. I haven't seen my son in a very long time -- it's almost four months. Please tell me (about the trial). I'm just an ordinary mother.""
	The 12 were arrested at sea in August while they were apparently making a bid to flee to Taiwan after a tough national security law took effect in Hong Kong earlier this year.
	They were picked up after entering mainland waters for crossing the maritime border without permission. At least some took part in anti-government protests in 2019 and were facing charges in Hong Kong.
	Though Hong Kong is a part of China, travellers must still pass through immigration when going to and from the mainland.
	Two are being held on suspicion of organizing an illegal border crossing. The group has been locked up in Shenzhen, a southern Chinese city that borders Hong Kong.
	The relatives covered their faces with masks, and some wore sunglasses, caps or hoods to hide their identities as they spoke at a news conference. They did not give their names.
	Owen Chow, an activist who has been helping the families, said they wanted to know whether the trials would be open to the public and if family members could attend.
	He and some family members questioned the authenticity of letters some of the latter had received, purportedly from their detained relatives, saying they were being held in a good environment and not abused.
	""The only thing I can do is to have dissatisfaction and be angry,"" said a relative of Tang Kai-yin, another detainee. ""I don't know what else to do."""

              As leaders set fresh climate goals, Biden pledges U.S. support

	U.S. President-elect Joe Biden pledged Saturday to rejoin the Paris climate accord on the first day of his presidency, as world leaders staged a virtual gathering to celebrate the fifth anniversary of the international pact aimed at curbing global warming.
	Heads of state and government from over 70 countries took part in the event -- hosted by Britain, France, Italy, Chile and the United Nations -- to announce greater efforts in cutting the greenhouse gas emissions that fuel global warming.
	The outgoing administration of U.S. President Donald Trump, who pulled Washington out of the Paris accord, wasn't represented at the online gathering. But in a written statement sent shortly before it began, Biden made clear the U.S. was waiting on the sidelines to join again and noted that Washington was key to negotiating the 2015 agreement, which has since been ratified by almost all countries around the world.Â 
	""The United States will rejoin the Paris Agreement on day one of my presidency,"" he said. ""I'll immediately start working with my counterparts around the world to do all that we possibly can, including by convening the leaders of major economies for a climate summit within my first 100 days in office.""
	Biden reiterated his campaign pledge that his administration will set a target of cutting U.S. emissions to net zero ""no later than 2050.""
	Experts say commitments put forward by the international community in the past five years have already improved the long-term outlook on climate change, making the worst-case scenarios less likely by the end of the century. But wildfires in the Amazon, Australia and America, floods in Bangladesh and East Africa, and record temperatures in the Arctic have highlighted the impact an increase of 1.2 degrees Celsius (2.2 Fahrenheit) since pre-industrial times is already having on the planet.
	""If we don't change course, we may be headed for a catastrophic temperature rise of more than 3 degrees (Celsius) this century,"" UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said, urging world leaders to declare a ""climate emergency.""
	The Paris agreement aims to cap global warming at well under 2 C (3.6 F), ideally no more than 1.5 C (2.7 F), by the end of the century. Meeting the temperature target will require a phasing-out of fossil fuels and better protection for the world's carbon-soaking forests, wetlands and oceans.
	The UN chief called the announced U.S. return to the Paris accord ""a very important signal.""
	""We look forward for a very active U.S. leadership in climate action from now on,"" Guterres said. ""The United States is the largest economy in the world, it's absolutely essential for our goals to be reached.""
	Biden insisted that the dramatic economic shifts needed would be positive for American workers.
	""We have before us an enormous economic opportunity to create jobs and prosperity at home and export clean American-made products around the world, harnessing our climate ambition in a way that is good for American workers and the U.S. economy,"" he said.
	American representatives at the virtual meeting included Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, Gov. Charlie Baker of Massachusetts and U.S. business leaders, such as Apple chief executive Tim Cook.
	Also absent from the event were major economies such as Australia, Brazil, Indonesia, Mexico, Russia and Saudi Arabia. Most have offered no significant improvements on their existing emissions targets lately.
	Environmental campaigners singled out Brazil's recent announcement that it will stick to its target of cutting emissions by 43 per cent over the next decade compared with 2005 levels and aim for net zero by 2060 -- later than most other countries.
	By contrast, an agreement Friday by European Union members to beef up the continent's 2030 targets from 40 per cent to at least 55 per cent compared with 1990 levels was broadly welcomed, though activists said it could have aimed even higher.
	China, the world's biggest emitter, also surprised the world in September by announcing a net zero target of 2060, with emissions peaking by 2030. In his speech Saturday, Chinese President Xi Jinping provided further details on his country's medium-term goal for improving energy efficiency and ramping up electricity generated from renewable sources of power such as wind and solar.
	But Xi also cautioned that ""unilateralism will lead us nowhere"" -- a veiled reference to discussions in the EU to impose tariffs on goods imported from countries that have less stringent emissions standards than the 27-nation bloc. The issue is likely to dominate discussion between China, the EU and the U.S. in coming years.
	The Maldives, an Indian Ocean nation made up of low-lying islands that are particularly vulnerable to sea level rise, announced Saturday that it will now aim to achieve net zero by 2030, one of the most ambitious goals worldwide. Bhutan and Suriname claim to have already achieved that goal.
	The 189 countries that are party to the Paris agreement are required to submit their updated targets to the United Nations by the end of the year. This would normally have occurred at the annual UN climate summit, but the event was postponed for a year because of the pandemic.
	The gathering, now scheduled to take place in Glasgow, Scotland, in November 2021, will see haggling over financial support for poor countries to cope with climate change, and fine-tuning the rules for international markets in emissions trading. Britain, next year's host, announced this month that it's aiming to cut emissions by 68 per cent over the next decade and end state support for fossil fuel industry exports.
	Former UN climate chief Christiana Figueres, who was a key player at the Paris negotiations, said leaders had a duty to be optimistic about their ability to curb global warming.
	""Because if we don't, the alternative is unthinkable,"" she said. ""None of us adults alive today want to have on our shoulders the responsibility of turning over a world that is a world of misery for generations to come.""

              U.S. allows emergency COVID-19 vaccine in bid to end pandemic

	The U.S. gave the final go-ahead Friday to the nation's first COVID-19 vaccine, marking what could be the beginning of the end of an outbreak that has killed nearly 300,000 Americans, according to a person familiar with the decision but not authorized to discuss it publicly.
	Shots for health workers and nursing home residents are expected to begin in the coming days after the Food and Drug Administration authorized an emergency rollout of what promises to be a strongly protective vaccine from Pfizer Inc. and its German partner BioNTech.
	Initial doses are scarce and rationed as the U.S. joins Britain and several other countries in scrambling to vaccinate as many people as possible ahead of a long, grim winter. It will take months of work to tamp down the coronavirus that has surged to catastrophic levels in recent weeks and already claimed 1.5 million lives globally.
	While the FDA decision came only after public review of data from a huge ongoing study, it has also been dogged by intense political pressure from the Trump administration, which has accused the agency of being too slow and even threatened to remove FDA chief Stephen Hahn if a ruling did not come Friday.
	The move sets off what will be the largest vaccination campaign in U.S. history -- but it also has global ramifications because it's a role model to many other countries facing the same decision.
	The world desperately needs multiple vaccines for enough to go around, and the Pfizer-BioNTech shot is the first based on rigorous scientific testing to emerge from that worldwide race -- a record-setting scientific achievement that shaved years off the usual process.
	""I don't think you would have found a scientist on this planet that would have predicted this 11 months ago,"" said Dr. Paul Offit, a vaccine expert at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia who advises the FDA.
	The U.S. is considering a second vaccine, made by Moderna Inc., that could roll out in another week. In early January, Johnson & Johnson expects to learn if its vaccine is working in final testing.
	Europe is set to make its own decision on the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna shots later this month, an important step as some other candidates that multiple countries were anxiously awaiting have hit roadblocks. Friday, Sanofi and GSK announced a months-long delay after early tests showed their vaccine didn't work well enough in older adults.
	And China and Russia didn't wait for final-stage tests before beginning vaccinations with some homegrown shots.
	About 3 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine are expected in the first shipments around the country, according to officials with Operation Warp Speed, the Trump administration's vaccine development program. A similar amount is to be held in reserve for those recipients' second dose.
	A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advisory committee is poised to recommend who's first in line. Expected to follow health workers and nursing homes are other essential workers, older adults and people at high risk because of other health problems. U.S. authorities don't expect enough for the general population before spring, and that's assuming there are no manufacturing glitches.
	In a still unfinished study of nearly 44,000 people, the FDA found the vaccine was safe and more than 90% effective across recipients of different ages, including older adults, races and those with health problems that put them at high risk from the coronavirus.
	Emergency use means the vaccine still is experimental. Most important for would-be recipients to know:
	--Some protection begins after the first dose, but it takes a second dose three weeks later for full protection. It's unclear how long protection lasts.
	--The vaccine protects against COVID-19 illness, but no one yet knows if it can stop the silent, symptomless spread that accounts for roughly half of all cases. The ongoing study will attempt to answer that but for now, the vaccinated still will need to wear a mask and keep their distance.
	--Expect a sore arm and some flu-like symptoms such as fever, fatigue, headache and chills after the second dose. While uncomfortable, those reactions only last about a day. ""That's just your immune system working. It's a good thing,"" Offit said.
	--Authorities are investigating several allergic reactions reported in Britain by people with a history of severe allergies. Offit said it is routine in the U.S. for the vaccinated to stick around for a half-hour so they could get prompt treatment if such reactions appear.
	If emergency use of Moderna's vaccine also is authorized, the U.S. expects to vaccinate 20 million people by the end of December. They hope to have enough for another 30 million people in January and 50 million in February.
	Getting shots into arms is the big challenge, especially as a new poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found only half of Americans want the vaccine when it's their turn. About a quarter say they won't get it and the rest aren't sure.
	Political interference has complicated health authorities' message that the testing was rigorous and cut no corners.
	President Donald Trump bashed the FDA, again, Friday for taking too long, complaining that the agency ""is still a big, old slow turtle."" One of his deputies even pressed Hahn to clear the shots by the end of the day or face possible firing, two administration officials said.
	The FDA is unique in analyzing drugmakers' raw data, a process that takes longer than many other countries' regulatory reviews. In addition, the FDA insisted that large COVID-19 vaccine studies track at least half the participants for two months to look for side effects, a time period when historically any vaccine problems appear.

	Canada is no longer training with the Chinese military, the Minister of National Defence Harjit Sajjan told the House of Commons on Thursday, after Conservative defence critic James Bezan questioned why Prime Minister Justin Trudeau would maintain such relations with China.
	The issue came to a head following a report by the Globe and Mail that top officials at Global Affairs, concerned the Chinese government would view it as a retaliatory move over its detention of Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, was âalarmedâ that General Jonathan Vance cancelled winter military exercises with the Peopleâs Liberation Army in 2019 at CFB Petawawa.
	The news comes as Kovrig and Spavor marked their second anniversary in Chinese prison on what Canada and its Western allies say are unfounded espionage charges that followed Canadaâs arrest of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou on a U.S. extradition warrant in December 2018.
	âOur government always stands up for Canadians at home and abroad and this includes our relationship with China. But let me be very clear, we do not train with Chinese military,â said Minister Sajjan, adding that this initiative was originally put in place by the Conservative government under Stephen Harper.
	âIt was the previous government that actually signed a co-operation plan initiative in 2013 under Rob Nicholson, when he was the Minister of National Defence â¦ because of the agreement they had signed, this is one of the reasons why we actually changed our approach because of the concerns the member outlined,â Sajjan said.
	Bezan, who served as Parliamentary Secretary of National Defence under Nicholson at the time, said Canada was engaging in âhostage diplomacyâ and that the Chinese government back then âis completely different to the Chinese government today.â
	Conservative leader Erin OâToole called the joint training exercise a âdangerous path for the Trudeau government to take"" and called Canada's dealings with China a ""dangerously naive approach [that] has put Canada and our citizens at risk.â
	The Canadian Armed Forces have participated in various joint and regional military exercises for decades with some two dozen Pacific Rim countries. Specifically, Canada advanced its bilateral defence relationship with China through talks between senior military officials on both sides in March 2012 and June 2013. The Cooperation Plan Initiative, which would guide defence-related activities, was signed in Ottawa in August 2013.
	Chinaâs President Xi Jinping, who came into power in March 2013, has tightened his control over the country in recent years through mass detention and surveillance of its Muslim population in Xinjiang, a crackdown on activism, heavy Internet censorship, consolidation of power and removal of presidential term limits. He has also taken a more assertive and harder-line approach to foreign affairs and defending Chinaâs interests.
	Mengâs arrest, and the subsequent arrest of Kovrig and Spavor shortly after, soured relations between Canada and China. Trudeau has spoken to U.S. president-elect Joe Biden about the situation, but has not said whether Biden might revisit the Justice Departmentâs efforts to extradite Meng. Should the U.S. withdraw its charges against Meng, it could give China a reason to release Kovrig and Spavor.
	âWe will always stand up for Canadians who are arbitrarily detained. This is one of the reasons why we actually stopped our training with the Chinese,â Sajjan said.

              Olympics on tight timeline to chart new path on protest
          
","
              For generations, the IOC knew exactly where to look for key support of its ban against protests at the Olympics. This week, the American federation put the IOC on notice: It is no longer the IOC's partner when it comes to enforcing the contentious Rule 50.

                  Friday, Dec. 11, 2020
                ",https://www.ctvnews.ca/sports/olympics-on-tight-timeline-to-chart-new-path-on-protest-1.5227276,"
	For generations, the IOC knew exactly where to look for key support of its ban against protests at the Olympics.
	In 1968, it was the U.S. Olympic Committee that sent home its own athletes, Tommie Smith and John Carlos, when they raised their fists while on the medals stand at the Mexico City Games.
	In 2019, it was the same organization that placed its own athlete, Gwen Berry, on probation for doing the same after her win at the Pan-Am Games.
	This week, the American federation put the IOC on notice: It is no longer the IOC's partner when it comes to enforcing the contentious Rule 50. The USOPC is now heeding the calls from many of its own athletes and will no longer punish them for kneeling or raising fists or any other kind of acceptable demonstration at the Olympics.
	âWhen you sit in my seat, you have to make decisions that you think are on the right side of history,â said CEO Sarah Hirshland. âAnd I believe we're on the right side of history.â
	But there are details to iron out, and they strike to the heart of how much change is truly possible between now and next July, when the Tokyo Olympics are scheduled to take place.
	High on the list: What can athletes demonstrate about, and what will an acceptable demonstration look like?
	âThat becomes a difficult situation,â said Harry Edwards, the activist who helped brainstorm the gestures by Smith and Carlos 52 years ago. âBecause you could very easily get into a thing of trying to outdo someone else and it ends up having nothing to do with the spirit of the issue.â
	That confusion helps explain the calculated response to the USOPC that came from the IOC in the form of a short release from the head of its athlete commission, swimmer Kirsty Coventry of Zimbabwe.
	Well aware that the protest rule can't stay as-is for the foreseeable future, Coventry and the IOC are in the process of surveying athletes across the globe for their thoughts about possible changes. She said the majority of the respondents believe in the right of free speech, which is ârespectedâ at the Olympic Games (but only in certain settings) and âexpress support for preserving the ceremonies, the podium and the field of play.â
	Though Coventry's committee is still accepting feedback, and won't make any final decisions until early next year, she's previewing a far less radical adjustment to Rule 50 than the U.S. contingent would like.
	American athletes have been reeling from a summer of unrest over police violence against Black people in the United States. Every major sports league has agreed to change policies to give their players a bigger platform to discuss race and social injustice.
	But U.S. sports leagues and the Olympics are very different creatures. The Olympics are a behemoth that counts America as only one of 206 countries who are members.
	Some of the biggest members are among the IOC's most important partners - China, for instance, hosted the 2008 Olympics and will do so again in 2022 - and they don't share the same concerns or values about free speech or racial injustice as do the United States and many of its closest allies.
	âMany have also recognized the practical question of how to choose between the opinions of hundreds of issues from different angles across the world,â Coventry said of her survey respondents. âWe can see that it would be very difficult to make such a judgment without dividing the athlete community across all 206 NOCs.â
	Moushaumi Robinson, who led the U.S. athletes group that pressed for the changes, said she understands the complexities. Her group continues to discuss them to try to come up with solutions.
	âA lot of us just want to be able to say `I may not agree with you but I respect that you have a voice,â' she said. âAnd we want to be able to express it without someone punishing you for it.â
	All of which leads Edwards to believe that Thursday's move by the USOPC and its athletes is a sign of progress - not necessarily a huge leap but another step.
	âThis is an ongoing struggle, and it's going to continue to be a struggle,â he said. âAnd what today reflects is that this generation of athletes is more than willing to do their part.â"

              Diverse TV holiday season includes all-Asian Lifetime movie

              In one scene from the Lifetime TV movie, âA Sugar & Spice Holiday,â a co-worker says to Suzy, an Asian American architect in Los Angeles: âI didn't know if Christmas was a big deal where you're from.â

	In one scene from the Lifetime TV movie, âA Sugar & Spice Holiday,â a co-worker says to Suzy, an Asian American architect in Los Angeles: âI didn't know if Christmas was a big deal where you're from.â
	Retorts Suzy: âI'm from Maine.â
	A lot of viewers of a cozy Christmas film might just shrug off the insinuation that Suzy is somehow not American. But for an Asian audience, that brief exchange is a knowing reminder that microaggressions don't take a holiday. They especially haven't in the wake of the pandemic, which has triggered anti-Asian racism and terms like âChinese virusâ and âkung flu.â
	âI think it's great timing for us for this movie to be coming out now during the pandemic with the perception of the Asian culture and the `flu' and all,â Canadian actor Jacky Lai, who plays Suzy, told The Associated Press. âI really do hope that this (movie) - with our faces - is able to hopefully be welcomed by people into their homes and see us as just your American/Canadian friends.â
	âA Sugar & Spice Holiday,â premiering Sunday, may be the first feel-good TV Christmas flick to feature a mostly Asian ensemble. It's one of several projects where cable channels are demonstrating a desire for inclusion this yuletide season. The shift comes a year after the Hallmark Channel dropped an ad that included a same-sex couple. The fallout pointed to an overall diversity problem in the genre with not just the LGBTQ community, but communities of colour. Recent months of racial unrest only added to the conversation within the entertainment industry about representation.
	Tia Maggini, vice-president of Lifetime Original Movies, says it was a coincidence that screenwriter Eirene Donohue, who is Asian American and had worked with the them before, came to them with the story pitch.
	âIt was exciting to be presented with this particular point of view that has been long overdue for the Christmas movie genre,â Maggini said in a statement. Most important: The movie itself was actually funny and âfull of Christmas heart.â
	Indeed, the rom-com has all the warm, familiar holiday movie tropes. Suzy returns to the small town where she grew up for Christmas, is persuaded to revive her baking skills for a local gingerbread house competition and is assisted by her former high school crush (Tony Giroux).
	Her father is played by veteran actor Tzi Ma. Despite a year filled with high profile film roles in âThe Farewellâ and âMulan,â Ma didn't hesitate to join a Lifetime movie.
	âIt was the first time a Chinese American family was featured on a Christmas story,â Ma said in an email. âLifetime has a tremendous Asian American following. It's a way to say thank you to them.â
	In Hollywood, it can often feel like studios only cast Asians in narratives where there's some kind of hardship or East-meets-West struggle. And with TV holiday movies, they're almost nonexistent. Meanwhile, there are white actors who have made a baker's dozen of them. Like any other group, Giroux says, Asians deserve to see themselves in lighthearted fare regularly.
	âI think it's so important to have all sorts of stories with any culture - for them to have exposure to the stories of struggle but it's such a delight to see something lighter, to see aspects of culture that aren't surrounded with times of difficulty,â Giroux says.
	Giroux, who is Canadian, is also looking forward to queuing up a movie where his grandparents can see themselves.
	âI'm really excited for them to see a story that covers part of their story. My grandparents immigrated here from China from in the `50s,â Giroux says. âThat's why being part of this project is telling a story that I'm really a part of.â
	Lai grew up loving romantic comedies. She remembers unexpectedly getting emotional watching âCrazy Rich Asians,â the first major Hollywood studio film with an all-Asian cast in 25 years.
	âYou hear people say there hasn't been a movie like this in 25 years. You hear those things. But it's not until I sat in the theatre and watched someone who looked like me on screen who wasn't a ninja or a nerd but someone just like me. I remember the way it felt,â Lai says. âI am so excited that there's another movie like that and hopefully we bring joy and open some minds with this movie and more opportunities.â
	The movie is lovingly sprinkled with Chinese American nuances on script and screen. These include a photo of Suzy's deceased grandma flanked by incense sticks and the entire family eating with chopsticks. And it is definitely the only Christmas movie to feature both gingerbread and stinky tofu, a beloved Chinese dish known for its pungent smell.
	âI love that we were able to kind of include a lot of nice details. ... It's really a romantic comedy where the characters happen to be Asian American,â says Jennifer Liao, the director. âIt's nice to make an Asian American movie that's not necessarily completely frontloaded with having to carry the weight of cultural identity issues and things like that.â
	âSugar & Spiceâ is not the only holiday movie expanding the definition of who can lead these kinds of flicks. A handful of networks, including Lifetime and Hallmark, have a Christmas-themed movie on their slate featuring a same-sex pairing. Tony winner Ali Stroker, who uses a wheelchair, stars in Lifetime's âChristmas Ever After.â
	Does Liao feel pressure as âthe firstâ even on such an innocuous project to bring in a sizeable audience? âI feel like the pressure is more to deliver something that I and everybody else worked on can be proud of. That was really no. 1,â Liao says.
	Lai doesn't see the point of getting caught up in things like ratings.
	âI think that it is really, really nice to hear when someone says `I got to see someone who looks like me on screen.' That will never get old,â Lai says. âWe get more responses like that - for me, the movie did its purpose.â

	India on Friday rejected a Chinese allegation that it is responsible for high tensions along their disputed border.
	Indian External Affairs Ministry spokesman Anurag Srivastava said the six-month standoff between the two countries' armies ""has been a result of the actions of the Chinese side, which has sought to effect a unilateral change in the status along the Line of Actual Control in Eastern Ladakh.""
	Srivastava was responding to a statement by Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying in Beijing on Thursday that ""the rights and wrongs of what has happened in the China-India border area are very clear and the responsibility lies squarely with the Indian side.""
	Hua also said that China is firmly committed to safeguarding its sovereignty. ""We hope that India will work with China in the same direction and do more things conducive to solidarity, co-operation and common development,"" she said.
	The standoff between the Asian giants erupted into a fierce brawl in May and worsened into hand-to-hand combat on June 15 with soldiers using clubs, stones and fists, leaving 20 Indian troops dead. China is believed to also have suffered casualties, but has not given any details.
	The countries have held a series of talks on ending the standoff without any breakthrough."

              Chinese authorities detain Bloomberg news assistant

              U.S. financial news service Bloomberg said Friday that Chinese authorities have detained one of its Beijing-based news assistants on what they said was suspicion of endangering national security.

	U.S. financial news service Bloomberg said Friday that Chinese authorities have detained one of its Beijing-based news assistants on what they said was suspicion of endangering national security.
	Bloomberg reported that Chinese citizen Haze Fan was seen being taken from her apartment building accompanied by security officers in plain clothes at about noon on Monday, shortly after her last contact with her editors.
	It quoted a Chinese government statement as saying Fan was detained by the Beijing branch of the National Security Bureau ""according to relevant Chinese law on suspicion of engaging in criminal activities that jeopardize national security.""
	China permits Chinese citizens to work only as translators, researchers and assistants for foreign news organizations, not as registered journalists able to report independently. China's own media are almost entirely state owned and tightly controlled, and the country has long been one of the leading jailers of journalists.
	Bloomberg said it has been seeking information about Fan's whereabouts from the Chinese government and from China's embassy in Washington, D.C.
	It said its parent company, Bloomberg LP, was informed Thursday that she was being held on suspicion of endangering national security, a vaguely defined charge that can lead to lengthy detention with little recourse to legal assistance.
	""We are very concerned for her, and have been actively speaking to Chinese authorities to better understand the situation. We are continuing to do everything we can to support her while we seek more information,"" a Bloomberg spokesperson was quoted as saying in the report.
	Fan began working for Bloomberg in 2017 after stints with a number of other foreign news organizations in China, the company said.
	China has detained news assistants in the past over reports that angered the ruling Communist Party, and authorities have also sought to punish foreign media more generally by limiting their operations, expelling journalists or issuing them only short-term visas.
	China this year expelled journalists from The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal and other American outlets amid complaints over content and moves by the U.S. to send home dozens of Chinese journalists working for state media.
	Bloomberg saw its business in financial information suffer in China several years ago in apparent retaliation for its reporting on the personal financial dealings of leading Chinese officials."

	Pakistan's foreign minister on Friday called for the United Nations and the European Union to investigate a recent report's findings that exposed a 15-year disinformation campaign to serve India's interests and discredit Pakistan.
	The extensive report was published earlier this week by EU DisinfoLab, a Brussels-based nongovernmental organization. The findings detail how 10 defunct but U.N.-accredited NGOs were ""revived"" in order to influence the EU and the U.N. Human Rights Council. It also uncovered over 750 fake local media outlets used to spread disinformation.
	At a news conference, Shah Mahmood Qureshi urged the U.N. and the EU to ""immediately begin an investigation and delisting of the 10 fake NGOs created by India to malign Pakistan.""
	""We also call on the United Nations to create processes that ensure that the international system is not manipulated through such influence operations,"" he said.
	The EU DisinfoLab report, entitled ""Indian Chronicles,"" did not explicitly attribute the campaign to the Indian government or its intelligence agencies.
	The report said the operation was led by the Srivastava Group, a business conglomerate that came into the spotlight in India after organizing a visit to the disputed Kashmir region for far-right members of the European Parliament in late 2019.
	Qureshi, however, directly accused New Delhi of running the campaign.
	""The scope and extent of India's operations against Pakistan under their hybrid war is now apparent for the world to see. Pakistan will take all necessary actions to protect its interests,"" he said.
	There was no immediate comment from India.
	The two nuclear armed rivals have a history of bitter relations, and have fought three wars since gaining independence from Britain in 1947.
	The EU DisinfoLab report comes less than a month after Pakistan accused India of sponsoring ""terrorism"" aimed at destabilizing the country and targeting its economic partnership with China.
	India has likewise accused Pakistan of sponsoring militant groups that have carried out attacks inside its borders in recent years.

	China's sales of SUVs, minivans and sedans rose by double digits in November as the country recovered from the coronavirus pandemic, but were below pre-virus levels for the year, an industry group reported Friday.
	Sales in the industry's biggest global market rose 11.6% over a year earlier to 2.3 million, according to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers. Total vehicle sales, including trucks and buses, rose 12.6% to 2.8 million, holding steady at October's growth rate.
	From January to November, passenger vehicle sales were off 7.6% from the same period of 2019, at 17.8 million. Sales of commercial vehicles rose 20.6% to 4.7 million.
	Full-year auto sales are on track to decline for a third year after hitting a peak in 2017.
	China, where the pandemic began in December, became the first country to reopen its economy after the disease was declared under control in March.
	November sales of all-electric and gasoline-electric hybrid vehicles more than doubled, rising 104.9% over a year earlier. Sales in the first 11 months of 2020 edged back above pre-virus levels, rising 3.9% over a year earlier.
	Auto demand already was weak before China closed factories and dealerships in February to fight the coronavirus. Consumers are uneasy about slowing economic growth and a tariff war with Washington.
	That hurts global automakers that are looking to China to propel sales growth and are spending heavily to develop electric vehicles under pressure to meet Chinese government sales quotas."

              Tipping point? Experts say the Paris agreement changed the climate on climate
          
","
              Five years after it was passed, the Paris agreement may finally be changing the climate on climate change, with some activists saying it contributed to a stronger climate movement.
        ","

	Five years after it was passed, the Paris agreement may finally be changing the climate on climate change.
	""I've always known we're not going to act as soon as we could have,"" said Mark Jaccard, a widely consulted energy economist at Simon Fraser University.
	""I also know that when we do start to act, it'll be very fast. It'll be one of those tipping points and it could be that we're at one right now.""
	On Dec. 12, 2015, 196 countries met in Paris and put their signatures on a legally binding treaty to do what it took to limit global warming to below two degrees Celsius and to create carbon-neutral economies by 2050.
	Progress on those promises has been spotty.
	The United Nations annual emissions gap report released this week points out that greenhouse gas emissions have continued to grow and reached record levels in 2019. Even with a seven per cent decline in emissions expected this year because of the COVID-19 pandemic, atmospheric concentrations are expected to rise.
	The Liberal government has committed Canada to being carbon neutral by 2050. But it has released no plan for the three to four per cent annual cuts that it would take to get there. Canada has never met any of its previous climate goals and is one of five G20 countries behind on its Paris commitments.
	And yet ...
	""We have a much stronger climate movement that we did,"" said Keith Stewart of Greenpeace. ""A lot of the big forces in the world are starting to line up behind the transition.""
	More and more financial institutions -- including, just this week, the $225-billion New York state pension fund -- are divesting from fossil fuels or decarbonizing. The UN says 126 countries, including China, have either adopted binding net-zero goals or are considering them.
	The cost of renewable energy is plummeting -- 90 per cent for solar power, says an Oxford University publication. Some countries -- again, including China -- are putting end dates on the sale of gas-powered vehicles.
	""The effort is picking up speed,"" Jaccard said.
	Without Paris, Canada wouldn't have achieved what it has, federal Environment Minister Jonathan Wilkinson told an online webinar Thursday.
	""Canadians were really tired of inaction,"" he said. ""The pan-Canadian framework was something that came out of the Paris agreement.""
	The federal Liberals have implemented a carbon tax, signed agreements to reduce methane releases, promised a clean-fuel standard to cut vehicle emissions, announced $1.5 billion in funding for electric buses and charging stations, and helped phase out coal-generated power.
	""The Trudeau government is the only federal government Canada's had that is implementing the pricing and regulations that actually reduce emissions,"" Jaccard said.
	Wilkinson promises even more.
	""We know that more ambition will be required.""
	More is needed than just a new set of targets, Stewart said. Canadians who depend on the fossil fuel industry need help with the transition.
	""There's a whole bunch of people who are going to be hurt badly if we don't do this properly,"" he said. ""The rest of the country is going to be supporting Alberta, Saskatchewan and Newfoundland.""
	Jaccard said some way may be needed to prevent countries that aren't limiting emissions from having a trade advantage. Tariffs that penalize products from high-carbon jurisdictions are being discussed both at home and abroad, he said.
	""How do you get any kind of collective action when there are easy rewards for cheating? You have to have penalty mechanisms.""
	Paris made a real difference and progress is out there, said Jaccard.
	""I react strongly to people who say it's too late. The evidence doesn't support it.
	""It's harder, which means we've taken longer to act on it, but I always knew we would act.""

A Chinese citizen who allegedly financed a turtle-trafficking ring has been extradited from Malaysia to the United States, the Department of Justice (DOJ) announced in a statement on Thursday.
	Kang Juntao, 24, from Hangzhou in eastern China, was initially charged with money laundering last February. Between June 2017 and December 2018, he allegedly financed a nationwide ring of people who purchased turtles in the U.S. belonging to five protected species, and arranged for them to be illegally shipped to Hong Kong.
	""The turtles were inhumanely bound with duct tape and placed in socks so as not to alert customs authorities,"" the DOJ statement said.
	According to Kang's indictment, at least 1,500 turtles -- with a total value of US$2,250,000 -- were smuggled out of the U.S.
	Using a PayPal account, Kang allegedly purchased turtles from sellers advertising on social media or reptile trade websites.
	These sellers allegedly shipped the turtles to ""middlemen"" who were ""typically Chinese citizens who entered the country on student visas,"" according to the DOJ. Kang allegedly paid and instructed them to repackage the turtles, and use false labels for shipment to Hong Kong.
	Once in Hong Kong, the turtles were allegedly sold on the black market for thousands of dollars each.
	Kang allegedly did not declare the turtles to U.S. or Chinese customs, or obtain required permits from the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES).
	Authorities allege Kang trafficked the eastern box turtle, the Florida box turtle, the Gulf Coast box turtle, the spotted turtle, and the wood turtle -- all protected species under the CITES treaty.
	Kang was arrested at Malaysia's Kuala Lumpur International Airport last January before his extradition to the U.S. on Thursday.
	""Wildlife trafficking is a serious crime that impacts imperiled species at home and abroad,"" said Aurelia Skipwith, director of the US Fish and Wildlife Service, in the DOJ statement."

	EEuropean Union leaders reached a hard-fought deal Friday to cut the bloc's net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55 per cent by the end of the decade compared with 1990 levels, avoiding a hugely embarrassing deadlock ahead of a UN climate meeting this weekend.
	Following night-long discussions at their two-day summit in Brussels, the 27 member states approved the EU executive commission's proposal to toughen the bloc's intermediate target on the way to climate neutrality by mid-century, after a group of reluctant, coal-reliant countries finally agreed to support the improved goal.
	""Europe is the leader in the fight against climate change,"" tweeted EU Council president Charles Michel as daylight broke over the EU capital city. ""We decided to cut our greenhouse gas emissions of at least 55 by 2030.""Â 
	German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the 21-hour summit during which the climate debate was a constant worry, had much to show for it. ""It was worth having a sleepless night,"" she said.
	UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres' spokesman, Stephane Dujarric, hailed Friday's deal.
	""It's a very welcome announcement, one that inscribes itself in the efforts the secretary-general has called on member states, the groups of member states, to take,"" Dujarric said.
	Five years after the Paris agreement, the EU wants to be a leader in the fight against global warming. Yet the bloc's leaders were unable to agree on the new target the last time they met in October, mainly because of financial concerns by eastern nations seeking more clarity about how to fund and handle the green transition.
	But the long-awaited deal on a massive long-term budget and coronavirus recovery clinched Thursday by EU leaders swung the momentum.
	Large swaths of the record-high 1.82 trillion-euro package are set to pour into programs and investments designed to help the member states, regions and sectors particularly affected by the green transition, which are in need of a deep economic and social transformation. EU leaders have agreed that 30 per cent of the package -- some 550 billion euros -- should be used to support the transition.
	Still, agreeing on common language was not an easy task. Negotiations were punctuated throughout the night by intense discussions in the plenary session and multiple chats in smaller groups on the sidelines.
	Another delay in revising the EU's current 40 per cent emission cuts objective for 2030 would have been particularly embarrassing before the virtual Climate Ambition Summit marking five years since the Paris deal, and leaders worked to the wire to seal a deal.
	The event on Saturday will be co-hosted by the U.K. with the United Nations and France.
	French President Emmanuel Macron praised ""a major signal"" that will enable EU leaders ""to bring in our wake our big international partners, especially the United States and China.""
	British Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced last week he wants the U.K. to cut greenhouse gas emissions by at least 68 per cent from 1990 levels by 2030 -- a more ambitious goal than the EU's.
	Poland, which last year didn't commit to the EU's 2050 climate neutrality goal, and other eastern countries, including the Czech Republic and Hungary, largely depend on coal for their energy needs. They considered it unfair that all member states should be submitted to the same ambition without considering their respective energy mixes.
	To win their approval, member states agreed that the new target should be delivered collectively. According to the Belgian Prime minister's office, ""leaders agreed that the cuts will be first achieved in sectors and countries where there is still plenty of room for improvement.""
	In addition, the European Commission will take into account specific national situations when drawing up the measures. A progress report will be submitted to the European Council in the spring.
	The accord also left the door open to member states to use gas or nuclear power as they drop fossil fuels. EU leaders agreed last year that nuclear energy would be part of the bloc's solution to making its economy carbon neutral, and they reiterated Friday that they would respect member states' rights to decide on their energy mix and to choose the most appropriate technologies to reach the goal.
	According to a French official who was not authorized to speak publicly about the meeting, Poland also obtained guarantees that the EU's Emissions Trading System -- a cap-and-trade scheme for industries to buy carbon credits covering about 40 per cent of the EU's greenhouse gas emissions -- would be revamped. Poland wants the reform of the system to redirect more revenues to the poorer EU countries.
	World leaders agreed five years ago in Paris to keep the global warming increase to below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit), and ideally no more than 1.5 degrees C (2.7 degrees F) by the end of the century. Under the Paris accord, countries are required to submit updated climate targets by the end of this year.
	Greenpeace and other environmental groups have said the improved EU target is insufficient to properly tackle climate change.
	""To increase the chances of limiting global heating to 1.5 C and avoid the worst effects of climate breakdown, Greenpeace is calling for at least a 65 per cent cut in EU emissions from polluting sectors by 2030,"" the NGO said.
	Climate Action Network Europe regretted that the revised ""net"" target includes carbon sinks like reforestation, meaning that emitting sectors will need to decarbonize less to reach the new goal.
	""As the Commission indicates itself in its 2030 Climate Target Plan, if the EU is successful in implementing the Commission's biodiversity, carbon removals could represent up to 5 per cent of emissions. In this case the real emissions reduction target would be as low as 50 per cent,"" the NGO said.
	EU leaders also encouraged the commission to propose a carbon tax at the bloc's borders for countries that did do not regulate CO2 emissions as strictly as the EU does.

	Police said in a statement that they arrested a 73-year-old man under the national security law, but did not name him.

	Beijing imposed the national security law in response to protests in Hong Kong that began in June 2019 over a proposed extradition law and expanded to include demands for greater democracy in the former British colony.
	The legislation outlaws secession, subversion, terrorism, and collusion with foreign forces to intervene in Hong Kong's internal affairs. In certain cases, those charged under the national security law could also face trial in mainland China, where the legal system is highly opaque.
	The sweeping legislation prompted more public protests and led to complaints that Beijing is violating the autonomy promised to Hong Kong when was handed over to China from Britain in 1997. Critics have said the law is also damaging Hong Kong's status as a business centre.
	Apple Daily criticized the law on its front page on July 1, calling it the ""final nail in the coffin"" of the territory's autonomy.
	Lai has advocated for other countries to take a harsher stance on China, and last year he travelled to the U.S. to meet with Vice-President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to discuss the proposed extradition bill.
	He was also arrested in February and April on charges of taking part in unauthorized protests. He also faces charges of joining an unauthorized vigil marking the anniversary of the June 4, 1989, crackdown on pro-democracy protests in Beijing's Tiananmen Square."

	The UN General Assembly approved a resolution over Russian objections Thursday commending progress in peace talks between the Afghan government and the Taliban while urging stepped-up efforts to tackle terrorist attacks by the Taliban, al-Qaida, the Islamic State extremist group and their affiliates.
	The vote in the 193-member world body was 130 in favour, Russia against, and China, Pakistan and Belarus abstaining. Fifty-nine countries did not vote.
	The 15-page resolution titled ""The Situation in Afghanistan"" covers a wide range of issues including peace and reconciliation, democracy, the rule of law, good governance, human rights, counter-narcotics, social and economic development and regional co-operation.
	While welcoming progress in the intra-Afghan talks, including the Dec. 2 agreement on rules of procedure for negotiations, the resolution ""condemns the high rate of continued violence."" It says this ""is contributing to an unacceptable number of casualties"" and calls for an immediate cessation of violence and strongly encourages the Afghan government and the Taliban ""to pursue confidence-building measures and to reduce violence.""
	The resolution reiterates the General Assembly's ""serious concern"" about the security situation in Afghanistan and stresses the need to continue to address the threat to the country's stability from violence committed by the Taliban, including the Haqqani Network, as well as al-Qaida, Islamic State, their affiliates ""and other terrorist and criminal groups.""
	Afghanistan's UN ambassador, Adela Raz, expressed regret that despite her government's strong support for the resolution it wasn't adopted by consensus, saying the measure reflects ""developments that are taking place on the ground and particularly the progress in the peace process.""
	Raz said the goal of the government, Afghanistan's neighbours and the General Assembly is to incorporate the Taliban as a political party. ""It is our utmost aim to see the Taliban as a constructive political party in the country, without the relationship with al-Qaida and other terrorist groups, working for prosperity and peace in Afghanistan,"" she said.
	Noting that UN experts monitoring sanctions against the Taliban say it ""maintains ties to terrorist groups such as al-Qaida,"" Raz said the resolution is balanced regarding ""the Taliban's willingness to take firm steps towards peace and reconciliation"" and its continuing attacks and terrorist ties.
	German Ambassador Christoph Heusgen, whose country led negotiations on the resolution, said that ""out of all the 'special years' for Afghanistan declared in the past two decades, 2020 was indeed singular."" Most important was the start of Afghan peace negotiations in September, he said after detailing all the events leading to the talks, starting with the U.S.-Taliban agreement in February.
	Heusgen also pointed to pledges of more than US$13 billion in foreign aid and stabilization for Afghanistan at a donors conference in Geneva just over two weeks ago as evidence that ""the international community stands firmly behind the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan and its ongoing quest to achieve self-reliance.""
	He said the resolution is ""constructive and forward-looking"" and the vote signals that the General Assembly ""stands behind the Afghan people in a very difficult period of the country.""
	Russia's deputy UN ambassador, Anna Evstigneeva, sharply criticized Germany's role in the negotiations, saying there was ""blatant disregard"" for Moscow's concerns. She also said it is ""an attempt to conceal the true scope"" of threats from the Islamic State extremist group and drug issues threatening the country's security.
	She accused Germany of having ""a pre-established biased position favouring one group of states,"" which she didn't name, and said it should no longer facilitate negotiations on the Afghanistan resolution in the General Assembly.
	Nonetheless, Evstigneeva said, ""we continue to support Afghanistan during this crucial period.""
	Germany's Heusgen responded by saying Russia's ""no"" vote sends the message that ""Russia today let down the Afghan people.""
	""All of us should have voted in favour and should have sent a strong signal to the Afghan people: In these difficult times, we stand behind you,"" he said."

              World carbon dioxide emissions drop 7 per cent in pandemic-hit 2020
          
","
              A locked-down pandemic-struck world cut its carbon dioxide emissions this year by 7%, the biggest drop ever, new preliminary figures show.
        ","

	A locked-down pandemic-struck world cut its carbon dioxide emissions this year by 7%, the biggest drop ever, new preliminary figures show.
	The Global Carbon Project, an authoritative group of dozens of international scientists who track emissions, calculated that the world will have put 37 billion U.S. tons (34 billion metric tons) of carbon dioxide in the air in 2020. That's down from 40.1 billion US tons (36.4 billion metric tons) in 2019, according a study published Thursday in the journal Earth System Science Data.
	Scientists say this drop is chiefly because people are staying home, travelling less by car and plane, and that emissions are expected to jump back up after the pandemic ends. Ground transportation makes up about one-fifth of emissions of carbon dioxide, the chief man-made heat-trapping gas.
	""Of course, lockdown is absolutely not the way to tackle climate change,"" said study co-author Corinne LeQuere, a climate scientist at the University of East Anglia.
	The same group of scientists months ago predicted emission drops of 4% to 7%, depending on the progression of COVID-19. A second coronavirus wave and continued travel reductions pushed the decrease to 7%, LeQuere said.
	Emissions dropped 12% in the United States and 11% in Europe, but only 1.7% in China. That's because China had an earlier lockdown with less of a second wave. Also China's emissions are more industrial based than other countries and its industry was less affected than transportation, LeQuere said.
	The calculations -- based on reports detailing energy use, industrial production and daily mobility counts -- were praised as accurate by outside scientists.
	Even with the drop in 2020, the world on average put 1,185 tons (1,075 metric tons) of carbon dioxide into the air every second.
	Final figures for 2019 published in the same study show that from 2018 to 2019 emissions of the main man-made heat-trapping gas increased only 0.1%, much smaller than annual jumps of around 3% a decade or two ago. Even with emissions expected to rise after the pandemic, scientists are wondering if 2019 be the peak of carbon pollution, LeQuere said.
	""We are certainly very close to an emissions peak, if we can keep the global community together,"" said United Nations Development Director Achim Steiner.
	Chris Field, director of the Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment, thinks emissions will increase after the pandemic, but said ""I am optimistic that we have, as a society learned some lessons that may help decrease emissions in the future.""
	""For example,"" he added, ""as people get good at telecommuting a couple of days a week or realize they don't need quite so many business trips, we might see behaviour-related future emissions decreases.""

              'None of us imagined this': Michael Kovrig's wife marks two-year anniversary of his detention

              On the grim two-year anniversary of Michael Kovrigâs imprisonment in China, his wife says she worries most about the state of his mental health heading into yet another holiday season alone.

	On the grim two-year anniversary of Michael Kovrigâs imprisonment in China, his wife says she worries most about the state of his mental health heading into yet another holiday season alone.
	""Here we are, two years later, still speaking about him being in detention. None of us would have imagined this was going to be the case,"" said Vina Nadjibulla in an interview on CTVâs Power Play on Thursday.
	""I hoped sincerely that Michael would be home by now and instead heâs facing a prospect of his third Christmas alone, in isolation, in detention.""
	Kovrig, a former diplomat, and fellow Canadian Michael Spavor were arrested in China on Dec. 10, 2018, and charged with allegations of state spying for Canada. The Canadian government calls their detention arbitrary, while most in the diplomatic community view it as retaliation for the arrest of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou days prior in Vancouver on a U.S. extradition request.
	Consular access has been limited throughout the pandemic; the two men went 10 months without communication with Canadian representatives.
	""Our contact has been very limited between January and October. There were no consular visits, there were very few letters from Michael. Finally, in October we were able to get a consular visit and at least confirmation and a reassurance that he is still healthy and is doing well,"" said Nadjibulla, who is married to Kovrig but separated.
	Canadaâs Ambassador to China Dominic Barton who is leading the effort to secure Kovrig and Spavorâs release, told a House of Commons committee this week that the two men looked ""robust"" and that one ""would be very impressed by seeing both of them.""
	Nadjibulla called that long-awaited visit this fall a ""huge relief"" but notes she remains deeply concerned about his mental health.
	""Michael is doing everything he possibly can to keep his mind occupied with positive thoughts, with virtuous thoughts, with prayers of gratitude, with philosophical passages. Reading really provides him solace day-to-day, he essentially says that is what gets him through moment-to-moment, is being able to read and have access to books, which weâve been advocating for quite a bit,"" said Nadjibulla.
	The Liberal government remains adamant itâs doing all it can to free the men, despite opposition criticism that Ottawa has been ""kowtowing"" to China over the last several years.
	""Today is the sad anniversary of the illegal abduction and imprisonment of two innocent Canadians in China,"" said Conservative Leader Erin OâToole during a press conference on Thursday.
	""For months China has unfairly targeted our farming exports. For years, the Chinese Communist Party has been carrying out mass internment of the Uighurs in concentration camps and still the Liberals keep pushing for more involvement and more engagement with China.""
	Optimism sparked last week when the Wall Street Journal reported the U.S. Justice Department was in talks with Mengâs legal team to resolve her fraud charges and allow her to return home should she admit to criminal wrongdoing. It led to speculation that the arrangement could pave a way for Kovrig and Spavorâs freedom.
	Nadjibulla says, more broadly, she was left hopeful after hearing that during the first call between Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and U.S. President-Elect Joe Biden the leaders discussed the fate of the two men.
	""I pray that we will be seeing the light at the end of the tunnel,"" she said.

	Saskatchewan is set to begin its rollout of Pfizerâs COVID-19 vaccine on Dec. 15, just under a year after the first cluster of novel coronavirus patients was reported in China. Itâs the quickest any vaccine has been developed and Health Canada is also reviewing other candidates. 
CTV News spoke with Volker Gerdts, director and CEO of VIDO-InterVac at the University of Saskatchewan, a lab dedicated to infectious disease and vaccine research, to learn about how these vaccines have been developed so fast, whether they present any new safety concerns, and the status of VIDO-InterVacâs own vaccine candidate. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.
	Normally, for human vaccines, it can take up to 10 to 12 years for a human vaccine. For animal vaccines itâs usually much faster, but even then it's still years before you have a product.
	Well, it's through a very concerted effort, through a lot of money and through the willingness to, along the production or the development pathway, lose money.
	So if I can use just a very simple analogy: if you are willing to send 10 horses into the race, knowing that at the end, you only need one and you maybe lose nine, you can accomplish much more than running and then testing 10 different candidates in a sequence. Right? And so, this year, many governments around the world or big international organizations have made large amounts of money available to manufacturers to develop a vaccine as quickly as possible.
	And so with that money, you're able to test multiple candidates, knowing that some of them may not work and others will. And if you are prepared to lose that money, you can obviously save some time by running them all in parallel.
	And the other thing that people have done is trying to do as many activities in parallel as possible. So same idea, instead of waiting until you have the data from the first step to then go into the next study, processes have taken place in parallel. People were willing to, like I said, invest and lose money, but also, you know, try to reduce the time in between these studies to the bare minimum.
	Okay, so in very simple terms, vaccines contain fragments, pieces if you want, of a pathogen in them. And those fragments, those pieces, are being produced in different systems.
	So you can have that piece being a piece of RNA, as Pfizer or Moderna vaccines are, or you can make a protein as we do, or we can deliver it with another vector, another virus, which is the AstraZeneca vaccine.
	Essentially, what you do is you take a part of the pathogen, you can also take the whole pathogen, but you make it non disease causing, and then you inject it and you show it to the immune system and the immune system recognizes it and forms an immune response to it.
	We are trying to use a safe form of the pathogen. So often we kill these pathogens, we chemically inactivate them, so then they canât cause disease anymore and then we can inject them. Or we just take fragments, pieces of those pathogens. And we pick the ones that are very important in the interaction between the pathogen and the host.
	For example, right now, with the COVID-19 pandemic, everybody is focusing on this spike protein, which is on the surface of the virus, and that's what the virus uses to attach to the cells.
	If you have an immune response against the spike protein, you have antibodies in your blood, they prevent the attachment of the virus to the host cell, and that's how we prevent the virus from causing disease.
	Yeah, that's right. So same idea, if you're willing to do something, and it may not work out and you lose it, you know, you can start all these steps already before you have approval.
	No. The regular safety assessments, the processes that are laid out by the regulators that are required for approval, are all the same.
	You still saw that all these candidates went through Phase One, Phase Two studies and Phase Three studies and that the results have to be reported and reviewed by Health Canada.
	In the case of the clinical trials, you remember, there was here and there a case where an individual had come down with disease and then needed to be specifically reviewed by the review board. The processes are the same as we would normally do for any vaccine.
	Well, I think we're seeing a shift in the field. I think we will see in the future that the times of developing vaccines in 10 to 15 years are over and vaccines will be developed much faster.
	Whether it's always as fast as this one, I canât see that happening, because the money that has gone into this, of course is enormous, right?
	In the situation of a global pandemic, yes, I can see that. But if it's a regular disease, which maybe doesn't have the global impact, it's hard to imagine that there will be billions of dollars coming from every government in the world towards the development of these vaccines.
	We're making what is called a protein subunit. This is a proven technology that is in a number of vaccines for humans. Diphtheria, tetanus, and whooping cough vaccines for children or the Hepatitis C vaccine.
	VIDO-InterVac is making a protein subunit vaccine which also has a lot of advantages in that it's easy to manufacture, it's cost effective and much easier in terms of storage.
	The Pfizer vaccine, for example, requires -70 C storage and so on. Our technology does not require that.
	We have now made an application to Health Canada - in fact, it's going out today - an official package, which shows all the data that we have on our vaccine candidate and the regulators will review that data and then hopefully give us permission to start our clinical trials in the very near future.
	So we're ready to go and waiting now for the green light from Health Canada to start.
	It will be later next year at the earliest. I think for most of the vaccines that we're seeing right now, probably around May or June of next year, somewhere there, so ours will be a little bit later than that."

              'We need trust': How a COVID-19 vaccine came so quickly
          
","
              While some have expressed concern that COVID-19 vaccines have reached approval stage in record time, experts insist that the speed is a product of multitasking and co-ordinated effort, not shortcuts.

                ",https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/coronavirus/we-need-trust-how-a-covid-19-vaccine-came-so-quickly-1.5225872,"TORONTO -- 
	Months ago it seemed impossible a vaccine for COVID-19 would even reach final trial stages by December, let alone the arms of Canadians.
	But now the first of several potential coronavirus shots is likely days away after Health Canada approved the candidate by BioNTech and Pfizer Inc. on Wednesday.
	If most vaccines take years to develop and distribute, how is it that we got here so quickly? Is there any cause for concern that speed means danger?
	Experts say that the speed is not a product of hasty shortcuts, but instead a combination of multitasking, a co-ordinated global effort and the fruits of earlier research. Understanding this is a matter of public health concern, said Kerry Bowman, a bioethicist and environmentalist with the University of Toronto whose work on emerging zoonotic diseases involved him in research and health-care work during the Ebola and SARS outbreaks.
	âThe Canadian public are assuming that all of this happened at record speed and every conceivable corner was cut,â he told CTVNews.ca over the phone on Thursday.Â 
	But thatâs not so.
IT WASNâT âGROUND ZEROâ
	The SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes the COVID-19 disease isnât the first coronavirus. Human coronaviruses were first identified more than 50 years ago with the HCoV-229E, which infects humans and bats. Scientists have since discovered five others, including MERS-CoV, which causes Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, and SARS-CoV, the first strain of the SARS coronavirus species that led to the current pandemic of COVID-19. The groundwork was not for nothing, said Bowman.
	âBecause weâve got this pattern of emerging infectious diseasesâ¦ many good people have been on to this and developed a research platform that really, really was tremendously useful when this COVID-19 pandemic struck,â he said.
	âThey really werenât starting from ground zero at all. We really built on previous lessons tremendously and now weâre going to soon reap the benefits of that.â
	After COVID-19 broke out in China, scientists there were quickly able to produce the genetic code for the novel coronavirus and shared it with the global community on Jan. 11, before outbreaks took hold in many other countries. Despite the quick action of the scientific community, the pandemic continued on a grim course, which Bowman said points to social and political failures, not academic.
	âThis pandemic was an accident waiting to happen,â he said. âOur governments were very slow to respond to such a massive threat.â
	While labs quickly harnessed the new genetic code, other technologies had already been developed in years prior for other diseases, particularly the messenger RNA vaccine technology, which modifies the gene responsible for making the coronavirus protein and attaching the virus to cells in the body, thereby producing an immune response. The newly approved Pfizer vaccine is one of them.
MULTITASKING AND CO-ORDINATION
	Vaccine development and production requires a lot of money from partnerships between pharmaceutical companies, which has never been such a swift process, said Bowman, providing the resources required to ramp up development.
	âNormally, funding and partnerships really drag out with these types of things. Global emergency partnerships have happened very quickly,â he said.Â 
	Other steps of the process that normally would take several years and happen sequentially were sped up and done in unison instead.Â 
	âRather than wait till one step was completed, they did a lot of things in parallel, only if it was safe and made sense scientifically,â said Bowman.
	Normally, pharmaceutical companies would send fully completed data sets to Health Canada for approval, and analysis of that data would be under embargo. Instead, it has happened in âreal time,â said infectious disease expert and associate professor at McMaster University Zain Chagla, with health agencies reviewing incomplete data sets as they come in throughout the course of clinical trials.
	âThis is a global emergency thatâs shutting down society and relatively so, this is probably the biggest intervention to date that might actually reduce some of the burden in our communities,â he told CTVNews.ca last month.
	Another element that provided a push for vaccines was the second wave of COVID-19 infections. While the spread of the virus has been devastating, with known infections tripling worldwide since late August, the surge meant that clinical trials reached important markers earlier than anticipated, providing more robust data.
	The pandemic remains far from over, with more than 2,400 deaths in the last month and 6,000 new infections daily across the country. All the more reason why Canadians should trust that the potentially pandemic-ending COVID-19 vaccines that are beginning to circulate werenât made by cutting corners, experts say.Â 
	âThereâs very good reasons why this moved as quickly as it did,â said Bowman. âWe need trust because thereâs many Canadians that are vaccine hesitant.âÂ

	âThere is a real problem,â she said at a news briefing on Thursday. âHow come the information wasnât transmitted before that? Itâs outrageous, honestly.âÂ 
	In the spring, the COVID-19 disease claimed nearly 6,000 lives in Quebec, which accounted for about 60 per cent of all deaths in Canada.
	The Liberal Party is convinced that the government could have acted sooner, in particular to ensure the supply of personal protective equipment like masks, in sufficient quantities.
	After all, by the end of January, British Columbia and Alberta were already placing orders for equipment, including masks.
	The opposition also touched on Arruda's statement that he never recommended closing restaurants during the second wave -- rather, the decision was political.Â 
	Arrudaâs statement made some restaurateurs react. They were quick to share their anger with the media and demand responses from the government.
	According to Quebec solidaire, Legault must apologize to the restaurateurs, whom he chose to âabandonâ contrary to what was recommended by public health.
	The parliamentary leader of the Parti QuÃ©bÃ©cois, Pascal Berube, urged the government to compensate restaurant owners directly, based on figures from last year.
	Reacting in turn to Arruda's statement, Minister of Health Christian Dube said he was convinced that the decision to close the dining rooms of restaurants was the right one.
	âIt was important for us to limit the number of contacts between people, and particularly (...) on the issue of restaurants, bars, places of gathering,â he explained at a news conference.Â 
	âThere are times when we decided (...) to be more careful and perhaps go beyond the recommendations that were made,â he added.Â

              Bisons revive, freshwater dolphins dwindle: Conservationists
          
","
              A leading conservation group uniting governments and civil society says all four known freshwater dolphin species are now threatened with extinction, after newly discovered information on the tucuxi in the Amazon river system showed it too is endangered.

	A leading conservation group uniting governments and civil society says all four known freshwater dolphin species are now threatened with extinction, after newly discovered information on the tucuxi in the Amazon river system showed it too is endangered.
The finding from the International Union for Conservation of Nature comes as its latest ""Red List"" of threatened species, released Thursday, also showed that populations of the European bison -- Europe's largest land mammal -- have improved, even as the list of extinct species overall has continued to expand.
	""The European bison and 25 other species recoveries documented in today's IUCN Red List update demonstrate the power of conservation,"" said Dr. Bruno Oberle, IUCN's director-general.
	Still, the conservation group said 31 species have been declared extinct in the latest of its regular updates of the list, including three Central American frog species and 15 freshwater fish species endemic to a single lake in the Philippines. A South China Sea shark, last seen in 1934 and only formally described last year, is thought to be ""possibly extinct.""
	Craig Hilton-Taylor, head of the IUCN red list, said the impact of human activity was a driver for many species nearing extinction.
	""All of these things are down to human activities, whether it's direct hunting or fishing or harvesting of the species, to introducing invasive species, changing habitats to agriculture, urbanization, climate change,"" he said in a video interview. ""The human footprint is everywhere.""
	The tucuxi, a small gray dolphin found in the Amazon River system, is now listed as ""endangered."" Its numbers have been severely depleted by human activity, including fishing gear, the damming of rivers and pollution. Previously there wasn't enough information to determine its status.
	The Gland, Switzerland-based group cites three other freshwater dolphin species -- the Amazon river dolphin, the South Asian river dolphin and the Yangtze River dolphin in China, though it may already be extinct -- as threatened, along with the Yangtze finless porpoise, IUCN spokesman Matthias Fiechter said.
	IUCN says nearly 129,000 species are on its list, including 35,765 threatened with extinction. The ""red list"" breaks down threatened species into vulnerable, endangered and critically endangered categories -- the last of these meaning those closest to extinction.
	The European bison is making gains -- more than tripling its population since 2003 to more than 6,200 last year -- because of conservation management, IUCN said.
	Once widespread across Europe several centuries ago, the continent's largest land mammal was hunted, and its numbers declined dramatically.
	After the First World War, the remaining population of the horned animals -- close cousins of the North American bison -- was hunted out, leaving the species extinct in the wild and only surviving in captivity. Reintroduction efforts began in the 1950s, and today 47 free-ranging herds now roam the continent.
	""There's a huge push across Europe, what they call re-wilding, trying to restore habitats that have been transformed by people back into wild habitat again and bring back a lot of these species that have been lost,"" Hilton-Taylor said.
	IUCN, which was founded in 1948, brings together more than 1,400 member organizations and 15,000 experts and bills itself as one of the world's largest environmental networks.

China flight attendants advised to wear diapers for COVID-19 protection

	As the coronavirus pandemic rages on, transportation officials around the world have been looking for ways to keep passengers and crew safe on board planes.
	On November 25, the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) released new guidelines for the country's airline industry, which it oversees.
The document, titled Technical Guidelines for Epidemic Prevention and Control for Airlines, Sixth Edition, contains advice about the best hygiene practices to carry out on aircraft and in airports.
	But one of those suggestions -- that personnel like flight attendants wear disposable diapers so they don't need to use the bathroom -- has raised some eyebrows.
	A section on PPE advises cabin crew on flights to and from high-risk countries to wear ""medical masks, double-layer disposable medical gloves, goggles, disposable hats, disposable protective clothing, and disposable shoe covers.""
	The next sentence reads: ""It is recommended that cabin crew members wear disposable diapers and avoid using the lavatories barring special circumstances to avoid infection risks.""
	While such advice may seem dramatic, it's no secret that lavatories can be the germiest place on an airplane. In August, a woman traveling from Italy to South Korea contracted coronavirus during her trip, and a visit to the bathroom -- the only place where she didn't wear an N95 mask -- was named as the possible source of her infection.
	Airplane bathroom design was already a hot topic before COVID-19, but the pandemic has focused efforts to come up with new solutions.
	Japanese airline ANA announced earlier this year that it was testing out a prototype of a new hands-free lavatory door. Meanwhile, Boeing successfully applied for a patent on a ""self-cleaning lavatory"" that would use UV light to clean 99.9% of bathroom germs after every use."

              Politicians urge people to buy Australian wine in defiance of China

	Politicians from various Western countries have asked consumers to buy Australian wine in order to fight back against China's punitive tariffs on the beverage.
	China is the most important export market for Australian wine, and winemakers are scrambling to find new markets following Beijing's decision to slap tariffs of up to 212% on Australian wine imports amid an escalating trade war between the two nations.
	Now a number of public figures associated with the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China (IPAC), which calls itself ""an international cross-party group of legislators working to reform the approach of democratic countries to China,"" have called on consumers to stand up to Beijing.
	""We are asking you all to join us in standing against Xi Jinping's authoritarian bullying,"" said Miriam Lexmann, a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) representing the Christian Democrats, in a video posted on Twitter on Tuesday.
	""By drinking a bottle or two of Australian wine and letting the Chinese Communist Party know that we will not be bullied,"" added Elisabet Lann, a municipal councilor from Sweden's Christian Democrats.
	Other politicians featured in the video include Australian MP Kimberley Kitching, US Senator Ted Yoho and Shiori Yamao, an independent member of Japan's House of Representatives.
	Tony Battaglene, CEO of Australian Grape and Wine, a national association, said Beijing's tariffs have endangered business with mainland China.
	Battaglene works with around 800 wine producers in Australia who have ""built their businesses"" around exporting to China and are now left with no backup plan, he added.
	""We were surprised, we were shocked,"" Battaglene told CNN Business. ""Having the extent of these interim tariffs, I mean essentially they will close the market to Australian bottled wine, to premium wine, in China. There's no way that we can compete at those levels.""
	China's Commerce Ministry announced Friday that its decision was made after finding preliminary evidence of dumping. Australian officials have bitterly protested the move, saying that China has been unable to provide proof.
	The wine war is taking place against the backdrop of a wider deterioration in relations. Australia has upset China this year by calling for an investigation into the origins of the coronavirus pandemic. Beijing later targeted Canberra over trade, namely by suspending some imports of beef and slapping heavy tariffs on barley."

              'Two Michaels' mark two jailed years in China, no development in their cases

	In his darkest moments, Michael Kovrig draws strength from knowing that his fellow Canadians and people around the world are working to free him and Michael Spavor from their respective Chinese prison cells.
	As much as that matters, Kovrig's wife Vina Nadjibulla says he is also subjecting himself to a strict regimen to strengthen his mind and body because he views that as the key to his survival.
	She says that not only is Kovrig determined to survive his ordeal, he wants to reclaim his freedom better and stronger than when he lost it.
	Kovrig and Spavor are marking two years in separate Chinese prisons, on what Canada and dozens of its Western allies say are trumped-up espionage charges in retaliation for the RCMP's December 2018 arrest of Chinese high-tech executive Meng Wanzhou on a U.S. extradition warrant.
	Canada's ambassador to China, Dominic Barton, one of the few outsiders to see them, said this week Kovrig and Spavor are anything but broken men, and that seeing how they've endured their captivity was inspiring.
	""Mr. Spavor and Mr. Kovrig, and their families, have shown truly remarkable perseverance in the face of an unimaginable situation,"" Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Thursday.
	Kovrig is ""marshalling every ounce of his willpower and strength"" to cope with his difficult situation, Nadjibulla said in an interview this week.
	""He says that knowing that Canadians care, knowing that the world cares, and people are fighting for his release, makes him feel stronger, and keeps hope alive,"" she said, drawing on letters that he has written in captivity.
	""He hopes that he will be able to come out from this experience not only having survived it, but with a commitment, with resolve to rebuild his life better, to contribute even more to society.""
	A statement from Global Affairs on Thursday to The Canadian Press said that Canadian Embassy officials in Beijing spoke directly with Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs officials to clarify a media report earlier in the morning that suggested the two Michaels had gone on trial in China.
	The statement said that ""contrary to what has been reported in the media this morning, there has been no development in the cases of Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor.""
	The statement also said that ""the confusion was caused by an inaccurate characterization of the process made by the Chinese MFA spokesperson.""
	The Canadian Press also reached out, through intermediaries, to request interviews with Spavor's friends and family but was unsuccessful. Spavor worked as an entrepreneur in the Chinese city of Dandong, where he is imprisoned near the North Korean border.
	Kovrig was most recently an analyst with the International Crisis Group in Washington and before that he was a member of Canada's diplomatic corps, a career-focused on preventing deadly conflicts.
	""He hopes that he can continue to do that, and he can rejoin the broader conversation in the world with life and not just continue to be isolated and cut off in the way that he is,"" said Nadjibulla.
	She said Kovrig is devouring books from the meditations of stoic philosopher Marcus Aurelius, to St. Paul's Letter to the Romans, to Tolstoy's ""War and Peace,"" to Nelson Mandela's ""Long Walk to Freedom."" He's reread one of his pre-prison favourites, ""Antifragile: Things That Gain From Disorder"" by Nassim Nicholas Taleb, because it contains a key message for him.
	""It essentially posits that it's important to cultivate an ability to not only survive traumas or disruptions but to become better and stronger as a result. So, this idea of building back better. I know it's very much on the minds of many of us as we recover from the pandemic,"" she said.
	Kovrig is also drawing on stoic philosophical teaching that, among other things, calls for the transformation of ""fear into prudence, pain into information,"" said Nadjibulla. Kovrig has added ""anger into determination and grievance into resolve"" to that philosophy.
	He has been drawn to St. Paul's Letter to the Romans, the sixth book of the New Testament, ""which says suffering produces endurance, endurance produces character, character produces hope. And Michael is doing everything possible to keep hope alive,"" said Nadjibulla.
	Kovrig is subjecting himself to a strict physical regimen, forever on the move in his small cell striving to walk the equivalent of five kilometres daily because he knows his mind cannot thrive if his body is not strong, said Nadjibulla.
	Robert Malley, Kovrig's boss at the International Crisis Group, says his imprisoned colleague can hold the plank, a core body exercise of endurance, for 18 minutes. In solidarity, Crisis Group colleagues recently had a plank competition but the closest anyone got was seven minutes. They're also walking 7,000 steps a day, the equivalent of five kilometres.
	Malley said he and his colleagues are in awe of Kovrig's discipline.
	""None of us can be prepared for that, unless you're in the military and you're told this could happen. But he seems to have had all of the reflexes, instincts that are necessary,"" said Malley.
	When Kovrig is released one day his colleagues hope stories of their attempts to replicate some of his exercises will help him heal and, perhaps, bridge the gap growing between them and him, said Malley.
	Kovrig only found out the scope of the global pandemic during Barton's on-site virtual visit in October -- his first contact with Canadian diplomats since January because Chinese authorities wouldn't allow any contact due to COVID-19, said Nadjibulla.
	He was shocked at the pandemic's scale and compared it to a zombie apocalypse and the movie ""Contagion.""
	Kovrig is also aware that he is one of ""two Michaels"" and understands that both he and Spavor ""are caught in this bigger situation,"" she said. It's not a topic that can be discussed during the now-resumed 30-minute consular visits.
	Nadjibulla said she was happy to hear that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau spoke to U.S. president-elect Joe Biden about the two Michaels in their recent conversation. Trudeau refused to discuss the content of that conversation last week, or whether Biden might revisit the Justice Department's attempted extradition and prosecution of Meng.
	If the U.S. withdrew its charges, Meng could go free, and that might give China reason to free the two Michaels.
	""Our Michael and Michael Spavor are caught in a bigger geopolitical struggle,"" Nadjibulla said. ""They're pawns in a bigger political game involving the U.S., China and Canada. And they have been in the situation for two long years, for no other reason than being Canadian citizens.""

China restricts U.S. official travel to Hong Kong

China is imposing restrictions on travel to Hong Kong by some U.S. officials and others in retaliation for similar measures imposed on Chinese individuals by Washington, the Foreign Ministry said Thursday.

	China is imposing restrictions on travel to Hong Kong by some U.S. officials and others in retaliation for similar measures imposed on Chinese individuals by Washington, the Foreign Ministry said Thursday.
	U.S. diplomatic passport holders visiting Hong Kong and nearby Macao will temporarily no longer receive visa-free entry privileges, spokesperson Hua Chunying said.
	U.S. administration officials, congressional staffers, employees of non-governmental organizations and their immediate family members will face ""reciprocal sanctions,"" Hua said.
	She was apparently referring to U.S. sanctions that bar certain Chinese and Hong Kong officials from travelling to the U.S. or having dealings with the U.S. financial system over their roles in imposing a sweeping National Security Law passed this summer that ushered in a crackdown on free speech and opposition political activity in Hong Kong.
	Hua said the move was taken ""given that the U.S. side is using the Hong Kong issue to seriously interfere in China's internal affairs and undermine China's core interests.""
	Those sanctioned ""have performed egregiously and are primarily responsible on the Hong Kong issue,"" she said at a daily briefing.
	""China once again urges the U.S. side to immediately stop meddling in Hong Kong affairs, stop interfering in China's internal affairs, and not go further down the wrong and dangerous path,"" Hua said.
	China had long threatened to retaliate against the U.S. sanctions and other actions seen as hostile.
	Earlier, China's official Xinhua News Agency said Trump administration officials are ""digging a hole"" for the next U.S. administration's relationship with China through actions targeting the country and its officials.
	Steps such as restricting visas for the 92 million members of the ruling Communist Party and their families have ""again exposed the sinister intentions of extreme anti-China forces in Washington to hijack China-U.S. relations for their own political gain,"" Xinhua said in an editorial.
	The U.S. State Department last week cut the duration of such visas from 10 years to one month, another example of the increasingly hard-line stance adopted by the administration in its waning days. That came in addition to the sanctions targeting specific Chinese and Hong Kong officials over their actions in Hong Kong, the northwestern region of Xinjiang and elsewhere.
	While President-elect Joe Biden has signalled he intends to keep pressure on China, he's also expected to seek a return to more conventional, less confrontational style of diplomacy. Rolling back Trump-era measures could be difficult however, while giving Republicans the chance to renew accusations that Biden is softening Washington's stance toward Beijing.
	""By relentlessly challenging the bottom line of China-U.S. relations on issues concerning China's core interests, anti-China politicians are not only digging a hole for the next administration's relationship with China, but also eying their own personal political gains,"" Xinhua said.
	U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has castigated China on almost a daily basis over its policies toward Taiwan, Tibet, Hong Kong, Xinjiang and the South China Sea.
	Dozens of officials from mainland China and Hong Kong have been hit with visa bans and other sanctions and new restrictions have been imposed on Chinese diplomats, journalists and academics. Chinese tech giant Huawei has been shut out of the U.S. market and the U.S. has lobbied other countries to follow suit, often successfully.
	On Wednesday, Pompeo accused U.S. universities of caving to Chinese pressure to blunt or bar criticism of the the Chinese communist party, which he said was ""poisoning the well of our higher education for its own ends.""
	Chinese responded by vowing to impose countervailing measures against American officials, saying U.S. accusations and punitive measures only solidified the Chinese people behind their leaders.
	Perhaps with an eye toward Biden, who takes office Jan. 20, Xinhua held open the possibility of better relations if Washington changed its approach.
	""Today, China and the United States should also uphold the spirit of non-conflict, non-confrontation, mutual respect and win-win co-operation,"" Xinhua said. ""The two must focus on managing their differences, with the top priority being a smooth transition toward stronger China-U.S. relations."""

              India's pandemic recovery plan could cost air quality goals
          
","
              The pandemic has made India's emergency measures to curb pollution-related illness, such as boosting public transit, harder to implement. And long-term targets, including weaning power plants from dirty fossil fuels, are taking a back seat.
        ","

	India is facing two public health emergencies simultaneously: critically polluted air and the pandemic. And Surinder Singh, a bus driver in the capital New Delhi, is trapped between them both.
	In previous years, the government encouraged more people to use buses that run on cleaner fuels, like the one he drives, as an emergency air quality measure. But this year there are limits on passengers to maintain social distance. The air stings Singh's eyes and he worries about contracting the virus every time a person gets on board.
	Still reeling from India's harsh lockdown that dried up his US$9 daily income for two months, the 47-year-old father of two says he has no choice but to work. Masked and armed with a bottle of hand sanitizer, he starts his journey near a private hospital that is overwhelmed by virus patients. He travels through roads packed with traffic to the city's largest and most frenetic railway station.

India is grappling with two public health emergencies: critically polluted air and the pandemic. Nowhere is this dual threat more pronounced than in the Indian capital New Delhi, where the spike in winter pollution levels has coincided with a surge of COVID-19 cases. (AP Photo/Manish Swarup, File)
	""I drive the bus in constant fear,"" he said.
	Millions of others are equally desperate in India's historic recession. The economy contracted by 23.9% in the April-June quarter -- its worst performance in at least 24 years -- and by 7.5% in the next quarter.
	The virus, meanwhile continues to spread with over 9.7 million cases, and more than 140,000 deaths. And India's underfunded hospitals, already strained by the virus, are also filling up with patients in respiratory distress from air pollution.
	The pandemic has made emergency measures, such as boosting public transit, harder to implement. And long-term targets, including weaning power plants from dirty fossil fuels, are taking a back seat. India plans to increase coal production to reduce imports, and its recovery plan remains heavily reliant on energy sources that produce carbon emissions.
	""This pandemic will define the pathway of how we move in the future (to control air pollution),"" said Sunil Dahiya, an analyst at the advocacy group Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air.
	India's environment ministry did not respond to requests for comment.
	The dual threat is particularly pronounced in the Indian capital New Delhi, where the annual spike in winter pollution levels has come amid a surge in new COVID-19 cases. The city is among the most polluted in India, where an estimated 1.67 million people die annually from bad air. Dr. Akshay Budhraja, a pulmonologist at a private hospital here, said it was flooded with patients with respiratory distress who thought they had COVID-19. ""Patients are very, very anxious,"" he said.
	The Delhi pollution gets worse in the fall and winter when the burning of crop debris in neighbouring states coincides with cooler temperatures that trap smoke close to the city. Over 76,000 farm fires were spotted by satellites in Punjab state -- the most since 2016 -- and Delhi's air quality levels in October were worse than previous years, government data shows.
	Although the city of 29 million people and 10 million cars is enveloped in smog, authorities have fewer options than before the pandemic. Last year, authorities had restricted some of the capital's private vehicles and increased public transportation. But this year, standing passengers aren't allowed in Delhi's buses, and metro coaches are only allowing about 50 people, compared to a maximum of 300 in the past. Anumita Roychowdhury, a director at the advocacy group Centre for Science and Environment, estimated that public transit is operating at a third of capacity overall.
	The pandemic also has hindered efforts to clean emissions at coal-fired power plants, which account for 65% of India's electricity. The government had asked plants to install technology that would remove sulfur dioxide from their emissions by 2022. But after initial delays from problems in getting loans, the pandemic snapped supply chains and made it impossible to import the required equipment, said Ashok Kumar Khurana, who heads the Association of Power Producers.
	India's power ministry has sought a deadline extension from the environment ministry while the government has undertaken measures aimed at boosting coal production. In June, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the auction of 40 new coal leases to private miners. Modi described this shift from India's state-controlled coal industry as ""freeing the coal sector from decades of lockdown.""
	Last year, the government asked the state-run Coal India to increase the annual production from the current 661 million tons (600 million metric tons) to over a billion tons by 2024. To make the transition to domestic coal easier, it has also waived regulations that mandated a federal environment ministry review if a power plant wanted to change the type of coal being used.
	Much of India's coal reserves have a high ash content that burns inefficiently and results in increased emissions and air pollution, said Roychowdhury. India is the third-highest emitter of carbon dioxide, behind China and the United States.
	These are efforts to save ""an industry that is already circling the drain,"" said Kanika Chawla, an energy policy expert at the New Delhi-based think-tank Council on Energy, Environment and Water. Before the pandemic, India's power plants were running below capacity because the growth in power production capacity had outpaced demand.
	With demand dipping further, Chawla said that the government had an opportunity to pivot away from fossil fuels and accelerate a ""just"" transition to cleaner fuels. ""We were clearly at a crossroad,"" she said.

	Airbnb proved its resilience in a year that has upended global travel. Now it needs to prove to investors that it sees more growth ahead.
	The San Francisco-based home sharing company made a triumphant debut on the public market Thursday, with its shares more than doubling in price to open at US$146. Airbnb had priced its shares at $68 apiece late Wednesday. The shares are trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market under the symbol ""ABNB.""
	Instead of the traditional ringing of the bell prior to the trading day, Airbnb presented a video of Airbnb hosts from around the world ringing their doorbells. In a video message, CEO Brian Chesky also thanked the millions of guests who have stayed at its listings.
	""You gave us hope that the idea of strangers staying together, in each others' homes, was not so crazy after all,"" Chesky said. ""Airbnb is rooted in the fundamental idea that people are good and we're in this together.""
	Airbnb raised $3.7 billion in its offering, making it the biggest U.S. IPO this year, according to Renaissance Capital, which tracks IPOs. The company had initially set a price range of $44 to $50 for it shares, but raised that to a range of $56 to $60 earlier this week indicating rising investor demand.
	Airbnb's listing comes a day after another San Francisco-based company, DoorDash, soared through it initial public offering, the second largest after Airbnb's. DoorDash's stock jumped 85.8% to close at $189.51. The meal delivery app raised $3.4 billion with its offering.
	Airbnb wants to add more hosts and properties, expand in markets like India, China and Latin America and attract new guests.
	First, it will need to recover. Airbnb -- which has never posted an annual profit -- said its revenue fell 32% to $2.5 billion in the first nine months of this year as the coronavirus forced travellers to cancel their plans. The company delayed its IPO -- initially planned for the spring -- and funded operations with $2 billion in loans. In May, Airbnb cut 1,900 employees -- or 25% of its workforce -- and halted programs not related to its core business, like movie production.
	But in the months since, Airbnb's business rebounded faster than hotels as travellers felt safer booking private homes away from crowded downtowns during the pandemic. In Miami, for example, short-term rental occupancy reached 83% in October, while average occupancy for hotels was 42%, according to STR, an accommodations data firm.
	Airbnb said the number of nights and experiences booked, which plummeted 72% in April compared to year-ago levels, were down 20% in September. Airbnb debuted experiences -- from cooking classes to surfing lessons -- in 2016.
	Airbnb now has 7.4 million listings, from castles to treehouses, in 220 countries. They are operated by 4 million hosts. The company controls around 39% of the global short-term rental market, according to Euromonitor. It's the market leader in Europe but trails VRBO, a vacation rental company owned by Expedia, in North America.
	Looking ahead, Airbnb thinks it could see a surge in business from people who are able to work remotely.
	""We believe that the lines between travel and living are blurring, and the global pandemic has accelerated the ability to live anywhere,"" Airbnb said in a recent financial filing.
	It could also expand its offerings further into boutique hotels, as it signalled with its 2019 purchase of last-minute hotel room supplier Hotel Tonight.
	Still, Airbnb acknowledges it will be difficult and expensive to attract new hosts and guests. Its revenue growth rate was already slowing in the years leading up to the pandemic.
	""I do think the company will benefit from the pent-up travel demand once the vaccine is widely distributed, but why would someone want to buy into a travel-related, unprofitable business with slowing growth?"" said Scott Rostan, the CEO of Training the Street, which advises Wall Street analysts.
	Airbnb was born 13 years ago in the San Francisco apartment shared by Brian Chesky -- now the company's CEO -- and Joe Gebbia, who leads its design studio and Airbnb.org, its charitable arm.
	Chesky and Gebbia were looking for a way to subsidize their apartment. When they learned a design conference was coming to town and hotels were full, they set up a website -- AirBedandBreakfast.com -- and rented out air mattresses. They got three takers. In 2008, they formed a company with Nate Blecharczyk, a software engineer.
	Home sharing wasn't new. VRBO was launched in 1995. Booking.com, another older rival based in Amsterdam, mainly offers hotel rooms but has also branched into vacation rentals.
	What Airbnb did differently was focus on affordability, letting hosts rent out spare rooms and sofa beds, said Tarik Dogru, an assistant professor in the Dedman College of Hospitality at Florida State University who studies Airbnb. Guests strayed further into neighbourhoods than they would if they stayed at a hotel.
	""Airbnb offered that feel of authenticity for those who are looking for it,"" Dogru said.
	That has sometimes been a problem. The company has angered some cities, which accuse it of promoting overtourism and making neighbourhoods less affordable by taking housing off the market. Los Angeles, Paris and even Airbnb's home city of San Francisco have passed laws restricting its rentals.
	Airbnb's rapid growth -- the number of hosts and active listings grew more than 20% in both 2018 and 2019 -- has also made it difficult for the company to ensure quality. Last November, Airbnb promised to verify all its listings to make sure they match the photos on its site. It also spent the last year removing party houses and tightening rules for guests after a deadly 2019 shooting at an illegal Airbnb house party in California.
	Relationships with hosts and guests have been rocky at times. After multiple reports of racist behaviour targeting guests, Airbnb instituted a nondiscrimination statement that all guests and hosts must sign. It won't display a guest's profile photo until a property is booked, so a host can't deny a room based on a guest's race.
	And earlier this year, hosts revolted after the company let guests cancel bookings and get full refunds due to the pandemic. Airbnb responded by promising $250 million to hosts to help make up the shortfall.
	Cary Gillenwater, a university professor and Airbnb host in Duivendrecht, The Netherlands, said the company didn't provide much financial assistance to him, even though he let many guests cancel without penalties.
	Gillenwater usually makes more than $21,000 each year renting out a room on his property with its own entrance. This year, he'll be lucky to make $2,500. He's looking into renting the room to office workers to use during the day.
	Despite his experience, he's considering investing in Airbnb and thinks it will continue to grow. Home sharing is invaluable for his family of five, he said, because it's difficult to find hotel rooms that are large enough.
	""I feel like there is a future for them, but we have to get through all this first,"" he said."

              Hunter Biden tax probe examining Chinese business dealings

                ",https://www.ctvnews.ca/world/america-votes/hunter-biden-tax-probe-examining-chinese-business-dealings-1.5224104,"WILMINGTON, DEL.  -- 
	The Justice Department's investigation scrutinizing Hunter Biden's taxes has been examining some of his Chinese business dealings, among other financial transactions, a person familiar with the matter told The Associated Press on Wednesday.
	The investigation was launched in 2018, a year before his father, Joe Biden, announced his candidacy for president, but it isn't clear which entities might be tied up in the probe, and the inquiry was not disclosed to Hunter Biden until Tuesday.
	The younger Biden has a history of international affairs and business dealings in a number of countries, and the revelation of a federal investigation puts a renewed spotlight on the questions about his financial dealings that dogged his father's successful White House campaign.
	Federal investigators served a round of subpoenas on Tuesday, including one for Hunter Biden, according to another person familiar with the investigation who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss an ongoing probe. The tax investigation centres on his business dealings, the person said.
	Investigators did not reach out in the weeks prior to the election because of a Justice Department policy surrounding elections that prohibits overt investigative acts, one of the people said.
	In a statement released by the president-elect's transition office, Hunter Biden said he learned about the investigation on Tuesday, but he did not disclose specifics about what was being scrutinized.
	""I take this matter very seriously but I am confident that a professional and objective review of these matters will demonstrate that I handled my affairs legally and appropriately, including with the benefit of professional tax advisors,"" he said in a statement.
	He has long been a target of President Donald Trump and his allies, who have accused him of profiting off his political connections. Trump and his supporters also raised unsubstantiated charges of corruption related to Hunter Biden's work in Ukraine at the time his father was vice-president and leading the Obama administration's dealings with the Eastern European nation.
	Late Wednesday, Trump tweeted a quote from New York Post columnist Miranda Devine claiming, ""10% of voters would have changed their vote if they knew about Hunter Biden.""
			â10% of voters would have changed their vote if they knew about Hunter Biden.â Miranda Devine @nypost @TuckerCarlson But I won anyway!
	The disclosure of the federal investigation, led by the U.S. attorney's office in Delaware, comes at an awkward moment for the incoming president, who is assembling his Cabinet. His pick for attorney general could have oversight of the investigation into the new president's son if it is still ongoing when Biden is sworn in on Jan. 20.
	The transition team said in a statement, ""President-elect Biden is deeply proud of his son, who has fought through difficult challenges, including the vicious personal attacks of recent months, only to emerge stronger.""
	It could also add weight to Trump's broad accusations that Biden was weak on China. Trump took a tough line on China during the campaign as he tried to deflect blame for the coronavirus. Biden has rejected the characterization that he was weak and said, that unlike Trump, he would rebuild global coalitions to check China's power.
	A New Yorker profile on Hunter Biden last year detailed some of his business work in China, including how he accompanied his father on a 2013 trip to Beijing, where he met with a business associate. He also acknowledged having received a diamond from a Chinese energy tycoon involved in liquified natural gas projects. He downplayed the idea that the gift could have been intended to affect his father's policy. He told the magazine that he gave the diamond to an associate.
	""What would they be bribing me for? My dad wasn't in office,"" he said.
	Hunter Biden has been caught up in controversies before. While his father was vice-president, Hunter joined the Naval Reserve and was discharged after testing positive for cocaine in his system, later revealing a yearslong struggle with addiction.
	He also joined the board of Ukrainian energy company Burisma in 2014, sparking concerns about the perceptions of a conflict of interest given the elder Biden was deeply involved in U.S. policy toward Ukraine. An investigation by the Republican-led Senate did not identify any policies that were directly affected by Hunter Biden's work.
	In the weeks before the election, Trump supporters used the existence of a laptop they said was connected to Hunter Biden -- and the emergence of someone who maintains he had business discussions with him -- to raise questions about Joe Biden's knowledge of his son's activities in Ukraine and China. The president-elect has said he did not discuss his son's international business dealings with him and has denied having ever taken money from a foreign country.
	The laptop surfaced publicly in October when The New York Post reported on emails that it said had come from Hunter Biden's laptop and that it said it received from Rudy Giuliani, Trump's personal lawyer.
	A third person familiar with the matter said the tax investigation does not have anything to do with the laptop. Like the other people who spoke to the AP, the person was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.
	In a CNN interview last week, President-elect Biden addressed the business dealings of his son Hunter and his brothers, pledging that they would avoid any perceived conflicts of interest during his time in office.
	""My son, my family will not be involved in any business, any enterprise that is in conflict with or appears to be in conflict, where there's appropriate distance from the presidency and government,"" Biden said.

              Ang Lee on 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' 20 years later
          
","
              Twenty years later, the exhilarating grace of Ang Lee's martial-arts masterwork 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' is just as breathtaking.
        ","
                  Wednesday, Dec. 9, 2020
                ",https://www.ctvnews.ca/entertainment/ang-lee-on-crouching-tiger-hidden-dragon-20-years-later-1.5223863,"NEW YORK -- 
	It's physically impossible to get to the forest scene atop the slender bamboo trees in ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" and not say out loud ""Whoa.""
	Twenty years later, the exhilarating grace of Ang Lee's martial-arts masterwork is just as breathtaking. The way figures glide across the water. The extraordinary lightness of it. Its craft and choreography are only further evidence of a mantra uttered in the film: ""A sword by itself rules nothing. It only comes alive in skilled hands.""
	Take that scene, where Chow Yun-fat and Zhang Ziyi clash in a dance across bamboo stalks. Asked what he remembers about shooting the scene, Lee doesn't hesitate: The sweating. Not from heat but from the stress of suspending a few of Asia's biggest movie stars high in the air, held aloft by cranes over a valley.
	""You use very heavy ways to imitate lightness,"" Lee says. ""Each actor hanging up there, you need 30 people down on the ground mimicking how the bamboo swings in the wind. I probably did about a third of what I wanted to do. The way you dream about a movie, it's very difficult to make real.""
	Tuesday marked the 20th anniversary of the release of ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon,"" an occasion being celebrated with a new limited-edition 4K UHD Blu-ray. It remains a movie unlike any other. An international co-production filmed in China and shot in Mandarin, it still ranks, easily, as the most successful non-English language film ever in the U.S. The $17-million movie grossed $128.1 million in North America.
	Arguably more than any other film, ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon"" opened mainstream American moviegoers not just to a new genre known predominantly in Asia -- the wuxia tradition -- but to subtitled films. It set another record with 10 Academy Awards nominations, a mark since equaled by ""Roma"" and ""Parasite."" ""Crouching Tiger"" took home four Oscars.
	Did Lee feel that when Bong Joon Ho's ""Parasite"" became the first non-English language best-picture winner in February that he had helped pave the way?
	""Yeah, I did,"" says Lee, laughing. ""I wouldn't say it happened because of me. But as people paved the way for me, I paved the way for that movie. And that movie paved the way for future moviemakers and goers. We're a community. We're all part of a history.""
	""Crouching Tiger"" is poised between worlds. Its elegantly choreographed action scenes have the meter of poetry. Its conflicts between duty and freedom, master and disciple take on soulful dimensions -- particularly in the scenes with the film's antagonist: the rebellious Jen Yu (Zhang), a commanding figure of feminist fury and empowerment who at the time drew comparisons to Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Twenty years later, she still feels like a brilliant outlier in a male-dominated genre.
	The film is a fusion of East and West, of Asian film history and Hollywood, of action movie and art house. Lee and writer-producer James Schamus -- who together adapted Jane Austen in 1995 -- took to referring to it as ""`Sense and Sensibility' with martial arts."" Over five months of prep and a five-month shoot across China, Lee agonized over the delicate balance of ""Crouching Tiger.""
	""Halfway through our difficulties, I remember thinking this is a B-movie, supposedly. I'm fighting the genre, trying to make a great movie,"" Lee says. ""I didn't have experience in martial arts. It's a very special skill and cinematic sense, which I learned from the Hong Kong crew -- the choreographer Yuen Wo-ping and the cinematographer Peter Pau. I learned so much about moviemaking. Not just about action, but about the essence of the medium.""
	Every project tends to become all-consuming for Lee, the protean director of ""Life of Pi,"" ""Brokeback Mountain"" and ""The Ice Storm."" ""Sometimes it feels like every movie is a lifetime,"" he says, chuckling. But he considers ""Crouching Tiger"" his most difficult film. Not just for the technical challenges but because of the pressure he put on himself to capture the cinema of his youth.
	""It was the toughest movie and the toughest part of my life. Making a film in China in 1998, 1999 was pretty impossible. Usually in martial arts films, you just focus on fighting scenes,"" Lee says. ""I still wanted good fighting scenes. I also wanted a good art department, historical look, acting. I was just too greedy. It was kind of my childhood fantasy. I joke that it's a childhood fantasy and midlife crisis all clenched together.""
	But that's also what Lee ascribes the film's success to: its sense of childlike wonderment.
	""What I think people respond to is the innocence,"" Lee says. ""Putting yourself in an unknown situation, somehow you have a better chance to find that innocence. It's the reason we go to the theatre.""
	In recent years, Lee has remade himself as a digital convert, in pursuit of a new kind of cinema -- ""which I have not found,"" he adds, laughing -- that includes high frame rate, 3-D and other innovations that he believes are the future of film. While some of the results have been fascinating, his forays into digital -- 2019's ""Gemini Man,"" 2016's ""Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk"" -- haven't been received well. Lee says he's still brooding, still curious.
	""I don't want to give up just yet,"" Lee says. ""The movie gods have been very great to me. As long as I can, I'll do my service -- whether digitally or if someday I go back to making something on a flat screen. But I think the way I view things has changed, and I have to be honest with that. At the end of the day, honesty is very important. You might get blamed for it, you might fail, but a part of you has to keep honest and fresh. I just hope the whole career is like a never-ending film school."""

              French army gets ethical go-ahead for bionic soldiers

	The French armed forces now have permission to develop ""augmented soldiers"" following a report from a military ethics committee.
	The report, released to the public on Tuesday, considers medical treatments, prosthetics and implants that improve ""physical, cognitive, perceptive and psychological capacities,"" and could allow for location tracking or connectivity with weapons systems and other soldiers.
	Other possible interventions considered by the armed forces ethics committee include medical treatments to prevent pain, stress and fatigue, and substances that would improve mental resilience if a soldier were taken prisoner.
	The committee said that France needs to maintain ""operational superiority of its armed forces in a challenging strategic context"" while respecting the rules governing the military, humanitarian law and the ""fundamental values of our society.""
	As a result, it has forbidden any modification that would affect a soldier's ability to manage the use of force or affect their sense of ""humanity.""
	Further examples of banned modifications include cognitive implants that would affect the exercise of a soldier's free will, or changes that would affect their reintegration into civilian life.
	Armed forces minister Florence Parly said ""invasive"" augmentations such as implants are not currently part of military plans.
	""But we have to be clear, not everyone has the same scruples as us and we have to prepare ourselves for such a future,"" she said in a press release published Tuesday.
	Parly did, however, leave the door open to future changes in policy.
	""It's an opinion which isn't set in stone and will be regularly reassessed in the light of future developments,"" she said.
	The defense ethics committee was created at the end of 2019 and consists of 18 people from a variety of fields. It is tasked with providing clarity on ethical questions raised by the potential military applications of scientific and technological innovations, according to the press release.
	The release of the report follows an opinion column from John Ratcliffe, U.S. Director of National Intelligence, in the Wall Street Journal, in which he raised concerns about China's threat to the U.S. and world democracy, as well as its plans for military technology.
	""U.S. intelligence shows that China has even conducted human testing on members of the People's Liberation Army in hope of developing soldiers with biologically enhanced capabilities,"" Ratcliffe wrote.
	""There are no ethical boundaries to Beijing's pursuit of power.""
	China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs slammed the op-ed and called on ""some politicians on the U.S. side"" to ""to stop producing and spreading political viruses and lies.""
	In 2016, CNN reported that the U.S. military was spending millions on an advanced implant that would allow a human brain to communicate directly with computers.
	The Pentagon's research arm, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), hopes the implant will allow humans to interface directly with computers, which could benefit people with aural and visual disabilities, such as veterans injured in combat."

              Pandemic putting democracy under threat: study

              More than six in 10 countries around the world have adopted measures during the COVID-19 pandemic that threaten democracy or human rights, a report by democracy institute International IDEA said Wednesday.

	More than six in 10 countries around the world have adopted measures during the COVID-19 pandemic that threaten democracy or human rights, a report by democracy institute International IDEA said Wednesday.
The study, which examined the situation in almost all countries of the world, concluded that 61 percent of nations ""implemented restrictions that were either illegal, disproportionate, indefinite or unnecessary"" in at least one area of democratic freedoms.
	Among countries widely considered democracies, 43 per cent fell into this category, a figure that rose to 90 per cent for authoritarian regimes, according to the Stockholm-based intergovernmental organisation.
	""It was to be expected that authoritarian regimes that had less checks and balances would use the excuse provided by the pandemic to tighten their grip,"" secretary general Kevin Casas-Zamora told AFP.
	""What is more surprising is that so many democracies have adopted measures that are problematic from the standpoint of democracy and human rights.""
	India, a democratic country, held the unenviable top spot, with measures of ""concern"" in nine of 22 areas studied -- including freedom of movement, freedom of expression and freedom of the press -- ahead of Algeria and Bangladesh with eight areas of concern.
	They were followed by China, Egypt, Malaysia and Cuba, which each had seven.
	Russia was the top European nation with six, a score shared by Saudi Arabia, Myanmar, Jordan, Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe.
	IDEA examined the various measures adopted around the world to determine if they were problematic from a democracy and human rights standpoint, regardless of effectiveness from a health perspective.
	Along with India, Malaysia, Myanmar, Sri Lanka and Iraq -- all considered democracies, albeit some of them ""fragile"" -- were among the top 15 countries with the worst records.
	""The pandemic is an accelerator of trends that were in place before the virus struck,"" Casas-Zamora said.
	""Countries that were highly authoritarian in most cases have become more authoritarian, (while) democracies that were facing real challenges in their ability to uphold the rule of law and basic human rights have seen those challenges worsen,"" he added.
	UN human rights chief Michelle Bachelet meanwhile echoed that notion on Wednesday, warning that the coronavirus crisis had laid bare weaknesses and divisions within societies, including a destructive failure to respect basic rights.
	""COVID-19 has zeroed in on the fissures and fragilities in our societies, exposing all our failures to invest in building fair and equitable societies,"" Bachelet told reporters in Geneva.
	""It has shown the weakness of systems that have failed to place a central focus on upholding human rights,"" she said.
	Among the major Western democracies, only the United States was singled out, with two areas of concern: ""freedom of association and assembly"", and ""predictable enforcement.""
	Israel had five areas of concern and Argentina two.
	Five European Union countries were mentioned: Bulgaria with three areas of concern, Hungary (two) and Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia (one each).
	Among the most frequent concerns were restrictions on press freedoms in the name of fighting disinformation, excessive use of force such as deploying troops to enforce rules or internment camps for the sick, corruption in emergency supplier contracts, and blaming migrants for the pandemic.
	The study also praised several countries as role models for having combined effective health measures with a respect for democratic principles.
	They were Iceland, Finland, New Zealand, Norway, South Korea, Taiwan, Uruguay, Cyprus, Japan, Senegal and Sierra Leone.
	France, Italy, Canada, Germany, Britain and Spain were not mentioned among the top performers, but did not present any concerns either.
	IDEA refuted the idea that undemocratic nations had done better at containing the new coronavirus.
	Havana's and Beijing's apparent success in fighting the virus ""has been achieved at a high democracy and human rights cost,"" the report noted.
	IDEA said its conclusions were based on global observations of the impact of COVID-19 on democracy, launched in July with the European Commission.
	According to the institute, 55 per cent of the world's population currently live in a democracy. In the 162 countries assessed, it counted 99 democracies, 33 authoritarian governments and 30 ""hybrid"" governments."

              Why did Mount Everest's height change?

China and Nepal agreed this week on a new standard height for Mount Everest, the rugged Himalayan peak that straddles their border.
        ","

	The world's highest mountain is now officially a little higher, and that might not be the end of the story.
	China and Nepal agreed this week on a new standard height for Mount Everest, the rugged Himalayan peak that straddles their border.
	As definitive as that sounds, geological changes, the complicated business of measuring a mountain and varying criteria for determining the world's highest peak will likely ensure the question isn't settled for good.
	The mountain's height changes. The movement of tectonic plates can lift it up ever so gradually, while earthquakes can bring it down.
	The countervailing forces may help maintain a degree of stability over time, said Dang Yamin, a member of a Chinese team that surveyed Everest's height earlier this year.
	""Nature tends to strike a balance,"" he told the official Xinhua News Agency. As an example, Dang cited a massive 1934 earthquake that wiped out 150 years of steady height increase in a few moments.
	There's more than one way to measure a mountain.
	Last year, a Nepalese team set up a satellite navigation marker on Everest's peak to gauge its exact position via GPS satellites. A Chinese team undertook a similar mission this spring, though it used the Chinese-made Beidou constellation of navigation satellites, along with other equipment.
	At the same time, Nepalese crews took measurements with modern, laser-equipped versions of instruments called theodolites, first used to gauge the mountain's height in 1856 by measuring angles using trigonometry.
	The Nepalese team also used ground penetrating radar to measure the amount of snow and ice that sits on top of its highest rock.
	China and Nepal jointly presented a new official figure of 8,848.86 metres (29,031.69 feet) above sea level. The two had diverged for years over the mountain's actual height.
	The new height is 0.86 metres (more than 2 feet) above the higher of the countries' two previous figures, that given by Nepal. The agreement announced Tuesday was heralded as a sign of the growing political, economic and cultural ties between them.
	Measuring the height above sea level has always been tricky because ocean levels vary considerably depending on tides, magnetism and other factors. Rising sea levels are creating another factor for future measurements.
	How high above sea level is just one way of measuring a mountain's height. One reason Everest wins the prize is that its base sits high up on already lofty foothills.
	As measured from the Earth's core, Ecuador's Mount Chimborazo is the world's highest, standing more than 2,072 metres (6,800 feet) above Everest. Because the Earth bulges in the middle, mountains along the equator are farther from the core.
	Measuring from the foot of the mountain to the peak, Hawaii's Mauna Kea is the tallest. Most of it, however, is under the sea.
	This story has been corrected to say that the agreement was announced Tuesday, not Wednesday.

	Companies including the Chinese arm of TripAdvisor Inc. have been ordered by regulators to overhaul their mobile phone apps in what the Chinese government said is a crackdown on pornography and other improper content.
	The National Cyberspace Administration ordered the removal of 105 apps including TripAdvisor from app stores this week, although it gave no details of what each app was accused of doing wrong. It cited what it said were public complaints about obscene, pornographic and violent information or fraud, gambling and prostitution.
	The ruling Communist Party tightly controls what the Chinese public sees online and has launched repeated crackdowns on websites and apps.
	TripAdvisor China, a joint venture between TripAdvisor and its Chinese partner Trip.com, did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.
	Following the removal of its app in China, Nasdaq-listed TripAdvisor's stock price was down 1.68% to $29.59 at the market's close in the U.S. on Tuesday.
	TripAdvisor owns a 40% stake in TripAdvisor China, with Trip.com owning the other 60%. Under the partnership, the companies share its travel inventories and content.

	Taiwanese authorities have slapped a US$3,500 fine on a man who broke quarantine regulations for just eight seconds.
	The man, a migrant worker from the Philippines, was quarantining in a hotel in Kaohsiung City when he briefly stepped out of his room into the hallway, the city's Department of Health told Taiwan's official Central News Agency (CNA).
	The man was caught on CCTV by hotel staff, who contacted the Department of Health, CNA reported. The department fined him 100,000 Taiwan dollars -- around $3,500.Â 
	Under Taiwan's quarantine rules people are not allowed to leave their rooms, no matter for how long.
	People in quarantine should not think they won't be fined for leaving their hotel room, the Department of Health said, according to CNA.
	There are 56 quarantine hotels in Kaohsiung City, with a total of around 3,000 rooms, the department told CNA.
	CNN has contacted the department for comment.
	Taiwan has been widely lauded for its approach to containing the COVID-19 pandemic. It has never had to enact strict lockdowns, nor did it resort to drastic restrictions on civil freedoms, like in mainland China.
	Instead, Taiwan's response focused on speed. Taiwanese authorities began screening passengers on direct flights from Wuhan, where the virus was first identified, on December 31, 2019 -- back when the virus was mostly the subject of rumors and limited reporting.
	The government also invested in mass testing and quick and effective contact tracing.
	The island of 23 million people has recorded just 716 coronavirus cases and seven deaths, according to data from Johns Hopkins University."

              UAE says Chinese vaccine 86 per cent effective, offers few details
          
","
              The United Arab Emirates said Wednesday a Chinese coronavirus vaccine tested in the federation of sheikhdoms is 86 per cent effective, in a statement that provided few details but marked the first public release of information on the efficacy of the shot.

	The United Arab Emirates said Wednesday a Chinese coronavirus vaccine tested in the federation of sheikhdoms is 86 per cent effective, in a statement that provided few details but marked the first public release of information on the efficacy of the shot.
	The announcement brought yet another shot into the worldwide race for a vaccine to end the pandemic, a scientific effort that has seen China and Russia compete with Western firms for an effective inoculation. While questions remain about the Sinopharm shot, already at least one country outside China plans to roll it out in a mass-vaccination campaign.
	The UAE, home to Dubai and Abu Dhabi, conducted a trial beginning in September of the vaccine by Chinese state-owned pharmaceutical giant Sinopharm involving 31,000 volunteers from 125 nations. Volunteers between 18 and 60 years old received two doses of the vaccine over 28 days.
	The UAE's Health and Prevention Ministry announced the results via a statement on the state-run WAM news agency, saying they ""have reviewed Sinopharm CNBG's interim analysis of the Phase III trials.""
	""The analysis shows no serious safety concerns,"" the statement said, without detailing whether any participant suffered side effects.
	It wasn't immediately clear if the announced results included only those taking part in the testing in the UAE or if they also include results from China and elsewhere. The statement described the vaccine as receiving ""official registration"" without elaborating on what that meant.
	Emirati officials and Sinopharm did not respond to questions from The Associated Press.
	However, calls Wednesday to SEHA, the Abu Dhabi health authority, included an option for individuals to schedule an appointment to receive a ""COVID-19 vaccine."" The centre was swamped with calls following the announcement on the vaccine's efficacy.
	The Sinopharm vaccine has been approved for emergency use in a few countries and the company is still conducting late-stage clinical trials in 10 countries. Morocco is gearing up for an ambitious COVID-19 vaccination program, aiming to vaccinate 80 per cent of its adults in an operation starting this month that's relying initially on the Sinopharm vaccine.
	Sinopharm's shot relies on a tested technology, using a killed virus to deliver the vaccine, similar to how polio immunizations are made. Leading Western competitors, like the shot made by Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech, use newer, less-proven technology to target the coronavirus' spike protein using RNA. The United Kingdom already has begun vaccinating people with the Pfizer shot.
	Top officials in the UAE, including Dubai's ruler, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, have publicly receive the shots as part of the vaccine testing.
	Already, Pfizer reports its shot as being 95 per cent effective, while another RNA candidate from Moderna appears to be 94.5 per cent effective. Results suggest a third vaccine from Oxford University and AstraZeneca is safe and about 70 per cent effective, but questions remain about how well it may help protect those over 55.
	In transport, the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines must remain at cold temperatures -- negative 70 degrees Celsius (negative 94 degree Fahrenheit) and negative 20 degrees Celsius (negative 4 degrees Fahrenheit), respectively.
	The Sinopharm vaccine is believed to be able to travel at a temperature of 2 to 8 degrees Celsius (35 to 46 degrees Fahrenheit), a major draw for areas of the world where nearly 3 billion people live without stable electricity and refrigeration. In November, the Communist Party secretary for Sinopharm said almost 1 million people in China had received its vaccine.
	Meanwhile Wednesday, Abu Dhabi announced it would resume ""all economic, tourism, cultural and entertainment activities in the emirate within two weeks."" It attributed the decision to ""successes"" in halting the spread of the coronavirus.
	Abu Dhabi has required those travelling into the emirate from the UAE's other six sheikhdoms to take a coronavirus test within 48 hours prior to arrival.
	Since the pandemic began, the UAE has detected over 178,000 cases of the virus, with 160,000 recoveries and nearly 600 deaths. Its aggressive testing policy has seen over 17 million tests conducted in a country home to just over 9 million people.
	In Iran, meanwhile, President Hassan Rouhani angrily blamed U.S. sanctions for making it difficult for Tehran to purchase medicine and health supplies amid the pandemic.
	And in Israel, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu welcomed the first shipment of doses of the Pfizer vaccine, calling it a ""big day of celebration"" for the country.
	""I believe in this vaccine. I expect it will receive the appropriate approval in the coming days,"" Netanyahu said, adding that he intended to be the first to receive it. ""We see the end of the pandemic.""

              Kim's sister slams Seoul over questioning zero-virus claim

	The influential sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un lambasted South Korea's foreign minister for questioning the North's claim to be coronavirus free, warning Wednesday of potential consequences for the comments.
	South Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha said over the weekend that it's hard to believe North Korea's claim that there has been no virus outbreak on its soil. She added that the North has been unresponsive to South Korea's offer for co-operation to jointly tackle the pandemic.
	The North Korean leader's sister, Kim Yo Jong, responded in a statement carried by state media.
	""It can be seen from the reckless remarks made by her without any consideration of the consequences that she is too eager to further chill the frozen relations between North and South Korea,"" she said.
	""Her real intention is very clear. We will never forget her words and she might have to pay dearly for it,"" Kim said.
	The remarks show how sensitive North Korea is to what it considers any outside attempt to tarnish its image as its guards against the pandemic and the economic fallout.
	Despite its zero-virus case claim, North Korea's state media have repeatedly said there is a ""maximum emergency"" anti-epidemic campaign in which it has closed its international borders, flown out diplomats and isolated residents with suspected symptoms.
	The North's border closure with China, it's biggest trading partner, is wrecking its already fragile economy. The North has admitted it's facing ""multiple crises"" due to the pandemic, a spate of natural disasters last summer and persistent U.S.-led sanctions imposed over its nuclear program.
	Experts have said a major disease outbreak in North Korea could cause a humanitarian disaster because of its fragile health care system.
	South Korea's foreign minister told a forum in Bahrain on Saturday that the pandemic had ""made North Korea more North Korea -- that is, more closed, very top-down decision-making process where there is very little debate on their measures in dealing with COVID-19.""
	""They still say they do not have any cases, which is hard to believe,"" Kang said. ""So, all signs are the regime is very intensely focused on controlling the disease that they say they do not have.""
	Also this week, U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Stephen Biegun is in Seoul for talks on North Korea and other issues.
	South Korea's spy agency recently told lawmakers that Kim Jong Un had ordered diplomats overseas to refrain from any acts that could provoke Washington because it is worried about President-elect Joe Biden's expected new approach toward North Korea.
	Some observers say North Korea could still do something provocative to try to draw Biden's attention and create the need to restart stalled nuclear talks in which it could win concessions."

	Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor are physically and mentally well and showing inspiring resilience as they near the end of their second year of imprisonment by the People's Republic, says Canada's ambassador to China.
	Dominic Barton also says Chinese authorities were paranoid about containing the spread of COVID-19 as they denied consular access to the two men from January to October.
	""Our understanding of why it was the case is that the Chinese are completely paranoid about the virus,"" Barton said in testimony Tuesday night before the House of Commons special committee on Canada-China relations.
	Barton is leading Canada's efforts in China to win the release of Kovrig and Spavor, who were arrested and imprisoned on Dec. 10, 2018, in what is widely seen as retaliation for Canada's arrest of Chinese high-tech executive Meng Wanzhou.
	After months of delay, Barton was most recently granted on-site virtual consular access to Kovrig and Spavor in November, following similar virtual visits with the two Canadians a month earlier.
	""We were obviously very frustrated at not being able to get access even virtually because as far as we know . . . the virus doesn't go through televisions,"" said Barton.
	The Chinese government has charged Kovrig and Spavor with espionage but the Canadian government says their detention is arbitrary and has called repeatedly for their release.
	Barton said it wasn't just Canada that was blocked by the Chinese from visiting prisoners charged in national security cases; the U.S. and Britain faced similar restrictions.
	When Barton was able to see them, he said he was able to verify they were in good physical and mental condition.
	""They are robust,"" said Barton, who was testifying from Beijing via video link. ""You would be very impressed by seeing both of them.""
	Spavor is being held in a prison in the city of Dandong near the North Korean border while Kovrig is in a Beijing area prison.
	""It's a strange thing. We fly to these places, or drive to them in the case of Beijing. And I know that the Michaels (are) literally sort of on the other side of the wall, but you've got, you know, two big TVs,"" he said. ""It's like this.""
	Barton's main purpose for testifying was to describe the three-day Chinese government-controlled visit to Tibet that he and nine other Western diplomats undertook in October. He said he remains concerned about the human rights situation there and that they only saw what the Chinese wanted them to see.
	Even though the area is filled with security cameras, as is the capital of Beijing, Barton said he wandered off a couple of times to visit with locals without his Chinese government minders in tow.
	He said Canada is not reluctant to raise human rights concerns with China even though some people think Canada is in the Chinese ""doghouse"" these days. He also said that even though he knew the visit to Tibet would be controlled, it sent a signal to local people that the outside world still cared about their plight.
	Thursday marked Barton's second appearance before the committee this year, following testimony in February in which he declared ""the chill is real"" in Canadian relations with China.
	In February, Barton described an angry, emotional meeting during his first diplomatic contact with his Chinese counterparts after being appointed to the post in 2019 after a long career in business, which included being the global managing director of the consulting giant McKinsey & Co.
	His position in the company gave Barton high level access in China and across Asia, something the Trudeau government is hoping to leverage to win freedom for Kovrig and Spavor while maintaining economic relations with its second largest trading partner.

	A federal judge has blocked U.S. President Donald Trump's attempts to ban TikTok, the latest legal defeat for the administration as it tries to wrest the popular app from its Chinese owners.
	The Trump administration had tried to ban the short-form video app from smartphone app stores in the U.S. and cut it off from vital technical services. TikTok sued, arguing such actions would violate free speech and due process rights.
	Judge Carl Nichols of the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., said in a ruling Monday that the Commerce Department ""likely overstepped"" its use of presidential emergency powers ""and acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner by failing to consider obvious alternatives.""
	Nichols is the second federal judge to fully block the Trump administration's economic sanctions against the app as the court cases proceed.
	The Trump administration has alleged that TikTok is a security threat because the Chinese government could spy on app users' personal data. TikTok has denied it's a security threat but said it's still trying to work with the administration to resolve its concerns.
	Trump in September gave his tentative blessing to a proposal by ByteDance, the Chinese company that owns TikTok, meant to resolve U.S. national security concerns by having the U.S. companies Oracle and Walmart invest in TikTok. Oracle would manage U.S. user data under the arrangement. But a federal agency still has to review and finalize an arrangement.
	A government deadline for ByteDance to complete the deal passed on Friday, and it's not clear what the status of the agreement is.
	The Treasury Department, which chairs the agency reviewing the deal, said Friday that the agency ""is engaging with ByteDance to complete the divestment and other steps necessary to resolve the national security risks arising from the transaction.""
	The Trump administration's aggressive tactics are part of its latest attempt to counter the influence of China. Since taking office in 2017, Trump has waged a trade war with China, blocked mergers involving Chinese companies and stifled the business of Chinese firms like Huawei, a maker of phones and telecom equipment.
	While President-elect Joe Biden has said TikTok is a concern, it's not clear what his administration will carry on the Trump administration's ongoing attempts to secure a ban, or increase the involvement of U.S. companies."

              The day soccer dyed: Chinese match off because 'hair not black enough'

	A women's university soccer match in China descended into farce and was eventually called off after players were told that they were not allowed to have dyed hair, state media said Tuesday.
	The incident trended on the Twitter-like Weibo, angering many people, and comes after the men's national team were ordered to cover up their tattoos.
	The latest high-profile example of the shrinking space for individualism in communist-ruled China came when the women's sides of Fuzhou and Jimei universities met in a college league match in the southeastern province of Fujian.
	The teams were reportedly warned about the ban on dyed hair beforehand but as they were getting ready for the match on November 30 officials spotted that players from both sides had failed to heed the reminder.
	At least one Fuzhou University player was then spotted frantically having her hair dyed again in an attempt to return it to its original colour, but it failed to dry in time, the Beijing News said.
	The newspaper, citing someone at the scene who gave the pseudonym Zhang Zhi, said that some Fuzhou players also ran off to a nearby hair salon to buy black hair dye.
	However, one Fuzhou player was deemed ineligible because her hair was ""still not black enough"" so they were unable to field enough players, consequently forfeiting the match 3-0, the report said.
	Fuzhou University declined to comment when contacted by AFP. However, the China News cited the university as saying that the ban on dyed hair was ""in accordance with relevant regulations"" passed down from the education ministry in Beijing.
	""The relevant documents stipulate that players cannot dye their hair, have weird hairstyles or wear any accessories,"" the official said, adding it was a nationwide edict that had already been in place before the match.
	Many on Weibo were aghast at the ruling and the brouhaha trended on the social media network, racking up more than 400 million views.
	""I thought I was reading North Korean news,"" joked one user on Weibo.
	""Am I really living in the 21st Century?"" asked another.
	President Xi Jinping is a soccer fan and has grand plans to make China a leading country in the world's most popular sport.
	However, soccer has found itself in the crosshairs of the Communist Party's drive for a homogenized society.
	Players on the national team routinely cover their arms with long sleeves or bandages to hide their tattoos.
	Body ink is traditionally frowned upon in China but it is increasingly popular among young adults, even as authorities make plain their disdain for it."

	Shares in China's biggest online health care platform rose 50% in their Hong Kong stock market debut Tuesday, reflecting investor enthusiasm for the fledgling industry as the country emerges from the coronavirus pandemic.
	JD Health, an arm of JD.Com Inc., China's biggest online retailer, sells medications, hospital care packages and online consulting by doctors.
	Chinese internet companies increasingly offer health services in a society where hospitals are crowded and distribution of drugs and medical supplies outside major cities is uneven. Online consulting with Chinese-speaking physicians is popular with families from China who live in the West or other developing countries.
	Other competitors include e-commerce giant Alibaba Group's Alibaba Health; Baidu Health, run by search giant Baidu.com Inc.; and WeDoctor, run by Tencent Holding, operator of the popular WeChat messaging service.
	The coronavirus pandemic has boosted demand for Chinese online platforms.
	Investors have ""high hopes for this kind of companies to develop in China,"" said Jackson Wong, asset management director for Amber Hill Capital Ltd. in Hong Kong.
	The ruling Communist Party has encouraged growth of the industry by authorizing online pharmacies to deliver prescription drugs.
	During the pandemic, patients switched from going online only for urgent care to staying in touch with doctors about chronic conditions, according to industry analyst Kevin Chang of Bain & Co.
	""This new pattern of digital engagements is likely to continue and to increase the frequency of consultations,"" Chang said in a report.
	Consumer spending and business activity have rebounded to above pre-pandemic levels after China, where the pandemic began in December, declared the disease under control in March and eased most controls. Restrictions on travellers coming from abroad still are in place and visitors to public buildings are checked for fever.
	JD Health raised about $3.8 billion by selling 20% of the company to public shareholders.
	It was Hong Kong's second-biggest stock offering this year behind parent JD.Com, which has shares traded in New York and raised $4.5 billion in June when it joined the Hong Kong exchange.
	The ruling party is encouraging use of online health services to reduce the burden on hospitals.
	JD Health said it plans to expand its online pharmacy and develop ""smart healthcare solutions"" supported by artificial intelligence to work with physicians.
	The company says it had 72.5 million active users in June, up 30% over a year earlier.
	The industry might face tougher competition once the coronavirus is brought under control and patients have more offline options, said Wong.
	""If vaccines are very effective and people start going out again, the growth of these online service providers might not be as high,"" said Wong. ""That would be the biggest risk for this kind of company.""

              A year on, markets bustling in Chinese city where COVID-19 emerged
          
","
              Almost a year since the city reported the world's first cases of COVID-19 in one of its handful of vast wet markets, and even as several other countries remain firmly in the grip of the subsequent pandemic, life in Wuhan has largely returned to normal.

	Hundreds of shoppers pack a wet market on a December weekday morning in the Chinese city of Wuhan, jostling to buy fresh vegetables and live fish, frogs and turtles.
	Almost a year since the city reported the world's first cases of COVID-19 in one of its handful of vast wet markets, and even as several other countries remain firmly in the grip of the subsequent pandemic, life in Wuhan has largely returned to normal.
	""I'm not afraid, what is there to be afraid of?"" said Nie Guangzhen, a fish and vegetable vendor.
	Nie and other shop owners along a narrow street, part of the larger wet market, were busily gutting fish for streams of buyers - some not wearing masks - as city cleaners sprayed down the pavements.
	Few hints remain of Wuhan's early role in the coronavirus pandemic, which has since infected more than 67 million people globally, killing around 1.5 million people.
	China first alerted the World Health Organization to 27 cases of ""viral pneumonia"" in Wuhan on Dec. 31. Authorities shut down a wet market in the city the next day, after discovering some patients were vendors or dealers.
	That marked the start of a dark period for the city of 11 million in central China. Infections spiraled quickly to 50,000 cases, including almost 4,000 deaths. Officials responded by swiftly imposing a tough 76-day lockdown, erecting kilometers of thick yellow barricades through the city's deserted streets to keep people at home and businesses closed.
	The measures paid off. Wuhan has not recorded a new locally transmitted case in several months and is now indistinguishable from other Chinese cities with crowded shopping streets, traffic jams and tightly packed restaurants.
	""I really missed these more fun and exciting times, like going out shopping and eating with my friends,"" said 27-year-old shopper Hu Hang on Monday at a packed Wuhan night market selling Christmas sweaters among other goods.
	In the busy street, hawkers sell flowers and balloons, street performers including dancers and a clown perform while music blares from shops lining the road.
	The city's recovery is a sharp contrast to other major economies heading into the Christmas and New year holiday season.
	In the United States, the health system is under severe pressure as cases mount and health officials warn the worst is yet to come. The country recorded 15,000 deaths over the past week, the deadliest seven days of the pandemic since April.
	Several European countries have rolled out tight restrictions on gatherings ahead of Christmas, fearing a return to peak levels of cases because of festive celebrations.
	China's relative success in controlling the virus has become a key talking point in Chinese state media.
	""I haven't been overseas, so I don't understand it well, but looking at the TV it seems like foreign countries don't put human life first,"" said Mr Li, a 54-year old Wuhan street food vendor, who reopened his shop in June. ""The ideology of foreign countries is not as good as that of China.""
	China has taken steps, including mass testing millions of residents following small-scale outbreaks, to prevent a second wave of infections seen in many other cities and countries.
	At the gates of residential compounds, staff in blue tents monitor residents' smartphone health codes. In a public park, slogans on red propaganda banners urge people to remain vigilant.
	Wearing face masks is not mandatory, but most people do so in public.
	And while shoppers have returned to Wuhan's streets, Li and others say business is yet to return fully to normal.
	""The whole situation is not great, it's still a lot worse compared to the last few years,"" Li said, referring to a slump in sales during the time after lockdown when people were too afraid to return to the streets.
	Still, for many residents, lockdown memories have been superseded by the city's swift reopening - alongside new precautions.
	""I don't worry, because I'm doing a good job of protection,"" said wet market vendor Nie, who said she will continue to disinfect and boil her clothes. ""Even if there is a second wave, I will just stick to it.â

	The new height of the world's highest peak is 8,848.86 metres (29,031.7 feet), which is slightly more than Nepal's previous measurement and about four meters (13 feet) higher than China's.
	Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi and his Nepalese counterpart, Pradeep Gyawali, simultaneously pressed buttons during a virtual conference and the new height flashed on the screen.
	The height of Everest, which is on the border between China and Nepal, was agreed on after surveyors from Nepal scaled the peak in 2019 and a Chinese team did the same in 2020.
	There had been debate over the actual height of the peak and concern that it might have shrunk after a major earthquake in 2015. The quake killed 9,000 people, damaged about 1 million structures in Nepal and triggered an avalanche on Everest that killed 19 people at the base camp.
	There was no doubt that Everest would remain the highest peak because the second highest, Mount K2, is only 8,611 metres (28,244 feet) tall.
	Everest's height was first determined by a British team around 1856 as 8,842 metres (29,002) feet.
	But the most accepted height has been 8,848 metres (29,028 feet), which was determined by the Survey of India in 1954.
	In 1999, a National Geographic Society team using GPS technology came up with a height of 8,850 (29,035 feet). A Chinese team in 2005 said it was 8,844.43 metres (29,009 feet) because it did not include the snow cap.
	A Nepal government team of climbers and surveyors scaled Everest in May 2019 and installed GPS and satellite equipment to measure the peak and snow depth on the summit.
	Chinese President Xi Jinping visited Nepal later that year and the leaders of the two countries decided that they should agree on a height.
	A survey team from China then conducted measurements in the spring of 2020 while all other expeditions were cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic.
	Nepal's climbing community welcomed the end of confusion over the mountain's height.
	""This is a milestone in mountaineering history which will finally end the debate over the height and now the world will have one number,"" said Santa Bir Lama, president of the Nepal Mountaineering Association.
	China's official Xinhua New Agency quoted Xi as saying the two sides are committed to jointly protecting the environment around Everest and co-operating in scientific research.
	For China, the announcement appeared to be as much about politics as geography. China has drawn Nepal ever closer into its orbit with investments in its economy and the building of highways, dams, airports and other infrastructure in the impoverished nation.
	That appears to serve China's interests in reducing the influence of rival India, with which it shares a disputed border, and Nepal's role as a destination for refugee Tibetans.
	The Xinhua report said nothing about the technical aspects but heavily emphasized the joint announcement's geopolitical weight.
	China and Nepal will establish an ""even closer community of a shared future to enrich the countries and their peoples,"" Xinhua quoted Xi as saying."

	A nurse rolled up 90-year-old Margaret Keenan's sleeve and administered a shot watched round the world -- the first jab in the U.K.'s COVID-19 vaccination program kicking off an unprecedented global effort to try to end a pandemic that has killed 1.5 million people.
	Keenan, a retired shop clerk from Northern Ireland who celebrates her birthday next week, was at the front of the line at University Hospital Coventry to receive the vaccine that was approved by British regulators last week.
	The U.K. is the first Western country to deliver a broadly tested and independently reviewed vaccine to the general public. The COVID-19 shot was developed by U.S. drugmaker Pfizer and Germany's BioNTech. U.S. and European Union regulators may approve it in the coming days or weeks.
	âAll done?â Keenan asked nurse May Parsons. âAll done,â came the reply, as hospital staff broke into applause and also clapped for her as she was wheeled down a corridor.
	âI feel so privileged to be the first person vaccinated against COVID-19,â said Keenan, who wore a surgical mask and a blue âMerry Christmasâ T-shirt with a cartoon penguin in a Santa hat. âIt's the best early birthday present I could wish for because it means I can finally look forward to spending time with my family and friends in the New Year after being on my own for most of the year.â
	The second injection, in a fitting bit of drama, went to an 81-year-old man named William Shakespeare from Warwickshire, the county where the bard was born.
	The fanfare was good cheer to the nation, if but for a moment. Authorities warned that the vaccination campaign would take many months, meaning painful restrictions that have disrupted daily life and punished the economy are likely to continue until spring. The U.K. has seen over 61,000 deaths in the pandemic - more than any other country in Europe - and has recorded more than 1.7 million confirmed cases.
	âThis really feels like the beginning of the end,? said Stephen Powis, medical director for the National Health Service in England. âIt's been a really dreadful year, 2020 - all those things that we are so used to, meeting friends and family, going to the cinema, have been disrupted. We can get those back. Not tomorrow. Not next week. Not next month. But in the months to come.?
	But it is important beyond these shores. Britain's program is likely to provide lessons for other countries as they prepare for the unprecedented task of vaccinating billions.
	On Saturday, Russia began vaccinations with its Sputnik V vaccine, and China has also begun giving its own domestically made shots to its citizens and selling them abroad. But those are being viewed differently because neither countries' vaccines have finished the late-stage trials scientists consider essential for proving a serum is safe and effective.
	Other vaccines are also being reviewed by regulators around the world, including a collaboration between Oxford University and drugmaker AstraZeneca and one developed by U.S. biotechnology company Moderna.
	Documents released by U.S. regulators Tuesday confirmed that Pfizer's vaccine was strongly protective against COVID-19 and appeared safe. New results on a possible vaccine from Oxford University and drugmaker AstraZeneca suggest it is safe and about 70% effective, according to early test results from Britain and Brazil. But that report, in the medical journal Lancet, showed that questions remain about how well it helps protect those over 55.
	British regulators approved the Pfizer shot Dec. 2, and the country has received 800,000 doses, enough to vaccinate 400,000 people. The first shots are going to people over 80 who are either hospitalized or already have outpatient appointments scheduled, along with nursing home workers and vaccination staff.
	Others must wait, and health officials have said that those who are most at risk from the virus will be vaccinated in the early stages. For most people, it will be next year before there is enough vaccine to expand the program.
	U.K. health officials have worked for months to adapt a system geared toward vaccinating groups like school children and pregnant women into one that can rapidly reach much of the population.
	Questions arose about when the country's most prominent senior couple - Queen Elizabeth II, 94, and her husband, Prince Philip, 99 - would get the vaccine and whether it would happen on camera.
	Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab appeared nonplussed when he was asked about it by NBC.
	âI'm not sure whether they'd do it on camera,â Raab said. âBut I'm sure arrangements will be made according to the phased approach that I set out, and like any family, they would have felt the pressures and all the worries that surround this pandemic as well.â
	The 800,000 doses are only a fraction of what is needed in the U.K. The government is targeting more than 25 million people, or about 40% of the population, in the first phase of its vaccination program, which gives first priority to those at highest risk from the virus.
	The program will be expanded when supply increases, with the vaccine offered roughly on the basis of age groups, starting with the oldest. Britain plans to offer vaccines to everyone over the age of 50, as well as younger adults with health conditions that put them at greater risk.
	In England, the vaccine is being delivered to 50 hospital hubs in the first wave of the program, with more hospitals expected to offer it as the rollout ramps up. Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales are making their own plans under the U.K.'s system of devolved administration.
	Logistical issues are slowing the distribution of the Pfizer vaccine because it has to be stored at minus-70 degrees Celsius (minus-94 degrees Fahrenheit). Authorities are focusing on large-scale distribution points because each package of vaccine contains 975 doses and they don't want any to be wasted.
	The U.K. has agreed to buy more than 350 million doses from seven different producers. Governments around the world are making agreements with multiple developers to ensure they lock in delivery of the products that are ultimately approved for widespread use.
	All these logistical challenges culminated Tuesday in Keenan's vaccination by Parsons, a nurse originally from the Philippines who has worked for the NHS for 24 years.
	âI'm just glad to be able to play a part on this historic day,â she said. âThe last few months have been tough for all of us working in the NHS, but now it feels like there is a light at the end of the tunnel.â"

              Mountie says he updated FBI on Meng arrest, but he was working for the RCMP

	An RCMP officer who was tasked as a point person for U.S. investigators during the 2018 arrest of Meng Wanzhou at Vancouver's airport says he didn't see himself as working for them.
	Sgt. Ross Lundie told the B.C. Supreme Court on Monday that he updated the Federal Bureau of Investigation when the Huawei executive was arrested but he didn't see anything wrong with that.
	""At the end of the day, I'm not there to provide information or act on behalf of the FBI,"" Lundie said. ""I'm there working as an RCMP member.""
	Meng returned to court Monday for the evidentiary hearing in her extradition case after a media report last week said the U.S. Justice Department is discussing a deal in her case.
	The Wall Street Journal reported that American prosecutors were discussing a deferred prosecution agreement with Meng that would see her admit to some level of wrongdoing and allow her to leave Canada.
	Prime Minister Justin Trudeau wouldn't comment on the report Friday, except to say Canada's absolute priority is the safe release of Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, whose arrests in China have been widely linked to Canada's detention of Meng.
	Meng is wanted in the United States on charges of fraud and conspiracy based on allegations that she misrepresented Huawei's relationship with subsidiary Skycom in a 2013 presentation to HSBC, putting the bank at risk of violating U.S. sanctions against Iran.
	Meng and Huawei both deny the allegations.
	There was no mention of the talks in court on Monday as witness testimony resumed.
	Court has heard that Lundie was a senior officer in a satellite RCMP office at Vancouver's airport and had previously worked for a national security team that brought Mounties together with Canada Border Services Agency officers and other investigators.
	He told the court he offered to work on his day off when Meng was arrested to ensure things went smoothly. He suggested the border agency complete its customs and immigration process before the arrest because he didn't want to step on the organization's toes.
	Richard Peck, one of Meng's lawyers, read an email from a senior Mountie that identified Lundie as an RCMP contact for the FBI.
	Lundie agreed that was true but said he never saw himself as a lead on the case, only as assisting the unit tasked with Meng's arrest.
	""Assisting the FBI, given my background and what I'm used to, this is a very uncomfortable position to be in. This is not what we do,"" Lundie said.
	""But you did,"" Peck said.
	Lundie agreed that he communicated with the FBI that day.
	Lundie has testified that in his previous role with the national security team, it was normal to work with other investigative units, but his duties changed when he moved to the Richmond detachment, which operates the satellite office at the airport.
	""I'm in a different role here. I worked for a detachment, so that's different,"" he said.
	Peck asked him if he had any concerns about the information he shared with the FBI.
	""I didn't pass information I shouldn't have.""
	Meng's lawyers are seeking evidence through the hearings to support an abuse of process claim. They allege that the RCMP and border officers conducted a covert criminal investigation at the behest of U.S. authorities under the guise of a routine immigration exam.
	Lundie told the court that during a meeting between the border agency and RCMP officers before Meng's arrest, he spoke about a legal avenue through which the RCMP could request information related to a border exam.
	Peck asked why he would raise a way of sharing information if he had no intention to glean what was learned from the exam.
	""My intent was to tell them not to interfere at all,"" Lundie said.
	The border exam ultimately took almost three hours and Peck asked Lundie if he was concerned by the time it was taking.
	""I understand the optics of it taking as long as it did. It would have been better if it had not. But no, no I didn't,"" Lundie said.
	Peck challenged Lundie on the purpose of the border exam.
	""This exam by the CBSA, I suggest to you, was orchestrated to gain information from her,"" Peck said.
	""No,"" Lundie replied.
	Peck suggested the content of the exam could be shared later through the legal mechanism Lundie raised with officers earlier that day. And the information would be of interest to the FBI, not the RCMP, Peck said.
	""No,"" Lundie said.

              Report shows how New Zealand mosque shooter eluded detection

              A comprehensive report into the 2019 Christchurch mosque shootings in which 51 Muslim worshippers were slaughtered sheds new light on how the gunman was able to elude detection by authorities as he planned out his attack.

                ",https://www.ctvnews.ca/world/report-shows-how-new-zealand-mosque-shooter-eluded-detection-1.5221217,"WELLINGTON, NEW ZEALAND -- 
	A comprehensive report into the 2019 Christchurch mosque shootings in which 51 Muslim worshippers were slaughtered sheds new light on how the gunman was able to elude detection by authorities as he planned out his attack.
	The nearly 800-page Royal Commission of Inquiry report released Tuesday shows that the attacker, Brenton Tarrant, kept a low profile and told nobody of his plans.
	It concludes that despite the shortcomings of various agencies, there were no clear signs the attack was imminent -- aside from the manifesto Tarrant sent out just eight minutes before he began shooting, which came too late for agencies to respond.
	But the report does detail failings in the police system for vetting gun licenses, and says that New Zealand's intelligence agencies were focused on the threat posed by Islamic extremism rather than white supremacists.
	Among 44 recommendations, the report says the government should establish a new national intelligence agency.
	New Zealand currently has one intelligence agency that focuses on domestic threats and one that focuses on international threats. Often those agencies are focused on immediate events like keeping visiting dignitaries safe. The report recommends establishing a new, well-financed intelligence and security agency that's more strategic in nature and can focus on emerging threats and developing a counter-terrorism strategy.
	New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said the government has agreed to implement all of the recommendations and apologized for agency shortcomings.
	Tarrant, who is Australian, was sentenced in August to life in prison without the possibility of parole after pleading guilty to 92 counts of terrorism, murder and attempted murder.
	The report details the extensive world travels of Tarrant but also shows he had almost no meaningful interactions with people in New Zealand because he was introverted and didn't work.
	As a child, Tarrant had unsupervised access to the internet and became interested in video games from the age of six or seven, the report says. He began expressing racist ideas from a young age and told his mother he started using the 4chan internet forum from age 14.
	He put on a lot of weight as a teenager before starting to exercise compulsively at gyms and going on a diet, losing about 50 kilograms (110 pounds). His father Rodney was diagnosed with lung cancer caused by exposure to asbestos and in 2010 killed himself at home, leaving an inheritance of 457,000 Australian dollars ($339,000) to Tarrant.
	The gunman worked for about three years as a personal trainer at a gym in the Australian town of Grafton, but stopped working after an injury and then used his inheritance to live and travel. He visited dozens of countries around the world, including India, China, Russia, North Korea, and many countries in Africa and Europe.
	He moved to New Zealand in 2017 and focused on planning for his attack. The report said he only had superficial interactions with people at a gym and the rifle club where he practiced rapid-fire shooting. Yet when needed, Tarrant could present himself to others in a way that didn't arouse suspicion.
	Tarrant told investigators that although he frequented extreme right-wing discussion boards on websites like 4chan and 8chan, he found YouTube a far more significant source of information and inspiration.
	Ardern said she planned to speak to the leaders at YouTube ""directly"" about how the gunman had become inspired by videos on the site.
	In 2018, Tarrant was treated at Dunedin Hospital for injuries to his right eye and thigh after telling doctors he accidentally fired a gun while cleaning it at his apartment, the report says. He got government compensation for his injury, which wasn't reported to the police. The hospital registrar said the accident appeared to be careless and ""a little unusual"" but otherwise didn't set off alarm bells.
	Health authorities also wrote that Tarrant was taking illicit steroids and injecting testosterone after he was treated for abdominal pain, but they didn't report that to the police either.
	As part of the process for getting a gun license, Tarrant was required to provide to police the names of two referees who could speak to his good character. He gave them the name of a friend he knew mostly online from gaming together, along with that friend's father. Vetting officers interviewed Tarrant and the referees, and recommended he be given his license.
	Police Commissioner Andrew Coster said that in deciding whether Tarrant was ""fit and proper"" to hold a gun license, ""we could have done more to consider whether the two referees knew the individual well enough to serve as referees.""
	The report also found that the New Zealand Security Intelligence Service, the domestic spying agency, had chosen to concentrate scarce counter-terrorism resources on the threat of Islamist extremist terrorism inspired by groups like Islamic State at the expense of other threats.
	Despite the shortcomings of various agencies, the report concludes, there was no plausible way Tarrant's plans could been detected ""except by chance."""

	The European Union on Monday invited U.S. President-elect Joe Biden to help mend tattered trans-Atlantic ties and urged him to join it in a long-term ""strategic dialogue"" that would address global issues ranging from COVID-19 to climate change.
	At talks in Brussels, EU foreign ministers said that Europe's shared interests and historic ties with America make up ""the world's foremost and closest relationship,"" and are a solid foundation for co-operating on economic, foreign policy and human rights challenges.
	""A strong trans-Atlantic partnership is vital to ensure and to contribute to our common security, stability and prosperity,"" the ministers said in a statement.
	Trans-Atlantic ties have eroded over the last four years under President Donald Trump, who slapped tariffs on European exports and pulled the United States out of a number of security agreements that they hold dear, notably the Iran nuclear deal.
	Trump also abandoned the Paris climate change agreement, and has spurned the multilateral approach that is part of the EU's DNA when it comes to bodies like the World Health Organization. As ties have unraveled, Russia and China have become more assertive.
	Looking to put the Trump era behind them, the ministers underlined their ""interest to engage in a regular, comprehensive and strategic political dialogue with the United States, including at the highest level, in order to reach the full potential of the transatlantic partnership. ""
	They said the 27-nation bloc ""stands ready to discuss the strategic direction of all policies of shared interest and looks forward to expanding co-operation with the United States."" They called for fresh efforts to reform international bodies like the World Health Organization and the World Trade Organization, as well as to strengthen global arms treaties.
	""With Joe Biden's election as the new American president, there are a lot of major opportunities that we as Europe want to take,"" said German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas, whose country holds the EU's rotating presidency until the end of the month.
	But Maas conceded that U.S. policy won't change entirely. ""Not everything will be different, but a lot will be better, and we must be clear what part of our responsibility we will take, and where we will co-operate with the United States -- be it in our direct or indirect neighbourhood, in the western Balkans, in eastern Europe, but also in Africa,"" he said.
	EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell, who chaired the meeting, said the aim is to establish ""a new, refreshed start of our engagement with the U.S."" The bloc's leaders will also discuss EU-U.S. relations this week at a two-day summit starting on Thursday, and have been heartened by the positive noises coming from across the Atlantic.
	Lithuanian Foreign Minister Linas Linkevicius said the Biden team, which is set to take office on Jan. 20, appears to be coming in with a ""different attitude, different willingness, readiness to co-ordinate, to act together.""
	""On both sides of the ocean, we have to act with responsibility and with understanding. There is no replacement for trans-Atlantic relations,"" Linkevicius said.

	China's politically sensitive trade surplus soared to a record US$75.4 billion in November as exports surged 21.1% over a year earlier, propelled by American consumer demand.
	Exports to the United States rose 46% despite lingering tariff hikes in a trade war with Washington, customs data showed Monday.
	Total exports rose to $268 billion, accelerating from October's 11.4% growth. Imports gained 5% to $192.6 billion, up from the previous month's 4.7%.
	Chinese exporters have benefited from the economy's relatively early reopening after the Communist Party declared the coronavirus pandemic under control in March while foreign competitors still are hampered by anti-disease controls.
	âExports were much stronger than expected in November,â said Julian Evans-Pritchard of Capital Economics in a report.
	Forecasters say that surge is unlikely to last into 2021 once coronavirus vaccines are rolled out.
	âWe expect export performance to be less impressive,â said Louis Kuijs of Oxford Economics in a report.
	China's global trade surplus for the first 11 months of 2020 is $460 billion, up 21.4% from this time last year, already one of the highest ever recorded.
	Exports to the United States rose to $51.9 billion while imports of American goods gained 33% to $14.6 billion. The trade surplus with the United States swelled 52% over a year earlier to $37.3 billion.
	Beijing promised to buy more American soybeans, natural gas and other exports as part of the âPhase 1â agreement signed in January and aimed at ending a costly tariff battle over Chinese technology ambitions. China fell behind on meeting those commitments earlier in the year but is catching up as demand rebounds.
	The two governments agreed to postpone further planned tariff hikes on each other's goods but most penalties already imposed on billions of dollars of imports stayed in place.
	Chinese imports are growing faster by volume than by value because demand has been chilled by the shutdown of travel and industry, driving prices lower.
	China is on track to become the only major economy to grow this year while activity in the United States, Europe and Japan falls.
	China's economy shrank by 6.8% from a year earlier in the first three months of 2020 after factories, shops and offices were shut down to fight the virus. Growth rebounded to 3.2% in the second quarter and accelerated to 4.9% in the three months ending in September.
	Automakers and other large manufacturers are back to normal activity, helping to drive demand for imported iron ore, copper and other raw materials. Retail sales are back above pre-virus levels and rose 4.3% over a year earlier in October.
	Also in November, exports to the 27-nation European Union rose 8.6% over a year ago to $37.5 billion while imports of European goods gained 4.5% to $26.2 billion. China's trade surplus with Europe widened by 20% to $11.3 billion."

	Chinese vaccine company Sinovac announced Monday that it is planning to complete a new facility to double its annual vaccine production capacity to 600 million doses by the end of the year, while also securing a US$500 million investment in a boost to its COVID-19 vaccine development efforts.
	The company is currently conducting the last stage of clinical trials for its vaccine candidate in Brazil, Turkey and Indonesia and is among the frontrunners of China' s vaccine efforts. China has at least five COVID-19 vaccine candidates running late stage clinical trials across more than a dozen countries.
	Sino Biopharmaceutical Ltd., a pharmaceutical conglomerate, bought a 15% stake in Sinovac for an investment of $500 million. The funds will allow the company to ""improve our vaccine sales capabilities, expand in Asia markets, develop and access new technologies, and most importantly, accelerate our efforts to help combat the global pandemic,"" Sinovac CEO Yin Weidong said in a statement.
	On Sunday, 1.2 million doses of its experimental vaccine arrived in Indonesia and are expected to be approved for use soon.
	Sinovac's candidate is a two-dose inactivated vaccine, an old-school technology in which a live virus is killed and then purified. It can be stored at 2 to 8 C (36 to 46 F), within the range of a normal refrigerator, unlike some other vaccines candidates that require far lower temperatures.
	Sinovac's experimental vaccine is currently approved for emergency use in China, although it has not yet obtained final market approval. Under emergency use, it has been distributed to groups the Chinese government deemed suitable, including front-line medical workers and border personnel.
	The latest public data from the company, published in the science journal Lancet, showed its candidate produced lower levels of antibodies in people than those who have recovered from COVID-19."

              U.S. President Donald Trump's lawyer Rudy Giuliani has tested positive for COVID-19, Trump said on  Sunday, prompting one state legislature to close for a week after Giuliani visited to try to persuade lawmakers to help reverse Trump's election defeat.

	U.S. President Donald Trump's lawyer Rudy Giuliani has tested positive for COVID-19, Trump said on Sunday, prompting one state legislature to close for a week after Giuliani visited to try to persuade lawmakers to help reverse Trump's election defeat.
	The 76-year-old former New York mayor is the latest in a long string of people close to the White House, including Trump himself, sickened in a pandemic that has killed more than 280,000 Americans.
	""@RudyGiuliani, by far the greatest mayor in the history of NYC, and who has been working tirelessly exposing the most corrupt election (by far!) in the history of the USA, has tested positive for the China Virus,"" Trump said, using a term for COVID-19 that has drawn backlash.
	Giuliani tweeted his thanks to ""friends and followers"" Sunday evening for their concern about him. ""I'm getting great care and feeling good. Recovering quickly and keeping up with everything,"" he wrote on Twitter.
	Two sources familiar with the situation told Reuters that Giuliani was at Georgetown University Hospital in Washington, D.C., on Sunday and one said he had been admitted for treatment. The hospital did not immediately respond to requests for confirmation.
	Giuliani has been spearheading Trump's floundering effort to overturn his Nov. 3 election loss to Democratic President-elect Joe Biden through a flurry of lawsuits. Both Trump and Giuliani have repeatedly claimed, contrary to evidence, that the outcome was marred by widespread fraud.
	State and federal officials have repeatedly said there is no evidence of fraud on any significant scale.
	Giuliani visited Georgia on Thursday, where he urged state lawmakers to intervene to overturn Biden's victory in the state, after making similar pleas in Michigan on Wednesday and Arizona on Monday.
	After news of Giuliani's test, the Arizona state legislature said it would close both chambers this week out of caution ""for recent cases and concerns relating to COVID-19."" Giuliani met with about a dozen Republican lawmakers there last week.
	The Trump campaign released a statement from the president's legal team Sunday evening saying Giuliani had tested negative just before his trip to the three states.
	""Mayor Giuliani tested negative twice immediately preceding his trip to Arizona, Michigan, and Georgia. The Mayor did not experience any symptoms or test positive for COVID-19 until more than 48 hours after his return,"" the statement said. ""No legislators in any state or members of the press are on the contact tracing list, under current CDC (Centers for Disease Control) Guidelines.""
	It said other members of the president's legal team ""who are defined as having had close contact"" will follow their doctors' orders and CDC guidelines about self-isolation and testing.
	Trump and many of his close associates have balked at public health officials' advice to wear masks and avoid crowds to stem transmission of the respiratory illness, which has roared to record levels in the United States as winter approaches.
	Giuliani, who developed an international profile as ""America's Mayor"" for his leadership after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, has faced mounting legal troubles during the Trump administration.
	Federal prosecutors in Manhattan have been investigating Giuliani's business dealings in Ukraine, and two associates, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, have been charged with campaign finance violations.
	Giuliani has not been criminally charged and has denied wrongdoing. Parnas and Fruman have pleaded not guilty.

              Chinese probe orbiting moon with Earth-bound samples
          
","
              A Chinese probe was orbiting the moon on Monday in preparation for the returning of samples of the lunar surface to Earth for the first time in almost 45 years.
        ","
                  Sunday, Dec. 6, 2020
                ",https://www.ctvnews.ca/sci-tech/chinese-probe-orbiting-moon-with-earth-bound-samples-1.5219174,"BEIJING -- 
	A Chinese probe was orbiting the moon on Monday in preparation for the returning of samples of the lunar surface to Earth for the first time in almost 45 years.
	The ascent module of the Chang'e 5 spacecraft transferred a container with 2 kilograms (4.4 pounds) of samples after docking with the robot spacecraft on Sunday and was then cut free.
	The orbiter and reentry vehicle will circle the moon for another week awaiting a narrow time window to make the roughly three-day, 383,000-kilometre (238,000-mile) journey back to Earth. It will first ""bounce"" off the Earth's atmosphere to slow its speed before the reentry vehicle separates and floats down on parachutes to land on the vast steppes of Inner Mongolia, where China's Shenzhou crewed spaceships have also made their landings.
	If the mission succeeds, it will make China the third country after the United States and former Soviet Union to bring moon rocks to Earth. They will be the first fresh samples of the lunar surface obtained by scientists since the Soviet Union's Luna 24 probe in 1976.
	The Chang'e 5 ascent stage blasted off from the moon's surface on Friday, leaving behind the lander module flying the Chinese flag, according to the China National Space Agency, which also released a photo taken by the orbiter showing it approaching for its rendezvous with the ascender, a sliver of the Earth seen in the background.
	That marked the first time China had succeeded in lifting off a spacecraft from a celestial body, while no country had previously achieved the tricky feat of executing a robotic docking in lunar orbit. Controllers on Earth had to deal with distance and time lag while precisely manoeuvring a clamp into position with almost no room for error.
	The 23-day mission has been front page news in state media for days, paired with reports that China has officially lifted all of its citizens out of the most grinding form of poverty. Along with being a propaganda coup for the ruling Communist Party, the dual stories illustrate the vast economic and technological advances China has made since it became just the third country in history to launch a person into space in 2003.
	Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying praised the ""courage to explore, overcome difficulties and pay hard efforts"" of those who made the mission possible.
	""The entirety of the Chinese people are proud of the efforts and wisdom of the Chinese lunar exploration researchers,"" Hua told reporters Monday at a daily briefing.
	By way of cautious incremental steps, China is now in the midst of a series of ambitious missions that include a probe en route to Mars and the development of a reusable space plane about which little information has been provided.
	The Chang'e lunar program, named after the ancient Chinese moon goddess, has also been operating the Chang'e 4 probe on the moon's less explored far side for the past two years, while the Chang'e 3 rover launched seven years ago continues to send back data.
	Future plans call for returning a human to the moon five decades after American astronauts, along with a possible permanent moon base, although no timeline has been offered. China is also building a permanent space station to begin operating as early as 2022.
	U.S. opposition has prevented China's secretive, military-backed program from participating in the International Space Station, although the CNSA has been expanding its ties with other programs, including the European Space Agency, which has helped guide Chang'e 5 on its mission.
	Chang'e 5 touched down Dec. 1 on the Sea of Storms on the moon's near side close to a formation called the Mons Rumker, an area believed to have been the site of ancient volcanic activity.
	The rocks and other debris were obtained both by drilling into the moon's crust and by scooping directly off the surface. They are thought to possibly be billions of years younger than those brought back earlier and may offer insights into the moon's history as well as that of other bodies in our solar system.
	The lunar exploration program has set up dedicated labs to analyze the samples for age and composition. China is also expected to share some part of them with other countries, as was done with the hundreds of kilograms (pounds) of rocks, sand, dust and other samples obtained by the U.S. and the former Soviet Union."

              Japanese space officials eager to analyze asteroid samples
          
","
              Japanese space officials said they are excited about the return of a capsule that landed safely in the Australian Outback on Sunday while carrying soil samples from a distant asteroid.
        ","

	Japanese space officials said they are excited about the return of a capsule that landed safely in the Australian Outback on Sunday while carrying soil samples from a distant asteroid, and that they are eager to begin analyzing the ""treasure"" inside.
	The capsule's delivery by Japan's Hayabusa2 spacecraft completes its six-year sample-return mission and opens the door for research into finding clues to the origin of the solar system and life on Earth.
	""We were able to land the treasure box"" onto the sparsely populated Australian desert of Woomera as planned, said Yuichi Tsuda, Hayabusa2 project manager at the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, or JAXA, adding that the capsule was in perfect shape. ""I really look forward to opening it and looking inside.""
	The capsule will be packed in a container as soon as its preliminary treatment at an Australian lab is finished and brought back to Japan this week, Satoru Nakazawa, a project sub-manager, said during an online news conference from Woomera.
	Hayabusa2 left the asteroid Ryugu, about 300 million kilometres (180 million miles) from Earth, a year ago. After it released the capsule on Saturday, it set off on a new expedition to another distant asteroid.
	Tsuda said Hayabusa2's successful completion of its inter-planetary round trip is the world's first and that he hoped to use the expertise gained in future planetary exploration, possibly Japan's MMX mission to Mars' moons beginning in 2024.
	Scientists say they believe the samples, especially ones taken from under the asteroid's surface, contain valuable data unaffected by space radiation and other environmental factors. They are particularly interested in organic materials in the samples to find out how they are distributed in the solar system and related to life on Earth.
	""And then the sample will start to tell its stories and reveal to us some wonderful signs about how water arrived on our Earth and how we even may have been formed, such as our organics, carbon-based animals, humans and plants,"" said Megan Clark, head of the Australian Space Agency, who was also at the news conference.
	The return of the capsule with the world's first asteroid subsurface samples comes weeks after NASA's OSIRIS-REx spacecraft made a successful touch-and-go grab of surface samples from the asteroid Bennu. China, meanwhile, announced recently that its lunar lander collected underground samples and sealed them within the spacecraft for return to Earth, as space developing nations compete in their missions.
	JAXA officials said the Ryugu samples will be handled in clean chambers to avoid any impact on the samples. Initial research is planned in the first six months, and the samples will be distributed to NASA and other key international research groups, with about 40% stored for future technological advancement to resolve unanswered questions.
	More than 70 JAXA staff had been working in Woomera to prepare for the sample return. They set up satellite dishes at several locations in the target area inside the Australian Air Force test field to receive the signals.
	The pan-shaped capsule, about 40 centimetres (15 inches) in diameter, was found inside the planned landing area and retrieved by a helicopter team from JAXA.
	Hayabusa2 released the capsule on Saturday from 220,000 kilometres (136,700 miles) away in space, sending it toward Earth. About 12 hours after the release, the capsule reentered the atmosphere at 120 kilometres (75 miles) away from Earth, seen as a fireball cutting across the night sky.
	For Hayabusa2, it's not the end of the mission. It is now heading to a small asteroid called 1998KY26 on a journey slated to take 11 years one way, for possible research into planetary defence, such as finding ways to prevent meteorites from hitting Earth.
	Since its Dec. 3, 2014, launch, the Hayabusa2 mission has been fully successful. It touched down twice on Ryugu despite the asteroid's extremely rocky surface, and successfully collected data and samples during the 1 1/2 years it spent near Ryugu after arriving there in June 2018.
	In its first touchdown in February 2019, it collected surface dust samples. In a more challenging mission in July that year, it collected underground samples from the asteroid for the first time in space history after landing in a crater that it created earlier by blasting the asteroid's surface.
	Asteroids, which orbit the sun but are much smaller than planets, are among the oldest objects in the solar system and therefore may help explain how Earth evolved.
	Ryugu in Japanese means ""Dragon Palace,"" the name of a sea-bottom castle in a Japanese folk tale.

China prepares large-scale rollout of COVID-19 vaccines
          
","
              Provincial governments across China are placing orders for experimental, domestically made coronavirus vaccines, though health officials have yet to say how well they work or how they may reach the country's 1.4 billion people.
        ","
                  Saturday, Dec. 5, 2020
                ",https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/coronavirus/china-prepares-large-scale-rollout-of-covid-19-vaccines-1.5219102,"TAIPEI, TAIWAN -- 
	Provincial governments across China are placing orders for experimental, domestically made coronavirus vaccines, though health officials have yet to say how well they work or how they may reach the country's 1.4 billion people.
	Developers are speeding up final testing, the Chinese foreign minister said during a UN meeting last week, as Britain approved emergency use of Pfizer Inc.'s vaccine candidate and providers scrambled to set up distribution.
	Even without final approval, more than 1 million health care workers and others in China who are deemed at high risk of infection have received experimental vaccines under emergency use permission. Developers have yet to disclose how effective their vaccines are and possible side effects.
	China's fledgling pharmaceutical industry has at least five vaccines from four producers being tested in more than a dozen countries including Russia, Egypt and Mexico. Health experts say even if they are successful, the certification process for the United States, Europe, Japan and other developed countries might be too complex for them to be used there. However, China said it will ensure the products are affordable for developing countries and has been actively pursuing deals across the world.
	On Sunday, 1.2 million doses of the Chinese company Sinovac's vaccine arrived in Indonesia, the government said.
	""We are very grateful, thank God, the vaccine is now available so that we can immediately curb the spread of the COVID-19 disease,"" President Joko Widodo said.
	Within China, so far only one developer, China National Pharmaceutical Group, known as Sinopharm, said in November it applied for final market approval for use of its vaccine. Others have been approved for emergency use on people deemed at high risk of infection.
	""We must be prepared for large-scale production,"" Vice Premier Sun Chunlan said during a visit Wednesday to developers, according to the official Xinhua News Agency.
	Sun, who has as overseen much of the country's response, visited one of Sinopharm's Beijing subsidiary companies, Sinovac and a research lab under the National Medical Products Administration, a regulatory agency that approves medical products for public use.
	The government has yet to say how many people it plans to vaccinate. Sun said plans call for vaccinating border personnel and other high-risk populations this month.
	The companies are using more traditional techniques than Western developers.
	They say unlike Pfizer's vaccine, which must be kept frozen at temperatures as low as minus 70 degrees Celsius (minus 94 Fahrenheit), theirs can be stored at 2 to 8 C (36 to 46 F). The Chinese producers have yet to say how they might be distributed.
	Health experts question why China is using experimental vaccines on such a vast scale now that the outbreak is largely under control within its borders.
	Health officials previously said China will be able to manufacture 610 million doses by the end of this year and ramp up to 1 billion doses next year.
	The government of Jiangsu province, where the major city of Nanjing is located, issued a procurement notice for vaccines from Sinovac and Sinopharm on Wednesday for emergency use.
	Authorities in Sichuan province in the west, which has about 85 million people, announced Monday they were already buying vaccines. An official newspaper in Anhui province, southeast of Beijing, said a local residential committee issued a notice asking whether residents want a vaccine.
	The Sichuan and Anhui announcements said the vaccine, given in two shots, would cost a total of 400 yuan ($60).
	Vaccines from Sinovac and Sinopharm were approved for emergency use in July.
	In October, Zhejiang province south of Shanghai offered the public vaccination under emergency use authorization. It said people considered high-risk would get priority.
	In November, the Communist Party secretary for Sinopharm said almost 1 million people had received its vaccine.
	In September, Sinovac's CEO said about 3,000 of its employees had taken their vaccine. He said the company provided tens of thousands of doses to the Beijing city government.
	Sinopharm has clinical trials under way in 10 countries including the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Jordan, Peru and Argentina with nearly 60,000 volunteers. It has built two facilities in China capable of producing 200 million doses per year.
	Sinovac has trials in Brazil, Turkey and Indonesia. Its most recent publicized data, a study in the science journal the Lancet, showed its candidate produced lower levels of antibodies in people than those who had recovered from COVID-19. The company projects it will be able to produce a few hundred million doses of the vaccine by February or March of next year.
	Another producer, CanSino, is testing in Russia, Pakistan and Mexico and pursuing partnerships in Latin American countries. Its vaccine, which has been used on an emergency basis with the Chinese military, uses a harmless adenovirus to carry genes into human cells to generate an immune response.
	A fourth company, Anhui Zhifei Longcom Biologic Pharmacy Co., is conducting final stage trials across China.

              A potential return for Meng may not guarantee release of Kovrig, Spavor: experts 
          
","
              If a deal is made and Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou is allowed to go home, will two detained Canadians be released? Experts weigh in on the possibilities.

	Almost two years after Meng Wanzhouâs arrest in Vancouver's airport, the Huawei executive could be heading home soon.
	According to reports from the Wall Street Journal, the United States Department of Justice is ready to make a deal with the telecom giant, offering Meng a deferred prosecution agreement and allow her to return to China in exchange for an admission of wrongdoing in her ongoing criminal case.
	This could be welcome news for Canada, as Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor have been detained in China since Mengâs arrest, in what has widely been seen as retaliation from the Chinese government. Canada has also been subject to trade sanctions on canola, soybean, beef, and pork exports, leading to a 16 per cent decline of exports to China in 2019.
	""If she is returned, it opens the door for releasing the two Canadians, and I think that Ottawa is probably busy speaking with Washington and Beijing to try and make sure the solution will be a triangular one,"" said former Canadian ambassador to China Guy Saint-Jacques.
	However, experts are divided on how soon the Michaels will come home, or if theyâll be released in exchange at all.
	""The idealist in me says perhaps, but the realist says no,"" former diplomat Colin Robertson told CTV News.
	Robertson said this potential deal is only the first step as negotiations with China are always a long process.
	""We look at negotiations through different ends of the telescope and that can lead to misunderstandings,"" he said. ""It can also lead to false optimism, which is I'm afraid we might be encouraging right now.""
	One issue complicating the return of the Michaels is the consistent denial from the Chinese that their detentions were related to Meng's arrest, said Robertson.
	In June, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said at a press conference: ""The Meng Wanzhou incident is in essence difference from the cases of the Canadians.""
	According to Zhao, ""the United States aims to oppress Huawei and other Chinese high-tech companies, and Canada is its accomplice.""
	""This is really between the United States and Ms. Meng,"" said Charles Burton, associate professor at Brock University and MacDonald-Laurier Institute senior fellow.
	""Would the Chinese authorities release Kovrig and Spavor, or would they continue to hold them to continue to exert pressure over Canada with regard to other political matters?""
	Though China has said in the past Meng's release ""could open up space"" to resolve Kovrig and Spavor's detention, the reports of the potential deal so far do not include any guarantees for the Canadians' return.
	""That's why we have to try and get as much undertakings from the Americans if they do decide to proceed down this roadâ¦that the Michaels are part of it,"" said Robertson.
	While it was U.S. President Donald Trump who issued Meng's extradition request, the incoming Biden administration is expected to remain tough on China. Robertson said the Canadian government needs to continue to press the Americans to make sure Kovrig and Spavor aren't forgotten once the Meng affair is resolved.
	""We've been left holding the bag,"" said Robertson.
	""We've been used by the Americans and we've certainly been abused by the Chinese, and the two Michaels are the real victims in this whole tragedy."""

              Trump orders most American troops to leave Somalia
          
","
              The Pentagon said Friday it is pulling most U.S. troops out of Somalia on President Donald Trump's orders, continuing a post-election push by Trump to shrink U.S. involvement in counterterrorism missions abroad.

	The Pentagon said Friday it is pulling most U.S. troops out of Somalia on President Donald Trump's orders, continuing a post-election push by Trump to shrink U.S. involvement in counterterrorism missions abroad.
	Without providing details, the Pentagon said in a short statement that ""a majority"" of U.S. troops and assets in Somalia will be withdrawn in early 2021. There are currently about 700 troops in that Horn of Africa nation, training and advising local forces in an extended fight against the extremist group al-Shabab, an affiliate of al-Qaida.
	Trump recently ordered troop drawdowns in Afghanistan and Iraq, and he was expected to withdraw some or all troops from Somalia. Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, had said on Wednesday that the future structure of the U.S. military presence in Somalia was still in debate.
	The adjusted U.S. presence, Milley said, would amount to ""a relatively small footprint, relatively low cost in terms of number of personnel and in terms of money."" He provided no specifics but stressed that the U.S. remained concerned about the threat posed by al-Shabab, which he called ""an extension of al-Qaida,"" the extremist group that planned the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States from Afghanistan.
	""They do have some reach and they could if left unattended conduct operations against not only U.S. interests in the region but also against the homeland,"" he said. ""So they require attention."" Noting that Somalia remains a dangerous place for Americans, he said that a CIA officer was killed there recently.
	The acting secretary of defence, Christopher Miller, made a brief visit to Somalia last week and met with U.S. troops.
	Depending on what remains of the U.S. presence in Somalia when he takes office Jan. 20, President-elect Joe Biden could reverse Trump's drawdown or make other adjustments to reflect his counterterrorism priorities. The U.S. military also has a presence in neighbouring Djibouti on the Bab al-Mandab Strait.
	Rep. Jim Langevin, a Rhode Island Democrat, criticized the Trump pullback in Somalia as a ""surrender to al-Qaida and a gift of China."" Langevin is chairman of the House Armed Services Committee's Intelligence and Emerging Threats and Capabilities Subcommittee.
	""When U.S. forces leave Somalia in response to today's order, it becomes harder for diplomats and aid workers to help people resolve conflicts without violence and loss of life,"" Langevin said. ""With upcoming elections in Somalia and conflict raging in neighbouring Ethiopia, abandoning our partners could not come at a worse time.""
	Langevin said China will use the opportunity to build its influence in the Horn of Africa.
	The Pentagon said the drawdown in Somalia does not mark the end of U.S. counterterrorism efforts there.
	""As a result of this decision, some forces may be reassigned outside of East Africa,"" it said. ""However, the remaining forces will be repositioned from Somalia into neighbouring countries in order to allow cross-border operations by both U.S. and partner forces to maintain pressure against violent extremist organizations operating in Somalia.""
	It added: ""The U.S. will retain the capability to conduct targeted counterterrorism operations in Somalia, and collect early warnings and indicators regarding threats to the homeland.""
	The nature of the threat posed by al-Shabab and the appropriate U.S. response has been a matter of increasing debate in the Pentagon, which has been looking for opportunities to shift its focus toward China as a greater long-term challenge.
	A Defence Department watchdog report last week said U.S. Africa Command has seen a ""definitive shift"" this year in al-Shabab's focus to attack U.S. interests in the region. Africa Command says al-Shabab is Africa's most ""dangerous"" and ""imminent"" threat."

              Negotiating contracts for vaccines in development needed flexibility: Anand
          
","
              Procurement Minister Anita Anand says that as soon as she knows when the first dose of COVID-19 vaccine will arrive in Canada, she will share that information with Canadians.

                ",https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/coronavirus/negotiating-contracts-for-vaccines-in-development-needed-flexibility-anand-1.5218491,"OTTAWA -- 
	Procurement Minister Anita Anand says that as soon as she knows when the first dose of COVID-19 vaccine will arrive in Canada, she will share that information with Canadians.
	But Anand told The Canadian Press in an interview this week that the original contracts to buy COVID-19 vaccines had to be vague about delivery dates because nobody knew at the time if the vaccines would be successful.
	It's only in the last few weeks, when the leading candidates from Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca reported such positive results from their large clinical trials, that the way forward became clear enough for Anand's department to start asking the companies to be more specific about when they can make good on their contracts with Canada.
	""We put these contracts in place in order to place Canadians in the best stead possible, of any country in the world, recognizing that we would need to negotiate additional terms such as precise delivery dates, once a vaccine was discovered, and regulatory approval was obtained,"" she said. ""And that is what's happening now.""
	As Canadians face a pandemic-plagued holiday season and dream that 2021 will not be the anxiety-laden and often tragic disaster that 2020 has proven to be, there is one gleaming hope dangling still just out of reach: a vaccine for COVID-19.
	Still, the federal government has yet to answer one big question: When will it get here?
	It is not that she doesn't want to tell Canadians when, said Anand. But the complexities of figuring out a specific date are linked to when Health Canada approves the vaccine, and when the vaccine makers can see that Canada is ready to receive and safely distribute the precious doses, some of which have to be stored at temperatures below -70 C.
	Those pieces are starting to converge now.
	Health Canada officials are days, maybe even hours, away from approving the COVID-19 vaccine from Pfizer and BioNTech for use in Canada.
	Canadians got some more information on the logistics from a briefing of federal officials this week, including that Pfizer will ship its vaccine directly to 14 identified receiving sites in provinces. FedEx and Innomar Strategies were contracted Friday to oversee the delivery of other vaccines from a national receiving site to provinces.
	The National Advisory Committee on Immunization issued refined guidance Friday for who should get the vaccine first, including long-term care residents and workers, and people over the age of 80.
	The materials like syringes, gauze pads and bandages needed to vaccinate millions of people are in place. Ultralow temperature freezers have been purchased and nine new ones have already arrived. Provincial governments are lining up their own task forces.
	""We are going to have vaccines in this country, as expeditiously as possible,"" Anand said.
	Conservative Leader Erin O'Toole has been decrying the lack of clarity from the Liberals about the vaccine plan. A week ago he accused the Liberals of only starting to buy vaccines in a panic this summer after a collaboration with China on a vaccine fell apart.
	The partnership between the National Research Council and China's CanSino Biologics was announced in May to great fanfare. But the doses to be used in a Canadian clinical trial failed to arrive, when the Chinese government -- in the midst of political tensions with Canada -- refused to issue an export permit for them.
	""I would not have put all our eggs in the basket of China,"" O'Toole said Nov. 29, adding the timeline shows it wasn't until that deal fell apart that Canada ""started getting serious with Pfizer, Moderna, the other options.""
	Anand said that is not the case.
	She said the CanSino deal fell within Innovation Minister Navdeep Bains' portfolio, not her own, and nothing about the project prevented her from negotiating with other companies.
	Her marching orders to negotiate deals with other vaccine makers came weeks earlier. A team of procurement officials in her department was assigned to the file in March, at the same time as those negotiating contracts for medical supplies, personal protective equipment and rapid tests.
	In June, the COVID-19 vaccine task force provided a list of vaccines for Canada to pursue. Anand said talks with manufacturers began in early July. The first deal, with Massachusetts biotech firm Moderna, was struck July 24.
	Canada was first to sign with Moderna. It signed a contract with Pfizer and BioNTech a week later, on Aug. 1. It was the fourth country to do so, after the United Kingdom, the United States and Japan.
	News of trouble on the CanSino deal first appeared in early July when the doses still hadn't been approved for export by China. Canada walked away from the deal at the end of August when it became clear it would not happen.
	By then, Canada had deals with four other vaccine companies, including Moderna, Pfizer/BioNTech, Johnson & Johnson, and NovaVax. It added deals with Sanofi/GlaxoSmithKline and AstraZeneca in September and then with Canada's own Medicago the next month.
	Anand said Canada approached every contract with a similar goal -- to get 20 million doses guaranteed, and options to potentially buy more later on. In all, Canada is paying more than $1 billion to the seven vaccine makers for 194 million doses, even if those vaccines never get beyond the experimental stage.
	Another 220 million doses are available if Canada asks for them, a decision that will be made for the vaccines that are proving to be the best. Anand announced Friday another 20 million doses will come to Canada in 2021 from Moderna, for a total of 40 million.

              PM won't confirm reports U.S. Justice Department seeking plea deal with Meng Wanzhou

	Prime Minister Justin Trudeau joined the chorus of official silence Friday surrounding reports that the United States is seeking to negotiate a plea deal of sorts with detained Huawei scion Meng Wanzhou.
	Trudeau refused, like U.S. officials, to acknowledge a Wall Street Journal report that Justice Department lawyers have approached Meng's legal team about the possibility of a so-called deferred prosecution agreement.
	The newspaper says in exchange for admitting some level of wrongdoing, Meng - who faces wire and bank fraud charges in the U.S. - would be allowed to leave Canada, where she has been awaiting extradition for the last two years.
	Meng, who has so far reportedly rejected the prospect of a deal, was detained in Vancouver in December 2018 at the behest of the Justice Department, which has accused Huawei of violating U.S. sanctions on Iran.
	Her arrest sparked an intractable diplomatic standoff that continues to this day, and has been widely linked to China's decision days later to detain Canadians Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, who face charges of espionage.
	Canada's âabsolute priorityâ is the safe release of Kovrig and Spavor, Trudeau said Friday during a news conference outside his Rideau Cottage residence in Ottawa.
	âWe're going to continue to work as hard as we possibly can to bring these two Michaels home,â Trudeau said.
	âIt's been extremely difficult for them, for their families and their loved ones. We will continue to stand up for Canadians in difficulty anywhere around the world.â
	Marc Raimondi, a Justice Department spokesman, also refused to comment on the reports Friday, as did officials at the International Crisis Group, where Kovrig worked. Queries to the White House also went unanswered.
	The sudden effort to secure a resolution, coming as it does in the final days of Donald Trump's presidency, has a tinge of politics to it, said Brett Bruen, a consultant and former U.S. diplomat who worked as an adviser in Barack Obama's administration.
	With a potential Trump comeback being planned for 2024, the current president may be looking to claim a win on China before he leaves office - and to deny one to his incoming successor, Joe Biden.
	âPresident Trump wants to have talking points for potentially another campaign, and - probably more importantly, from what I'm hearing - his political movement,â Bruen said.
	âHe wants to be able to both attack Biden as being weak on China - he didn't get the concessions and the kind of change that Trump did - and also to be able to make the case that (Trump) could have done more if only he had more time.â
	China has repeatedly urged the U.S. to abandon the extradition of Meng, and decried Canada as being complicit in what they consider an arbitrary and unjust abuse of the extradition agreement between the two countries.
	The U.S. alleges Meng orchestrated the use of Skycom, a Huawei subsidiary, to evade sanctions against Iran between 2009 and 2014.
	China detained Kovrig and Spavor 10 days after the arrest of Meng, who is also the daughter of Huawei's founder, Ren Zhengfei.
	The good news for the Michaels, Bruen said, may be that China would far prefer to do a deal with the current outgoing administration, which appears very motivated.
	âThey would much prefer to strike a deal with Trump, because they know that he is looking at the short term, whereas Biden is going to make it contingent on medium- and long-term concessions,â he said.
	âFor Beijing, it's far preferable to give up a couple of Canadians and perhaps even put out some statement that is fairly meaningless, but that Trump will tout as a major victory.â
	Huawei has close ties to China's military and is considered one of the country's most successful international enterprises, operating in the high-tech sphere where China hopes to establish international dominance.
	The detentions and deteriorating relations also spilled over into Huawei's push to build Canada's next-generation wireless networks.
	The U.S. has been lobbying aggressively against Huawei, urging Australia, Canada, Germany and Japan, among others, to close their networks to the company.

              WHO warns vaccines 'do not equal zero COVID'

              The roll-out of vaccines to fight the COVID-19 pandemic will not by itself eliminate the deadly coronavirus, the World Health Organization said on Friday.

	The roll-out of vaccines to fight the COVID-19 pandemic will not by itself eliminate the deadly coronavirus, the World Health Organization said on Friday.
	The WHO warned against complacency and what it said was an erroneous belief that because vaccines are on the near-horizon, the crisis is over.
	""Vaccines do not equal zero COVID,"" WHO emergencies director Michael Ryan told a virtual news conference.
	""Vaccines and vaccination will add a major, major, powerful tool to the tool kit that we have. But by themselves, they will not do the job.""
	Britain on Wednesday became the first Western country to approve a vaccine for general use, piling pressure on other countries to follow suit swiftly.
	WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that progress on vaccines ""gives us all a lift and we can now start to see the light at the end of the tunnel.
	""However, WHO is concerned that there is a growing perception that the pandemic is over.
	""Many places are witnessing very high transmission of the virus, which is putting enormous pressure on hospitals, intensive care units and health workers.""
	Global coronavirus infections passed 65 million on Friday.
	The novel coronavirus has killed at least 1.5 million people since the outbreak emerged in China last December, according to a tally from official sources compiled by AFP.
'LIFE AND DEATH'
	""The pandemic still has a long a way to run and decisions made by leaders and citizens in the coming days will determine both the course of the virus in the short term and when this pandemic will ultimately end,"" said Tedros.
	Maria Van Kerkhove, the WHO's COVID-19 technical lead, added that these decisions ""can mean life and death for us, life and death for our family"".
	According to the WHO's overview of candidate vaccines, 51 are currently being tested on humans, 13 of which have reached final-stage mass testing.
	A further 163 candidate vaccines are being developed in laboratories with a view to eventual human trials.
	""I have seen vaccines transform the world and change the course of epidemics, and I fully expect that these vaccines and the ones that are to come will do that,"" Ryan said.
	But he warned that people needed to recognise that the vaccine ""will not be with everyone early next year"".
	Health workers, the elderly and people with underlying conditions will get priority -- a choice that ""will take a lot of the sorrow out of this pandemic. But it will not, by itself, end transmission,"" said Ryan.
	Tedros said he was happy to be vaccinated on camera to help promote public confidence, but would not jump the queue to do so.
	""I would be happy to do it"" but ""I have to make sure it's my turn"", he said."

	The top U.S. intelligence official stepped up the Trump administration's harsh attacks on Beijing on Thursday, labelling China the biggest threat to democracy and freedom worldwide since the Second World War and saying it was bent on global domination.
	""The intelligence is clear: Beijing intends to dominate the U.S. and the rest of the planet economically, militarily and technologically,"" Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe said in an opinion article on the Wall Street Journal website.
	Ratcliffe, a former Republican congressman appointed by U.S. President Donald Trump to the top U.S. spy job last spring, said China posed ""the greatest threat to America today, and the greatest threat to democracy and freedom world-wide since World War Two.""
	He said he had shifted resources within the US$85 billion annual federal budget allocated to intelligence to increase the focus on China.
	Ratcliffe said China's economic espionage approach was threefold: ""Rob, Replicate and Replace.""
	He said the strategy was for Chinese entities to steal American companies' intellectual property, copy it and then supplant U.S. companies in the global market place.
	A spokesperson for the Chinese embassy rejected Ratcliffe's comments as ""fact-distorting"" and hypocritical and said they showed ""the entrenched Cold-War mindset and ideological prejudices of some people on the U.S. side.""
	Beijing has frequently called on U.S. leaders to dial back their rhetoric on China, which it blames on fear of China's growing role in the world.
	Ratcliffe's essay was the latest broadside against China from Trump's administration as it seeks to cement the outgoing president's tough-on-China legacy following his Nov. 3 election defeat.
	Trump's approach has taken relations between the world's two largest economies to their lowest point in decades and analysts say it could limit the incoming Biden administration's room for manoeuvre in dealing with Beijing.
	Ratcliffe alluded to reports collected by U.S. intelligence agencies that Chinese representatives have sought to interfere in U.S. domestic politics.
	He also charged that China had stolen U.S. defense technology to fuel President Xi Jinping's aggressive military modernization plans.
	""The election is over. Now letâs all be honest about China,"" Ratcliffe told Reuters after the article was published.
	Among other issues, Washington and Beijing have clashed over China's handling of the coronavirus outbreak, its tightening grip on Hong Kong, its disputed claims in the South China Sea, trade and accusations of human rights crimes in Xinjiang.
	Ratcliffe, who served only briefly on the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee before Trump appointed him to his role, has been accused by Democrats and current and former intelligence officials of politicizing intelligence.
	In his essay, Ratcliffe said Chinese authorities had ""conducted human testing"" on members of the Chinese army ""in hopes of developing soldiers with biologically enhanced capabilities."" He did not elaborate.
	U.S.-based think tanks have reported that China is giving increasing importance to biotechnology in its military strategy but they have not released detailed reports about the kind of testing alleged by Ratcliffe.
	On Thursday, the Trump administration restricted travel to the United States by members of China's ruling Communist Party and their families.
	On Wednesday, it banned cotton imports from a quasi-military organization in Xinjiang it says uses forced labor of detained Muslims, while the House passed a law to kick Chinese firms off U.S. stock exchanges if they do not comply with auditing rules.
	China accused U.S. politicians of fabricating news of detained Muslims being forced into labor in Xinjiang.
	In an emailed statement, the embassy spokesperson said ""no one deserves the title of Empire of Hacking and Spying better than the U.S."" and charged that both the U.S. government and U.S. firms had long carried out ""large-scale, organized and indiscriminate cyber theft, surveillance and attack.""
	Bonnie Glaser, an Asia expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank, said Ratcliffe's comments appeared aimed at locking in a tough approach before President-elect Joe Biden takes office on Jan. 20.
	""It does appear to part of a broader effort to tie Biden's hands and limit his room to maneuver on China policy,"" she said.
	""In prior administrations, the norm has been to avoid taking such actions during a presidential transition, but the Trump administration has long set a pattern of bucking the norm.""Â "

              Global virus cases top 65 million as nations plan for vaccine

              Global coronavirus infections passed 65 million on Friday and countries doubled down on restrictions, even as plans to roll out vaccines gathered pace.

	Global coronavirus infections passed 65 million on Friday and countries doubled down on restrictions, even as plans to roll out vaccines gathered pace.
	Joe Biden said he would ask Americans to wear masks for 100 days when he takes over as president of the United States, the world's worst-hit country from a pandemic that has now killed more than 1.5 million people across the planet.
	""I'm going to ask the public for 100 days to mask. Just 100 days to mask -- not forever,"" Biden told CNN on Thursday.
	The U.S. is among the countries posting all-time highs in daily deaths this week along with Italy, which is undergoing a dramatic resurgence after it largely tamped down its earlier outbreak by enforcing a strict lockdown in the spring.
	The alarming spikes come after more positive news on vaccine development, with US-based Moderna announcing its candidate drug confers immunity for at least three months.
	To build trust in vaccines after they are approved, 78-year-old Biden said he was willing to be vaccinated in public -- following up on similar commitments from former US presidents Barack Obama, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton.
	Biden also used the CNN interview to say he had asked the government's top infectious disease specialist Anthony Fauci to join his COVID team and serve as a chief medical adviser.
	But in a sign of the difficult work ahead, California announced new statewide bans on gatherings and non-essential activities, as hospitals in the nation's most populous state face being overwhelmed.
	The pandemic is showing little sign of slowing, with the daily global death toll in recent weeks reaching its highest rate since the virus emerged in China late last year.
	However, the rapid development of several vaccines has provided respite from the dismal cycle of lockdowns and surging cases.
	Britain on Wednesday became the first Western country to approve a vaccine for general use, piling pressure on other countries to swiftly follow suit.
	But Fauci said Britain had rushed its approval process.
	""In all fairness to so many of my U.K. friends, you know, they kind of ran around the corner of the marathon and joined it in the last mile,"" he told CBS, although he later said he had not meant to imply ""any sloppiness.""
	Britain's regulator hit back on Friday, saying: ""No vaccine would be authorised for supply in the U.K. unless the expected standards of safety, quality and efficacy are met.""
	Other nations are also moving ahead with plans to roll out the vaccines. Belgium and France have said jabs would begin in January for the most vulnerable.
	But officials were not the only ones to focusing on vaccines.
	IBM said on Thursday that hackers had targeted companies involved in the effort to distribute doses around the world.
	The firm said it was not sure if the cyberattacks had been successful or who was behind them, but the precision of the operation had ""the potential hallmarks of nation-state tradecraft"".
'12TH MAN BACK'
	UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned that even if vaccines were quickly approved, the world would still be fighting the pandemic's aftershocks.
	""Let's not fool ourselves. A vaccine cannot undo damage that will stretch across years, even decades to come,"" Guterres said while opening a special UN summit on the virus.
	The worlds of sport and culture are still grappling with the pandemic's society-altering effects.
	On Thursday, Warner Bros. studio said it would release its entire 2021 schedule of movies on HBO Max streaming and in theatres simultaneously -- a paradigm shift for the cinema industry.

              NASA buying Moon dust for US$1

              The U.S. space agency NASA awarded contracts to four companies on Thursday to collect lunar samples for US$1 to $15,000, rock-bottom prices that are intended to set a precedent for future exploitation of space resources by the private sector.

	The U.S. space agency NASA awarded contracts to four companies on Thursday to collect lunar samples for US$1 to $15,000, rock-bottom prices that are intended to set a precedent for future exploitation of space resources by the private sector.
	""I think it's kind of amazing that we can buy lunar regolith from four companies for a total of $25,001,"" said Phil McAlister, director of NASA's Commercial Spaceflight Division.
	The contracts are with Lunar Outpost of Golden, Colorado for $1; ispace Japan of Tokyo for $5,000; ispace Europe of Luxembourg for $5,000; and Masten Space Systems of Mojave, California for $15,000.
	The companies plan to carry out the collection during already scheduled unmanned missions to the Moon in 2022 and 2023.
	The firms are to collect a small amount of lunar soil known as regolith from the Moon and to provide imagery to NASA of the collection and the collected material.
	Ownership of the lunar soil will then be transferred to NASA and it will become the ""sole property of NASA for the agency's use under the Artemis program.""
	Under the Artemis program, NASA plans to land a man and a woman on the Moon by 2024 and lay the groundwork for sustainable exploration and an eventual mission to Mars.
	""The precedent is a very important part of what we're doing today,"" said Mike Gold, NASA's acting associate administrator for international and interagency relations.
	""We think it's very important to establish the precedent that the private sector entities can extract, can take these resources but NASA can purchase and utilize them to fuel not only NASA's activities, but a whole new dynamic era of public and private development and exploration on the Moon,"" Gold said.
	""We must learn to generate our own water, air and even fuel,"" he said. ""Living off the land will enable ambitious exploration activities that will result in awe inspiring science and unprecedented discoveries.""
	Any lessons learned on the Moon would be crucial to an eventual mission to Mars.
	""Human mission to Mars will be even more demanding and challenging than our lunar operations, which is why it's so critical to learn from our experiences on the Moon and apply those lessons to Mars,"" Gold said.
	""We want to demonstrate explicitly that you can extract, you can utilize resources, and that we will be conducting those activities in full compliance with the Outer Space Treaty,"" he said. ""That's the precedent that's important. It's important for America to lead, not just in technology, but in policy.""
	The United States is seeking to establish a precedent because there is currently no international consensus on property rights in space and China and Russia have not reached an understanding with the United States on the subject.
	The 1967 Outer Space Treaty is vague but it deems outer space to be ""not subject to national appropriation by claim of sovereignty, by means of use or occupation, or by any other means."""

              Chinese official says Australian PM overreacted to tweet

	China's senior diplomat in Australia said Prime Minister Scott Morrison overreacted to a social media post about alleged war crimes by Australian soldiers in Afghanistan, adding that his actions drew more attention to the report.
	Earlier this week, Morrison said that a Chinese official's tweet showing the fake image of an Australian soldier appearing to slit a child's throat was ""truly repugnant"" and merits an apology, which has not come from China.
	""I think it's unfortunate that this issue evolved in such a way that has gone astray and now there is a much larger visibility of the Brereton report in China,"" China's deputy ambassador, Wang Xining, said Friday. ""More people are attentive to what happened in Afghanistan. People wonder why a national leader would have such a strong opinion to an artwork done by a normal young artist in China.""
	He was referring to a disturbing report by Australia's military earlier this month that found evidence that elite Australian troops unlawfully killed 39 Afghan prisoners, farmers and civilians during the conflict in Afghanistan. It recommended that 19 soldiers be referred to federal police for criminal investigation.
	It followed a four-year investigation by Maj. Gen. Paul Brereton, a judge and army reservist who was asked to look into the allegations and interviewed more than 400 witnesses and reviewed thousands of pages of documents.
	Zhao Lijian, a spokesman for China's Foreign Ministry, posted the graphic image that shows a grinning soldier holding a bloodied knife to the throat of a veiled child, who is holding a lamb.
	Zhao wrote a caption with the tweet saying: ""Shocked by murder of Afghan civilians & prisoners by Australian soldiers. We strongly condemn such acts, & call for holding them accountable.""
	Many of Australia's allies have been critical of the tweet, with the European Union calling it ""irresponsible.""
	""We consider the deliberate dissemination of a fabricated image via social media accounts affiliated with China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs to be irresponsible, insensitive, and not at all constructive, particularly given the subject in question,"" said an EU spokesman.
	""Such behaviour and use of information tools to disseminate fabricated images or information cannot be justified.""
	Officials from the United States, New Zealand and Canada have also criticized the Chinese tweet.
	The rift between the two nations has grown since the Australian government called for an independent inquiry into the origins of the coronavirus pandemic. China has since imposed tariffs and other restrictions on a number of Australian exports, most recently to its lucrative wine industry."

	The U.S. government has stepped up a feud with Beijing over security by adding China's biggest processor chip maker and a state-owned oil giant to a blacklist that limits access to American technology and investment.
	Thursday's announcement adds to steps taken by U.S. President Donald Trump against China since losing his re-election bid Nov. 3. Political analysts have said Trump was likely to take further action before President-elect Joe Biden takes office Jan. 20.
	The Pentagon added four companies including Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. and China National Offshore Oil Corp. to a list of entities deemed to be part of efforts to modernize the ruling Communist Party's military wing, the People's Liberation Army. That raises the total number of companies on the blacklist to 35.
	SMIC plays a leading role in the ruling party's effort to reduce reliance on U.S. and other foreign technology by creating Chinese suppliers of processor chips and other components.
	China's government has criticized such restrictions as an abuse of national security arguments to handicap fledgling Chinese competitors in technology and other fields.
	That has taken on greater urgency after Washington blocked access to American chips and other technology for telecom equipment giant Huawei Technologies Ltd. and imposed curbs on other Chinese buyers. The White House also has blocked the use of U.S. technology by global vendors to produce chips for Huawei.
	CNOOC is the smallest of China's three main state-owned oil producers.
	Political analysts expect little change in policy under Biden due to widespread frustration with China's trade and human rights records and accusations of spying and technology theft.
	The 2.3 million-member PLA is one of the world's biggest and best-armed militaries. It is spending heavily to develop nuclear submarines, stealth fighters, ballistic missiles and other advanced weapons.
	The Pentagon's first list of 20 companies deemed to be PLA-linked in June included Huawei and video surveillance provider HikVision Digital Technology Co. Both say they never have taken part in military-related research.
	Also cited by the Pentagon in earlier lists are state-owned phone carriers China Telecom Corp. and China Unicom Ltd. and petrochemical, construction, aerospace, rocketry, shipbuilding and nuclear power equipment companies."

	U.S. prosecutors are discussing a deal with lawyers for Huawei finance chief Meng Wanzhou to resolve criminal charges against her, a person familiar with the matter said, signaling a potential end to a case that has strained ties between the United States, China and Canada.
	Negotiations between Meng's attorneys and the U.S. Justice Department picked up after the U.S. presidential election a month ago, the person said, but it is still unclear what kind of deal could be struck.
	Meng, 48, was arrested in Canada in December 2018 on a U.S. warrant. She faces bank fraud charges for allegedly misleading HSBC Holdings Plc about Huawei Technologies Co Ltd's business dealings in Iran, which was subject to U.S. sanctions.
	Meng does not think she did anything wrong and so is reluctant to make admissions that she does not think are true, the person said. Further negotiations are expected to take place on Friday, the person said.
	The Wall Street Journal first reported on a possible deal. It said the case might be resolved with a ""deferred prosecution agreement"" under which Meng would admit to some of the allegations against her and prosecutors would defer and later drop the charges if she cooperated.
	In the case, which was filed in New York, Huawei and Meng are accused of conspiring to defraud HSBC and other banks by misrepresenting Huawei's relationship with Skycom Tech Co Ltd, a suspected front company that operated in Iran.
	Huawei has said Skycom was a local business partner, but U.S. prosecutors said it was an unofficial subsidiary used to conceal Huawei's Iran business.
	U.S. authorities say Huawei used Skycom to obtain embargoed U.S. goods, technology and services in Iran, and to move money via the international banking system. The charges against the company include violating U.S. sanctions on Iran.
	The source said the negotiations do not appear to be part of a larger deal with Huawei, which was hit with additional charges in the case in February, including conspiring to steal trade secrets from six U.S. technology companies.
	U.S. Justice Department spokesman Marc Raimondi declined to comment. Huawei also declined to comment, as did a spokeswoman for Canadian Foreign Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne.
	The Trump administration has targeted Huawei's business worldwide in an effort to thwart its ambitions to supply next generation 5G networks.
	In pressuring other countries to bar Huawei from their cellular networks, the United States said it was worried its equipment could be used by Beijing for spying. The company has repeatedly denied the allegation.
	Meng is due back in British Columbia Supreme Court on Monday as she fights extradition to the United States.
	If she were to admit wrongdoing, the Trump administration could claim victory in a thorny dispute with China, and relieve the pressure on Canada, which has found itself in the cross fire of the U.S.-China trade war.
	After Meng's arrest, China cut off imports of canola seed from Canada and detained two Canadian citizens, Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, for alleged spying. They remain behind bars.
	""Ottawa has been pressing Washington to try to come and help us in any way possible, and this would be a great way to end this nightmare,"" former Canadian ambassador to China Guy Saint-Jacques told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.
	Reuters broke news of the bank fraud charges two years ago and exclusively reported last year on how an internal HSBC probe helped lead to the charges against Huawei and Meng.
	The U.S. sanctions investigation was spurred by Reuters reports more than six years ago that detailed the close ties between Huawei and Skycom.
	U.S. President Donald Trump told Reuters after Meng's arrest in 2018 that he would intervene in the case if it would serve national security interests or help close a trade deal with China. Meng's lawyers expressed concern at the time that she was a pawn.

	A Chinese spacecraft lifted off from the moon Thursday night with a load of lunar rocks, the first stage of its return to Earth, the government space agency reported.
	Chang'e 5, the third Chinese spacecraft to land on the moon and the first to take off from it again, is the latest in a series of increasingly ambitious missions for Beijing's space program, which also has a orbiter and rover headed to Mars.
	The Chang'e 5 touched down Tuesday on the Sea of Storms on the moon's near side. Its mission: collect about 2 kilograms (4 pounds) of lunar rocks and bring them back to Earth, the first return of samples since Soviet spacecraft did so in the 1970s. Earlier, the U.S. Apollo astronauts brought back hundreds of pounds of moon rocks.
	The landing site is near a formation called the Mons Rumker and may contain rocks billions of years younger than those retrieved earlier.
	The ascent vehicle lifted off from the moon shortly after 11 p.m. Beijing time Thursday (1500 GMT) and was due to rendezvous with a return vehicle in lunar orbit, then transfer the samples to a capsule, according to the China National Space Administration. The moon rocks and debris were sealed inside a special canister to avoid contamination.
	It wasn't clear when the linkup would occur. After the transfer, the ascent module would be ejected and the capsule would remain in lunar orbit for about a week, awaiting the optimal time to make the trip back to Earth.
	Chinese officials have said the capsule with the samples is due to land on Earth around the middle of the month. Touchdown is planned for the grasslands of Inner Mongolia, where China's astronauts have made their return in Shenzhou spacecraft.
	Chang'e 5's lander, which remained on the moon, was capable of scooping samples from the surface and drilling 2 metres (about 6 feet).
	While retrieving samples was its main task, the lander also was equipped to extensively photograph the area, map conditions below the surface with ground penetrating radar and analyze the lunar soil for minerals and water content.
	Right before the ascent vehicle lifted off, the lander unfurled what the space administration called the first free-standing Chinese flag on the moon. The agency posted an image -- apparently taken from the lander -- of the ascend vehicle firing its engines as it took off.
	Chang'e 5 has revived talk of China one day sending astronauts to the moon and possibly building a scientific base there, although no timeline has been proposed for such projects.
	China launched its first temporary orbiting laboratory in 2011 and a second in 2016. Plans call for a permanent space station after 2022, possibly to be serviced by a reusable space plane.
	While China is boosting co-operation with the European Space Agency and others, interactions with NASA are severely limited by U.S. concerns over the secretive nature and close military links of the Chinese program."

	RCMP say a man with ties to Mississauga, Ont. is facing charges in connection with various transnational telephone frauds, including the infamous Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) telephone scam.
	On Thursday, authorities announced the charges as part of their ongoing investigation called Operation Octavia, which commenced in October 2018 to combat the CRA telephone tax schemes and other related frauds.
	According to the RCMP, telephone fraudsters operating outside of Canada have been targeting the Canadian public since 2014.
	In the CRA telephone scam, callers from India impersonate CRA, RCMP, or other federal agents in order to intimidate victims into paying non-existent fines or taxes. During the investigation, the RCMP said they have uncovered âmoney mules,â âmoney mule managers,â and money launderers operating within Canada and overseas.
	That scheme alone has cost victims a cumulative total of more than $18.5 million since 2014, the RCMP said.
	The fraudstersâ other scams, including the âBank investigatorâ and âTech supportâ scams, have resulted in victim losses of more than $34 million, according to the announcement.
	Despite a number of police raids on illegal call centres in India and arrests made in Canada, the RCMP said the telephone fraudsters continue to operate and target Canadians.
	To date, the RCMP said nine individuals have been charged in relation to Project Octavia.
	âFraud, like violent crime, has devastating consequences on its victims. Those whose conscience does not deter them from preying on the vulnerable, will be held accountable by the rule of law,â Staff Sgt. Ken Derakhshan, acting Officer in Charge of the GTA Financial Crime Section in Milton, Ont., said in a press release.
	Thomas Pao, 25, of Mississauga, Ont. has been charged with fraud over $5,000, possession of proceeds of crime, and laundering of the proceeds of crime.
	RCMP said a Canada-wide arrest warrant has been issued for Pao, who is currently believed to be in China.
	None of the allegations have been tested in court.Â 
	Authorities advised Canadians who receive a call from someone asking for their personal or banking information to hang up and report the activity to the Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre through their website www.antifraudcentre.ca. If the person threatens them or their family, the RCMP said to hang up and call police.Â "

              Burner phones and banking apps: Meet the Chinese 'brokers' laundering Mexican drug money

              U.S. law enforcement officials  say small cells of Chinese criminals have upended the way narcotics cash is laundered and are displacing the Mexican and Colombian money men that have long dominated the trade.

	Early next year, a Chinese businessman named Gan Xianbing will be sentenced in a Chicago courtroom for laundering just over US$530,000 in Mexican cartel drug money.
	Gan, 50, was convicted in February of money laundering and operating an unlicensed money-transfer business that whisked cartel cash from U.S. drug sales offshore. Gan has maintained his innocence; his lawyers say he was entrapped by U.S. authorities. The trial garnered few headlines and little of the public fascination reserved for kingpins of powerful narcotics syndicates that U.S. federal prosecutors said Gan served.
	Still, U.S. law enforcement officials told Reuters that Chinese ""money brokers"" such as Gan represent one of the most worrisome new threats in their war on drugs. They say small cells of Chinese criminals have upended the way narcotics cash is laundered and are displacing the Mexican and Colombian money men that have long dominated the trade.
	Virtually unheard of a decade ago, these Chinese players are moving vast sums quickly and quietly, authorities said. Their expertise: routing cartel drug profits from the United States to China then on to Mexico with a few clicks of a burner phone and Chinese banking apps â and without the bulky cash ever crossing borders. The launderers pay small Chinese-owned businesses in the United States and Mexico to help them move the funds. Most contact with the banking system happens in China, a veritable black hole for U.S. and Mexican authorities.
	Chinese money brokers based in Mexico ""have come to dominate international money laundering markets,"" U.S. prosecutors said in a Sept. 24 sentencing memorandum for Gan's case.
	Reuters spoke to more than a dozen law enforcement officials, diplomats, lawyers and sources familiar with the Gan case or Chinese money laundering techniques. The news organization also examined more than 1,500 pages of documents from the trial. The material included previously unreported details about how the ring operated compiled by prosecutors and agents of Homeland Security Investigations, the investigative arm of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security that led the probe.
	What emerged was a blueprint showing how some groups of Chinese money brokers have become key cogs in the multi-billion-dollar drug empires run by Latin American cartels. The Chinese role presents a formidable challenge for U.S. anti-narcotics efforts at a time of rising tensions between Beijing and Washington.
	Gan, who U.S. prosecutors said operated a tight ring with another Chinese money broker, was apprehended in November 2018 by Homeland Security Investigations agents at Los Angeles International Airport on his way to Mexico from Hong Kong. The U.S. government said that Gan had moved anywhere from $25 million to $65 million in illicit drug proceeds from 2016 to the time of his arrest, according to a September court filing by Gan's attorneys.
	Based in Guadalajara, the ring is believed to have worked with multiple syndicates, including the famed Sinaloa Cartel that was previously led by jailed Mexican drug lord Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman, according to two U.S.-based sources familiar with the investigation.
	The U.S. Department of the Treasury and Europol, the European Union's law enforcement arm, have warned about the expanding web of Chinese crime groups laundering drug money. Europol in November 2019 said these groups present a ""growing threat to Europe,"" while the U.S. Treasury in February placed Chinese professional money laundering networks on its list of ""key threats"" and vulnerabilities within the U.S. financial system.
	U.S. law enforcement has stepped up operations against these groups. In addition to the Gan case in Illinois, federal prosecutors have brought charges in Virginia and Oregon against alleged members of at least two other Chinese money laundering rings since October of last year. Those cases are pending.
	Still, a senior U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agent said U.S. efforts to nail Latin American drug capos by following the money have gotten much more difficult.
	""I can't emphasize this enough, the involvement of the Chinese has really complicated all of these schemes,"" the DEA official said.
	Gan, who declined to testify in court, pleaded not guilty to three counts of money laundering, one count of conspiracy to launder money and one count of operating an unlicensed money transmitting business. He was acquitted on the conspiracy charge. Reuters did not receive a reply to requests for comment from Gan sent to his legal team.
	His lawyers, in a September sentencing plea document, said Gan was not the mastermind of the operation, rather a seafood exporter who was duped into letting his bank account in China be used to launder money by another Mexico-based Chinese national named Pan Haiping. Glenn Seiden, Gan's lawyer, declined to speak with Reuters or answer questions about Gan's case.
	Attorney Aaron Schwartz, who was part of the defense team, said he wanted to make it clear that Gan did not cooperate with the U.S. government because his client feared for the safety of his family in Guadalajara, where the powerful Jalisco New Generation cartel holds sway. Gan's lawyers also allege Gan was entrapped in a sting operation by Homeland Security Investigations agents working with an informant who helped arrange the transactions that resulted in their client's conviction. The agency said it does not comment on ongoing investigations.
	Pan Haiping, Gan's alleged associate, was detained earlier this year in Mexico on accusations of money laundering and is awaiting extradition to the United States, according to the two U.S. sources familiar with the investigation and a senior Mexican federal police source. Pan Haiping could not be reached for comment. The Mexican prosecutor's office declined to comment on Pan Haiping's case or provide the name of his legal counsel in Mexico, saying it cannot comment on ongoing cases.
	In a March 2019 U.S. indictment unsealed a few weeks ago, Pan Haiping was charged with laundering almost $500,000 for Mexican cartels; running an illegal money transmitting business in Illinois; and conspiring to launder money using bank accounts in China, including an account belonging to Gan.
	Another alleged conspirator, Long Huanxin, was arrested in February at Vancouver International Airport by Canadian law enforcement acting on a warrant from U.S. authorities, according to Canadian court transcripts from Long's detention hearing. Long was extradited to the United States, and last month he pleaded not guilty in Chicago to charges of money laundering for Mexican cartels, U.S. court documents show. Long's lawyer did not respond to a request for comment.
	U.S officials informally sought assistance from China in the Gan case but received no support in their investigation, according to the two U.S. sources familiar with the probe.
	China's Foreign Ministry disputed their account. The ministry told Reuters in late October that it did not receive a request from U.S. authorities for help on that case. China stands ready to cooperate with the United States to ""destroy drug cartels and drug-related money-laundering networks,"" the ministry said in a statement. But it stressed the need for the two countries to work on the ""principle of respecting each other's laws, equality and mutual benefit,"" the statement said.
	The ministry said most Chinese bank-account holders about whom Washington has inquired as part of its money laundering investigations in recent years were ""legitimate enterprises and individuals"" in China. ""After we asked the U.S. side to provide drug-related clues or evidence of enterprises and individuals, the U.S. side has not responded,"" China's Foreign Ministry said in the statement.
	Without help from Beijing to track money flows in China and to infiltrate the laundering networks, U.S. agents say they face an uphill struggle to catch culprits.
	""It's the most sophisticated form of money laundering that's ever existed,"" one of the U.S. sources familiar with the investigation said.
	Key to cracking the case was Lim Seok Pheng, a New York-based member of the ring who became a cooperating witness for the U.S. government following her May 2018 arrest on suspicion of money laundering.
	A Singapore national, Lim said at Gan's trial that she once peddled footwear and had first met Gan in China where he ran a shoe factory before he relocated to Guadalajara in 2011. Lim testified that Gan recruited her to join the illicit operation in 2016 and that she became lovers with the other alleged ringleader, Pan Haiping.
	Following her arrest at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport, Lim agreed to wear a recording device to help authorities gather evidence against Gan and the other alleged conspirators. She also brought undercover Homeland Security Investigations agents into the operation as money couriers on three separate cash pick-ups in Chicago that led to Gan's conviction, according to the trial testimony of Lim and the agents.
	Lim pleaded guilty to money laundering charges in November 2019 and is out on bail, awaiting sentencing.
	She and her attorney declined to comment.
	The only thing tougher than moving illegal drugs across borders is getting the profits back to Mexico's cartels, U.S. officials said. Cash is heavy, and transporting it exposes traffickers to lots of risk. Putting it into the banking system is perilous, too. The U.S. and Mexican financial systems have been geared to detect dirty money.
	Prosecutors told the court that Gan and his accomplices sidestepped these obstacles by first moving the U.S. cash offshore to China, then on to Mexico. Lim was a linchpin connecting both sides of the Pacific. In her November 2019 plea agreement, Lim admitted to laundering, with Gan and Pan Haiping, about $48 million in drug cash between 2016 and September 2017. She took a 0.5% commission, the agreement said.
	Lim testified at Gan's trial that she had two jobs. The first was collecting drug money in U.S. cities such as Chicago and New York from cartel contacts, typically anywhere from $150,000 to $1 million at a time. She would wait in a public place, armed with a burner phone, a code name and the serial number of an authentic $1 bill. Mexican cartels would pass on her details to their dealer contacts, who would call Lim's burner phone and use the code name to identify themselves. At the rendezvous point, Lim would give them the $1 bill with the corresponding serial number as a ""receipt"" to verify the handoff had taken place, Lim said at trial.
	Lim's other job was recruiting businesses in the Chinese diaspora to help them make that cash disappear, Lim and prosecutors said.
	Some U.S.-based Chinese merchants have long engaged in off-the-books currency ""swaps"" to avoid hefty bank fees. Such transactions are illegal in the United States, American authorities said, if they are used by companies routinely to skirt the formal banking system or to operate an unauthorized money transfer business. In some cases these informal, hawala-style transactions are used to help wealthy Chinese move money clandestinely out of China, in violation of that nation's currency controls.
	The operation run by Gan and Pan Haiping grew to include at least three Chinese merchants in New York, who were paid commissions to participate, Lim told the court. The names of the Chinese merchants were not revealed at Gan's trial, and it's unclear if they knew of Lim's links to drug trafficking.
	Prosecutors at trial presented testimony, evidence and graphics showing how the transactions worked. At their simplest, authorities said, that process worked as follows: Lim would arrive at one of the merchants with, say, $150,000 in cartel cash. With the businessperson observing, she would open a currency converter app on her smartphone to obtain the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Chinese yuan. She would also hand over the details of a bank account in China given to her by Gan. In what's known as a ""mirror transaction,"" the Chinese businessperson would take possession of the $150,000 in U.S. currency while simultaneously transferring the equivalent in Chinese yuan from their own account in China to the bank account number provided by Gan.
	The result was that a foreign transfer of funds had been made without involving a U.S financial institution - or the accompanying digital fingerprints. The Chinese business had effectively used yuan from its China-based bank account to purchase cash dollars now on hand in the United States; it earned a commission for its trouble while avoiding bank fees and U.S. government scrutiny.
	Meanwhile, Gan had converted U.S. drug dollars into Chinese currency now sitting in a Chinese bank. The only contact with the financial system â a domestic transfer between two accounts in China â would be unlikely to raise red flags with Chinese banking authorities unaware of the money's provenance.
	The crime ring used various Chinese banks for the operations, including the Bank of China, according to WhatsApp messages exchanged between Gan and Pan Haiping. The messages were extracted from Gan's iPhone by Homeland Security Investigations agents after his arrest, and key excerpts were read out aloud by prosecutors at trial, according to court transcripts.
	Bank of China did not respond to requests for comment.
	To get the money from China to Mexico, Gan performed the same sort of mirror transactions, only this time with the help of Chinese businesses who had access to pesos in Mexico. This leg of the journey was described by the two U.S. sources familiar with the investigation and is outlined in court documents, including the U.S. government's September 2020 sentencing memorandum for Gan and the June 2019 superseding indictment detailing charges against him.
	U.S. prosecutors said the laundered money was delivered to Pan Haiping's Mexican drug cartel clients, according to the superseding indictment. No Mexican banks were named in any of the court documents reviewed by Reuters.
	In October, Reuters traveled to Guadalajara and found Gan's wife, Pan Emi (no relation to Pan Haiping), working in a busy store she owns in the city's Chinese quarter selling wigs, plastic jewelry, sunglasses and other low-cost merchandise imported from China.
	Manning the cash register, Pan Emi said her husband was innocent of wrongdoing and being unfairly portrayed by authorities as a criminal when he was nothing more than a plucky businessman. She said no Mexican or U.S. law enforcement agents had contacted her about the case.
	She said Gan, fed up with high Chinese taxes, had left his shoe factory in the Chinese city of Wenzhou nearly a decade ago seeking a better life in Mexico. In Guadalajara, she said, Gan co-founded a business exporting jellyfish, which are considered a delicacy and an aphrodisiac in China. Pan Emi said her ""super friendly"" husband built a large network of friends and contacts in Mexico and was always on the phone.
	Pan Emi confirmed some details of the case. She said her husband knew Pan Haiping and Lim and had participated in currency swaps with other Chinese merchants. But she denied Gan was involved with traffickers or knew anything about drug money.
	She said currency swaps were common in the expatriate Chinese business community to avoid pricey fees and lousy exchange rates offered by banks.
	""These swaps that we do with each other are easy. It's no big problem,"" Pan Emi said. ""I don't think it's illegal.""
	Money brokers like Gan and Pan Haiping are growing in number among the large Chinese diasporas in the United States, Europe and Latin America, according to three DEA officials.
	Demand for their services is being driven by affluent Chinese looking to evade China's currency controls and move wealth abroad, the DEA officials told Reuters. Beijing limits the amount of money its citizens can transfer out of China to the equivalent of $50,000 U.S. dollars annually.
	Latin American cartels, flush with dollars and euros from drug sales, are uniquely placed to satisfy the Chinese appetite for hard currencies. Some Chinese expatriates located in drug-producing countries such as Mexico, Colombia and Peru are the intermediaries bridging these disparate sets of people, said Donald Im, a senior DEA agent and anti-money laundering specialist.
	""When there is need by the cartels for cash to be laundered, and there is demand for cash from the Chinese, you have a perfect marriage made in heaven,"" Im told Reuters. ""The Chinese brokers are very important to the Mexican and Colombian cartels.""
	In the case of Gan, it was a lucrative business, according to conversations between his alleged associates taped by Homeland Security Investigations agents. ""He has made $1 million already because of us, for real,"" Pan Haiping told Lim in August 2017, according to transcripts of intercepted phone communications presented at Gan's trial.
	Chinese money launderers are squeezing out Mexican and Colombian rivals by undercutting them on price by as much as half, U.S. officials said. The Chinese operators have been able to do that because they levy fees on both sides of each transaction. They impose fat commissions as high as 10% on Chinese citizens eager to get money out of China. That allows the Chinese money brokers, in turn, to charge traffickers nominal fees of just a few percentage points. The money launderers still turn a handsome profit while locking in a steady supply of coveted dollars and euros from cartel customers.
	DEA agent Im said the Chinese expats had the ""systems and the infrastructure"" in place not only to launder the drug proceeds but to do it so cheaply that drug cartels receive back ""almost 100%"" of their dirty money.
	Chinese money brokers have also managed to avoid choosing sides in Mexico's cartel wars, even coordinating money contracts with both the Sinaloa and Jalisco New Generation cartels on the same day, according to a second senior DEA agent, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	Traffickers use other so-called trade-based money laundering schemes to move drug money from China to Mexico, according to the DEA and Mexican government officials who spoke with Reuters. In July, Mexico's Financial Intelligence Unit, an investigative agency, said publicly that Chinese nationals laundering money for the Jalisco New Generation cartel were using drug proceeds to buy shoes in bulk from China, then reselling them in Mexico to get the gang their cash.
	Chinese exports to Mexico, including electronics, clothing and other consumer goods, have nearly doubled over the past decade to $83 billion in 2019. The surge has allowed drug cartels and their money launderers to piggyback on this burgeoning trade relationship, authorities said.
	In Guadalajara, Pan Emi said e-mail exchanges with her husband's U.S. lawyers left her optimistic ahead of Gan's looming sentencing. Prosecutors have asked for a 20-year jail term; Gan's defense attorneys have argued for no more than two years.
	Pan Emi said business was going well in Mexico and she had no desire to return to China. ""I hope my husband comes back,"" she said."

China hits out at U.S. after report of new visa restrictions
          
","
China on Thursday accused critics in the U.S. government of ""an escalation of political suppression"" against Beijing following a report of new visa restrictions on members of China's ruling Communist Party and their immediate family members.
        ","
                  Thursday, Dec. 3, 2020
                ",https://www.ctvnews.ca/world/china-hits-out-at-u-s-after-report-of-new-visa-restrictions-1.5215115,"BEIJING -- 
	China on Thursday accused critics in the U.S. government of ""an escalation of political suppression"" against Beijing following new visa restrictions on members of China's ruling Communist Party and their immediate family members.
	Foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said China would ""make representations"" to the U.S. over its decision to limit such people to one-month, single-entry visas.
	Hua called Washington's approach ""totally inconsistent with the U.S.'s own interests,"" and said it would damage America's global image.
	""I think it is obvious to all that this is an escalation of political suppression by some extreme anti-China forces in the U.S. out of strong ideological prejudice and deep-rooted Cold War mentality against China,"" Hua said at a daily briefing.
	The State Department said in a statement Thursday that the new restrictions are intended to protect the U.S. from the Chinese Communist Party's ""malign influence.""
	""For decades we allowed the CCP free and unfettered access to U.S. institutions and businesses while these same privileges were never extended freely to U.S. citizens in China,"" it said.
	It wasn't clear how the restrictions would be enforced since many of the party's 92 million members do not play active public roles in its institutions.
	The restrictions are the latest punitive measure taken against China's leadership and economy amid sharpening disputes over human rights, the coronavirus pandemic, trade, technology, Taiwan and a host of other issues.
	On Wednesday, the U.S. said it would block imports from a major Chinese producer of cotton goods because of its reliance on workers detained as part of a crackdown on ethnic minorities in China's northwest.
	Washington has already slapped travel bans and financial sanctions on officials connected to the crackdown on Uighurs and other Chinese Muslim groups in Xinjiang, as well as on Chinese and Hong Kong officials it accuses of restricting social and political rights in the semi-autonomous Chinese city through the implementation of a harsh new national security law.
	Diplomatic ties hit a low point over the summer when the U.S. ordered the closure of the Chinese consulate in Houston and China responded by demanding the U.S. vacate its consulate in the southwestern city of Chengdu.
	Washington had been loosening restrictions on travel by Chinese to the U.S., seeking to take advantage of the lavish spending habits of China's newly wealthy. Beginning in 2014, Chinese travellers -- whether party members or not -- became eligible for multiple-entry visas valid for 10 years, with stays of 180 days allowed for each entry, while students were permitted visas good for five years. China reciprocated with similar treatment for U.S. citizens.
	Chinese who make up the single largest group of foreign students at American universities have already complained of tougher conditions for obtaining or extending visas. Chinese academics have also faced greater scrutiny, while dozens of journalists with state media have been forced to return home and visa restrictions placed on those remaining, prompting retaliation from Beijing.
	Analysts have long speculated that President Donald Trump will impose harsher measures on China before leaving office on Jan. 20, placing President-elect Joe Biden in a bind in managing the increasingly fractious relationship.

              'Canada really sticks out:' Studies show banks not so green on climate change
          
","
              International analyses suggest Canadian financiers are oiling the wheels of the fossil fuel industry at a far greater rate than their peers.
        ","
                  Thursday, Dec. 3, 2020
                ",https://www.ctvnews.ca/climate-and-environment/canada-really-sticks-out-studies-show-banks-not-so-green-on-climate-change-1.5215051,"
	International analyses suggest Canadian financiers are oiling the wheels of the fossil fuel industry at a far greater rate than their peers.
	Bankers say they've made big strides in addressing climate change concerns and promise to reveal how dependent on carbon their portfolios are. They add the nature of Canada's resource-driven economy makes large investments in oil and gas all but inevitable.
	But critics say not much is changing.
	""There's no significant decrease in financing,"" said Olaf Weber of the University of Waterloo's School of Environment, Enterprise and Development.
	A recent study from the Rainforest Action Network placed RBC, TD and Scotiabank in the global Top 10 for financing fossil fuels, providing more than $89 billion to oil and gas companies in 2019 alone. The Bank of Montreal and CIBC are in 16th and 21st spots with a total of nearly $42 billion.
	In the 4 1/2 years since the Paris agreement on climate change, fossil-fuel lending has grown at all five major banks, says the study.
	It's the same story at Export Development Canada, an arm's-length federal agency that helps Canadian industry sell its products abroad. Last May, Oil Change International ranked the agency second in the world in support for fossil fuels. Its average $10 billion a year outspent everyone but China.
	Earlier this month, the International Institute for Sustainable Development ranked Canada last among countries in the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development in its attempts to end public finance of oil and gas as well as the scale of its support for exploration, production, refining, and transportation.
	Only one of the Canadian major banks -- TD -- has committed to a global effort by 88 banks and financial institutions to standardize how banks tote up their carbon exposure.
	""Canada really sticks out like a sore thumb,"" said Bronwen Tucker of Oil Change International, which advocates for energy transition.
	Canadian banks say they're changing. Most no longer finance thermal coal projects and several -- including RBC, TD and BMO -- reject fossil fuel drilling in the Arctic.
	Alec Clark, head of global energy for TD Securities, said his bank has been disclosing its carbon-intensive investments since 2018. It has promised to be carbon neutral by 2050, aligning it with Paris agreement targets, and has pledged to invest $100 billion in renewable energy by 2030.
	""Setting out our ambitions provides good context for our clients,"" Clark said. ""A significant number already have their own ambitions.""
	RBC is working with its clients to be environmentally responsible, said spokesman Andrew Block in an email.
	""We are committed to finding ways to balance the transition to a low-carbon economy while supporting efforts to meet global energy needs and our energy clients. The world will continue to rely on natural resources and traditional sources of energy for some time.""
	Carl Burlock, Export Development Canada's executive vice-president, said the agency has committed to reduce the carbon intensity of its investments by 15 per cent by 2023. Those reductions will be disclosed, he said.
	About $3.5 billion has been provided to more than 250 clean technology companies, said Burlock. ""We have a role to play in the transition to a lower carbon economy.""
	Any lender involved in a significant way in the Canadian economy will be involved with fossil fuels, he said.
	""Oil and gas have been substantial exports from Canada for many years. If you look at the profile of our support it really reflects the profile of Canada's export industry.""
	Clark agrees. ""Energy is a big part of TD Securities. It's a big part of the Canadian economy.""
	That doesn't mean investment doesn't change, he said.
	""You can be an energy company and still be very focused on doing things in your day-to-day operations that make you less intensely a user or emitter of emissions.""
	As well, most banks have policies intended to evaluate an investment's environmental, social and governance risks.
	Weber points out some estimates say that up to 80 per cent of investments made in Canada already use the criteria. If they made a difference, he said, we'd have noticed by now.
	""You can see that it's not really a radical shift.""
	Amelia Meister of the shareholder activism group Sum Of Us said Canada's investment in fossil fuels is more than just a mirror of its economy. It's a bit of cheering for the home team.
	""I have spoken to executives at banks who have said the fossil fuel industry is a pillar of the Canadian economy and it's the banks' responsibility to support the Canadian economy,"" she said.
	""At one point, that may have been true. We are at a very different point.""
	Tucker said investing in fossil fuel companies has direct impacts on emissions. New oilfields don't get opened, oilsands mines don't get built and pipelines don't get laid without gobs of cash.
	""A new pipeline or oilfield ... presents emissions that we can't afford even in the near term but also that are going to be locked in for decades. We are actually at a point where we can't expand oil and gas infrastructure any more.""

China testing blunders stemmed from secret deals with firms
          
","
China's Center for Disease Control and Prevention gave test kit designs and distribution rights exclusively to three then-obscure Shanghai companies with which officials had personal ties, according to an Associated Press investigation.
        ","
                  Thursday, Dec. 3, 2020
                ",https://www.ctvnews.ca/world/china-testing-blunders-stemmed-from-secret-deals-with-firms-1.5215035,"WUHAN, CHINA -- 
	Secrecy and cronyism at China's top disease control agency led to widespread test shortages and flaws that hampered the early response to the coronavirus outbreak, an Associated Press investigation has found.
	China's Center for Disease Control and Prevention gave test kit designs and distribution rights exclusively to three then-obscure Shanghai companies with which officials had personal ties, according to the investigation. It was based on interviews with more than 40 doctors, CDC employees, health experts, and industry insiders, as well as hundreds of internal documents, contracts, messages and emails.
	The Shanghai companies -- GeneoDx Biotech, Huirui Biotechnology, and BioGerm Medical Technology -- paid the China CDC for the information and the distribution rights, according to two sources with knowledge of the transaction who asked to remain anonymous to avoid retribution. The price: One million RMB (US$146,600) each, the sources said. It's unclear whether the money went to specific individuals.
	In the meantime, the CDC and its parent agency, the National Health Commission, tried to prevent other scientists and organizations from testing for the virus with their own homemade kits. They took control of patient samples and made testing requirements to confirm coronavirus cases much more complicated.
	The flawed testing system -- at a time when the virus could have been slowed -- stopped scientists and officials from seeing how fast it was spreading. Chinese authorities failed to report a single new case between Jan. 5 and 17, even as hundreds were infected in Wuhan, the city where the virus was first detected.
	The apparent lull in cases meant officials were slow to take early actions such as warning the public or barring large gatherings. It also caused critical shortages of testing kits, barring access to care for many who were infected.
	The testing problems, along with other mistakes and delays, allowed the virus to rip through Wuhan undetected and spread across the world in a pandemic that has now sickened 64 million people and killed almost 1.5 million.
	China was hardly the only country to grapple with testing. In in the U.S., the CDC declined to use a WHO design and insisted on developing its own kits, which turned out to be faulty and led to even longer delays than in China. Still, the hiccups in China were especially consequential because it was the first country to detect the virus.
	""Because you have only three companies providing testing kits, it kept the capacity of testing very limited,"" said Yanzhong Huang, a senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations. ""It was a major problem that led to the rapid increase in cases and deaths.""
	China's foreign ministry and China's top medical agency, the National Health Commission, did not respond to requests for comment.
	But interviews and documents suggest that a culture of backdoor connections quietly flourished in a top-down, underfunded public health system. Though none of the first three diagnostics companies tapped to make test kits were well-known in the industry, there were extensive ties between the companies and top China CDC researchers.
	The founder of BioGerm, Zhao Baihui, was the former chief technician of the Shanghai CDC's microbiology lab. Emails and financial records obtained by the AP show that Zhao first started BioGerm's predecessor through an intermediary in 2012, while she was still at the Shanghai CDC. In the next five years, she sold thousands of dollars' worth of test kits to her own workplace through the intermediary. After quitting the CDC in 2017, Zhao went on to spearhead lucrative contracts with Shanghai officials.
	Zhao did not respond to requests for comment from the AP.
	Another of the three companies, GeneoDx, enjoyed special access because it is a subsidiary of the state-run firm SinoPharm, which is managed directly by China's cabinet. In October 2019, GeneoDx co-organized an internal CDC training conference on emerging respiratory diseases in Shanghai. Tan Wenjie, the CDC official who ran the training, was later put in charge of developing test kits.
	GeneoDx did not respond to requests for comment or interviews. The National Health Commission did not respond to a request for a comment or an interview with Tan.
	The last company, Huirui, is a longtime partner with Tan, the CDC official in charge of test kits. In an interview, CEO Li Hui said the CDC routinely contracted his company to make emergency testing chemicals. He denied any personal relationship with Tan or any payments to the CDC.
	""We've been working with the CDC to respond to emerging new diseases for about ten years, not just for a day or two, it's normal,"" Li said.
	It's unclear whether the agreements between the China CDC and the three test kit companies violated Chinese law.
	They raise questions around potential violations of bribery laws, along with rules against abuse of authority, self-dealing and conflicts of interest, said James Zimmerman, a Beijing-based corporate attorney and former chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China.
	But other experts caution that the state may have designated the three companies to make test kits under special laws on the procurement of emergency goods during natural disasters.
	""Things will be different in the middle of a crisis,"" said Lesli Ligorner, a Beijing-based attorney specializing in anti-corruption law. ""I wouldn't be so quick to rush to judgement.""
	The first step in making test kits is to get samples of the virus and decode its genetic sequence. This leads to test designs, essentially a recipe for the tests.
	In past outbreaks, the China CDC sent test designs and testing compounds to laboratories across the country just days after identifying the pathogen. But this time, they held back the genome and test designs. Instead, they finalized ""technology transfer"" agreements to give the test designs to the Shanghai companies, according to three people familiar with the matter. The selection process was kept secret.
	At the same time, central CDC authorities stymied others from testing. Provincial CDC staff were told that instead of testing and reporting cases themselves, they had to send patient samples to designated labs in Beijing for full sequencing, a complicated and time-consuming procedure. As a result, for weeks, local CDC staff were unable to confirm new cases.
	After a Jan. 14 internal teleconference to order secret preparations for a pandemic, China's health authorities relaxed the requirements to confirm cases and started distributing the CDC-sanctioned test kits. A day after the first test kits finally arrived in Wuhan on Jan. 16, the case count began to rise again.
	But the test kits from GeneoDx and Huirui had quality issues, turning out inconclusive results or false negatives. And technicians were hesitant to use test kits that would later prove more accurate from more established companies, because the CDC did not endorse them.
	As a result, in the early days, getting a COVID test was so difficult that Wuhan residents compared it to winning the lottery.
	Among the victims was Peng Yi, a 39-year-old schoolteacher who started coughing on Jan. 23. When he went to the hospital, he waited for eight hours, only to be turned away for a lack of test kits. Then, when he finally got tested on Jan. 30, it turned out negative, even as the virus ravaged his lungs.
	His second test, on Feb. 4, turned out positive. It was too late. Weeks later, Peng passed away.
	""There were very, very few tests, basically none -- if you couldn't prove you were positive, you couldn't get admitted to a hospital,"" his mother, Zhong Hanneng, said in a tearful interview in October. ""The doctor said there was nothing that could be done."""

              Australian leader seeks conciliation in dispute with China

	A diplomatic war of words between Australia and China over a graphic tweet seemed to finally cool on Thursday as Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison struck a much more conciliatory tone.
	Morrison's change in approach came even after he was thwarted in getting his views out directly to Chinese people over the messaging app WeChat, after the Chinese company deleted his post on the grounds it could distort historical events and confuse the public.
	Earlier this week, Morrison expressed indignation and anger at the tweet posted by a Chinese official that showed a fake image of a grinning Australian soldier holding a bloodied knife to a child's throat.
	The post took aim at alleged unlawful killings and abuses by Australian soldiers during the conflict in Afghanistan.
	Earlier this week, Morrison called the tweet ""truly repugnant"" and ""deeply offensive"" and demanded an apology from China. But China had not backed down, saying that Australia should be the one examining its actions.
	On Thursday, Morrison took a much different approach, telling reporters in Canberra that his aim was for the two countries to have a ""happy coexistence.""
	""My position and my government's position is to seek constructive engagement,"" Morrison said. ""The relationship with China is a mutually beneficial one. It supports both our countries, it is good for both of our countries.""
	China is Australia's largest trading partner.
	Morrison said Australia had made its views very clear on both the tweet and the WeChat message.
	WeChat is ubiquitous in China and is used for everything from getting news to making electronic payments. The company is held responsible for ensuring content doesn't attract negative attention, and censorship is relatively common.
	Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said he was disappointed about both the tweet and the deleted post.
	""What the prime minister did in his WeChat message before it was disappointingly deleted was he made it very clear Australia is proud of its service men and women who wear the uniform,"" Frydenberg said.
	The rift between the two nations has grown since the Australian government called for an independent inquiry into the origins of the coronavirus pandemic. China has since imposed tariffs and other restrictions on a number of Australian exports."

	Outspoken Hong Kong pro-democracy advocate and media tycoon Jimmy Lai was refused bail on Thursday on a fraud charge amid a growing crackdown on dissent in the semi-autonomous city.
	Jimmy Lai of Next Digital, which publishes the Apple Daily newspaper, was among 10 people arrested Aug. 10 on what police said was suspicion of violating a national security law and collusion with a foreign country.
	Lai, 73, was later released on bail but police raided his company's offices in October and took away documents.
	On Wednesday, Lai and two Next Digital executives were charged with fraud over accusations that they violated lease terms for Next Digital office space.
	Lai appeared in court Thursday and was denied bail. His case has been adjourned till April 16.
	Hong Kong police said in a statement Wednesday that it had arrested three men on charges of fraud, without naming them. It also said that one of them had been suspected of violating the national security law, and that it was still under investigation.
	Beijing imposed the national security law in response to protests in Hong Kong that began in June 2019 over a proposed extradition law and expanded to include demands for greater democracy in the former British colony.
	The sweeping legislation prompted more public protests and led to complaints that Beijing is violating the autonomy promised to Hong Kong when it returned to China and damaging its status as a business centre.
	Apple Daily criticized the law on its front page on July 1, calling it the ""final nail in the coffin"" of the territory's autonomy.
	The British government had slammed Lai's August arrest and said the security law was being used to crush dissent.
	The law is ""being implemented in a way that undermines freedom of speech,"" the British government said in a report this month on the status of the 1984 agreement for Hong Kong's return to China.
	""It is imperative that this freedom is fully respected,"" the report said.
	Lai was earlier arrested in February and April on charges of taking part in unauthorized protests. He also faces charges of joining an unauthorized vigil marking the anniversary of the June 4, 1989, crackdown on pro-democracy protests in Beijing's Tiananmen Square."

	Australia's economy grew by 3.3% in the third quarter, rebounding from its first recession in nearly three decades as it recovered from pandemic-related shocks, according to figures released Wednesday.
	Treasurer Josh Frydenberg told reporters the country still has a lot of ground to make up from the coronavirus downturn.
	""Australia's recession may be over, but Australia's economic recovery is not,"" he said.
	Despite the latest quarterly rise, the economy contracted at a 3.8% annual pace. That's after GDP fell by 0.3% in the first quarter and then by a record 7% in the second quarter.
	""But the Australian economy has demonstrated its remarkable resilience and Australia is as well positioned as any other nation on Earth,"" Frydenberg said. ""Today's national accounts represent a major step forward in Australia's economic recovery.""
	Before this year, Australia had managed to avoid a recession for 28 years. The economy grew even during the global financial crisis thanks to strong demand for Australia's mineral exports and a robust domestic sector.
	The better-than-expected figures were encouraging, economists said.
	""The rebound in Q3 GDP reversed around 40% of the decline during the first half of the year and we expect output to return to pre-virus levels by mid-2021,"" Ben Udy of Capital Economics said in a commentary.
	Now on top of the pandemic, Australia is enduring a spate of rocky relations with China, its biggest trading partner.
	Frydenberg said the situation with China is ""very serious"" but his government is focusing on striking deals with other countries in Asia and beyond.
	""We have great produce, and we have great services, and we have great resource sectors, and I'm very optimistic about the opportunities for our exporters around the world,"" he said.
	Australia's relationship with China worsened this week after a Chinese official tweeted a fake image of a grinning Australian soldier holding a bloodied knife to a child's throat.
	Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison called the image ""repugnant"" and demanded an apology from the Chinese government. But China has not backed down.
	The post took aim at alleged abuses by elite Australian soldiers during the conflict in Afghanistan.
	Tensions have been growing this year since the Australian government called for an independent inquiry into the origins of the pandemic. China has imposed tariffs and other restrictions on a number of Australian exports."

	The small German biotech firm BioNTech, started by a husband and wife team with Turkish roots, had never brought a vaccine to market before.Â 
	But its experimental technology has now become the first authorized for use in the Western world to help end the coronavirus pandemic.
	Along with its U.S. partner Pfizer, BioNTech on Wednesday said its COVID-19 vaccine has been granted approval by Britain, with a rollout planned for as early as next week.
	Mainz-based BioNTech was co-founded in 2008 by Ugur Sahin and his wife Ozlem Tureci, both scientists and the children of Turkish immigrants to Germany, as well as Austrian cancer expert Christoph Huber.
	In normal times, BioNTech and its roughly 1,500 employees are focused on developing specialised immunotherapies for cancer patients based on ""messenger RNA"" (mRNA) molecules that trigger the building of proteins in cells, to stimulate the immune system.
	It's this same technology, which has the benefit that it can be developed more quickly than traditional vaccines, that lies at the heart of its COVID-19 shot.
	The vaccine will introduce synthetic mRNA into the human body to trick the immune system into producing the viral proteins needed to provoke a safe but robust offensive against the coronavirus.
	Sahin, 54, jumped into action in January shortly after reading about the emergence of a new and deadly coronavirus in the Chinese city of Wuhan.Â 
	By the time much of the planet was in lockdown in March, BioNTech had developed 20 vaccine candidates based on mRNA technology, he told Der Spiegel weekly.
	Those were eventually whittled down to a handful of the most promising options, with vaccine BNT162b2 now the frontrunner.
	Having struck a deal with U.S. pharma giant Pfizer to work together to develop mRNA-based flu vaccines in 2018, teaming up on a potential coronavirus vaccine was an obvious next move for BioNTech.
	The two companies announced in March that they aimed to jointly develop a COVID-19 jab, ""pairing Pfizer's development, regulatory and commercial capabilities with BioNTech's mRNA vaccine technology and expertise"", they said at the time.
	While global headlines tend to lead with Pfizer's involvement, Sahin insisted to Spiegel: ""It is our technology.""
	The co-operation is a good fit because it allows BioNTech ""to develop and distribute a possible vaccine in the shortest time possible"", he added.
	The BNT162b2 vaccineÂ will require two jabs to be effective.
	BioNTech and Pfizer have said they expect to supply up to 50 million vaccine doses globally in 2020, and up to 1.3 billion in 2021.
	In a clear sign that they were gearing up for mass production, BioNTech in September bought a manufacturing site in Marburg in western Germany from Swiss pharma group Novartis, along with its 300 employees, allowing it to produce millions of additional doses each year.
	BioNTech already has two other production sites in Germany, while at least four Pfizer sites in the United States and Europe will join in the unprecedented effort to roll out a vaccine at record speed.
	Sahin had told AFP in an interview in November that if all the players involved -- governments, pharma companies and vaccine logistics firms -- ""do a really good job"", then ""we can succeed in vaccinating 60 to 70 percent of the population by the autumn of 2021.""
	""And when we've accomplished that then we could have a normal winter. Without another shutdown.""
	Besides Britain, the European Union and a slew of countries including the US and Japan have already placed orders for millions of doses of the BioNTech-Pfizer vaccine as nations eagerly await the regulatory nods.
	BioNTech has also struck a deal with Shanghai-based Fosun Pharmaceutical Group, which will have the exclusive rights to bring the vaccine to China."

              UN: Warmer world in 2020 busted weather records, hurt people

              An overheating world obliterated weather records in 2020, creating an extreme year for hurricanes, wildfires, heat waves, floods, droughts and ice melt, the United Nations' weather agency reports.

	An overheating world obliterated weather records in 2020, creating an extreme year for hurricanes, wildfires, heat waves, floods, droughts and ice melt, the United Nations' weather agency reported Wednesday.
	While the globe partly shut down due to the coronavirus pandemic, extremes linked to human-caused climate change intensified, the World Meteorological Organization said in its State of the Global Climate report. The report kicked off a day when the United Nations pushed for new climate action with two reports and a major speech by Secretary-General Antonio Guterres describing the woeful state of the planet.
	The UN is ramping up its efforts for a Dec. 12 climate summit in France on the 5th anniversary of the 2015 Paris climate agreement.
	The WMO report found that worsening global warming is being seen in all seven key climate indicators, but it said the problem is more than measurements and is increasing human suffering in an already bad year.
	""In 2020, over 50 million people have been doubly hit: by climate-related disasters (floods, droughts and storms) and the COVID-19 pandemic,"" the report said. ""Countries in Central America are suffering from the triple-impact of hurricanes Eta and Iota, COVID-19 and pre-existing humanitarian crises.""
	By the time it ends, 2020 will go down as one of three warmest years on record, despite a La Nina cooling of the central Pacific that often lowers temperatures globally, the WMO report said.
	This year is set to be about 1.2 degrees Celsius (2.2 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than the last half of the 1800s, which scientists use as a baseline for warming caused by heat-trapping gases from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas. Most trapped heat goes into the world's seas, and ocean temperatures now are at record levels, the report said.
	""There is at least a 1-in-5 chance of it temporarily exceeding 1.5 degrees Celsius by 2024,"" WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas said in a statement.
	The Paris climate accord set a goal of not exceeding 1.5 degrees (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) of warming since pre-industrial times.
	A new analysis by Climate Action Tracker scientists who monitor carbon pollution and pledges to cut them said public commitments to emission cuts, if kept, would limit warming to about 2.6 degrees Celsius (4.7 degrees Fahrenheit) and possibly as low as 2.1 degrees Celsius. Those public commitments include President-elect Joe Biden's promise that the U.S. will have zero net carbon emissions by 2050 and China's goal to do the same by 2060.
	""2020 was a shocking year, not only because of COVID, but also because of the impacts from extreme events we saw,"" said Cornell University climate scientist Natalie Mahowald, who wasn't part of the WMO report.
	Among the dozens of extremes that the report highlighted:
	-- A record 30 Atlantic named tropical storms and hurricanes, plus a record 12 that made U.S. landfalls.
	--Death Valley, California, hit 129.9 degrees (54.4 degrees Celsius), the hottest temperature the world has seen in 80 years, while the Los Angeles metropolitan area logged its hottest day on record with 120.9 degrees (49.4 degrees Celsius) in September.
	--Record wildfires struck California and Colorado in the western United States, following a major fire season in Australia, worsened by record heat.
	--The Arctic had record wildfires and a prolonged heat wave culminating in a 100-degree mark (38 degrees Celsius) in Siberia in June. Temperatures in Russia from January to August were 2.7 degrees (1.5 degrees Celsius) hotter than the previous record.
	--Record low Arctic sea ice was reported for April and August and the yearly minimum, in September, was the second lowest on record.
	--More than 2,000 people died in record summer rains and flooding in Pakistan and surrounding nations. Extensive flooding from extreme rains in Africa killed hundreds of people in Kenya and Sudan. And in China, the overflowing Yangtze River killed at least 279 people.
	--Near-record drought and heat caused heavy crop losses in South America. Much of central Europe had extensive drought, with a record 43-day spring dry spell in Geneva, home of the WMO.
	Mahowald of Cornell said while these events can't solely be blamed on climate change, ""these are the types of events scientists fear will increase due to climate change."""

	Hong Kong pro-democracy activist Joshua Wong has been sentenced to 13.5 months in prison after pleading guilty to inciting and organizing an unauthorized protest outside the city's police headquarters last year, during months of unrest over a proposed extradition bill with China.
	Two other activists, Agnes Chow and Ivan Lam, were sentenced to 10 months and seven months in prison respectively over the protest on June 21, 2019. Chow faced charges relating to inciting and taking part in the protest, while Lam was charged with inciting the protest.
	The trio -- all former members of the disbanded political party Demosisto -- had been remanded in custody since Nov. 23, and were transferred from prison to court to hear their sentences. Hundreds of supporters turned out at the West Kowloon Magistrates Court Wednesday, as well as a small number of pro-China demonstrators.
	In a letter he wrote in prison, published on his social media accounts prior to sentencing, Wong -- who faced up to three years in jail -- described how he had been placed in solitary confinement after an X-ray allegedly revealed ""foreign objects"" in his stomach. A prison service representative did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Wong's claims. 
	Wong's lawyer, Jonathan Man, said his client ""was suffering during the period of solitary confinement,"" which he said ended last Thursday. Man added that while Lam was ""okay,"" 23-year-old Chow was struggling in prison, as ""it is the first time she was remanded and (she) was not used to the environment.""
	In a letter posted to Chow's social media accounts prior to Wednesday's sentencing, she wrote that she was having trouble sleeping and was feeling ""under the weather."" Chow added that she was ""very worried"" about the ""high possibility"" of her receiving a jail term. ""I hope that everyone outside the prison walls are doing well,"" she said.
	Wednesday's sentence marks the fourth time Wong has been jailed, and the longest sentence he has received, with previous stints in prison all lasting less than six months.
	In the sentencing document, the court said that ""deterrent sentences are warranted to safeguard public interests.""
	""Once again, the government has used the politically motivated charge of 'inciting others to protest' to prosecute people who have merely spoken out and protested peacefully,"" Amnesty International's Asia-Pacific regional director Yamini Mishra said in a statement.
	""By targeting well-known activists from Hong Kong's largely leaderless protest movement, authorities are sending a warning to anyone who dares openly criticize the government that they could be next.""
	Mishra added that ""even in protests where isolated acts of violence took place and public property was damaged, these should not be attributed to others or the organizers, or to the assembly in general.""
	Wednesday's sentencing was the latest related to the 2019 protests. About 2,000 people have faced charges such as rioting, illegal assembly and possession of weapons.
	Wong himself faces other charges over a rally in October last year, and police have said investigations into the unrest are continuing.
	Last month, a number of former pro-democracy lawmakers were arrested over protests staged in the city's legislature, while a reporter for public broadcaster RTHK was also detained.
	The protests have largely stopped this year, due to COVID-19 social distancing restrictions and the national security law imposed on the city by Beijing in the summer. The law criminalizes secession, subversion and collusion with foreign forces, and carries with it strict prison terms.
	It was used to bar Wong and a number of other candidates from standing for elections that were due to be held in September, but were postponed because of the coronavirus. Several of those disqualified were sitting lawmakers, who were subsequently ejected from the parliament by Beijing -- overruling constitutional precedent and bypassing Hong Kong's courts -- on November 11, sparking the mass resignation of the entire pro-democratic camp.
	The move came the same week as the U.S. State Department sanctioned a number of top Chinese officials in Hong Kong for ""threatening the peace, security, and autonomy"" of the city, a move the local government described as ""barbaric interference.""
	Other countries have also criticized China over the ongoing crackdown, with the European Council saying the move to disqualify opposition lawmakers constituted a ""further severe blow"" to freedom of opinion in the city and ""significantly undermines Hong Kong's autonomy.""
	Some in Hong Kong have reacted to the worsening political system by emigrating -- or in the case of those facing prosecution, fleeing abroad.
	This summer, a dozen Hong Kongers were arrested by the Chinese coast guard en route to Taiwan. All are now detained on the mainland and facing a raft of charges. A former independence activist, Tony Chung, was also arrested after allegedly attempting to claim asylum at the US consulate to Hong Kong, along with several others.
	In his letter from prison, Wong urged the public to ""continue to pay attention"" to the 12 detained in China. Separately Tuesday, parliamentarians from 18 countries wrote to Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam to urge her to intervene on their behalf.
	""In your role as Chief Executive, it is incumbent on you to intercede on behalf of these young people to ensure that they are guaranteed justice,"" the lawmakers wrote, expressing concern about a justice system ""where imprisonment is essentially guaranteed, torture is common and forced confessions are frequently demanded of suspects.""
	""To continue to fail to do so would be a gross abdication of your responsibility to serve the people of Hong Kong and ensure their wellbeing and safety,"" the letter added."

China #MeToo case heard in court after more than 2 years

	A Chinese woman who filed a sexual misconduct lawsuit against a TV host told cheering supporters at a courthouse Wednesday that she hopes her case will encourage victims of gender violence in a system that gives them few options to pursue complaints.
	Zhou Xiaoxuan spoke ahead of a trial in her lawsuit, which was delayed for two years and reflects the challenges Chinese women face in pursuing sexual misconduct complaints despite the spread of the global #MeToo movement.
	Zhou, 27, has accused Zhu Jun, a popular state TV host, of forcibly kissing her in 2014. She is asking for a public apology as well as 50,000 yuan (US$7,600) in damages.
	Zhu has denied the accusation and filed a defamation case against Zhou.
	""Even if ultimately in this case we don't get a legal win, as long as we can show to a lot of people (that) there are people like me, those of us who are victims of gender violence, that's already a type of win,"" Zhou said outside the Haidian District People's court in Beijing.
	A verdict was not expected on Wednesday.
	The movement took off in 2018 in China when a college student in Beijing publicly accused her professor of sexual misconduct.
	The #MeToo global movement helped encourage activism in China, but came at a time when President Xi Jinping's government is tightening controls and stamping out dissent.
	Women who complain face censorship and official resistance. The movement has seen few victories, and it was only in 2019 that sexual misconduct was added to court regulations as grounds for a suit.
	In a rare victory, a woman who used the alias Liu Li won a case against her former boss in July. The boss, a social worker in the western city of Chengdu, was required to issue a public apology but no damages were awarded.
	""Together, we want to demand answers from history,"" read a sign held by a few dozen supporters outside the courthouse in Beijing on Wednesday. Others carried .Metoo signs.
	Many yelled ""jiayou,"" or ""add oil,"" a common Chinese phrase as reassurance to Zhou, who cried after speaking.
	Videographers working for foreign news agencies were taken away by police soon after Zhou gave her statement. It was unclear why they were held.

	Britain became the first country in the world to authorize a rigorously tested COVID-19 vaccine Wednesday and could be dispensing shots within days -- a historic step toward eventually ending the outbreak that has killed more than 1.4 million people around the globe.
	In giving the go-ahead for emergency use of the vaccine developed by American drugmaker Pfizer and Germany's BioNTech, Britain vaulted past the United States by at least a week. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is not scheduled to consider the vaccine until Dec. 10.
	""This is a day to remember, frankly, in a year to forget,"" British Health Secretary Matt Hancock said.
	The announcement sets the stage for the biggest vaccination campaign in British history and came just ahead of what experts are warning will be a long, dark winter, with the coronavirus surging to epic levels in recent weeks in the U.S. and Europe.
	Officials cautioned that several tough months still lie ahead even in Britain, given the monumental task of inoculating large swaths of the population. Because of the limited initial supply, the first shots will be reserved for those most in danger, namely nursing home residents, the elderly and health care workers.
	Britain's Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency recommended the vaccine after clinical trials involving tens of thousands of volunteers showed it was 95% effective and turned up no serious side effects. The vaccine is still considered experimental while final testing is done.
	""This is an unprecedented piece of science,"" given that the vaccine was authorized less than a year after the virus was discovered, said David Harper, senior consulting fellow in global health at the Chatham House think-tank .
	Prime Minister Boris Johnson declared that the ""searchlights of science"" had picked out the ""invisible enemy,"" which has been blamed for close to 60,000 deaths in Britain. He said that in developing the vaccine, scientists had performed ""biological jujitsu"" by turning the virus on itself.
	Other countries aren't far behind: Regulators in not only the U.S. but the European Union and Canada also are vetting the Pfizer vaccine along with a shot made by Moderna. British and Canadian regulators are also considering a vaccine made by AstraZeneca and Oxford University.
	Amid growing concern that Americans will greet vaccines with skepticism, U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said Britain's decision ""should give Americans additional confidence in the quality of such a vaccine."" The virus has killed more than 270,000 in the U.S. On Wednesday, the head of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention signed off on an expert panel's recommendation that health care workers and nursing home residents be the first to be vaccinated when shots become available.
	Hancock said Britain will begin receiving the first shipment of 800,000 doses from Belgium within days, and people will start getting the shots as soon as it arrives. Two doses three weeks apart are required. The country expects to receive millions of doses by the end of this year, Hancock said, though the exact number will depend on how fast it can be manufactured and checked for quality.
	BioNTech, which owns the vaccine, said it has so far signed deals to supply 570 million doses worldwide in 2021, with options to deliver 600 million more. It hopes to supply at least 1.3 billion in 2021.
	That is only a fraction of what will be needed as public health officials try to vaccinate much of the world's population. Experts have said several vaccines will be required to quickly end the pandemic that has infected more than 64 million people globally.
	In Britain, the first shots will go to nursing home residents and those who care for them, followed by everyone over 80 and health care workers. From there, the program will be expanded as the supply increases, with the vaccine offered roughly on the basis of age groups, starting with the oldest people.
	Amid the burst of optimism, Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla warned governments against any immediate move to relax restrictions and reopen their economies.
	""The time that we will have to go back to normality is not far away,"" he said. ""But it is definitely not now.""
	Despite the speed with which they approved the vaccine, and the intense political pressure surrounding the worldwide race to solve the crisis, British regulators insisted ""no corners have been cut"" during the review process.
	The MHRA made its recommendation after a so-called rolling review that allowed it to assess information about the vaccine as it came in, starting back in October.
	""The safety of the public will always come first,"" said Dr. June Raine, the agency's chief executive. ""And I emphasize again that this recommendation has only been given by the MHRA following the most rigorous scientific assessment of every piece of data.""
	Getting that message to the public will be critical if any vaccination program is to be successful. Some people are worried about getting any vaccine, never mind a new one.
	""But I think once they understand and see everyone else having it without hesitation, I think you'll find that people will go and have it,"" Jacqueline Roubians, a 76-year-old retired nurse, said at Brixton Market in London. ""People are dying of COVID, so you make that decision: Do you want to die or do you want the vaccine?""
	In addition to the huge logistical challenges of distributing the vaccines, the Pfizer-BioNTech one must be stored and shipped at ultra-cold temperatures of around minus 70 degrees Celsius (minus 94 degrees Fahrenheit).
	Pfizer said it has developed shipping containers that use dry ice and GPS-enabled sensors will allow the company to track each shipment and ensure it stays cold.
	Every country has different rules for determining when an experimental vaccine is safe and effective enough to use. China and Russia have offered different vaccines to their citizens before they had gone through large-scale, late-stage testing.
	Hours after Britain's announcement, Russian President Vladimir Putin, not to be outdone, ordered the start of a large-scale COVID-19 vaccination campaign by late next week, with doctors and teachers to be first in line to receive the Sputnik V shot, whose name was inspired by the 1957 satellite that was one of Moscow's proudest technical achievements.
	The Russian vaccine won regulatory approval in August but has yet to complete advanced studies of its effectiveness and safety. Health Minister Mikhail Murashko said more than 100,000 people in Russia have been given the shots.
	Still to be determined is whether the Pfizer-BioNTech shots prevent people from spreading the virus when they have no symptoms. Another question is how long protection lasts.
	The vaccine also has been tested in only a small number of children, none younger than 12, and there's no information on its effects in pregnant women.

	The captain of a scuba diving boat that caught fire and sank off the coast of California last year, killing 34 people who were trapped below deck, was indicted Tuesday on federal manslaughter charges for one of the deadliest maritime disasters in recent U.S. history.
	Jerry Boylan was charged with 34 counts of seaman's manslaughter for ""misconduct, negligence and inattention"" by failing to train his crew, conduct fire drills and have a roving night watchman on the Conception when fire broke out Sept. 2, 2019, the indictment said.
	""As a result of the alleged failures of Captain Boylan to follow well-established safety rules, a pleasant holiday dive trip turned into a hellish nightmare as passengers and one crew member found themselves trapped in a fiery bunkroom with no means of escape,"" U.S. Attorney Nick Hanna said in a statement.
	Boylan and four other crew members, who had all been sleeping, escaped from the flaming boat after he made a breathless mayday call. All 33 passengers and one crew member perished in the bunkroom.
	Some of the dead were found with their shoes on, leading to speculation they were trying to escape but were trapped by flames that blocked a stairwell and a small hatch that were the only exits to the deck above. All died of smoke inhalation, according to coroner's reports.
	The rare federal charges against Boylan were brought under a pre-Civil War law aimed at holding steamboat captains and crew responsible for watery disasters that were far more frequent at the time.
	Federal safety investigators faulted the owners of the vessel for a lack of oversight, but they were not charged with any crime.
	""I hate the term accident in this case because, in my opinion, it is not an accident if you fail to operate your company safely,"" National Transportation Safety Board member Jennifer Homendy said at a hearing in October.
	The company that owned the boat, Truth Aquatics Inc., has filed suit in federal court under a provision in maritime law to avoid payouts to the families of the victims. The families of 32 victims have filed claims against boat owners Glen and Dana Fritzler and the company.
	The cause of the fire was been under investigation for more there a year and may be impossible to pinpoint. It began in an area on the main deck where divers had plugged in phones, flashlights and other items with combustible lithium ion batteries.
	The fire happened on the final night of a three-day Labor Day weekend scuba diving excursion near Santa Cruz Island off Santa Barbara.
	The 34 victims ranged from a new deckhand to scientists and engineers to parents with their teenage and adult children. They came from as far away as China, Singapore and India. Two passengers were celebrating birthdays.
	The sole crewmember who died, Allie Kurtz, 26, had previously worked as a cook on another Truth Aquatics boat and was thrilled with her promotion. Her family said she loved the water and had childhood aspirations of becoming a pirate.
	Marine biologist Kristy Finstad, who co-owned Worldwide Diving Adventures and chartered the Labor Day Weekend trip, first put on a dive tank at the age of nine and had done hundreds of dives in the rugged, wind-swept Channel Islands, off Santa Barbara's coast.
	Five members of the Quitasol family took the trip to celebrate their father's birthday. Sisters Angela, Nicole and Evan joined their father, Michael Quitasol, and their stepmother, Fernisa Sison. The family had been scuba diving together for at least a decade.
	Before the disaster, Boylan and Truth Aquatics had a good reputation with customers and the boating community in Santa Barbara, where the company had a fleet of three boats. The Conception had passed its two most recent Coast Guard safety inspections.
	But NTSB investigators condemned the company and captain for a litany of issues including failing to train the crew on emergency procedures.
	Ryan Sims, who had been working aboard the boat for just three weeks, told investigators he had asked the captain to discuss emergency plans the day before the fire.
	""When we have time,"" Boylan replied, Sims reported.
	""I didn't know what the procedures were supposed to be,"" Sims said, echoing what other crew members told investigators.
	The NTSB said the lack of a night watch allowed the fire to spread quickly and trap victims below deck. The agency also faulted the Coast Guard for not enforcing the night watch requirement, citing records showing no one cited for failing to provide one since 1991.
	Crew members told investigators they were asleep on the upper deck when the fire broke out below around 3 a.m.
	They said they made repeated attempts to reach those below deck. But the flames and heat kept them back and eventually forced them to jump overboard.
	Boylan made a mayday call at 3:14 a.m. saying, ""I can't breathe,"" before abandoning ship.
	Sims, who has sued the boat's owners, broke a leg jumping from the boat.
	The crew climbed into a dinghy and motored to a yacht anchored nearby to call again for help.
	""One thing we never heard was any screams or banging or anything from the boat, both while we were on it or when we were close,"" Cullen Molitor, the boat's second captain, told investigators."

              '76 Days,' a new documentary shot in four Wuhan hospitals, captures a local horror before it became a global nightmare.

                ",https://www.ctvnews.ca/entertainment/in-76-days-a-documentary-portrait-of-lockdown-in-wuhan-1.5212758,"NEW YORK -- 
	""Papa!"" screams a hospital worker, covered from head to toe in a Hazmat suit and PPE, in the opening moments of the documentary ""76 Days.""
	This is in the early days of the pandemic in Wuhan, back in January and February when the city of 11 million went into a 2 1/2-month lockdown and hospitals were overrun. The health worker's father has just died, and her agony at not being able to sit by his side is overwhelming. Her colleagues restrain her as she sobs, moaning, ""Papa, you'll stay forever in my heart.""
	""76 Days,"" shot in four Wuhan hospitals, captures a local horror before it became a global nightmare. Given the constraints at the time on footage and information from Wuhan, it's a rare window into the infancy of the pandemic. The film is directed by the New York-based filmmaker Hao Wu, who worked with two Chinese journalists -- one named Weixi Chen, the other is remaining anonymous -- to create of a portrait of the virus epicenter.
	Some of the images document the fear and confusion of those early days: A group of patients mill outside the hospital doors, pleading to be let in. Others are by now more familiar: Solitary deaths followed by phone calls to family members.
	""There has been so much news coverage and commentary about the pandemic but most of that has primarily been about statistics and our political divide,"" Wu said in an interview. ""What I think is missing is the human stories, the human faces of the pandemic.""
	That may be especially true for stories of the pandemic from China, which President Donald Trump and his supporters have been highly critical of, blaming it for the ""Wuhan virus."" Wu's film, though, consciously avoids politics to concentrate on the humanity inside the hospitals -- even if the workers are so obscured by their Hazmat suits that they're only identifiable by the names penned in sharpie on their backs.
	""I feel like right now there is such a toxic background to a lot of the discussions around the virus,"" Wu says. ""The virus is an enemy that doesn't care about your nationality.""
	""76 Days,"" which premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival in September, is being released Friday by MTV Documentary Films is more than 50 virtual cinemas. Last month, it was nominated for best documentary by the IFP Gotham Awards.
	It's among the first in a coming surge of coronavirus documentaries. A handful have already arrived, some -- snapshots in an ongoing drama -- hurriedly edited even as the scope of the pandemic has continued to expand. In October, Alex Gibney released ""Totally Under Control,"" a two-part indictment of the federal U.S. response to the virus. In August, the artist-activist Ai Weiwei debuted ""Coronation,"" a documentary he directed remotely with dozens of volunteers to capture the lockdown experience for ordinary Chinese people.
	For some, the films are too harsh a reminder of an all-consuming reality. But ""76 Days"" feels like a vital early draft of history. Wu's first instinct had been to create a more straightforwardly journalistic film examining what happened in Wuhan. But Wu -- a Chinese native who lives in New York with his partner and two children (he depicted his journey as a gay man in a traditional Chinese family in the 2019 Netflix documentary ""All in My Family"" ) -- soon recognized the difficulty of access and the rapidly changing situation would make such a film either very difficult or potentially stale by the time it was finished.
	""The images coming out of Wuhan were so harrowing. Everyone was scouring social media, trying to find out what happened in Wuhan, how it got so bad. A lot of us were so angry,"" he says. ""I started getting away from wanting to assign blame.""
	The journalists, working with press passes, would have typically been closely watched by Communist party minders but in the chaos were given more free rein. Wu leaned into a more observational approach without talking heads, and urged his collaborators to focus on the people and the details. One poignant shot shows the ziplocked cellphone of a deceased person quietly ringing.
	Wu's last trip to China was in January and February. Right after he came back, his grandfather was diagnosed with late stage liver cancer. He would die a month later. Wu, unable to visit because of travel restrictions and busy on the film, wasn't able to say goodbye in person.
	""For me, I was compelled to tell the story. It's almost like a tribute to my grandfather,"" says Wu. ""The shots that attracted me were those that showed the details of people willing to be nice to each other. I guess it was guilty about not being able to say goodbye to my grandfather, to hold his hand."""

	The companies say they now expect the transaction to close on Jan. 29, 2021.
	Bombardier has been working to transform itself from a maker of trains and aircraft into a company focused on business jets.
	Alstom shareholders voted to approve the deal on Oct. 29.

	The sale is expected to make Alstom the second-largest manufacturer of rolling stock, behind China's CRRC.
	Alstom has committed to establish its North American headquarters in Montreal, which will oversee 13,000 employees, set up a research centre and improve production at the Bombardier Transport plant in La Pocatiere, where the order book is almost empty.

China spacecraft lands on moon to bring rocks back to Earth

	A Chinese spacecraft sent to return lunar rocks to Earth collected its first samples Wednesday after landing on the moon, the government announced, adding to a string of successes for Beijing's increasingly ambitious space program.
	The Chang'e 5 probe touched down shortly after 11 p.m. (1500 GMT) on Tuesday after descending from an orbiter, the China National Space Administration said. It released images of the barren scene at the landing site showing the lander's shadow.
	""Chang'e has collected moon samples,"" the agency said in a statement carried by the official Xinhua News Agency. It said the probe also had successfully unfolded solar panels that will power it.
	The probe, launched Nov. 24 from the tropical southern island of Hainan, is the latest venture by a Chinese space program that sent its first astronaut into orbit in 2003, has a spacecraft en route to Mars and aims eventually to land a human on the moon.
	Plans call for the lander to spend about two days drilling into the lunar surface and collecting 2 kilograms (4.4 pounds) of rocks and debris. The top stage of the probe will be launched back into lunar orbit to transfer the samples to a capsule for return to Earth, where it is to land in China's northern grasslands in mid-December.
	If it succeeds, it will be the first time scientists have obtained fresh samples of lunar rocks since a Soviet probe in the 1970s. Those samples are expected to be made available to scientists from other nations, although its unclear how much access NASA will have, given tight U.S. government restrictions on space co-operation with China.
	From the rocks and debris, scientists hope to learn more about the moon, including its precise age, as well as increased knowledge about other bodies in our solar system. Collecting samples, including from asteroids, is an increasing focus of many space programs and China's mastery of the technology once again places it among the leading nations operating in space.
	American and Russian space officials congratulated the Chinese program.
	""Congratulations to China on the successful landing of Chang'e 5. This is no easy task,"" wrote NASA's science mission chief, Thomas Zurbuchen, on Twitter.
	""When the samples collected on the Moon are returned to Earth, we hope everyone will benefit from being able to study this precious cargo that could advance the international science community.""
	The most recent return of lunar rocks to Earth was carried out in 1976 by Luna 24, a Soviet robot probe.
	U.S. astronauts brought back 842 pounds (382 kilograms) of lunar samples from 1969 to 1972, some of which is still being analyzed and experimented on.
	The Chang'e 5 flight is China's third successful lunar landing. Its predecessor, Chang'e 4, was the first probe to land on the moon's little-explored far side.
	Chinese space program officials have said they envision future crewed missions along with robotic ones, including possibly a permanent research base. No timeline or other details have been announced.
	The latest flight includes collaboration with the European Space Agency, which is helping to monitor the mission.
	China's space program has proceeded more cautiously than the U.S.-Soviet space race of the 1960s, which was marked by fatalities and launch failures.
	In 2003, China became the third country to send an astronaut into orbit on its own after the Soviet Union and the United States. It also launched a crewed space station.
	China, along with neighbours Japan and India, also has joined the growing race to explore Mars. The Tianwen 1 probe launched in July is on its way to the red planet carrying a lander and a rover to search for water."

              OPEC talks on production hit snag as pandemic clouds outlook

                ",https://www.ctvnews.ca/business/opec-talks-on-production-hit-snag-as-pandemic-clouds-outlook-1.5211678,"FRANKFURT -- 
	The OPEC oil producers' cartel was to push ahead with a new round of discussions Tuesday about how much to pump next year as countries wrestled over whether to extend the production cuts that have been supporting prices depressed by the pandemic.
	Members adjourned a videoconference after a first day of deliberations Monday ended without an agreement. They also put off from Tuesday to Thursday a meeting with non-OPEC oil producers like Russia, who have been co-ordinating their actions with the cartel in recent years to increase their influence.
	Oil producing countries face a difficult situation. The pandemic has sapped demand for fuel across the economy, which induced them to cut back production this year to keep prices from sagging even more than they have. Yet the lower production means less revenue for governments that depend on oil sales to fill state coffers.
	And the outlook for demand is mixed across the globe; economies in the U.S. and Europe have been disrupted by a second upsurge in coronavirus infections, while activity and travel in China have rebounded more strongly.
	Oil traded 19 cents lower at $45.15 per barrel Tuesday on the New York Mercantile Exchange. That is off from $63 at the start of 2020.
	The sag in demand has been reflected in lower prices to consumers for auto fuel in the U.S. Gasoline prices at the pump dipped well below $2 per gallon in many parts of the country in May as the pandemic took hold, and have remained flat after a mild rebound. The U.S. average was $2.12 as of Nov. 30, down 45 cents from the same week a year earlier but little changed from this summer, according to the U.S. Energy Information Agency.
	Analysts at UniCredit bank said the oil producing countries were likely to agree to extend this year's production cuts of about 7.7 million barrels a day.
	âIn our view, the delay should not be a concern and we still expect the current curbs to be extended into the first quarter of 2021,â they said, adding that it is not unusual for OPEC meetings to last longer than scheduled and virtual discussions slow the negotiation process.
	âMoreover, both Saudi Arabia and Russia - the two leaders of the group - favour an extension of the cuts and this should be enough to square the circle and finalize the deal on Thursday.â Saudi Arabia tends to take a leadership role within OPEC, while Russia is the biggest non-OPEC country to co-ordinate with the cartel."

              Scientists find new clues, but origin of COVID-19 still a mystery
          
","
              While many scientists are racing to find vaccines to tame the spread of the coronavirus pandemic, other researchers are probing the past, trying to unravel one of the greatest mysteries of the virus: exactly where it came from.

	While many scientists are racing to find vaccines to tame the spread of the coronavirus pandemic, other researchers are probing the past, trying to unravel one of the greatest mysteries of the virus: exactly where it came from.
	The World Health Organization has assembled an international team of 10 scientists to trace the origins of the virus.
	They will have to investigate both the suspect animals and how the first patients may have been infected.
	""We want to know the origin and we will do everything to know the origin,"" WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told reporters on Monday.
	But success is by no means assured.
	The first cases were reported in the Chinese city of Wuhan a year ago, before countries across the world began to record growing infections.
	The WHO said the first cases in Wuhan are believed to date from the beginning of December.
	But ""where an epidemic is first detected does not necessarily reflect where it started"", it added in a November report.
	In recent months, researchers in various countries have suggested that cases may have gone unnoticed long before December 2019, based on analysis of wastewater or blood samples.
	But there is a lack of ""clear evidence"" to back up these claims, said Etienne Simon-Loriere, of the virology department at the Institut Pasteur in Paris.
	To establish a virus family tree, researchers rely on genetic analysis.
	This can help ""better understand transmission dynamics, particularly how the virus may have evolved over time and how clusters might be related in time and place"", the WHO said.
	Scientists agree that the disease has an animal origin.
	""The big question is what led it to jump into humans,"" Etienne Simon-Loriere told AFP.
	Suspicions have fallen on bats, which are ""a major reservoir for coronaviruses"", he adds.
	But there would likely have been an intermediary animal to shepherd SARS-CoV-2 into people.
	The pangolin -- a mammal subject to rampant regional wildlife smuggling -- was identified as a likely carrier early on based on genetic analysis. But the case is not settled.
	WHO investigators will need to clarify this point by probing the wet market in Wuhan, which sold live and wild animals and has been linked to many of the early cases.
	The team will be armed with clues we did not have at the start of the pandemic.
	Simon-Loriere said they could look out for an animal with a virus receptor, a protein called ACE2, similar to the one found in humans.
	It is through this receptor that the virus latches onto cells.
	Some animals such as mink and ferrets have been found to have a very similar receptor to humans, while others are quite different.
	Another origin theory that swirled in conspiracy rumours for months was that the Wuhan Institute of Virology was involved in the outbreak.
	Against the backdrop of diplomatic tensions, U.S. President Donald Trump touted the idea, claiming the virus could have leaked from the biosafety lab.
	China has rejected the accusations.
	While Simon-Loriere said it was not yet possible to completely rule out the idea that the virus escaped accidentally, he stressed that there was ""no indication it was manmade"".
	""All the elements of its genome have already been observed in nature, mainly in bat coronaviruses,"" he said.
	The WHO says understanding how an epidemic began is ""essential to preventing further introductions to the human population"".
	But it has warned that the process of tracing how a disease jumped from animals ""is a riddle that can take years to solve"".
	""The introduction of a new virus to the human population is one of the greatest mysteries an epidemiologist can hope to unravel,"" it said.
	The goal is to ""understand the mechanism and put in place measures to avoid the emergence of a new SARS-CoV-3, 4, etc."", said Simon-Loriere.
	For example, during the 2002 SARS epidemic, a ban on the consumption of civet cats -- identified as an intermediary host of that coronavirus -- is credited with having helped prevent the reintroduction of the virus into humans.
	The UN health agency sent an advance team to Beijing in July to lay the groundwork for the probe.
	But it has remained unclear when the larger team will be able to travel to China to start its work.
	In late November the WHO said it hoped to have a larger team of scientists on the ground ""as soon as possible"".
	The U.S. has accused Beijing of not being transparent, while it says the WHO kowtowed to China and dragged its feet in investigating how the outbreak first started.
	Others have voiced concern that the agency may have allowed China to dictate the terms of an international investigation into the origins of the virus.
	Tedros told critics to stop ""politicising"" the issue on Monday."

	New Zealand has joined Australia in denouncing a graphic tweet posted by a Chinese official that shows a fake image of a grinning Australian soldier holding a bloodied knife to a child's throat.
	Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said Tuesday that New Zealand has voiced its concerns directly with Chinese authorities.
	""This is an image that wasn't factual. It wasn't correct. And so in keeping with our principled position where images like that are used, we will raise those concerns and we'll do it directly,"" Ardern told reporters.
	China has not backed down from the tweet and said there will be no apology.
	Ardern's criticism was more muted than Australia's. She faced an awkward choice of how far to get involved in a conflict between New Zealand's closest ally, Australia, and its biggest trading partner, China.
	Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison on Monday called the image ""repugnant"" and demanded an apology from the Chinese government. The post took aim at alleged abuses by Australian soldiers during the conflict in Afghanistan.
	The incident is further souring already tense relations between Australia and China.
	The image, which appeared to show the soldier slitting the child's throat, was posted by Zhao Lijian, a spokesman for China's foreign ministry. He wrote a caption with his tweet: ""Shocked by murder of Afghan civilians & prisoners by Australian soldiers. We strongly condemn such acts, & call for holding them accountable.""
	He was referring to a disturbing report by Australia's military earlier this month which found evidence that elite Australian troops unlawfully killed 39 Afghan prisoners, farmers and civilians during the Afghanistan conflict. The report recommended that 19 soldiers be referred to federal police for criminal investigation.
	Asked about the issue at a daily briefing, foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying cast blame on the Australian side.
	""What Australia should do is to reflect deeply, bring the perpetrators to justice, make a formal apology to the Afghan people, and solemnly promise to the international community that they will never commit such terrible crimes again,"" Hua said.
	Morrison said Zhao's tweet was ""utterly outrageous"" and a terrible slur against Australia's military.
	It ""is truly repugnant. It is deeply offensive to every Australian, every Australian who has served in that uniform,"" he told reporters in Canberra. ""The Chinese government should be totally ashamed of this post. It diminishes them in the world's eyes.""
	Morrison said his government contacted Twitter asking it to take the post down. The post had a warning tag on it on Tuesday but could still be viewed. Zhao's account comes with a Twitter label stating that it's a Chinese government account.
	Despite China blocking Twitter and other U.S. social media platforms within the county, Chinese diplomats and state media have established a strong presence on them.
	Zhao was criticized by the U.S. in March after tweeting a conspiracy theory that U.S. soldiers may have brought the coronavirus to China. He is considered a leading representative of China's high-pitched new strain of assertive foreign relations.
	Morrison acknowledged there were tensions between China and Australia.
	""But this is not how you deal with them,"" he said. ""Australia has patiently sought to address the tensions that exist in our relationship in a mature way, in a responsible way, by seeking engagement at both leader and ministerial level.""
	The rift between the two nations has grown since the Australian government called for an independent inquiry into the origins of the coronavirus pandemic. China has since imposed tariffs and other restrictions on a number of Australian exports."

	Zhou Xiaoxuan's says her prestigious internship with Chinese state TV soured after a popular host forcibly kissed her.
	Outraged, Zhou took the previously taboo step of filing a lawsuit in 2018, joining the global #MeToo movement against sexual harassment. But the ruling Communist Party dislikes such grassroots activism and offers few ways to pursue complaints. Zhou waited two years for a hearing, while the host fought back by filing a defamation lawsuit.
	On Wednesday, Zhou's case goes to trial in Beijing, highlighting the growing willingness of Chinese women to speak up about sexual harassment despite official resistance and censorship that eroded #MeToo's impact.
	""There are very few sexual harassment cases who have a court hearing,"" Zhou said. ""We hope each individual case can be a type of push forward.""
	The ruling party, whose late leader Mao Zedong famously declared, ""women hold up half the sky,"" has improved their legal and social status but is far from delivering on its promise of equality. In some areas, conditions are deteriorating: Women have disappeared from leadership roles over the past three decades.
	#MeToo's global spread helped to encourage activism in China. But that came at a time when President Xi Jinping's government is tightening controls and stamping out dissent.
	Women who complain face censorship and official resistance. It was only in 2019 that sexual harassment was added to court regulations as grounds for a suit.
	Zhou accuses CCTV host Zhu Jun of groping and forcibly kissing her in 2014. She is asking for a public apology as well as 50,000 yuan (US$7,600) in damages.
	In a series of social media posts, she said she was alone with Zhu in his dressing room for a few minutes. She said he tried to reach into her dress and drag her onto himself, and then forcibly kissed her. The posts were shared widely and reposted by many on the Chinese internet and prompted a great amount of media coverage.
	When Zhou filed suit in 2018, such complaints were treated as labour disputes or under other laws that didn't relate directly to sexual harassment. Zhou's was termed a ""personality rights dispute.""
	Her lawyers have asked for it to be heard under the new legal provision that explicitly cites sexual harassment.
	Zhu, the CCTV host, has denied the allegations. A call to his phone wasn't answered. A person who answered at the number in public records for the law firm that represents him said the firm had moved and had no new number.
	Zhu has a countersuit pending against Zhou asking for damages of 650,000 yuan (US$100,000).
	Zhou expressed hope her case will show ""there are problems in the legal process.""
	The movement took off in 2018 in China when a college student in Beijing publicly accused her professor of sexual harassment.
	In a rare victory, a woman who used the alias Liu Li won a sexual harassment suit against her former boss in July. The boss, a social worker in the western city of Chengdu, was required to issue a public apology but no damages were awarded.
	Activists want more legislative changes and legal tools.
	""No matter what the result is, we feel that doing this has meaning,"" Zhou said."

	The European Medicines Agency plans to convene a meeting by Dec. 29 to decide if there is enough safety and efficacy data about the vaccine developed by Pfizer and BioNTech for it to be approved, the regulator said. The agency also said it could decide as early as Jan. 12 whether to approve a rival shot by American pharmaceutical company Moderna Inc, which was submitted to U.S. and European regulators this week.
	If its vaccine is approved, Germany-based BioNTech said its use in Europe could begin before the end of 2020 - but that seems quite ambitious, given that the EU Commission usually needs to rubber-stamp the regulator's decision. Still, the regulator has also left open the possibility that the date of that meeting will be brought forward if data comes in faster.
	The approval date now being eyed would be later than some European countries had hoped. Germany, which has given BioNTech 375 million euros ($450 million) in funding to develop the vaccine, has been preparing to start immunizing people from mid-December onward.
	On Tuesday, officials in Germany, France and the Netherlands cautioned that vaccine programs likely won't start until the end of the year.
	âWith the information we got in recent days we have to assume that approval will only happen around the turn of the year,â German Health Minister Jens Spahn said.
	âIt has moved because some studies obviously need a little longer to be submitted,â he said. âWhat's important is to be prepared.â
	His comments were echoed by French President Emmanuel Macron and Dutch Health Minister Hugo de Jonge, who said authorities in those countries are working to begin vaccinating people in the first week of January.
	âIt won't be a vaccination policy for the broader publicâ during the first few months, Macron said in a news conference at the Elysee presidential palace.
	BioNTech and Pfizer have said that clinical trials showed their vaccine is 95% effective. The two companies have already submitted data to regulators in the United States and Britain, and approval might come from them first.
	Hospitals in England have been told they could receive the first doses of the Pfizer shot as early as the week of Dec. 7 if it receives the OK, the Guardian and Financial Times reported. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration's scientific advisers are holding a public meeting Dec. 10 to review Pfizer's request to allow emergency use of its vaccine, and a decision could come shortly thereafter.
	British regulators also are assessing another vaccine developed by researchers from Oxford University and AstraZeneca.
	Whichever of the regulators acts earliest would be giving the first approval of a COVID-19 vaccine that's been that's been rigorously tested in tens of thousands of people in trials that meet common scientific standards.
	Globally, every country that has a drug regulatory agency will have to issue its own approval for any COVID-19 vaccine, although countries with weak systems typically rely on the World Health Organization to vet the shots. In the EU, countries typically accept EMA approval for vaccines and drugs unless there is a specific issue the country wants examined further.
	Multiple successful vaccines will be needed to end the pandemic, which has been on the upswing in Europe and the U.S. and so far left more than 1.4 million people worldwide dead.
	Numerous other vaccines are already being worked on across the world. Russia and China have even begun administering shots of locally developed vaccines and selling them to other countries before publishing evidence from advanced studies proving the vaccines are safe and effective.
	Even after vaccines are approved, manufacturers and regulators will be monitoring how well they are received by patients to determine the frequency of rarer side effects that may only appear when millions are immunized. While the vaccines so far submitted for approval seem to prevent people from getting sick, it is still unclear whether they prevent people from picking up the virus entirely - and crucially - passing it to others.
	And officials caution that while some people may receive a vaccine in the coming weeks, it will take many months to give billions of people around the world the shot, or two if a booster is necessary, meaning that people will be living with virus control measures well into next year.
	Authorities and drugmakers have pledged to work together to immediately begin rolling out the first shots once approval comes in, whether that's in the United States or Europe.
	âDepending on how the authorities decide we can start delivering within a few hours,â said BioNTech's chief operating officer, Sierk Poetting.
	The EU's top official said Tuesday around 2 billion doses of potential COVID-19 vaccines have been secured for the bloc's 27 nations, with the first deliveries likely to start before the end of the year.
	âIt will be a huge step forward toward our normal life,â EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said. âIn other words, I just wanted to say there is a light at the end of the tunnel.â
	Von der Leyen, however, urged EU citizens to remain âdisciplined till we have reached finally a vaccination that is appropriate to eradicate this virus.â As infections and hospitalizations surged in Europe in recent weeks, many countries tightened their restrictions. Some of those measures are beginning to have an effect, but there are concerns that family gatherings at Christmas could lead to a new spike.

              Top secret: Biden gets access to President's Daily Brief
          
","
              Joe Biden has had his first look as president-elect at the President's Daily Brief, a top secret summary of U.S. intelligence and world events -- a document former first lady Michelle Obama has called ""The Death, Destruction, and Horrible Things Book.""

                  Tuesday, Dec. 1, 2020
                ",https://www.ctvnews.ca/world/america-votes/top-secret-biden-gets-access-to-president-s-daily-brief-1.5211392,"WILMINGTON, DEL. -- 
	Joe Biden has had his first look as president-elect at the President's Daily Brief, a top secret summary of U.S. intelligence and world events -- a document former first lady Michelle Obama has called ""The Death, Destruction, and Horrible Things Book.""
	Biden has already had eyes on different iterations of the so-called PDB, which is tailored to the way each president likes to absorb information.
	More than a decade ago, Biden read President George W. Bush's PDB during Biden's transition into the vice presidency. After that, he read President Barack Obama's PDB for eight years. Beginning Monday, after a four-year break, he's reading U.S. President Donald Trump's PDB.
	""The briefers almost certainly will be asking Biden what he prefers in terms of format and style,"" said David Priess, author of ""The President's Book of Secrets,"" a history of the PDB. ""At a minimum, they're seeing what seems to resonate most with him so that when they make the book his book, they can tailor it to him.""
	Obama's PDB was a 10- to 15-page document tucked in a leather binder, which he found waiting for him on the breakfast table. Later in his presidency, he liked reading the ultra-secret intelligence brief on a secured iPad.
	""Michelle called it ""The Death, Destruction, and Horrible Things Book,"" Obama wrote in his recently released book, ""A Promised Land.""
	""On a given day, I might read about terrorist cells in Somalia or unrest in Iraq or the fact that the Chinese or Russians were developing new weapons systems,"" Obama wrote. ""Nearly always, there was mention of potential terrorist plots, no matter how vague, thinly sourced, or unactionable -- a form of due diligence on the part of the intelligence community, meant to avoid the kind of second-guessing that had transpired after 9-11.""
	From now until Inauguration Day, Biden and Vice-President-elect Kamala Harris will be reading the PDB crafted for Trump, who had delayed giving Biden and Harris access to it as he contests the outcome of the election.
	Trump, who prefers absorbing information in visual ways, likes short texts and graphics.
	""Trump himself said during his campaign and during the transition in 2016 that he did not like reading long documents -- that he preferred bullet points,"" said Priess, who has not seen any of Trump's PDBs. ""It probably has charts, tables, graphs -- things like that. Not the parody that people make that it's like a cartoon book ... but something that is more visual. But we don't know for sure.""
	The written brief, which Trump doesn't always read, often is followed by a verbal briefing with an intelligence official, although those oral briefings stopped at least for a time in October. Priess said he didn't know why they stopped or if they had resumed, but that they stopped at a time when Trump was spending much of his time on the campaign trail.
	Before Trump authorized Biden to get the PDB as president-elect, Biden was given some intelligence background briefings as a candidate. But they were more general and did not include the nation's top secrets.
	The other thing that a president-elect gets is a briefing ""on CIA's covert actions,"" former acting CIA director Mike Morell said at an event hosted by the Center for Presidential Transition based in Washington. ""It's important for the president-elect to get this briefing ... because on Inauguration Day, these covert actions will become the new president's.""
	In 1961, President John F. Kennedy read his first brief while sitting on the diving board of a swimming pool at his retreat in the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia. President Lyndon Johnson liked to read his brief in the afternoon. President Richard Nixon relied on his national security adviser Henry Kissinger to peruse the briefs and tell him what he thought the president should know.
	As the laborious recount of ballots dragged on in 2000, President Bill Clinton decided that then-Gov. George W. Bush should get access to his PDB just in case he was the winner. Bush became was the first incoming president to read it before he was president-elect.
	Biden is getting the PDB later than usual because of Trump's ongoing protest of the election results. Trump approved the briefings for Biden last Tuesday, a day after his administration approved the formal transition process to his successor.
	When Biden walks into the Oval Office, he'll be inheriting nuclear threats from North Korea and Iran, changing political dynamics in the Middle East, the winding down of America's presence in Afghanistan and rising competition from China.
	Biden had access to the PDB in Wilmington, Delaware. Harris received it in a secure room at the Commerce Department, where the presidential transition offices are located.
	Even Biden, who has decades of experience in foreign policy, could be the victim of an old political adage that no matter how informed he thinks he is, he could learn otherwise from the PDB.
	Former CIA Director Michael Hayden wrote in his book that revelations and new insight found in the PDB are known as ""aw s---"" moments. As in: ""Aw s---,"" he wrote, ""wish we hadn't said that during that campaign stop in Buffalo.""

              Opinion: Is America back? A steep hill to climb for the Biden administration

              Recently, when president-elect Joe Biden introduced the team that will handle foreign and security policy issues in his new administration, he used the slogan ""America is backâ.
        ","

                ",https://montreal.ctvnews.ca/opinion-is-america-back-a-steep-hill-to-climb-for-the-biden-administration-1.5210738,"MONTREAL -- 
	Recently, when president-elect Joe Biden introduced the team that will handle foreign and security policy issues in his new administration, he used the slogan ""America is backâ.
	Easier to say than achieve, I suspect.
	Firstly, Biden will have a lot of work to do domestically: a pandemic that continues to wreak havoc in the U.S., an economy to rebuild, and above all, trying to bring back unity after a Trump period that divided the United States in unimaginable ways.
	Still, the United States remains a great power, it will have no choice but to play its role on the international scene. The future secretary of state Antony Blinken is well acquainted with international affairs. The next ambassador to the United Nations, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, a career diplomat, and John Kerry, former secretary of state under Obama, appointed as special envoy on climate change are both experienced and competent.
	Biden has confirmed a return to multilateralism. Washington is expected to rejoin the Paris Accord on climate change and will reintegrate some international organizations such as the World Health Organization. It is to be expected that the American voice will be heard again at the United Nations in a more cooperative mode. This is good news.
	Biden will also need to repair the damage done by his predecessor by re-establishing normal relations with traditional allies in Europe, Canada and elsewhere.
	It is expected the U.S. will reclaim its usual place in leading NATO. Trump denigrated this organization and worked to weaken it for reasons that escaped observers.
	However, the world has greatly changed during Trump's four years.
	French President Macron, German Chancellor Merkel and European Union leaders are most probably relieved that common sense will return to the White House but, having been burned, they will want to give themselves some time to see how the Americans will behave on a number of trade and other issues.
	Biden said that the U.S. is ready to lead the world again. Not sure it is a universally shared objective. An increased involvement perhaps, but returning to a pre-Trump era may not be possible.
	Prime Minister Trudeau and his team have already begun bilateral contacts, promoting the importance of Canada in the American economy. Relations with our southern neighbour will not necessarily be more favourable to our interests, but at least there will be dialogue and not insults from the president. Nevertheless, there may be a few differences, notably because of Joe Biden's (Buy America) protectionist agenda and his opposition to the Keystone XL oil pipeline project.
	The big challenges for the next administration will of course be China and probably issues in the Middle East, particularly Iran. It is expected that the confrontational approach with Beijing will be abandoned in favour of an alliance with Europeans and others to make the Chinese understand that it is in their interest to better respect the rule of law and improve the human rights situation. Will this work? Beijing is becoming more and more self-confident. It took advantage of the American withdrawal from the world stage to advance its pawns. It has just signed a free-trade agreement with its Asian neighbours that corresponds to 30 per cent of world trade.
	Biden said the U.S. wants to join the multilateral nuclear agreement with Iran abandoned by Trump. This may not be easy to achieve because his government has adopted a long list of economic sanctions that the Iranians will want to see abandoned before making their own concessions. Negotiations are likely to be long and complicated, and Republican politicians in the Senate, if they remain the majority, will not help. The recent assassination of an Iranian nuclear scientist may not be the last attempt by opponents of the agreement to create additional difficulties before the departure of Trump from the White House.
	Elsewhere in the region, relations between Biden and Netanyahu will not be as warm as with Trump, but the link between Israel and the United States should remain strong. Moreover, Biden said that the U.S. Embassy will stay in Jerusalem. The Palestinians hope that their situation will improve with Biden. To a certain extent, it may be the case. The Israelis will not always have the green light in the context of the settlements on the West Bank, for instance, and the U.S. financial assistance for the Palestinians will probably return. But will the US try to revive the peace process? This is doubtful. Israel has strengthened its ties with several Gulf countries recently and the momentum seems to be changing in the region. Not in the direction of a two-state solution.
	The United States will likely show more interest in defending human rights. Some countries like Saudi Arabia or Egypt will not appreciate it.
	Other issues will attract attention, such as migrants from Central America, a region that has suffered greatly from COVID-19, but also climate change. Migration should be managed in a more humane way than under Trump.
	It will also be interesting to see how relations with Trump's great friends the Turkish, Russian and North Korean despots will be. What about Cuba? Trump had scrapped Obamaâs openness towards Havana.
	The Americans have lost ground because of Trump's chaotic and uncoordinated policy. It is not clear that the damage is temporary. Let's hope for Biden that ""America is back"" will be a more successful theme than Trudeau's ""Canada is backâ. Â

	The fight against COVID-19 will remain the Saskatchewan governmentâs top priority as it aims to navigate the pandemic and boost the economy.
	In the provinceâs throne speech on Monday, delivered by Lt.-Gov. Russ Mirasty, the province said Saskatchewan is facing the most difficult moment of the pandemic to date.
	It said more health orders may be required to slow the spread of COVID-19, but believes the best defence has been when people are vigilant and follow good practices.
	âI am confident that will continue in the weeks ahead as we all work together to reduce the spread of COVID-19,â the speech said. âAt the same time as we are working to protect lives, my government is also taking steps to protect livelihoods. We can, and will, do both.â
	The government touted investments in health care and education to address the pandemic.
	It said teachers can expect another allocation of funding in December. There has been more than $85 million directed to the education system for safety.
	Along with fighting the pandemic, the province said it will keep promises it made during the election campaign.
	It plans to implement these programs while balancing the budget by 2024.
	Here is a rundown of what people can expect.
ELECTRICITY BILLS TO BE REDUCED BY 10 PER CENT
	Starting tomorrow, SaskPower will reduce electricity charges by 10 per cent for one year.
	It will apply to residential customers, farms, industry, businesses, schools, universities and hospitals.
	The province said the rebate will save people $260 million, which it believes can be re-invested into the economy.
HOME RENOVATION TAX CREDIT
	The first bill introduced into the assembly will create the new Saskatchewan Home Renovation Tax Credit.
	The province said homeowners will be able to claim a 10.5 per cent tax credit on up to $20,000 of home renovation expenses between Oct. 1 to December 31, 2022.
	Homeowners are expected to save up to $2,100 on the cost of their home improvements. The province hopes the credit will boost the construction sector.
	The credit is part of the provinceâs $7.5 billion infrastructure plan, which includes $2 billion in stimulus funding.
NEW MINISTRY
	The province will create a Ministry of SaskBuilds and Procurement.
	It will oversee the development and implementation of procurement processes, as well as information and technology infrastructure.
TEMPORARY REDUCTION IN SMALL BUSINESS TAX
	The province plans to reduce the small business tax rate to zero per cent. It will be retroactive to Oct. 1.
	By July 2023, the tax rate will be restored to two per cent.
	The reduction will cost $189 million, which the province believes will be re-invested into the economy.
	The province said there has never been a better time to buy local given the pandemic has caused hardship for many small businesses.
ELIGIBILITY EXPANDED FOR INSULIN PROGRAM
	All provincial residents will soon be eligible to take part in the insulin pump program.
	The province will cover the cost of an insulin pump for anyone who needs one.
	Previously, the cost was only covered for people with type 1 diabetes under the age of 25.
	The province will also pay for the cost of continuous glucose monitoring for children under the age of 18.
	Itâs expected this will benefit 600 children in Saskatchewan.
AUTISM SUPPORTS
	Beginning in 2021, children under the age of 12 who have been diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder will receive $6,000 a year to cover the cost for individualized therapeutic supports.
LONG-TERM CARE
	The province said it will hire 300 new continuing care aides to work in long-term care.
	Of this number, 180 will work in long-term care homes, 63 for home care services and 57 for expanded home care services in rural and remote areas.
MENTAL HEALTH AND ADDICTIONS
	The province said it will continue to support people with mental health and addictions challenges.
	The provinceâs rural and remote health minister will oversee mental health and addictions programming in the province.
	The government has invested $435 million in mental health and addictions in 2020.
SASK. ADVANTAGE SCHOLARSHIP
	The province will be expanding the Saskatchewan Advantage Scholarship from $500 to $750 per year. It is expected to benefit 8,000 students in Saskatchewan.
COST REDUCTIONS FOR AMBULANCE CALLS
	The government will be eliminating charges for inter-facility transfers for seniors, and will reduce the maximum cost of other calls to $135 per call. It had been $275 per call.
	The seniors income benefit will also be increased to $360 per month from $270 per month.
COMMUNITY RINK PROGRAM
	The province is re-starting the community rink affordability program.
	The government will provide $2,500 per year to help cover the costs of operating rinks in villages, towns and cities.
	Itâs expected that 373 communities will be eligible for funding.
VETERANS
	The province will be providing $1.5 million per year to the Saskatchewanâs veterans service clubs. The clubs had originally received $100,000 per year.
CHILDCARE SPACES
	The province aims to add 750 childcare spaces over the next four years.
	It will be re-starting the active families bennefit, which will provide up to $150 per year per child for families with an annual income of under $60,000. There will be $200 for a child with a disability per year.
	This will cover the cost of participating in sports, arts or cultural activities.
RESIDENTIAL TENANCIES ACT
	The government will be introducing legislation that will allow those who have been sexually assaulted in their accommodations to unilaterally break a long-term lease.
	Currently, survivors of interpersonal violence can unilaterally break a long-term lease.
HUMAN TRAFFICKING ACT
	The province will be introducing an act that allows human trafficking victims to obtain expedited protection orders.
	It will also allow tough enforcement of orders and the seizure of property, bank accounts and suspension of drivers licences.
GROWTH PLAN
	The government hopes to see Saskatchewan have a population of 1.4 million and 100,000 new jobs by 2030.
	Itâs looking to increase exports by 50 per cent, and invest $30 billion in infrastructure over the next 10 years.
	Saskatchewan will be adding three more international trade offices next year. They will be located in Japan, India and Singapore.
	The province currently has an office in Shanghai, China.
CARBON TAX FIGHT
	The province said it will continue to fight the federal carbon tax.
	It said Saskatchewanâs climate change plan works to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and helps sustainable industries survive.
	In November, Premier Scott Moe appointed a legislative secretary with the job of examining how Saskatchewan can strengthen its autonomy within the federation.
	The province has discussed the possibility of having greater control over immigration into Saskatchewan.Â 
	As well, it has appointed a provincial firearms officer."

              White House Christmas decor gives nod to first responders

	First responders and frontline workers being challenged by the deadly coronavirus pandemic are highlighted in White House Christmas decorations that also give a special nod to Melania Trump's redesigned Rose Garden.
	It's the final Christmas in the White House for the Trump family, although the president continues to insist - despite evidence to the contrary - that he won the Nov. 3 election. President-elect Joe Biden will be sworn into office on Jan. 20.
	The first lady said âAmerica the Beautifulâ is her theme for the decor, and that it was inspired by Americans' shared appreciation âfor our traditions, values and history.â
	Workers on the front lines of a pandemic that has killed more than 266,000 people in the United States and infected more than 13 million others are recognized in the Red Room with a Christmas tree dotted with handmade ornaments, as well as other decorations around the parlour.
	The gingerbread White House - a sweet confection made of more than 400 pounds (181 kilograms) of dough, gum paste, chocolate and royal icing - is on display in the State Dining Room and for the first time includes the Rose Garden, which the first lady recently renovated, and the First Ladies' Garden.
	Ornaments on the official White House Christmas tree in the Blue Room - a Fraser fir from Shepherdstown, West Virginia, that stands more than 18 feet (5.49 metres) tall - were designed by students who were asked by the National Park Service to depict what makes their states beautiful.
	A buck and a crane are featured in three-dimensional art hanging in windows of the Green Room, where American wildlife is the highlight. Classical urns lining an East Wing walkway hold groupings of foliage from different regions of the country.
	Trees and other decorations in the East Room feature planes, trains and automobiles - including models of Air Force One - in a nod to triumphs in innovations and technology. Wrapped gifts beneath decorated trees lining the Cross Hall bear tags that say âpeace,â âlove,â âfaithâ and âjoy.â
	Monday's unveiling of the Christmas decor came weeks after Mrs. Trump was heard on an audio recording using profanity as she complained about the pressure of having to decorate for the holiday in the past. The recording of the July 2018 conversation was made and released to CNN by Stephanie Winston Wolkoff, who was fired from the White House earlier that year.
	Wolkoff published a tell-all book about her friendship and breakup with Mrs. Trump, whom Wolkoff blames for not defending her after questions arose about spending for Trump's 2017 inauguration, which Wolkoff helped produce.
	This year some 125 volunteers from around the country used 62 trees, 106 wreaths, more than 1,200 feet (366 metres) of garland, more than 3,200 strands of lights and 17,000 bows to decorate the 132-room White House over the course of Thanksgiving weekend.
	The library is decorated to recognize the 100th anniversary of the 19th Amendment, giving women the right to vote. Stockings for the president, first lady and their 14-year-old son Barron hang from a fireplace in the room where presidential china patterns are displayed.
	After previewing the decorations for the media, the White House on Monday planned the first of many holiday receptions that are expected to be smaller in size given coronavirus concerns.
	A few miles north of the White House, the wrapping also came off the Christmas decorations at Vice-President Mike Pence's official residence on the grounds of the Naval Observatory.
	Karen Pence said âOld Fashioned Christmasâ is their theme. The home is decorated with natural and rustic elements, including pine cones, seasonal berries, burlap, galvanized aluminum and plaid ribbon, along with seven Christmas trees and 35 wreaths."

	Calgary Zoo officials confirm the two giant pandas, which were on loan from China, have arrived safely back at the Chongqing Zoo in Chengdu.
	Er Shun and Da Mao departed Calgary Friday morning after zoo officials decided to cut short the pandas scheduled stay due to concerns with sourcing fresh bamboo amid the pandemic.
	""We believe the best and safest place for Er Shun and Da Mao to be during these challenging and unprecedented times is at home in China, where bamboo is abundant and easy to access,"" Dr. Clement Lanthier, Calgary Zoo president and CEO, said in a statement on Monday.
	""This was an incredibly difficult decision to make but the health and wellbeing of the animals we love and care for always comes first.""
	The adult pandas travelled from Calgary to Frankfurt, Germany on a Lufthansa Cargo flight before continuing to Chendgu, China.
	The pair's stay at the Calgary Zoo, which followed a five-year stint at the Toronto Zoo, was originally scheduled to end in 2023.
	Er Shun and Da Mao arrived in Calgary alongside cubs Jia Panpan and Jia Yueyue in 2018. The younger animals were returned to China earlier this year to participate in a breeding program."

	The government of Prime Minister Boris Johnson in July banned Huawei from having a role in building Britain's next-generation mobile phone networks over security concerns triggered by U.S. sanctions. Britain and other European countries have started to fall in line after the U.S. lobbied allies to shun Huawei over fears its equipment could be used by China's communist rulers to facilitate electronic espionage.
	Telecom operators were ordered to stop buying Huawei 5G equipment by the end of the year and have until 2027 to rip any of the company's existing gear out of their systems.
	While the ban implied operators would have to stop installing Huawei gear, the latest announcement spells out the deadline clearly - making it harder for them to stockpile equipment.
	Huawei declined to comment. It has previously denied the U.S. allegations and said Britain's ban was politically motivated.
	""Today I am setting out a clear path for the complete removal of high risk vendors from our 5G networks,"" Digital Secretary Oliver Dowden said. ""This will be done through new and unprecedented powers to identify and ban telecoms equipment which poses a threat to our national security.""
	The Telecommunications (Security) Bill, which is set to be debated in Parliament on Tuesday, requires tougher security standards for 5G wireless and fiber optic networks and threatens heavy fines for companies that don't comply with the rules.
	The government is also setting out a strategy to diversify its telecom equipment suppliers, including a research lab and investment in open radio standards technology. Huawei has just a handful of rivals including Finland's Nokia and Sweden's Ericsson, raising fears that relying on so few companies to supply critical infrastructure leaves networks open to vulnerabilities."

                ",https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/coronavirus/moderna-asking-u-s-european-regulators-to-ok-its-covid-19-shots-1.5209855,"
	Moderna Inc. said it would ask U.S. and European regulators Monday to allow emergency use of its COVID-19 vaccine as new study results confirm the shots offer strong protection -- ramping up the race to begin limited vaccinations as the coronavirus rampage worsens.
	Multiple vaccine candidates must succeed for the world to stamp out the pandemic, which has been on the upswing in the U.S. and Europe. U.S. hospitals have been stretched to the limit as the nation has seen more than 160,000 new cases per day and more than 1,400 daily deaths. Since first emerging nearly a year ago in China, the virus has killed more than 1.4 million people worldwide.
	Moderna is one of several companies to have already submitted partial data to a ""rolling review"" process offered by Health Canada. Rather than presenting regulators with a complete package of trial results, the would-be vaccine-makers file data and findings as they become available. Canada has been looking at Moderna's first results since mid-October.
	Canada has a different approval process than the United States and European countries, meaning that Moderna and Pfizer do not have to apply or reapply at each step. Instead, they have to submit their newest data and findings.
	Moderna created its shots with the U.S. National Institutes of Health and already had a hint they were working, but said it got the final needed results over the weekend that suggest the vaccine is more than 94% effective.
	Of 196 COVID-19 cases so far in its huge U.S. study, 185 were trial participants who received the placebo and 11 who got the real vaccine. The only people who got severely ill -- 30 participants, including one who died -- had received dummy shots, said Dr. Tal Zaks, the Cambridge, Massachusetts, company's chief medical officer.
	When he learned the results, ""I allowed myself to cry for the first time,"" Zaks told The Associated Press. ""We have already, just in the trial, have already saved lives. Just imagine the impact then multiplied to the people who can get this vaccine.""
	Moderna said the shots' effectiveness and a good safety record so far -- with only temporary, flu-like side effects -- mean they meet requirements set by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for emergency use before the final-stage testing is complete. The European Medicines Agency, Europe's version of FDA, has signalled it also is open to faster, emergency clearance.
	The FDA has pledged that before it decides to roll out any COVID-19 vaccines, its scientific advisers will publicly debate whether there's enough evidence behind each candidate.
	First up on Dec. 10, Pfizer and BioNTech will present data suggesting their vaccine candidate is 95% effective. Moderna said its turn at this ""science court"" is expected exactly a week later, on Dec. 17.
	If the FDA allows emergency use, Moderna expects to have 20 million doses ready for the U.S. by year's end. Recipients will need two doses, so that's enough for 10 million people.
	Pfizer expects to have 50 million doses globally in December. Half of them -- or enough for 12.5 million people -- are earmarked for the U.S.
	This week, a different panel of U.S. experts, established by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, will meet to decide how initial supplies will be given out. They're expected to reserve scarce first doses for health care workers and, if the shots work well enough in the frail elderly, for residents of long-term care facilities. As more vaccine gradually becomes available in coming months, other essential workers and people at highest risk from the coronavirus would get in line. But enough for the general population isn't expected until at least spring.
	Outside the U.S., Zaks said significant supplies from Moderna would be available later, ""in the first quarter"" of next year.
	""Obviously we are doing everything in our power to increase the capacity and accelerate the timelines,"" he said.
	Both Moderna's and Pfizer's vaccines are made with the same technology, using a piece of genetic code for the ""spike"" protein that studs the virus. That messenger RNA, or mRNA, instructs the body to make some harmless spike protein, training immune cells to recognize it if the real virus eventually comes along.
	AstraZeneca last week announced confusing early results of its vaccine candidate from research in Britain and Brazil
	That vaccine appears 62% effective when tested as originally intended, with recipients given two full doses. But because of a manufacturing error, a small number of volunteers got a lower first dose -- and AstraZeneca said in that group, the vaccine appeared to be 90% effective.
	Experts say it's unclear why the lower-dose approach would work better and that it may just be a statistical quirk.
	A larger U.S. study of the AstraZeneca candidate still is underway that should eventually give the FDA a better picture of how well it works. The FDA has said any COVID-19 vaccine would have to be at least 50% effective.
	Meanwhile Britain's government will have to decide whether its U.K. data is sufficient for an early rollout there.
	Johnson & Johnson also is in final-stage testing in the U.S. and several other countries to see if its vaccine candidate could work with just one dose.
	Both the J&J and AstraZeneca vaccines work by using harmless cold viruses to carry the spike protein gene into the body and prime the immune system.
	The different technologies have ramifications for how easily different vaccines could be distributed globally. The AstraZeneca shots won't require freezer storage like the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines.
	Candidates made with still other technologies are in late-stage testing, too. Another U.S. company, Novavax Inc., announced Monday that it has finished enrolling 15,000 people in a late-stage study in Britain and plans to begin recruiting even more volunteers for final testing in the U.S. and Mexico ""in the coming weeks.""
	Vaccines made by three Chinese companies and a Russian candidate also are being tested in thousands of people in countries around the world.

              Merriam-Webster, Dictionary.com choose the same 2020 word of the year
          
","
              Both Dictionary.com and Merriam-Webster on Monday announced 'pandemic' as their 2020 word of the year.
        ","
                  Monday, Nov. 30, 2020
                ",https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/coronavirus/merriam-webster-dictionary-com-choose-the-same-2020-word-of-the-year-1.5209808,"NEW YORK -- 
	On Dec. 31, China reported a cluster of pneumonia cases of unknown origin to the World Health Organization. By Jan. 31, WHO declared an outbreak of a novel coronavirus a global health emergency. Come March 11, the world was facing down the COVID-19 pandemic.
	Parents sat children down to explain what a pandemic is. Related terms usually restricted to medicine and science stormed into everyday conversation. Over time, we were pandemic baking and pandemic dating and rescuing pandemic puppies from shelters.
	All of which led Dictionary.com on Monday to declare ""pandemic"" its 2020 word of the year.
	Searches on the site for the word spiked more than 13,500% on March 11, senior research editor John Kelly told The Associated Press in an interview ahead of the announcement.
	""That's massive, but even more telling is how high it has sustained significant search volumes throughout the entire year. Month over month, it was over 1,000% higher than usual. For about half the year, it was in the top 10% of all our lookups.""
	Another dictionary, Merriam-Webster, also selected pandemic as its word of the year earlier Monday.
	Kelly said pandemic beat out routine lookups usually intended to sort more mundane matters, such as the differences between ""to, two and too.""
	""That's significant,"" Kelly emphasized. ""It seems maybe a little bit obvious, and that's fair to say, but think about life before the pandemic. Things like pandemic fashion would have made no sense. The pandemic as an event created a new language for a new normal.""
	Lexicographers often factor out routine lookups when evaluating word trends.
	The pandemic, Kelly said, made us all worthy of watercooler chatter with Dr. Anthony Fauci as our knowledge grew about aerosols, contact tracing, social distancing and herd immunity, along with the intricacies of therapeutic drugs, tests and vaccines that can help save lives.
	""These were all part of a new shared vocabulary we needed to stay safe and informed. It's incredible,"" said Kelly, who works with a team of lexicographers to come up with words of the year based primarily on site traffic.
	Asymptomatic, furlough, non-essential, hydroxychloroquine and a host of other pandemic-related words saw massive increases in lookups as well.
	Jennifer Steeves-Kiss, chief executive officer of Dictionary.com, said one key ingredient in the hunt for the site's word of the year is sustained interest over time. Pandemic met that standard.
	""This has affected families, our work, the economy,"" she said. ""It really became the logical choice. It's become the context through which we've had dialogue all through 2020. It's the through line for discourse.""
	The word pandemic has roots in Latin and the Greek pandemos, meaning ""common, public."" Breaking it down further, ""pan"" means ""all"" and ""demos"" means ""people."" As evidenced in a medical text by a Dutch-born physician, Gideon Harvey, pandemic entered English in the 1660s in the medical sense, Kelly said. He noted that ""demos"" is also the basis for the word democracy.
	A pandemic is defined by Dictionary.com as a disease ""prevalent throughout an entire country, continent, or the whole world; epidemic over a large area."" Its broader sense, as evidenced in its roots, can be used thusly: ""A pandemic fear of atomic war.""
	Dictionary.com also noted other worthy search trends beyond the pandemic. After the May 25 death of George Floyd under the knee of a Minneapolis police officer, words around racial justice experienced spikes, including fascism, anti-fascism, defund and white fragility.
	""There was no way for us to leave that out of the conversation this year,"" Kelly said."

	Australia's prime minister said Monday that a Chinese official's tweet showing a fake image of an Australian soldier appearing to slit a child's throat was ""truly repugnant"" and merits an apology.
	China said there would be no apology.
	The incident is further souring already tense relations between the two nations. Prime Minister Scott Morrison said he was seeking an apology from the Chinese government after Zhao Lijian, a spokesman for China's Foreign Ministry, posted the graphic image that shows a grinning soldier holding a bloodied knife to the throat of a veiled child, who is holding a lamb.
	Zhao wrote a caption with the tweet saying: ""Shocked by murder of Afghan civilians & prisoners by Australian soldiers. We strongly condemn such acts, & call for holding them accountable.""
	He was referring to a disturbing report by Australia's military earlier this month which found evidence that elite Australian troops unlawfully killed 39 Afghan prisoners, farmers and civilians during the conflict in Afghanistan. It recommended that 19 soldiers be referred to federal police for criminal investigation.
	Asked about the issue at a daily briefing, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying cast blame on the Australian side.
	""What Australia should do is to reflect deeply, bring the perpetrators to justice, make a formal apology to the Afghan people, and solemnly promise to the international community that they will never commit such terrible crimes again,"" Hua said.
	Morrison said Zhao's tweet was ""utterly outrageous"" and a terrible slur against Australia's military.
	It ""is truly repugnant. It is deeply offensive to every Australian, every Australian who has served in that uniform,"" he told reporters in Canberra. ""The Chinese government should be totally ashamed of this post. It diminishes them in the world's eyes.""
	Morrison said his government had contacted Twitter asking it to take the post down. The post had a warning tag on it by Monday afternoon but could still be viewed. Zhao's account comes with a Twitter label stating that it's a Chinese government account.
	Despite China blocking Twitter and other U.S. social media platforms within the county, Chinese diplomats and state media have established a strong presence on them.
	Zhao was criticized by the U.S. in March after tweeting a conspiracy theory that U.S. soldiers may have brought the coronavirus to China. He is considered a leading representative of China's high-pitched new strain of assertive foreign relations.
	Morrison acknowledged there were tensions between China and Australia.
	""But this is not how you deal with them,"" he said. ""Australia has patiently sought to address the tensions that exist in our relationship in a mature way, in a responsible way, by seeking engagement at both leader and ministerial level.""
	The rift between the two nations has grown since the Australian government called for an independent inquiry into the origins of the coronavirus pandemic. China has since imposed tariffs and other restrictions on a number of Australian exports."

              PM put all vaccine 'eggs' in one basket, didn't consider other options: O'Toole

              Conservative Leader Erin O'Toole accused the Liberal government Sunday of putting too much emphasis on partnering with a Chinese company for a COVID-19 vaccine in what turned out to be a failed deal.

	Conservative Leader Erin O'Toole accused the Liberal government Sunday of putting too much emphasis on partnering with a Chinese company for a COVID-19 vaccine in what turned out to be a failed deal.
	O'Toole said the Trudeau government only turned its attention to pre-ordering tens of millions of vaccine doses from companies such as Pfizer and Moderna in August when its collaboration between the National Research Council and Chinese vaccine-maker CanSino finally collapsed after months of delays.
	The Council had issued CanSino a licence to use a Canadian biological product as part of a COVID-19 vaccine. CanSino was supposed to provide samples of the vaccine for clinical trials at the Canadian Centre for Vaccinology at Dalhousie University, but the Chinese government blocked the shipments.
	""I would not have put all our eggs in the basket of China,"" O'Toole said at a morning news conference.
	""If you look at the timeline, that's when Canada started getting serious with Pfizer, Moderna, the other options,"" he added, saying he was concerned that ""the Trudeau government was willing to almost double down on partnering with China"" earlier in the pandemic.
	The government announced its major vaccine purchases in August after it confirmed the CanSino partnership had fallen through. At the time, it said its decision had come after careful consultations with its vaccine task force of health experts.
	The CanSino partnership with Dalhousie predated the deep freeze in Canada-China relations that occurred after the People's Republic imprisoned two Canadian men, Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, in apparent retaliation for the RCMP's arrest of Chinese high-tech executive Meng Wanzhou nearly two years ago on an American extradition warrant.
	This past week, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau created a firestorm when he said Canadians will have to wait a bit to get vaccinated for COVID-19 because the first doses off the production lines will be used in the countries where they are made.
	As questions grew about the CanSino deal, Trudeau continued to defend his government's vaccine procurement policy, which he says has secured multiple options for the country. Trudeau also appointed a Canadian Forces general to lead the logistics of an eventual vaccine rollout with the Public Health Agency of Canada.
	The chairman of American vaccine maker Moderna told the CBC on Sunday that Canada is near the front of the line to receive 20 million doses of the COVID-19 vaccine it pre-ordered.
	Noubar Afeyan was asked on CBC's Rosemary Barton Live whether the fact that Canada committed to pre-purchase its doses before other jurisdictions means it will get its supply first. Afeyan confirmed that was the case.
	""The people who are willing to move early on with even less proof of the efficacy have assured the amount of supply they were willing to sign up to,"" he said.
	O'Toole said with Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland poised to deliver the government's long-awaited fiscal update on Monday, the Liberals need to do two things to spur economic recovery: offer a better plan on how it will rollout vaccines for Canadians and step up the distribution of rapid tests.
	""There can't be a full economy, a growing economy, people working, people being productive without the tools to keep that happening in a pandemic. Those two tools are rapid tests, and a vaccine.""
	Freeland's fall economic statement is expected to give a full accounting of the government's record spending on programs to combat the pandemic. In July, the deficit was forecast to be at a record $343.2 billion but some estimates say it could easily top $400 billion.
	The government could announce new spending such as taking steps towards a national child-care system, and relief for battered industries such as travel and restaurants that will face an uphill struggle to recover from the pandemic.
	NDP finance critic Peter Julian sent Freeland a three-page letter urging her to take action on a variety of fronts to help struggling Canadian families during the pandemic.
	They included taking concrete action on establishing a national pharmacare plan to help Canadians pay for soaring prescription drug costs, and establish a national day-care strategy to help women who have been disproportionately hindered by the pandemic. Julien also urged Freeland to help Indigenous communities and abandon the government's plans to pay for the Trans-Mountain Pipeline and ramp up its fight against climate change.
	Green party Leader Annamie Paul called on Freeland to deliver ""a positive vision for a green recovery"" to accelerate Canada's transition to a carbon-neutral economy.
	""We are optimistic that a vaccine for COVID-19 will be widely available next year and so we must be prepared for what comes next,"" Paul said in a statement.
This report by The Canadian Press was first published Nov. 29, 2020."

	Testing a novel release strategy, Universal Pictures' animated sequel ""The Croods: A New Age"" had one of the best opening weekends of the pandemic, grossing US$14.2 million over the five-day Thanksgiving holiday weekend, according to studio estimates Sunday.
	Whereas new releases have traditionally lasted around 90 days in theatres, Universal has mapped out a shorted theatrical window in deals with major chains AMC and Cinemark that gives the studio the option to move new releases to premium video-on-demand after just 17 days. ""The Croods: A New Age"" is expected to shift to the home before Christmas for a $20 rental. For an industry reeling from the pandemic, it's part of wider changes seeping through the industry.
	""The Croods: A New Age"" grossed $9.7 million Friday-Sunday, which rivals even the weekend start for ""Tenet"" in October. Warner Bros. didn't break down the three-day weekend figures for ""Tenet,"" which began preview screenings in the U.S. on a Monday, but said it grossed $20.2 million in its first week in U.S. theatres plus its first two weeks in Canadian theatres.
	While the opening for ""The Croods: A New Age"" was something Hollywood hadn't seen in months -- a movie that outperformed expectations -- it was still only a sliver of what the industry usually sees in the typically busy holiday movie season. Last year, ""Frozen II"" led all films over the five-day Thanksgiving weekend with $123.7 million, while ""Knives Out"" scored $41.7 million
	Since ""Tenet"" opened, most larger releases have been postponed or detoured to digital, sometimes while still playing in theatres overseas. The Walt Disney Co. steered ""Mulan"" to a premium purchase on Disney+, but opened in China and elsewhere. Next month, Warner Bros. will release ""Wonder Woman 1984"" simultaneously on HBO Max and in theatres. Disney has uprooted the Pixar animation ""Soul"" to its streaming platform.
	That's left smaller films to lead what's left of the box office -- about 40% of the normal number of theatres. Most have tapped out around $4 million on opening weekend. The Kevin Costner and Diane Lane film ""Let Him Go"" debuted with $4.1 million in ticket sales from 2,454 locations earlier this month. The body-swap horror movie ""Freaky,"" with Vince Vaughn, has been No. 1 the last two weekends after debuting with $3.7 million.
	One of the biggest differences is that Universal spent more heavily to market the $65 million ""Croods"" sequel from DreamWorks Animation. It played in 2,211 locations, or about half the usual amount for such a release.
	Overseas, the film grossed $20.8 with almost all of that -- $19.2 million -- coming from China."

              Why 'Release the Kraken' has become the latest pro-Trump rallying cry
          
","
              Pro-Trump groups including QAnon conspiracy theorists are using the slogan âRelease the Krakenâ to spread unsubstantiated claims of widespread voter fraud in the U.S. election and support the legal campaign to challenge president elect Joe Bidenâs victory.

	Calls to âRelease the Kraken,â once reserved for tales of Scandinavian folklore and rum commercials, have become the latest rallying cry for pro-Trump groups spreading unsubstantiated claims of widespread voter fraud in the U.S. election.
	Pro-Trump groups, including QAnon conspiracy theorists, have been sharing the hashtag #ReleaseTheKraken in the weeks following President-elect Joe Bidenâs declared victory in an effort to support the legal campaign to challenge the election results.
	But how did the Kraken â a gigantic sea monster from Scandinavian folklore that rises up from the ocean to devour its enemies and a famous line from ""Clash of the Titans"" â become the symbol of this campaign?
	The hashtag appears to stem from comments made by Sidney Powell, a lawyer for former U.S. national security adviser Michael Flynn.
	During an interview with Fox Business Network on Nov. 13, Powell claimed the presidentâs team had substantial evidence to prove widespread voter fraud in several key states.
	âWe are talking about hundreds of thousands of votes. President Trump won this election in a landslide,â she said during the interview.
			Michael Flynn attorney Sidney Powell says she has âstaggeringâ statistical evidence and testimony to show Dominion voting machines altered ballots and this deception stems back to Venezuela, Cuba, and China. Sheâs says âIâm going to release the Kraken.â pic.twitter.com/50mQdHnOuS
	Powell claimed that she had seen a growing body of evidence and testimony from voters to prove that Dominion voting machines altered ballots in key swing states, claiming the machines were developed to rig elections in countries such as Venezuela, Cuba, and China.
	When asked if she believed her claims of voter fraud were the âculmination of an four-year effort to overthrow Trumpâs presidency,â she alleged that voter fraud had been organized and conducted with the help of tech companies, social media companies, and the media.
	âIâm going to release the Kraken,â she stated.
	The hashtag has continued to gain traction on Twitter as pro-Trump supporters spread news of efforts to legally challenge the election results. Though, on Saturday, some of the tweets appeared to poke fun at the effort as users shared images of The Kraken rum bottles, and images of octopuses, which are commonly used to depict the fictional creature.
			Or you can just release the other real Kracken. #ReleaseTheKraken pic.twitter.com/wEOnBO7tdy
	No evidence has emerged of the widespread voting fraud that Trump and his legal team have repeatedly alleged, which has been slapped down by judges and state election officials.â
	The Kraken line first came to the internetâs attention following the release of 2010's âClash of the Titansâ remake. The line, uttered by Zeus, then became a popular meme and one of TIME magazineâs Top 10 Buzzwords of the year."

	Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam said she has ""piles of cash"" at home as she has no bank account after the United States slapped sanctions on her in response to a draconian security law China imposed on the city.
	Lam was targeted, along with 14 other senior city officials, in the toughest US action on Hong Kong since Beijing imposed the new law on the territory in late June.
	The move by Washington freezes the American assets of the 15 officials and criminalises any financial transactionsÂ in the United States.
	In an interview with local English TV channel HKIBC aired on Friday night, Lam said she was ""using cash every day for all the things"" after being sanctioned.
	""Sitting in front of you is a chief executive of the Hong Kong SAR (Special Administrative Region) who has no banking service made available to her,"" Lam told HKIBC.
	""I have piles of cash at home, the government is paying me cash for my salary,"" she added.Â 
	Lam added that it was ""very honourable"" to be ""unjustifiably sanctioned"" by the US government and does not want to deter anyone from serving in public office.
	Earning HK$5.21 million (US$672,000) a year, Lam is one of the highest paid leaders in the world.
	Her remarks sparked a public backlash, with social media users posting photos of coins in their piggy banks at home to contrast with Lam's wealth.
	Others questioned how her large salary would be transported to her residence in cash.
	Lam had told media in August that she faced ""a little bit of inconvenience"" from the sanctions which hampered her use of credit cards."

	âFirst I was really angry, and then I was depressed,â Gao told CTV News through a translator. âWe told the police again and again that such violence would happen.â
	He says his family has had to stay inside, and he has had to keep his 10-year-old daughter from the people involved in the protest, where people in matching blue rain covers march along the street in front of his house, and stream video from their devices constantly.
	âI thought I lived in a democracy, but I am living in terror,â Gao said.
	The protesters themselves didnât respond to questions in person in the cul-de-sac Wednesday. They have leafletted homes claiming to be part of the New Federal State of China, a group founded by former Donald Trump advisor Steve Bannon, and Chinese tycoon Miles Guo, who is living in exile in New York.
	The aims of the protesters, and Gao, sound similar: theyâre both criticizing the Chinese Communist Party. Guoâs group has claimed that Gao is in league with the CCP. But documents filed in an American court allege itâs actually Guo who is working with the Chinese government to target critics abroad. Guo has denied this.
	The Surrey RCMP has arrested two people for the assault, said spokesperson Cpl. Elenore Sturko. But it has so far held off any action against the protest in general.
	âWe have lawful assembly and we can peacefully protest,â she said. âThe difference is whether or not lawful activity is taking place.â
	The City of Surrey said its bylaw officers had attended but found that there were no obstructions of traffic or bylaw violations.
	Lawyer Martin Peters said authorities have a fact pattern that could point them to a Criminal Code offence of harassment.
	âItâs classic language of the Criminal Code, watching and besetting a dwelling house,â he said, adding that if the evidence shows this is an organized attempt to harass Gao, anyone involved, including the people at the top, could be liable.
	He said Gao or the City of Surrey could also apply to get a civil injunction, which could require a buffer zone between the protesters and Gaoâs home. That was part of the order during the protests of the TransMountain pipeline, where the City of Burnaby was represented in court.
	Police have protected the protestersâ Charter freedoms so far, Peters said, but it seems that the protest is infringing on Gaoâs own Charter freedoms.
	âThis is probably designed to have a chilling effect on this journalist,â Peter said.
	Several city councillors didnât respond to inquires by CTV News.
	If there's no further action, Gao said he plans to sue the city and the RCMP for failing to keep the peace."

              Trudeau's office releases account of him scolding O'Toole before he does it

              A spokesman for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says his office accidentally sent out an account of a phone call with Conservative Leader Erin O'Toole that hadn't happened yet.

	A spokesman for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says his office accidentally sent out an account of a phone call with Conservative Leader Erin O'Toole that hadn't happened yet.
	The premature account of the call Friday said Trudeau chided O'Toole about Conservative MPs' downplaying the deaths of Albertans and comparing the novel coronavirus to the flu.
	Alberta MP Rachael Harder shared a newspaper column on her Facebook page this week that pointed out provincial statistics saying that just 10 of 369 Albertans who had died of COVID-19 as of mid-November were otherwise healthy. And Ontario MP Dean Allison described COVID-19 as ""influenza"" in a talk-radio interview.
	After the call, the Conservatives said Trudeau raised neither of these incidents with O'Toole.
	And a second read-out of the call from the PMO, after the call had actually taken place, dropped all mention of the matter.
	It said simply that the two leaders had discussed âthe COVID-19 pandemic, as well as vaccine distribution in Canada,â along with issues related to president-elect Joe Biden's incoming administration in the United States.
	The Tory leader went into the conversation with proposals for how Canada can improve its relationship with the U.S. under Biden.
	In a letter to Trudeau, O'Toole said responding to the COVID-19 pandemic must be the first priority, including ensuring a continent-wide response to vaccine supply, the production of personal protective equipment and managing the border.
	O'Toole said after that must come dealing with the threat posed by China, and that Canada should seek to join an existing dialogue among the U.S., Australia, India and Japan to oppose Chinese military expansionism.
	The letter also talks about the Keystone XL oil pipeline, a project that outgoing President Donald Trump approved but Biden opposes. O'Toole said it must be made clear to Biden the project is important to Canada's view of the bilateral relationship with the U.S.
	The letter cites a need for a collective effort on combating climate change, and a call to modernize the binational defence agreement known as Norad, which would include having Canada join the ballistic missile defence program.
	A copy of O'Toole's letter to Trudeau was obtained by The Canadian Press.
	âThis period of transition to the incoming Biden administration represents a unique opportunity to advance Canada's interests and values on the world stage,â O'Toole wrote in the letter.
	âIt is my sincere hope the Canadian and U.S. governments can work together for the mutual benefit of both our peoples who have endured so much this past year.â
	A Conservative read-out after the call said the two leaders concluded their chat by mutually âreaffirming the importance of eliminating COVID-19 and by wishing their families well.â

                ",https://bc.ctvnews.ca/what-we-ve-learned-from-the-mounties-and-border-officers-who-testified-in-meng-wanzhou-s-extradition-case-1.5207537,"VANCOUVER -- 
	On the morning of Dec. 1, 2018, Meng Wanzhou, the Chief Financial Officer of Chinese telecom giant Huawei and the daughter of its founder, touched down in Vancouver.
	Meng planned to visit one of her two Vancouver homes to drop off some boxes, then catch an evening flight to Mexico City.
	Eventually, she planned to continue on a trip that would take her to Costa Rica and the G20 in Argentina, with a stop in Paris on the way home.
	Instead, as she stood up from her business class seat onboard the Cathay Pacific 777, and stepped into the glass jetway, she was approached by two Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) officers.
	One of them checked her Hong Kong passport to confirm her identity, then asked for her phones: one white iPhone 7 Plus, and one red Huawei 20 RS Porsche Design, which Meng handed over to him.
	The other officer placed the phones in mylar bags provided by the RCMP, who had made the request to the CBSA on behalf of the FBI, then put them in his cargo pants pocket.
	Three RCMP officers stood watching out of view nearby.
	Â 
	The CBSA officers escorted Meng to the main international arrivals hall, where a kiosk spit out a receipt directing the executive to what's known as ""secondary inspection.""
	The officers, along with a supervisor, searched Meng's luggage, and questioned her on-and-off for two hours and 36 minutes, as part of what they called a routine admissibility exam.
	Those officers have since testified they had concerns related to national security and serious criminality.
	During that exam, Mounties waited in a supervisors' office that was within view of Meng, they have testified, but out of earshot.
	In the final moments of the exam, a CBSA officer asked Meng for the passcodes to her phones, which she provided, and which he wrote down both in his notebook and on a loose sheet of paper.

	Three hours after she landed, Meng was arrested by the RCMP.
	Mounties informed her she was facing bank and wire fraud charges in the U.S. and that there was a request for her extradition.
	The charges dealt with allegations surrounding Meng's role in Huawei's business dealings in Iran, and how Meng's alleged actions put a bank at risk of violating U.S. sanctions.
	Meng and Huawei have repeatedly denied any wrong doing.
	An RCMP constable, with a Mandarin-speaking constable standing by, read Meng her Charter rights and asked if she wanted to contact a lawyer.
	RCMP also took custody of her electronic devices, including the loose sheet of paper with the passcodes to her phones.
	Meng's luggage, house keys, and the code to her home alarm system were given to a friend who had been waiting to meet her.
	Â 
	Nearly two years after that day, Meng hasn't left Canada.
	She remains under virtual house arrest, on $10 million bail and conditions that require her to wear an ankle-monitoring bracelet, abide by a curfew, and to pay for her own private security team to prevent her from leaving the country.
	Meanwhile, two Canadians, former diplomat Michael Kovrig and entrepreneur Michael Spavor, who were arrested in China just days after Meng's arrest, have been charged with spying by Beijing.
	The ""two Michaels,"" as they've come to be known, have spent nearly two years in jail with little-to-no access to consular officials.

 Meng Wanzhou, right, leaves home for a court appearance in downtown Vancouver on Wednesday, May 8, 2019. 
	Meng's lawyers allege that the RCMP and CBSA co-ordinated and conspired with U.S. authorities to delay her arrest in order to extract evidence that could help the U.S. prove its case.
	Her defence team alleges the actions taken by the RCMP and CBSA, both of whom Meng is also suing, violated her rights under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
	They argue that the violations amount to an ""abuse of process"" of Canadian justice so grave, that the extradition case against her, currently being heard in B.C. Supreme Court, should be halted.
	RCMP, CBSA, and the individual officers and supervisors involved in the case, with a few exceptions, have repeatedly denied any and all wrong doing.
	For the very first time, the RCMP and CBSA officers who came into contact with Meng Wanzhou that day, along with their supervisors, have told their version of how the encounter unfolded.
	Over the past few weeks, they've answered questions from both the attorney general and Meng's defence lawyers about the circumstances surrounding her arrival, her questioning, her arrest, and her electronic devices. Meng's defence team plans to use any gaps, doubts, and discrepancies from the witness testimony as they make their abuse of process arguments before Associate Chief Justice Heather Holmes in early 2021. They also plan to make arguments that Meng is a political pawn in a trade war between Beijing and Washington, and that the U.S. cherry-picked evidence, while excluding potentially exculpatory facts, in order to mislead Canadian courts.
	Depending on her findings surrounding Meng's abuse of process claims, Justice Holmes may eventually have to decide if there is also sufficient evidence in the case to extradite Meng to the U.S. Experts have said appeals, if the judge rules against Meng, could take years.
	What follows is some of the more revealing testimony from key witnesses in October and November 2020, and how it may impact a case that's put both Vancouver and Canada at the centre of a political and economic battle between two global superpowers.

RCMP Const. Winston Yep testifies in October 2020 in B.C. Supreme Court (Sketch by Jane Wolsak)
	Const. Yep, who worked for an RCMP unit at B.C. headquarters that handles requests from outside jurisdictions, testified he first learned about the U.S. extradition request the afternoon before Meng arrived. He swore an affidavit in order to obtain a Provisional Arrest Warrant, which said Meng appeared to have no ties to Canada. Yep later learned Meng had two homes in Vancouver, but admitted in his testimony he never made any effort to correct the affidavit.
	The evening of Nov. 30, Yep testified, he and a colleague, Const. Gurvinder Dhaliwal met with CBSA personnel at YVR. Yep testified that the purpose of the meeting was to confirm if Meng was on the flight from Hong Kong, not to discuss the plan for the arrest. That evening, he testified, he became aware an RCMP higher-up had suggested Yep arrest Meng onboard the plane. ""It was just a suggestion,"" Yep testified.
	On the morning of Dec. 1, Yep, Dhaliwal and other Mounties joined members of the CBSA at YVR in a meeting in a supervisors' office. Yep testified he had ""safety concerns"" about arresting Meng on the plane. Defence lawyer Richard Peck pushed back and suggested Yep was lying: ""My view is that is not an honest answer. Safety was never an issue,"" Peck alleged. Yep disputed Peck's allegation, in part, by responding that safety, when it comes to arrests, is always an issue.
	During the morning meeting, Yep testified, it was decided CBSA would meet Meng at the plane. Two CBSA officers would conduct an admissibility exam for immigration and customs purposes in the secondary inspection area, before handing Meng over to the RCMP who would arrest her. Yep testified that Mounties asked CBSA officers to take Meng's phones and place them in mylar bags so they couldn't be remotely wiped, at the request of the FBI.
	With respect to the CBSA exam, Yep testified the delay was ""not intentional"" and that three hours was ""not unreasonable."" He testified that Mounties had no contact with Meng and while they waited in a CBSA supervisor's office nearby, they had ""no influence"" with the CBSA process.
	Yep also said he never asked CBSA officers, nor could he recall any fellow RCMP member asking the CBSA, to obtain any information from Meng during their exam.

	Const. Dhaliwal testified while his colleague, Const. Yep, was the arresting officer, he took on more of a communications role, as well as responsibility for Meng's electronic devices.
	He attended the Nov. 30 meeting with Yep at YVR, which he called a ""brainstorming session"" and testified he recalled a CBSA supervisor suggesting that the RCMP could arrest Meng Wanzhou in the jetway.
	Dhaliwal testified that at the Dec. 1 morning meeting, he could not recall who decided CBSA would take the lead and complete its exam before RCMP could arrest Meng. He indicated that he did not read the arrest warrant until days later. Dhaliwal also testified that he, Yep, and their direct supervisor, Sgt. Janice Vander Graaf were within view of the gate when two CBSA officers identified Meng, asked her for her phones, and placed them in the bags, he testified.
	During the CBSA exam, Dhaliwal testified he was charged with making regular updates to his unit as well as to a Canada Department of Justice lawyer.
	Dhaliwal testified that he did not direct the CBSA in its exam or pose any suggestions about what questions its officers should ask.
	After Yep arrested Meng, Dhaliwal took custody of Meng's two phones, laptop, tablet, and a USB flash drive. He testified that CBSA Officer Scott Kirkland also handed him a loose sheet of paper with the passcodes for Meng's phones. Dhaliwal testified he ""didn't even think about it"" and just put the paper with the phones. He said at no point did he or any RCMP member ask CBSA to obtain Meng's passcodes.
	Dhaliwal also testified about his dealings with RCMP Staff Sgt. Ben Chang, who led a team within the B.C. RCMP's Financial Integrity Unit. Email records from three days after Meng's arrest show Chang had been in touch with an FBI legal attachÃ©. Those emails show Chang requested Dhaliwal to document and provide him with identifying information for Meng's devices, including serial numbers and photos.
	According to her notes, Sgt. Janice Vander Graaf, Dhaliwal's direct supervisor, wrote that Dhaliwal later told her that Chang shared those numbers with the FBI. Dhaliwal testified he did not recall telling Vander Graaf what she wrote in her notes, and did not believe any RCMP member, including Chang, illegally provided evidence to U.S. law enforcement.

RCMP Sgt. Janice Vander Graaf testifies in November 2020 in B.C. Supreme Court (Sketch by Felicity Don)
	Sgt. Vander Graaf, who testified she started as a patrol officer in Surrey and has two decades of policing experience, is one of the senior Mounties ultimately responsible for Meng's arrest. She testified she first learned about the extradition request the afternoon of Nov. 30, and was in touch with constables Yep & Dhaliwal throughout the afternoon and evening.
	Vander Graaf testified that during a phone call with her supervisor, Acting Insp. Peter Lea, Lea made a ""strong suggestion"" that RCMP arrest Meng onboard the plane. Vander Graaf conveyed that message to Dhaliwal Friday night, but also testified she told him it would be fine to alter that plan if there was a reason.
	On Dec. 1, Vander Graaf was on a scheduled day off. But that morning, she testified, she received a call from Sgt. Ross Lundie, a Richmond Mountie stationed at YVR, who told her he wanted another senior officer onsite.
	Vander Graaf's notes show she arrived late to the meeting with CBSA. By the time she joined, she testified, the decision for CBSA to conduct its admissibility exam first, had already been made. Defence lawyer Scott Fenton asked if she expressed concerns, or called her boss to make him aware of the change in plan. Vander Graaf testified she did not object and did not think she called her supervisor. She also told Fenton that she had safety concerns about arresting Meng on the plane. When Fenton accused her of ""making this up into a much bigger thing (than it was),"" Vander Graaf denied the accusation, and testified her concerns surrounding safety were genuine.
	In revealing testimony that verged on combative, Vander Graaf also admitted she didn't read the arrest warrant, which called for Meng's ""immediate arrest,"" until 15 or 20 minutes before the flight landed from Hong Kong. Fenton pointedly suggested that because she hadn't read the warrant, Vander Graaf never took what he called a ""commandment for immediate arrest"" into consideration.
	Vander Graaf also testified she did not know how long CBSA's exam of Meng would take because it was ""their process."" When Fenton asked her if, hypothetically, the CBSA exam had taken two days, if the RCMP arrest would still be considered ""immediate,"" she replied: ""That could be, yes.""
	Defence also established that there had been some sort of ""chit-chat"" between CBSA and RCMP during the exam because Vander Graaf had written in her notes at the time Meng was carrying household goods, and the only place that detail could have come from, defence pointed out, was the CBSA.
	When it came to Meng's phones and the paper with her passcodes, Vander Graaf testified she told Dhaliwal to log them, because ""he couldn't unseize something that he'd already seized,"" and that giving them back to Meng would be ""less transparent.""
	Regarding her notes that Dhaliwal told her on Dec, 12 that RCMP Staff Sgt. Ben Chang had illegally provided identifying information about Meng's devices to the FBI, Vander Graaf stuck by her notes, then testified her concerns were later assuaged after she reviewed emails between Dhaliwal and Chang. Vander Graaf said she didn't take any further action because the emails, she said, provided more context and did not specifically indicate the evidence had been illegally shared. She also testified that she would have ""left it alone regardless"" because it was Chang's responsibility.
	In a fiery exchange, Fenton accused Vander Graaf of lying on the stand, and ""developing a memory,"" because he said her testimony about some of those emails was inconsistent with an affidavit she filed in 2019, where she wrote she had no independent recollection about those same emails.
	Meng's lawyer accused her of ""tailoring her evidence"" to protect the RCMP and to cover up alleged information sharing with the FBI.
	""That is absolutely not true,"" Vander Graaf said.

A court sketch from Jane Wolsak shows RCMP Sgt. Ross Lundie.
	Sgt. Lundie appears to have been one of the first Mounties aware that something unusual was about to transpire.
	As a supervisor for YVR office of the Richmond RCMP detachment, he testified he got a call from a colleague in Ottawa a week before Mengâs arrival. Lundie said the colleague asked questions about the âflowâ of arriving international travelers at YVR, and whether a traveller could exit the airport without encountering a CBSA officer.
	Lundie, who joined the RCMP in the late 1990s, testified he did not learn the name of the arriving traveler until the evening of Nov. 30, when he was asked to provide assistance to the RCMPâs Foreign Domestic Liaison Unit, as well as provide a Mandarin-speaking constable the next day.
	Lundie testified that he talked to constables Dhaliwal and Yep that evening on the phone, who raised the idea of arresting Meng on the plane. He testified that he âhad concerns with that right off the bat.â He had years of experience working alongside CBSA officers, Lundie said, and âitâs not something that we do,â he testified, unless there is an âimmediate public safety risk.â
	That evening, Lundie testified, he exchanged emails with higher-ups about Meng, telling some of them to âGoogle the name,â realizing she was âextremely high profile.â
	On Dec. 1, Lundie woke up to emails from FBI legal attachÃ© Sherri Onks, who he had previously met, and who asked him to keep her posted on Mengâs arrest. Lundie testified the request seemed âreasonableâ but also that he was not the lead on the case, instead indicating the RCMPâs Foreign Domestic Liaison Unit under Sgt. Janice Vander Graaf.
	Lundie attended the morning meeting at YVR with constables Yep and Dhaliwal and members of the CBSA. He testified that he suggested that CBSA conduct their examination of Meng first, and RCMP would arrest her after. Lundie said CBSA left the room to discuss, then returned and agreed, saying âthat made sense.â
	He also testified that he told CBSA that RCMP would not direct them in their exam, and said he was fully aware the two processes needed to be kept separate and any information sharing should only happen through formal channels.
	Lundie said he didn't recall if ""sanctions"" or ""Iran"" came up at the morning meeting.
	Under cross-examination, Lundie told defence lawyer Richard Peck that while the RCMP requested CBSA to bag Meng's cellphones, at the request of the FBI, he viewed that as a âreasonableâ request because it was ""just to secure them.""
	Lundie also told Peck that that during Meng's CBSA exam, he recalled hearing a conversation in the doorway of the CBSA superintendent's office, where he and Mounties were waiting, between either Const. Yep or Const. Dhaliwal and a CBSA officer that mentioned ""passwords"" or ""passcodes.""
	He testified that he didn't speak up because he didn't understand the relevance, and didn't realize CBSA had obtained Meng's passcodes
	""I had no idea why there would be passwords to phones obtained by anybody,"" Lundie said, before admitting in retrospect, as a senior officer concerned about blurred lines between CBSA and RCMP roles, he should have spoken up.
	While Lundie testified he was tasked by RCMP higher-ups with acting as the contact at YVR for the FBI legal attachÃ© the day of Meng's arrest, he testified he did not pass any information to the FBI ""that he shouldn't have.""
	He also told Peck that given his experience and position, he found being designated the FBI point-of-contact onsite put him in a ""very uncomfortable position.""

	Retired Staff Sgt. Ben Chang is the only witness in the Meng case to date who has declined to testify.
	Defence accuses Chang of illegally providing identifying information about Meng's electronic devices to the FBI, details they allege may have allowed U.S. investigators to access Meng's phone records and text messages.
	In an affidavit, Chang writes he was never specifically asked for the unique identifying numbers to Meng's devices from anyone at the FBI. Moreover, he writes, the information was never shared.
	His affidavit appears to be at least partially contradicted by an email from Chang to Dhaliwal that indicated the FBI legal attachÃ© had requested ""descriptions and lists of the devices"" including the serial numbers.
	Chang maintains in his affidavit that he asked Dhaliwal to gather only ""basic information"" about Meng's devices, along with photos, because he believed U.S. authorities would need it to make a formal request for the devices through a process known as the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT).
	According to the Globe & Mail newspaper, Chang now works as a senior security executive at a hotel and casino in Macau, which, like Hong Kong, is a special administrative region of China.
	Lawyers for Canada's Attorney General, according to documents filed with B.C. Supreme Court, have previously raised concerns around Chang related to ""witness safety.""
	The reference, first reported by the South China Morning Post, deals with a concern related to releasing notes from a 2019 phone call between Chang and a Department of Justice official.
	It's unclear if ""witness safety"" has any bearing on Chang's decision to not testify.
	When CTV News reached Chang's personal lawyer, Joe Saulnier, of Vancouver-based Martland & Saulnier, Saulnier said Chang had no comment.
	Meng's defence lawyers said Chang's refusal to testify may have ""any number of consequences"" and plan to incorporate it into their abuse of process arguments.

	Officer Katragadda was the least experienced member of the CBSA who dealt with Meng the day of her arrest, but also the officer who had the greatest amount of interaction with her.
	Katragadda, who joined the CBSA in 2015, testified he first learned about Meng at the Dec. 1 morning meeting at YVR with RCMP, where he said Mounties provided the arrest warrant.
	He also testified that, while he was not familiar with the name ""Meng Wanzhou,"" he had been previously aware that Huawei was suspect of assisting the Chinese government with spying.
	Katragadda testified he had admissibility concerns related to both serious criminality and national security.
	He said he did additional ""open source"" searching before Meng landed, which he said made him aware of the serious, high-profile nature of the matter, and that he could later be going to court.
	At the morning meeting with RCMP, Katragadda testified, he suggested CBSA conduct its exam of Meng first, before handing her off to the RCMP, but testified he couldn't recall who made the final decision.
	He testified he did not think the RCMP plan to arrest Meng on the plan was ""appropriate"" because he did not believe Meng posed an ""immediate risk.""
	Katragadda described Meng as a ""very pleasant person"" during their first interaction at the gate, where he identified her and asked her for her phones.
	He and Officer Scott Kirkland, who notes and surveillance video show, was chiefly assisting and taking notes, eventually escorted Meng to secondary inspection.
	Katragadda asked Meng some basic questions about her travels, searched her luggage, and X-rayed some boxes of household goods.
	Katragadda tesitified he was careful with his questions because he didn't want to be perceived to be asking Meng information on behalf of the RCMP or U.S. authorities.
	After less than an hour, Katragadda said, he had received enough information to adjourn the exam to a later date, and because he was mindful the RCMP were waiting to arrest Meng.
	But when he went to his supervisors' office, where he said Mounties were waiting, one of the CBSA supervisors on duty told Katragadda to hold off until they heard back from the CBSA National Security Unit.
	Katragadda testified that decision was ""not inappropriate"" but ""not what (he) had in mind.""
	The wait on a Saturday for two sets of additional questions from the unit, one of which dealt with countries Meng had travelled to, extended Meng's exam time to two hours and 36 minutes.
	In the final minutes before RCMP arrested Meng, Katragadda testified that he radioed Kirkland from the CBSA supervisors' office to ask Kirkland to obtain the passcodes to Meng's two phones.
	Katragadda testified that while he was the one who made the request, which he called ""reasonable,"" he could not recall whose idea it was.
	Less than 10 minutes later, notes and affidavits submitted by Katragadda and Kirkland show, RCMP arrested Meng.
	Katragadda testified he did not realize Meng's passcodes had been given to Mounties in error until ""days later"" at a debrief with CBSA higher-ups.

	Â 
	Officer Kirkland, who has been with the CBSA since 2008, testified that he had serious concerns in the Dec. 1 morning meeting with RCMP about possible Charter issues being raised if CBSA were to examine Meng first.
	He also explained that, at a Port of Entry, there is a lower expectation of privacy which allows border officers to ask questions and conduct searches for immigration and customs purposes.
	""Our examination (could) be argued as a delay in due process,"" Kirkland testified.
	Under cross-examination, Kirkland later clarified to Meng defence lawyer Mona Duckett that while he suggested at the morning meeting that CBSA identify Meng and ""step aside,"" he did not raise his Charter concerns.
	Calling the meeting ad-hoc without ""any serious in-depth conversations,"" he testified that RCMP did not object to CBSA going first, and did not give CBSA any direction on how to conduct its exam.
	""This was a rushed discussion,"" Kirkland said.
	Kirkland also testified that when he read the warrant and some news articles about Huawei that morning, he was shocked.
	""We knew this was going to be a big deal,"" Kirkland said. ""It was going to be a huge issue.""
	When Meng arrived just after 11 a.m. and handed over her phones, Kirkland was tasked with putting them in mylar bags, which he said he kept in his cargo pants' pocket.
	He later testified he didn't believe the bags, which had been provided by RCMP on behalf of the FBI, were effective at blocking signal transmission, because at one point, he said, the phones were vibrating.
	During the exam itself, Kirkland admitted to Duckett he intentionally did not answer Meng's repeated questions about why she was being examined in-depth, and deliberately did not mention the arrest warrant or U.S. criminal charges.
	He also reminded Duckett, multiple times, that Katragadda, as lead examiner, was in charge of questioning Meng along with deciding when to end the exam.
	Kirkland later conceded to Duckett she was correct when she suggested the exam did not raise ""an iota of evidence to support a national security concern"" when it came to Meng.
	When it came to the passcodes to Meng's phones, Kirkland testified that he typically wrote passenger passcodes down both in his notebook and a loose sheet of paper, which he said he eventually returns to the traveller.
	Kirkland's testimony directly contradicted Const. Dhillon's, who testified that Kirkland handed him the sheet with Meng's passcodes. Instead, Kirkland testified he left the sheet with Meng's belongings at the counter, and when he realized he had left it behind, he went back to look for it.
	Kirkland testified that RCMP obtained Meng's passcodes by mistake, and he never intended, nor was he directed by anyone to provide them to Mounties.

	Supt. Dhillon testified that he ""suggested"" to RCMP in the Dec. 1 morning meeting, along with CBSA Supt. Bryce McRae, that Mounties would not be able to intercept and arrest Meng at the gate.
	He testified that CBSA conduct its admissibility exam first, though. like his colleagues did not recall who made the final decision, saying ""that's how (he'd) been trained to do it.""
	Dhillon said at some point after the meeting, he spent roughly five to 10 minutes on the Huawei Wikipedia page, zeroing in on the section on ""controversies.""
	He testified he wondered ""if the fraud charges (against Meng) were related to any violations of sanctions.""
	He also said the article, which he later conceded under cross-examination by Mona Duckett could have been edited by anyone, raised concerns about national security and spying.
	Dhillon, who joined the agency in 2005, testified that he was the CBSA supervisor who relayed questions from the CBSA National Security Unit to one of the examining officers.
	Near the end of Meng's exam, Dhillon said he left the supervisors' office and approached the counter, where he began questioning Meng directly.
	He rejected accusations he was trying to gather evidence for the FBI, and instead stated he had national security concerns.
	Based on his Wikipedia research, Dhillon testified, he asked Meng if her company ""sold products in countries that they should not"" and specifically if Huawei ""sold products or did business in Iran.""
	He testified that based on Meng's ""non-verbal behavior...there's more to that story I was never able to explore.""
	Dhillon said he made no mention to Meng of the extradition warrant or U.S. fraud charges (which dealt with Huawei's business in Iran) because, he testified, he ""wanted (Meng) to speak to it.""
	He also admitted he did not tell Meng that RCMP were waiting to arrest her.
	During her cross-examination, Duckett accused Dhillon of lying on the stand and making up his Wikipedia research as a cover story in order to ask Meng about Iran, instead alleging he learned was told about Iran by RCMP during the morning meeting.
	Duckett called the research a ""creation after the fact"" and asked why Dhillon had singled out Iran, but not other countries mentioned on the Wikipedia page including North Korea, Venezuela, and Syria.
	Dhillon categorically rejected Duckett's accusations.
	He also testified that the RCMP did not ""instruct (him) to do anything that day.""

CBSA Supt. Bryce McRae testifies in B.C. Supreme Court in November 2020 (Sketch by Jane Wolsak)
	Supt. McRae testified he first became aware of the Meng case on Nov. 30, when the CBSA got a call, which emails filed in court show was from FBI legal attachÃ© Sherri Onks.
	Onks wanted a contact number for the supervisor on duty the next day, McRae later wrote in a 2019 email to Crown, because a ""notable client"" would be arriving.
	While McRae was on duty at YVR on Dec. 1, he testified he was ""not a direct player"" into how events unfolded and decisions were made.
	McRae said he recalled little about the morning meeting with RCMP, and testified he did not remember Officer Kirkland suggesting CBSA could quickly identify Meng, then hand her off to the RCMP to be arrested.
	Defence lawyer Mona Duckett accused him of having a ""poor memory.""
	With respect to CBSA's questioning of Meng, McRae testified he couldn't remember if he provided advice to Officer Katragadda on when to end the exam.
	McRae also testified he did not discipline Officer Kirkland for his mistake in providing Meng's passcodes to the RCMP.

              Top officials weighed Canadian warship's passage through sensitive strait near China

	Newly released documents have shed light on the secret government talks and debate that took place ahead of a Canadian warship's passage through a sensitive waterway near China last year.
	Those discussions included a private meeting between the top bureaucrats at the Department of National Defence and Global Affairs Canada, weeks before HMCS Ottawa sailed through the Taiwan Strait.
	Defence officials were also told to keep quiet about the frigate's trip in September 2019, three months after Chinese fighter jets buzzed two other Canadian ships making the same voyage.
	And they were ordered to keep the Privy Council Office, the department that supports the prime minister, in the loop as the Ottawa was making its way through the waterway.
	The unusual level of attention from the highest levels of government laid out in the documents, obtained by The Canadian Press through access to information, underscores the sensitivities surrounding the trip.
	That is because while much of the world considers the 180-kilometre strait to be international waters, Beijing claims ownership of the strait separating mainland China from Taiwan.
	Beijing, which regards the self-ruled island of Taiwan as a rogue province, has repeatedly condemned such passages by foreign warships from the U.S., Canada and elsewhere as illegal.
	HMCS Ottawa ended up sailing through the Taiwan Strait twice in early September. Media reports at the time said the frigate was shadowed by the Chinese navy.
	The heavily redacted memo to Global Affairs deputy minister Marta Morgan dated Aug. 7, 2019 starts by saying the Defence Department was looking for a risk assessment for the Ottawa's planned transit.
	Defence Department deputy minister Jody Thomas ""has also requested a meeting with you on Aug. 12 to discuss this deployment,"" the memo adds.
	While HMCS Ottawa was in the region at the time helping enforce United Nations sanctions against North Korea, the memo noted that the frigate was due to make a port visit in Bangkok in mid-September.
	Defence officials have publicly stated that the decision to have the Ottawa sail through the strait was because the route was the fastest way for the frigate to reach Bangkok from its position near North Korea.
	The memo backs that assertion, noting that going around Taiwan would add one or two days to the trip each way.
	Yet it also says the navy's presence in the South China Sea, of which the Taiwan Strait is a part, ""has demonstrated Canadian support for our closest partners and allies, regional security and the rules-based international order.""
	Global Affairs ultimately agreed to the Ottawa's sailing through the strait, but called on defence officials to keep the trip quiet, in large part because of fears the trip would coincide with the federal election campaign.
	""Finally, GAC will ask DND to ensure that it keeps PCO informed as this naval deployment progresses,"" the memo adds.
	Former Canadian ambassador to China David Mulroney described the discussions leading up to the Ottawa's transit of the Taiwan Strait as ""an illustration of smart and effective consultation producing the right decision.""
	""It is tremendously important that China sees that, in addition to the United States, other serious countries like Canada will not be intimidated into surrendering the Taiwan Strait and Taiwan itself to China's complete control,"" he said.
	""The RCN, working closely with Global Affairs, is promoting the national interest and asserting our sovereignty from the far side of the world.""

                ",https://www.ctvnews.ca/world/south-korea-agency-says-north-korea-executed-people-shut-capital-1.5206876,"SEOUL, KOREA, REPUBLIC OF -- 
	North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has ordered at least two people executed, banned fishing at sea and locked down the capital, Pyongyang, as part of frantic efforts to guard against the coronavirus and its economic damage, South Korea's spy agency told lawmakers Friday.
	Kim's government also ordered diplomats overseas to refrain from any acts that could provoke the United States because it is worried about President-elect Joe Biden's expected new approach toward North Korea, lawmakers told reporters after attending a private briefing by the National Intelligence Service.
	One of the lawmakers, Ha Tae-keung, quoted the NIS as saying Kim is displaying ""excessive anger"" and taking ""irrational measures"" over the pandemic and its economic impact.
	Ha said the NIS told lawmakers that North Korea executed a high-profile money changer in Pyongyang last month after holding the person responsible for a falling exchange rate. He quoted the NIS as saying that North Korea also executed a key official in August for violating government regulations restricting goods brought from abroad. The two people weren't identified by name.
	North Korea has also banned fishing and salt production at sea to prevent seawater from being infected with the virus, the NIS told lawmakers.
	North Korea recently placed Pyongyang and northern Jagang province under lockdown over virus concerns. Earlier this month, it imposed lockdown measures in other areas where officials found unauthorized goods and foreign currencies that were brought in, Ha cited the NIS as saying.
	North Korea also made an unsuccessful hacking attempt on at least one South Korean pharmaceutical company that was trying to develop a coronavirus vaccine, the NIS said.
	The agency has a mixed record in confirming developments in North Korea, one of the world's most secretive nations. The NIS said it couldn't immediately confirm the lawmakers' accounts.
	North Korea has maintained that it hasn't found a single coronavirus case on its soil, a claim disputed by outside experts, although it says it is making all-out efforts to prevent the virus's spread. A major outbreak could have dire consequences because the North's health care system remains crippled and suffers from a chronic lack of medical supplies.
	The pandemic forced North Korea to seal its border with China, its biggest trading partner and aid benefactor, in January. The closure, along with a series of natural disasters over the summer, dealt a heavy blow to the North's economy, which has been under punishing U.S.-led sanctions.
	North Korea's trade with China in the first 10 months of this year totalled US$530 million, about 25 per cent of the corresponding figure last year. The price of sugar and seasoning has shot up four times, Ha quoted the NIS as saying.
	North Korea monitoring groups in Seoul said the North Korean won-to-dollar exchange rate has recently fallen significantly because people found few places to use foreign currency after smuggling was largely cut off following the closure of the China border.
	According to the NIS briefing, North Korea ordered overseas diplomatic missions not to provoke the United States, warning their ambassadors of consequences if their comments or acts related to the U.S. cause any trouble in ties with Washington.
	North Korea's government has remained silent over Biden's election victory over U.S. President Donald Trump, with whom Kim held three summits in 2018-19 over the North's nuclear arsenal. While the diplomacy eventually stalled, the meetings helped Kim and Trump build up personal ties and stop the crude insults and threats of destruction they had previously exchanged.
	Lawmaker Kim Byung-kee cited the NIS as saying that North Korea is displaying anxiety as its friendly ties with Trump become useless and it has to start from scratch in dealing with the incoming Biden administration.
	Experts have been debating whether North Korea will resume major missile tests soon to try to get Biden's attention. During past government changes in the U.S., North Korea often conducted big weapons launches in an attempt to increase its leverage in negotiations with a new U.S. administration.
	The NIS expects North Korea will hold a military parade ahead of a ruling party congress in January in a show of force timed with Biden's inauguration. North Korea is also likely to use the Workers' Party congress to lay out its basic policies toward the U.S., Kim Byung-kee cited the NIS as saying.
	Kim Jong Un has said the congress, the first of its kind in four years, will set new state objectives for the next five years. In a highly unusual admission of its policy failure in August, the Workers' Party said North Korea's economy had not improved due to severe internal and external barriers and that its previous developmental goals had been seriously delayed."

China slaps 200 per cent tax on Australia wine amid tensions
          
","
China on Friday added wine to the growing list of Australian goods barred from its markets in a trade war against Australia over disputes including its support for a probe into the origin of the coronavirus.

	China on Friday added wine to the growing list of Australian goods barred from its markets in a trade war against Australia over disputes including its support for a probe into the origin of the coronavirus.
	The Ministry of Commerce imposed import taxes of up to 212.1%, effective Saturday, which Australia's trade minister said make Australian wine unsellable in China, his country's biggest export market.
	China increasingly is using its populous market as leverage to extract political concessions and increase its strategic influence.
	Earlier, China stopped or reduced imports of beef, coal, barley, seafood, sugar and timber from Australia after it supported calls for a probe into the origin of the coronavirus pandemic, which began in China in December.
	China's ruling Communist Party is trying to deflect criticism of its handling of the outbreak, which plunged the global economy into its deepest slump since the 1930s, by arguing the virus came from abroad, despite little evidence to support that.
	Meanwhile, Australia is working on a mutual defence treaty with Japan, which Chinese leaders see as a strategic rival, and has joined Washington and Southeast Asian governments in expressing concern about China's construction of military facilities on islands in the disputed South China Sea, a busy trade route.
	A Chinese foreign ministry spokesman called on Australia to ""do something conducive"" to improve relations but gave no details.
	""Some people in Australia adhering to the Cold War mentality and ideological prejudice have repeatedly taken wrong words and deeds on issues concerning China's core interests,"" said the spokesman, Zhao Lijian.
	Australia should ""take China's concerns seriously, instead of harming China's national interests under the banner of safeguarding their own national interests,"" Zhao said.
	Australia's main stock market index fell 0.5% on Friday following the news.
	""To a certain extent, this is Australia's fault for allowing itself to become a one-trick pony export-wise to China,"" market analyst Jeffrey Halley of Oanda said in a report.
	The Chinese market is especially important at a time when China is recovering from the coronavirus while the United States, Europe and other major economies are struggling with anti-disease controls that depress demand.
	The Ministry of Commerce said the wine tariffs are in response to complaints Chinese producers were damaged by improperly low-priced Australian imports.
	Australia's government denied subsidizing wine exports.
	Trade Minister Simon Birmingham said the accumulation of Chinese sanctions suggested they were due to ""other factors"" but gave no details.
	""The Australian government categorically rejects any allegation that our wine producers are dumping product into China,"" Agriculture Minister David Littleproud said.
	Australia has imposed restrictions meant to block foreign influence in its politics following complaints Beijing might be trying to manipulate its government.
	Australia also has joined the United States in imposing curbs on use of technology from Chinese telecom equipment giant Huawei Technologies Ltd. on security grounds."

              Canadians who say they've been targeted by foreign agents want co-ordinated response

              After burying his wife after the passenger jet she was aboard was shot down by the Iranian military, Javad Soleimani returned to Canada and began speaking out about the tragedy of Ukrainian International Airlines Flight PS752.

	After burying his wife after the passenger jet she was aboard was shot down by the Iranian military, Javad Soleimani returned to Canada and began speaking out about the tragedy of Ukrainian International Airlines Flight PS752.
	Soleimani's wife, fellow Edmonton PhD student Elnaz Nabiy, was among the 176 people -- including 55 Canadian citizens and 30 permanent residents -- killed Jan. 8 when the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps fired two missiles at the Boeing jet shortly after it took off from Tehran's airport.
	Then the Guard came calling on him, Soleimani said Thursday, after he assumed -- falsely -- that he was safe back in Canada.
	""Someone, probably a permanent resident, or perhaps a citizen of Canada, kept sending me messages telling me that IRGC is able to do anything in Canada and that I better be careful about myself,"" Soleimani said.
	He's reported incidents like that to the Canadian government, which has appointed former public safety minister Ralph Goodale to deal with the loved ones of PS752 victims, but not enough has been done to assuage the growing fears of Iranian Canadians, said Soleimani.
	""One day Canada was the safest place for all of us to live, but currently it's not at all safe.""
	Soleimani joined three other people via video link to a Parliament Hill press conference on Thursday, where they gave harrowing accounts of harassment by foreign agents operating on Canadian soil.
	They detailed how they had been victims of threats and intimidation by Iranian, Chinese and Russian foreign agents, and they said Canadian domestic police forces have proven ill-equipped to deal with their concerns.
	They were supporting a private member's bill from Conservative MP Garnett Genuis calling on the federal government to take stronger action against foreign interference, including creating a new single point of contact to report it.
	Genuis was following up on his party's successful motion in the House of Commons last week to call on the Liberal government to take a harder line against national security threats from China.
	""If a Canadian faces foreign-backed threats and intimidation, who do they go to? Many have reported getting the runaround,"" said the Alberta MP, who also serves on the special Commons committee on Canada-China relations.
	Soleimani was joined by members of Canada's Tibetan and Uighur communities, and a Canadian filmmaker and journalist who specializes in Russia, to put a human face on the growing accounts of foreign intimidation in Canada.
	In March, the National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians singled out China and Russia for their ""significant and sustained"" foreign interference in Canadian affairs, for trying to exploit the openness of Canadian society and for penetrating key institutions.
	The reconstituted Canada-China Commons committee intensified its examination of the topic this week, and was told by John McCallum, a former ambassador to China, that he rejected numerous visa applications from dubious Chinese travellers who had been flagged by security agencies.
	Chemi Lhamo, a University of Toronto student, recalled the harassment she endured because of her Tibetan heritage when she ran for student government in 2019. Her mobile phone exploded with 16,000 threatening comments on social media, including ""rape threats, death threats, not just against me, but my whole family.""
	One said, ""The blade that will go through you is made in China."" Another said. ""your mom is dead."" She had to call her mother ""just to check in on her, without frightening her.""
	Lhamo said she was followed by Chinese students on campus who took photos of her and those she spoke with. She got nowhere, she said, when she tried to get help.
	""I jumped from Toronto police, to my campus police, to RCMP, to dealing with CSIS, getting different levels of security or heads of security across the country,"" she said.
	""Ultimately, I still do not have a physical piece of paper that says, here's a report that we did, or here is the information on the people that have been threatening to kill you on Canadian soil.""
	Marcus Kolga, a filmmaker and freelance journalist who has devoted a critical eye to Russia, said he has been getting the ""runaround"" from his local police, the RCMP, and CSIS after being threatened multiple times by Kremlin-backed trolls between 2008 and 2019.
	Kolga, who is a member of the Macdonald-Laurier Institute think-tank, said he eventually received a message from the same Moscow IP address he'd heard from in the past ""asking whether I was dead yet.""
	Eventually, he said, a York Region police detective ""took a meaningful interest in the case"" and tracked down the malicious messenger.
	Rukiye Turdush, a Canadian-Uighur activist, said complaining to any Canadian authorities about Chinese harassment is complicated by the fact that many people like her have relatives back home in China's Xinjiang province. Chinese police make videos of their visits to play for their Canadian relatives.
	""They threaten them: `If you tell the Canadian police, if you do something, your mother's going to die, your father's going to be arrested.""'

              A 'white students' union' wants to set up a chapter at McGill University

              A self-styled 'white studentsâ union' that has had run-ins with several Toronto universities says itâs setting up a chapter at McGill University in Montreal.

                ",https://montreal.ctvnews.ca/a-white-students-union-wants-to-set-up-a-chapter-at-mcgill-university-1.5205469,"MONTREAL -- 
	A self-styled âwhite studentsâ unionâ that has had run-ins with several Toronto universities says itâs setting up a chapter at McGill University in Montreal.
	While the group has put up recruitment posters around McGillâs campus, however, thereâs little evidence it has gained momentumâa typical pattern, say some who have followed it and who question whether the supposedly multi-branched âstudent groupâ is much more than a single man in his 30s.
	The organization, called Students for Western Civilization, is run by Toronto man George Hutcheson, whoâs worked with many figures in Canadaâs far-right media and who recently appeared in a documentary on white nationalism.
	Hutcheson told CTV News that the group âseeks to affirm the rights, interests and identity of European-Canadiansâ by, among other things, âfighting anti-white hate speechâ and âpreserving and enhancing our cultural heritage.â
	He said the organization is applying for official status at McGill as a student group, but the student society that approves such requests said it hasnât received one from him, nor is it considering authorizing one if it does.
	âWe arenât aware of any recruitment efforts aside from the posters that had been put up around campus, but we can confirm that the so-called âWhite Students Unionâ is not recognized by or in any way affiliated with the [Studentsâ Society of McGill University],â said a statement emailed by SSMUâs spokesperson, Brooklyn Frizzle, on Wednesday.
	âThese messages do not align with the values of the SSMU,â the statement said.
	In a statement, McGillâs administration said it âfully respects freedom of speechâ but âwill remain vigilant to ensure that all members of our community feel safe, welcomed and respected on our campuses.â
WHY MCGILL?
	The Students for Western Civilization made the announcement on Monday, posting on its blog that it would be setting up shop at McGill.
	âCanadian universities like McGill have many ethnicity-based student groups, but none which defend the special interests of white students,â said the post.
	It said that Canadian students are âindoctrinatedâ with âanti-whiteâ messages, providing a bullet-point list with some of the perceived messages.
	âThat all white people are racist,â was one supposedly frequent accusation, while another was âthat white people are uniquely âfragile.ââ
	It also claimed thereâs a widely held belief âthat white people are âprivileged,â and our status, wealth, property can therefore be justifiably appropriated.â
	It invited McGill students to apply for the group but warned that âif you join usâ¦youâll be ostracized; slandered and attacked,â also saying âour ethnic group is persecuted.â
	Two and a half days later, the post had only 30 likes. The group also posted a photo on Twitter showing a poster with a stylized image of three white men and the words âWHITE STUDENTS UNIONâ plastered on what appeared to be a McGill campus building.
	In an email, Hutcheson claimed that the group picked McGill as the site of a new chapter at studentsâ requests.
	âWe chose McGill because we were contacted by five students there who wanted to start a branch,â he wrote.
	âSo far, weâve received 11 new applicants, but they havenât gone through our admission process yet.â
	However, Hutcheson said that there is no local person heading the Montreal chapter, and that he would be âtheir representative.â
	The group would ideally follow a calendar he claimed was established in Toronto, he said.
	âIn Toronto, our regular activities include a monthly academic meeting which is structured like a university tutorial, as well as a monthly social meeting. We will follow the same model in Montreal,â Hutcheson wrote.
	âIf we can obtain official status at McGill, we will also hold conferences there and bring in speakers.â
STUDENT SOCIETY BAFFLED
	Hutcheson said that application was in the works, adding in a second email that CTV News should consult [SSMU] for comment as âthey've already emailed us.â
	Frizzle, the SSMU spokesperson, said nobody from SSMUâs executive had emailed him and that no authorization process is underway.
	However, an odd email chain seemed to clear up the confusion. Someone had contacted the Students for Western Civilization through its standardized website form and had typed in a SSMU addressâwhich doesnât mean the writer actually had access to that email address. The writer went on to write a critique entitled âYouâre Unwanted at McGill.â
	Hutcheson treated this as an official correspondence from SSMU and ârespondedâ to the real SSMU executive with it, saying âweâ¦appreciate your candor,â though the SSMU executive had been unaware of the entire exchange. The email chain was shared with CTV News.
	In its statement to CTV, SSMU said it is very concerned by the idea the group could try to come to campus.
	âThe Executive Team is approaching this matter with the utmost seriousness and, in the interest of centring the experiences of People of Colour and not giving a platform to hateful dialogues, we are making every effort to resolve this situation swiftly and quietly,â it wrote.
âREALLY DANGEROUS STUFFâ
	A New York-based documentary filmmaker who spent time with Hutcheson said that despite the âreally sillyâ appearance of his group to many people, it shouldnât be underestimated.
	âHe knows what heâs doing,â said Daniel Lombroso, the director of the documentary âWhite Noise,â released this summer, about the global rise of the white nationalist movement.
	âHeâs basically going to use the student group as a way to radicalize college students,â he said.
	Hutcheson has appeared in Canadian media on and off for years. His group did a similar postering effort at several of Torontoâs universities in 2015 and 2017, sparking a backlash.Â 
	Hutcheson has also worked withÂ far-right political activist Faith Goldy, according to Lombroso.Â 
	His documentary followed far-right media personality Lauren Southern, who was dating Hutcheson at the time of filming.
	Lombroso accompanied the two of them on a date in Toronto in 2018, learning that Hutcheson is a âculinary white supremacistâ who refuses to eat ânon-whiteâ food, including, according to the film, ketchupâsince Hutcheson believes ketchup originated in China.
	Lombroso said Hutcheson was 30 at the time and is now about 32, and that he never mentioned where in Canada he grew up.Â 
	He wasnât himself a student, and there was little evidence at the time that his student group was a busy network, Lombroso said.
	âIt didnât seem like he had his hands full with work, is the best way I could put it,â Lombroso said.
	But he said Hutcheson is fluent in the language and aesthetic of the new white nationalism movement, from his haircut to the slick retro-looking campus posters.
	At one point, Lombroso said, Hutcheson told him that âwe Europeans cannot remain loyal to Canada if Canada doesn't remain loyal to us.â
	Itâs âmilitia-like language,â he said. âItâs really dangerous stuff.âÂ 
	It can also easily appeal to âdisaffectedâ students who are out of work and susceptible to the idea that the problem isnât the economy or the pandemic but that âpeople are conspiring against you as a white man,â Lombroso said.
	But as his documentary examines, the idea that being white is in itself a culture or even an ethnicity is an invention, Lombroso said.
	âIf he wanted to start a German culture club or a French culture club, no one would stop him. He can do that,â he said.
	âThe idea of whiteness asâ¦ an ethnicity is something that's never existed in history and has risen now as a way to preserve white power in the U.S. and Canada.â
	Lombroso happened to attend McGill himself, as an international student, and said that hearing Hutcheson was trying to recruit there alarmed him.Â 
	âItâs scary picturing him on campus doing that, because it could work,â he said. âIt really could work on people.â"

              'Pushed out of the ground': Why culled mink are resurfacing after burial in Denmark

              Some of the thousands of mink culled to minimize the risk of them re-transmitting the new coronavirus to humans have risen from their shallow graves in western Denmark after gases built up inside the bodies, Danish authorities said Thursday.

	Some of the thousands of mink culled to minimize the risk of them re-transmitting the new coronavirus to humans have risen from their shallow graves in western Denmark after gases built up inside the bodies, Danish authorities said Thursday.
	""The gases cause the animals to expand and in the worst cases, the mink get pushed out of the ground,"" Jannike Elmegaard of the Danish Veterinary and Food Administration said. He said it affected ""a few hundred"" animals.
	The mink are buried in trenches that are 2.5 metres (8.25 feet) deep and 3 metres (10 feet) wide. A first layer of about 1 metre of dead mink are then covered with chalk before another layer of animals is laid, covered again with chalk and then with dirt, Elmegaard told The Associated Press.
	But because the soil where they are buried is sandy, some have re-emerged. ""We assume it is the mink that were in the upper layer that pop up,"" he added calling it ""a natural process.""
	""Had the earth been more clayish, then it would have been heavier and the mink would not have resurfaced,"" he told the AP. The animals who resurface are reburied elsewhere, and authorities guard the site to keep away foxes and birds.
	Denmark culled thousands of mink in the northern part of the country after 11 people were sickened by a mutated version of the coronavirus that had been observed among the animals.
	Earlier this month, the Social Democratic minority government got a majority in parliament to back its decision to cull all of Denmark's roughly 15 million mink, including healthy ones outside the northern part of the country where infections have been found. The proposed law also bans mink farming until the end of 2021.
	The government had announced the cull despite not having the right to order the killing of healthy animals, an embarrassing misstep that caused it to scramble to build political consensus for a new law.
	Parliament also has to decide to pay compensation to the breeders. Danish mink farms are the world's biggest supplier of mink fur, accounting for 40% of global production. Most exports go to China and Hong Kong.
	There are 1,139 mink farms in Denmark, employing about 6,000 people. Breeders have said the culling will put an end to the industry. Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen on Thursday visited a mink farm in northern Denmark and said it had been ""emotional."" The operators ""had their life's work shattered in very, very short time,"" she said, before wiping tears away with her sleeve.
	""When we get on the other side of this ... then I hope that they and all other mink breeders will remember that it is not because of them and that it is not because they have been bad mink breeders,"" Frederiksen said.
	The coronavirus evolves constantly as it replicates but, to date, none of the identified mutations has changed anything about COVID-19's transmissibility or lethality."

	China's top diplomat on Thursday stressed the importance of bilateral relations while meeting senior officials in South Korea, where there is growing concern the country is becoming squeezed between China, its biggest trading partner, and military ally the United States.
	Moon's ambitions for inter-Korean engagement have faltered amid stalled nuclear negotiations between the U.S. and North Korea, which have disagreed over the release of crippling U.S.-led sanctions against North Korea in exchange for disarmament steps by the North.
	China, as North Korea's only major ally and economic lifeline, is seen as having unique leverage over the government in Pyongyang.
	Wang arrived in Seoul following a visit to Japan, where he met Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga.
	In Tokyo on Wednesday, Wang told Suga that he wants the two Asian powers to have good relations and co-operate in fighting the coronavirus and reviving their pandemic-hit economies. But the two sides remain at odds over an island dispute.
	South Korea has been eager to repair its relations with China, its biggest trading partner, which reacted furiously to Seoul's decision to deploy an advanced U.S. anti-missile system on its soil in 2016 to better cope with North Korean threats. There is also concern in South Korea over a deepening row between Washington and Beijing over trade, security, human rights and other issues, which could force Seoul into a difficult balancing act.
	China, which says the U.S. anti-missile system in South Korea could be reconfigured to peer into its territory, had been accused by Seoul of retaliating by limiting visits by Chinese tour groups to South Korea. Beijing also destroyed South Korean supermarket giant Lotte's business in China after the company sold a plot of land to the South Korean government where the anti-missile system was later installed.
	South Korea had hoped to secure a visit by Chinese leader Xi Jinping this year in what Seoul officials describe as a key step in repairing relations, but the pandemic has complicated such plans.
	When asked about a possible Xi visit, Wang pointed to the face masks worn by reporters, saying that the coronavirus must first be contained.
	South Korea on Thursday reported 583 new cases of the coronavirus, its biggest daily increase in about eight months, as a resurgence in the capital region threatens to erase hard-won gains."

	An RCMP officer who oversaw the arrest of Meng Wanzhou two years ago says she is not aware of any Mounties sharing information from the Huawei executive's electronics with U.S. law enforcement.
	Sgt. Janice Vander Graaf was head of the foreign and domestic liaison unit tasked in 2018 to take Meng into custody, an arrest that soured Canada's relations with China.

	However, Vander Graaf told the evidentiary hearing in Meng's extradition case that she soon believed that wasn't accurate, after Dhaliwal shared emails related to what he reported.
	âI realized that it didn't say exactly what Const. Dhaliwal had told me,â Vander Graaf said under questioning by John Gibb-Carsley, a lawyer for Canada's attorney general.

	British Columbia is a hotbed for electric vehicles and now thereâs another high-end electric car company making inroads here on the west coast.
	Polestar, a spin-off company of Volvo, is bringing two types of luxury electric and hyrbrid vehicles to the B.C. market.
	The company will not have traditional brick-and-mortar car dealerships, however. Polestar is a digitally based company where customers can do everything online, from arranging a test drive to choosing a colour, options, ordering and financing.
	""Within two or three minutes you can order your car online, put a deposit on it and itâs built within three to four weeks and the vehicle will be here and ready for delivery,"" said Barry Sadler, a senior manger at the Vancouver Island-based GAIN Group.
	The companyâs primary electric vehicle is the Polestar 2, a luxury five-door fastback that has a 375 kilometre range on a single charge.
	Other key features include regenerative breaking, 0-100km/hr acceleration in under five seconds, a panoramic sunroof, seating for five and more.
	""There has been a tremendous amount of interest in the vehicle, people are overwhelmed by itâs driving abilities,"" said Sadler.
	""Itâs all powered by Android-Auto so thatâs key and a big difference to some of the other electric cars in the marketplace,"" he said. ""I have had a chance to drive it, and itâs amazing.""
	The China-built base model starts at $69,900 and goes up from there depending on added features.
	The company also builds the Polestar 1, a limited-edition high-end hybrid vehicle. The carbon fibre two-door coupe carries a $197,000 price tag with limited availability.
	The new EV company advertises home delivery and pickup service for customers within 250 kilometres of a Polestar space.
	Polestar Vancouver opened in Park Royal Mall in West Vancouver but will move to a new permanent home at the corner of Seymour and Robson streets in downtown Vancouver in the spring of 2021.
	Polestar sales centres have no salespeople; instead, customers will be assisted by non-commissioned product specialists who can help with product information and test drives.
	The Vancouver Island-based GAIN Group will represent the brand in Western Canada along with Polestar Vancouver.
	There are two other locations opening in Canada, one in Toronto and the other in Montreal.
	The GAIN Group has already begun to take pre-sale orders throughout Western Canada.
	People can see, touch and test drive the new Polestar 2 by contacting the GAIN Group and making an appointment.
	According to the B.C. government, British Columbia had the most sales of electric vehicles per-capita in all of North America compared to other provinces and states last year.
	Vancouver Island saw the highest number of electric vehicle sales last year, at roughly 9.9 per cent of all vehicles sold. Meanwhile, the provincial average during the same time period was nine per cent.
	California boasted the second highest number of per-capita electric vehicle sales in North America with eight per cent, followed by Quebec with seven per cent.Â "

	Chinese President Xi Jinping congratulated U.S. President-elect Joe Biden on Wednesday and expressed hope for ""win-win co-operation"" amid conflicts over trade, technology and security that have plunged Sino-American relations to their lowest level in decades.
	Biden is widely expected to try to resume co-operation with China on North Korea, climate change and the coronavirus following the confrontational approach of President Donald Trump, who launched a tariff war and sanctioned Chinese companies. But analysts expect few major U.S. policy changes due to widespread frustration with Beijing over trade, human rights and technology theft.
	China became one of the last major governments to congratulate Biden two weeks ago. There was no explanation for the delay but some commentators suggested Beijing wanted to avoid straining relations with Trump, who had yet to concede and is in office for another two months until Jan. 20.
	In a message to Biden, Xi said ""healthy and stable"" relations are ""the common expectation of the international community,"" according to the official Xinhua News Agency.
	""We hope the two sides will uphold the spirit of non-conflict and non-confrontation, mutual respect and win-win co-operation, will focus on co-operation, control differences and promote healthy and stable development of Chinese-U.S. relations,"" the statement said.
	It said Chinese Vice-President Wang Qishan also sent a message to Kamala Harris to congratulate her on being elected vice-president.
	The United States and China have one of the world's biggest trading relationships but official ties have been roiled by spying accusations, the coronavirus pandemic, Beijing's crackdown on Hong Kong and disputes over control of the South China Sea.
	Trump has blocked access to U.S. technology for Chinese telecom equipment maker Huawei Technologies Ltd. on security grounds. He is trying to limit access to the United States for Chinese social media services, which the White House says might gather too much personal information about Americans.
	Trump has stepped up pressure on Beijing since the election by issuing an order that bars Americans from investing in securities issued by companies U.S. officials say are owned or controlled by the Chinese military.
	Some forecasters suggest the change from Trump, who rejected multilateral alliances, to Biden might increase pressure on China if Washington forms a coalition with other developed countries to push for policy changes.
	China tried to recruit Germany, France, South Korea and other governments as allies against Washington but all have refused. They criticized Trump's trade tactics of surprise tariff hikes, which also were used against allies, but echoed U.S. complaints that China is violating its free-trade commitments.
	Trump shook China's leaders by hiking tariffs on Chinese products in 2018 over complaints Beijing steals or pressures companies to hand over technology.
	The White House has lobbied allies to exclude Huawei, China's first global tech brand, from next-generation telecom networks on security grounds.
	On Tuesday, the British government proposed a law that would tighten security controls on next-generation networks and exclude companies such as Huawei that are deemed high risk. That would formalize a ban announced in July by Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Huawei taking part in a planned next-generation mobile network.
	Trump is pressing Chinese-owned video service TikTok to sell its U.S. operation and is trying to block companies from dealing with WeChat, the popular Chinese messaging service."

	Malaysia's Top Glove, the world's largest maker of rubber gloves, said Wednesday that supply disruptions at its factories due to an outbreak of the coronavirus may push glove prices up.
	The company said it shuttered 20 of its factories in an area outside Kuala Lumpur in stages since Nov. 17 after nearly 3,000 workers tested positive for the virus. Another eight facilities in the same area are currently running below 20% of capacity, and will also be closed to screen and quarantine workers.
	""Of course, there is some shortage as Top Glove is a big supplier in the world. Supply will definitely be affected somehow ... there is a possibility that glove prices will go up,"" executive chairman Lim Wee Chai told a virtual news conference.
	The company, which accounts for about a quarter of global supply, has said it expects between two and four weeks of delays in some deliveries and estimated a 3% impact on projected annual sales for the 2021 financial year.
	Managing director Lee Kim Meow told the news conference that there have been no order cancellations so far. He said priority will be given to hospitals and essential services amid the shortage, and voiced confidence that the issue will be resolved quickly. Top Glove produces about 90 billion rubber gloves a year, and exports to 195 countries.
	The area in Klang where Top Glove factories and workers' hostels are located is currently the most active in the country, with 4,036 coronavirus cases. Barbed wires surrounded two Top Glove hostels that have been placed under lockdown.
	The health ministry said cases have spread from the factories to the wider community. Malaysia has reported a total 59,817 cases, including 345 deaths.
	The company said some 6,000 workers have been screened, with a few thousands more to undergo testing by the end of this week.
	Lim dismissed concerns of contamination, saying that workers have no direct contact with the gloves, with the production lines fully automated, and that the high heat in the ovens would kill the coronavirus.
	He said his team was taken by surprise by Human Resources Minister M. Saravanan's comments that checks so far revealed ""deplorable"" conditions at the workers' housing.
	""I have visited the hostels and the conditions are terrible. My officers were ordered to go in full force as this is a big, vulnerable migrant worker colony. If we don't act, this cluster might get out of control,"" Saravanan reportedly told a local newspaper this week. An aide to the minister confirmed his comments to The Associated Press.
	Lim said he was puzzled as to why the minister changed his tune because he had given approval during a visit to Top Glove factories a few months ago.
	""Since the minister's visit, our housing condition has continued to improve ... because we pour in more money to improve facilities and we want to do it quickly. So it came as a big surprise when such comments were made,"" he said, adding that the company will seek clarification.
	Top Glove has more than 11,000 workers at the 28 affected factories in Klang. The company has said it has invested millions of dollars in recent months to upgrade housing facilities and ensure that strict health measures were followed to curb the spread of the virus.
	It employs a total of 21,000 workers in its 41 factories in Malaysia and six other facilities in Thailand, Vietnam and China."

	""The Indian side should immediately correct this discriminatory practice so as to avoid causing greater damage to the co-operation between the two sides,"" said the spokesman, Zhao Lijian.
	Zhao called on India to ""safeguard the legitimate rights and interests"" of Chinese companies but gave no indication whether Beijing might retaliate.
	The United States and some other governments also have expressed concern about whether Chinese apps might be gathering too much sensitive information about their users. The Trump administration is pressing TikTok's Chinese owner to sell its U.S. operation.
	Chinese-Indian relations are unusually sensitive because soldiers from the two sides are locked in a standoff over control of an area along their border high in the Himalayas."

	Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam lauded the city's new national security law on Wednesday as ""remarkably effective in restoring stability,"" despite criticism that it is severely narrowing the space for free speech and political opposition in the semi-autonomous Chinese territory.
	Lam said in her annual policy address that the law had prevented a return of political unrest and that bringing normalcy back to the political system is an urgent priority.
	Beijing imposed the security law on Hong Kong in June, aiming to crack down on dissent following months of anti-government protests in the city that at times descended into violence. Last year's protests were triggered by a proposed extradition law that would have allowed suspects in Hong Kong to be sent to the mainland. The proposal was eventually scrapped.
	""Advocacies of Hong Kong independence and collusions with external forces have progressively subsided, some of the prominent figures have kept a low profile, radical organizations have ceased operations or dissolved,"" Lam said in her address.
	""After a year of social unrest with fear for personal safety, Hong Kong people can once again enjoy their basic rights and freedoms, according to the law,"" she added.
	Lam also criticized foreign governments for interfering in Hong Kong's affairs, saying it had jeopardized national security.
	The security law's passage has drawn strong criticism among rights groups and foreign governments, who say it betrays China's promise under the ""one country, two systems"" framework to allow Hong Kong to maintain its own legal system and civil liberties for 50 years following the handover from British to Chinese control in 1997.
	They point to the curtailing of free speech through the outlawing of statements advocating Hong Kong's independence and criticism of China, the pulling of books from public libraries with suspect political views and a new emphasis on ""patriotic education"" in schools.
	The U.S. responded to the new law by targeting a number of Chinese and Hong Kong officials responsible for implementing the legislation with travel bans and financial sanctions, Lam among them, and by moving to reduce Hong Kong's special status with the imposition of higher tariffs and visa restrictions.
	The U.S. and a number of other countries also suspended their extradition treaties with Hong Kong, while Britain said it would allow holders of British National (Overseas) passports extended stays and a path to citizenship. Taiwan opened an office to help Hong Kongers interested in moving to the island.
	Beijing has rejected all such actions and criticisms as brazen political interference and taken an ever-tougher stance on dissent in Hong Kong.
	Earlier this month, China passed a resolution disqualifying four pro-democracy Hong Kong lawmakers after they were accused of violating their oaths of office. The move prompted all of Hong Kong's pro-democracy legislators to resign en masse as a show of solidarity.
	Lam said Wednesday that Hong Kong has experienced one of its most severe political challenges over the past year.
	""One of our urgent priorities is to restore Hong Kong's constitutional order and political system from chaos,"" she said.
	She said the government would introduce a bill by the end of this year to amend local laws related to oath-taking, to ""deal with those who have engaged in conduct that breaches the oath of the swearing-in.""
	Lam's address had been postponed for more than a month so she could seek Beijing's support for various economic measures aimed at reviving Hong Kong's economy.
	A leader of pro-democracy legislators in Hong Kong, Wu Chi-wai, criticized Lam's policy address, saying it was ""taking Hong Kong people to a wrong direction"" with policies including greater co-operation with China in areas such as finance, aviation and technology.
	""She bet the future of Hong Kong on the Greater Bay Area and the mainland economy. It will ruin the international city of Hong Kong,"" Wu said. ""We cannot and should not ... put all our eggs on one particular economic territory.""
	Wu and other remaining pro-democracy legislators are expected to officially step down from their positions by Dec. 1."

	One of Canada's most controversial ex-ambassadors to China says he repeatedly tried to improve the living conditions of Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor after their imprisonment in the People's Republic almost two years ago.
	John McCallum also said Tuesday he regrets speaking about the October 2019 Canadian election in a meeting with Chinese officials in the months leading up to it.
	McCallum, the former Liberal cabinet minister who was fired as Canada's envoy to China in January 2019, was testifying at the special House of Commons committee on Canada-China relations.
	Prime Minister Justin Trudeau fired McCallum after he made a series of public comments that broke with the government's line following the arrests of Kovrig and Spavor.
	The two men were arrested nine days after Canada's arrest of Chinese high-tech scion Meng Wanzhou in December 2018 on a U.S. extradition warrant in what is widely viewed as retaliation by China.
	McCallum said that's when everything changed in Canada's relations with China.
	""From that moment onwards, the top priority of the government and of myself as ambassador was to secure the release of the two Michaels,"" said McCallum, noting that he has been one of the few people to visit them in prison.
	""On more than one occasion, I tried to convince the Chinese that if they were unable to release Kovrig and Spavor they should at least improve their living conditions. Sadly, as you all know, Canadian efforts in this area have so far been unsuccessful.""
	The committee has been examining Canada's relations with China, which have plummeted to an all-time low since December 2018.
	Earlier Tuesday, Conservative MP Michael Chong urged Foreign Affairs Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne to adopt a more consistent approach to getting tough with China.
	The Conservative foreign affairs critic told Champagne during a House of Commons committee meeting Tuesday that the government needs to show Canadians how it will deal with growing Chinese intimidation of Canadians within Canada.
	Chong said it is inconsistent for the government to be talking tougher on China, while Canada's current ambassador, Dominic Barton, is making speeches about the need to broaden trade with the People's Republic.
	""I think it needs to be a lot clearer, a lot more consistent if Canada is going to have a clear, consistent voice with respect to China on the world stage,"" said Chong.
	Chong sponsored a motion that won approval in the Commons last week that calls on the government to decide within 30 days whether to allow China's Huawei Technologies to supply equipment for its next generation 5G internet network. Meng is a chief executive of Huawei.
	Champagne replied that Canada has taken a smart and firm approach with China lately that includes speaking out against its ill treatment of pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong and of ethnic Muslim Uighurs.
	""Whether it comes to the Uighurs or whether it comes to Hong Kong, I've outlined places where we're going to challenge China, places where we're going to, for example, coexist with China,"" Champagne said.

	Since Canadaâs travel restrictions on non-essential international travellers came into effect in mid-March, more than 335,000 foreign nationals have flown into this country, and 154 national interest exemptions have been granted, according to figures tabled in the House of Commons.
	According to the Canada Border Services Agency, as of October 335,872 travellers who are not Canadian citizens or permanent residents have flown to Canada since the federal Quarantine Act was imposed, limiting non-essential travel and imposing a 14-day self-isolation on people entering Canada from abroad. The CBSA was unable to provide a breakdown of the reasons for their entry.
	The United States was where the highest number of travellers were coming from, followed by India, France, Mexico, China, Philippines, United Kingdom, Korea, Jamaica, Guatemala, and Germany.
	While the number of travellers averaged around 20,000 a month between March and May, over the summer the number of foreign nationals coming to Canada increased. In June there were more than 37,000 people who flew into this country, rising to more than 59,000 in July, and hitting a pandemic-era high in August, with more than 84,000 travellers coming in. In September there were more than 73,000 travellers who flew in.
	As CTVNews.ca has previously reported, according to CBSA figures from March 31 to Nov. 12, an approximate total of 6,544,803 travellers have entered the country, the vast majority of whom were not required to isolate because they were deemed essential workers.
	In order for a traveller to be exempt from mandatory quarantine requirements, they must meet an exception outlined in the order enforcing the Quarantine Act. 
	Over the course of the pandemic, separate exemptions have been made for certain close family members of Canadian citizens, but those travellers have largely been required to complete a 14-day self-isolation upon arrival.
	As part of the quarantine rules in place, the federal government has been requiring those coming into this country to provide proof of an adequate isolation plan, and then in April required anyone returning to Canada to have a âcredible quarantine planâ or be forced to spend 14 days in isolation in a âquarantine location,â such as a hotel.
	According to a separate government response, as of August âapproximately $37 million has been spent on costs associated with hotel accommodations and quarantine site services.â
	While the government wonât say specifically where the lodging sites are, the option to isolate in a hotel is available in Vancouver, Kelowna, Calgary, Winnipeg, Regina, Toronto, Montreal, Halifax, Fredericton, St. Johnâs and Whitehorse.
	Across these sites there are 1,600 rooms available, and the government has no end date in sight for offering to put people up who need a spot to self-isolate.
	However, not all non-Canadians who have come into Canada have had to isolate. A trio of federal ministers have been able to grant national interest exemptions, allowing non-essential foreign nationals to enter Canada and bypass quarantine.
	Based on responses issued to MPs, as of Oct. 5, Public Safety Minister Bill Blair has issued nine exemptions over the course of the pandemic: five in May for family members to attend the funeral of a member of the Canadian Armed Forces, three in July for individuals in the shipbuilding industry related to a government defence project, and one for a witness to attend a criminal proceeding in-person in September after the court denied an application to testify remotely.
	Foreign Affairs Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne has granted 140 national interest exemptions as of Oct. 5, but Global Affairs Canada was unable to provide details about who was allowed into Canada, citing Canadaâs privacy laws.
	And, Immigration Minister Marco Mendicino has issued five exemptions over the course of the pandemic, all for players and staff of professional sports leagues, which resulted in a total of 1,458 individuals being allowed in to this country, where the leagues had public health plans in place that were approved by the Public Health Agency of Canada.
	âThe issuance of exemptions in these five cases was considered to be in the national interest given the importance of professional sports to Canada's society and economy. In particular, the presence of these individuals in Canada to practice and play their respective sports was deemed to support economic growth and recovery, social cohesion, national pride, and the beginning of a positive return to normalcy,â read the departmental response tabled in Parliament.
As of October, when the federal government eased the current cross-border travel policies on family reunification and boosted monitoring for travellers entering the country, Blair said that since the start of the pandemic, between two and three per cent of all COVID-19 cases confirmed in Canada have been tied to travel."

	The overwhelmingly Quebec federalist anglophone community may have sighed relief in 2018 knowing that if a non-Liberal provincial government had to be elected, at least it had not been replaced by an avowedly secessionist one. But nationalism in Quebec endures and is competitive. Inversely linked to the past setbacks for either sovereignty or federal constitutional change will be the need of the CAQ government to compensate for those losses by taking a stronger stance on language, starting with a new bill in January, announced on Tuesday.
	While Quebec anglophones will likely greet this prospect with dread, they are not powerless to positively influence events. Hereâs why. During a previous respite from the sovereignty prospect in 1985, the Bourassa Liberal government was elected with a twin commitment to allow multilingualism on commercial signage, which was important to anglophones, in addition to some federal constitutional proposals that became the basis of the 1987 Meech Lake Accord recognizing Quebec as a âdistinct societyâ in Canada, which was key for francophones.
	Nevertheless, that government reneged on its sign commitment in December 1988 when it passed Bill 178 banning languages other than French on outdoor signs. And while the Canadian parliament didnât intervene to defend minority rights through its power of disallowance, within days of the Billâs passage the Manitoba legislature rescinded its earlier approval of the Meech Lake Accord, and the other provinces started to hesitate with concerns over minority rights. The Accord was doomed.
	As a result, one could observe that a kind of temporary âre-majority-izationâ (meaning Canadaâs English language majority more actively supporting its community presence in Quebec) emerged that helped replace the falling into disuse of the federal power of disallowance, used to assure minorities of their future protection in Canada when it was founded in 1867. English-speaking community leaders should try to resurrect this pan-Canadian influence again, but this time for the benefit of all Quebecers. How?
In an Oct. 22 CTV commentary, I introduced the prospect of what I call the âlinguistic social contractâ that could be embedded within a written Quebec constitution compatible with its Canadian counterpart. Central to this prospect would be an appeal again to the other governments of Canada to help Quebec anglophones help themselves find a common vision as a minority with Quebecâs francophone majority as outlined in an Aug. 21 Montreal Gazette op-ed I co-wrote with Giuliano DâAndrea. And that same document could also be used to recognize Quebecâs characteristics (âdistinctâ âuniqueâ or whatever) within Canada.
	At the moment, all of Quebecâs parties in the National Assembly are committed to federally related constitutional change. Nevertheless, to accommodate any of their programs as written, the procedural approvals of other provinces, as were needed during the Meech and Charlottetown rounds, will likely be required again. The communityâs leadership should create a task force to lobby the other provinces to consider a Quebec constitution as a way to protect minorities in Quebec as well as recognize Quebecâs overall place in Canada.
	In fact, the most usual place to find a definition of a societyâs political characteristics is through a referral to its constitution. To link these minority rights and Quebecâs recognition aspiration within a single Quebec document would make our community less susceptible to francophone unilateralism (i.e. francophones using their numerical majority to overwhelm us) during any negotiation. And such a linkage would be morally defendable within Canada and internationally as long as we donât abuse that help by being unreasonable or insensitive to francophonesâ needs. Unlike the Quebec Liberals' expedient abandonment of its 1985 sign pledge, a Quebec constitution would allow all groups to realize their goals at the same time upon enactment.
	There is an old American political saying (and a Vulcan proverb for fans of Star Trek) that says: âOnly Nixon can go to Chinaâ (Some politicians can get away with things others canât). No government across our land has ever questioned English-speaking Quebecers' commitment to Canada. If anyone can help facilitate Canada trying again to win the National Assemblyâs consent to the 1982 Canadian constitution, itâs Quebec anglophones.
	In his 1960 inauguration speech, U.S. president John F. Kennedy offered that âThe time to repair the roof is when the sun is shining.â
	Now with the sovereignty issue on the backburner, there is an opportunity to not only protect anglophones within Quebec but also help the people with whom we share a homeland find recognition and respect within Canada.

	Declaring ""America is back,"" U.S. president-elect Joe Biden introduced his national security team, his first substantive offering of how he'll shift from Trump-era ""America First"" policies by relying on experts from the Democratic establishment to be some of his most important advisers.
	""Together, these public servants will restore America globally, its global leadership and its moral leadership,"" Biden said Tuesday from a theatre in his longtime home of Wilmington, Delaware. ""It's a team that reflects the fact that America is back, ready to lead the world, not retreat from it.""
	The nominees are all Washington veterans with ties to the Obama administration, a sign of Biden's effort to resume some form of normalcy after the tumult of President Donald Trump's four years in office. Another sign that Biden will soon be in charge: He scheduled a Thanksgiving address to the nation for Wednesday afternoon, planning to focus his remarks on shared sacrifices during the holiday season and expressing confidence that Americans will get through the coronavirus pandemic together.
	There are risks to choosing experienced hands from the previous Democratic administration. Besides Republican attacks, progressives fret that Biden is tapping some officials who were too cautious and incremental the last time they held power.
	Still, Biden's nominees were a clear departure from Trump, whose Cabinet has largely consisted of men, almost all of them white. Biden's picks included several women and people of colour, some of whom would break barriers if confirmed to their new positions.
	On Tuesday they stood behind Biden and Vice-President-elect Kamala Harris spaced apart and wearing masks to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, a contrast with Trump and many of his top aides who have largely eschewed facial coverings.
	The president-elect's team includes Antony Blinken, a veteran foreign policy hand well-regarded on Capitol Hill whose ties to Biden go back some 20 years, for secretary of state; lawyer Alejandro Mayorkas to be homeland security secretary; veteran diplomat Linda Thomas-Greenfield to be U.S. ambassador to the United Nations; and Obama White House alumnus Jake Sullivan as national security adviser.
	Avril Haines, a former deputy director of the CIA, was picked to serve as director of national intelligence, the first woman to hold that post, and former Secretary of State John Kerry will make a curtain call as a special envoy on climate change. Kerry and Sullivan's position will not require Senate confirmation.
	With the Senate's balance of power hinging on two runoff races in Georgia that will be decided in January, some Senate Republicans have already expressed antipathy to Biden's picks as little more than Obama world retreads.
	Sen. Tom Cotton, an Arkansas Republican and potential 2024 presidential candidate, argued that Biden is surrounding himself with people who will go soft on China.
	Sen. Marco Rubio, another potential White House hopeful, who sits on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that will consider Blinken's nomination, broadly wrote off the early selections.
	""Biden's cabinet picks went to Ivy League schools, have strong resumes, attend all the right conferences & will be polite & orderly caretakers of America's decline,"" Rubio tweeted.
	Biden said his choices ""reflect the idea that we cannot meet these challenges with old thinking and unchanged habits."" He said he tasked them with reasserting global and moral leadership, a clear swipe at Trump, who has resisted many traditional foreign alliances.
	The president-elect said he was ""struck"" by how world leaders have repeatedly told him during congratulatory calls that they look forward to the U.S. ""reasserting its historic role as a global leader"" under his administration.
	Trump, who has debated recently whether to mount another presidential campaign in 2024, appeared to defend his worldview on Tuesday.
	""We shouldn't go away from that -- America First,"" he said at the annual turkey pardon, a lighthearted pre-Thanksgiving White House tradition.
	While Trump expected total loyalty from his Cabinet and chafed at pushback from advisers, Biden said he expected advisers to tell me ""what I need to know, not what I want to know.""
	Further drawing a contrast with Trump, Haines said she accepted Biden's nomination knowing that ""you value the perspective of the intelligence community, and that you will do so even when what I have to say may be inconvenient or difficult.""
	Haines said she has ""never shied away from speaking truth to power"" and added ""that will be my charge as director of national intelligence.""
	Biden celebrated the diversity of his picks, offering a particularly poignant tribute to Thomas-Greenfield. The eldest of eight children who grew up in segregated Louisiana, she was the first to graduate from high school and college in her family. The diplomat, in turn, said that with his selections, Biden is achieving much more than a changing of the guard.
	""My fellow career diplomats and public servants around the world, I want to say to you, `America is back, multilateralism is back, diplomacy is back,""' Thomas-Greenfield said.
	Mayorkas, who is Cuban American, also offered a nod to his immigrant upbringing.
	""My father and mother brought me to this country to escape communism,"" he said. ""They cherished our democracy, and were intensely proud to become United States citizens, as was I.""
	But Mayorkas might pose the most difficult confirmation challenge from Biden's early round of nominees.
	The Senate previously confirmed him in December 2013 by a party-line vote to be the deputy secretary of Homeland Security. The Senate was controlled by Democrats then, and all of the chamber's Republicans voted against his confirmation mainly because he was then under investigation by the inspector general in that department who had been appointed by President Barack Obama. At the time, the Senate historian's office said it was unprecedented for the Senate to vote on a nominee who was under investigation.
	The inspector general, John Roth, found in March 2015 that Mayorkas, as director of the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, appeared to give special treatment to certain people as part of the visa program that gives residency preference to immigrants who agree to invest in the U.S. economy.
	Meanwhile, there were signs on Tuesday that the stalled formal transition of power is now underway. Biden's team now is in contact with all federal agencies, according to a transition official who spoke on condition of anonymity to describe developments that have not been announced.
	At the Pentagon, Kash Patel, chief of staff to the acting secretary of defence, is heading the department's transition work. A transition task force has been assembled, led by Tom Muir, head of the Pentagon office that provides administrative and management services to all Defence Department facilities in the Washington area.
	Muir said the first meeting with Biden's team was held virtually on Tuesday morning and that he expected daily meetings to come -- some virtually and some in person. He said normal accommodations for the Biden team have been made, including provision of briefing materials, video-teleconferencing capabilities, and office space inside the Pentagon.
	Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar also said his agency is working to get briefing materials to Biden's aides immediately and pledged a ""professional, co-operative and collaborative"" transition.
	The moves came a day after the head of the General Services Administration wrote the necessary letter of ""ascertainment"" acknowledging Biden as the apparent winner of the election, triggering the transition process.
	Trump, who continues to press a legal challenge to overturn the election results, again on Tuesday refused to concede his election loss.
	Trump tweeted that ""the GSA does not determine who the next President of the United States will be.""

              India bans 43 more mobile apps, including many from China

	India banned 43 mobile apps on Tuesday, including many from China, with which it is locked in a military standoff along their border in the Himalayas.
	India's information technology ministry said the apps threaten the âsovereignty and integrity of India.â
	The banned apps include four from Chinese retail giant the Alibaba Group.
	Tuesday's move comes months after India banned scores of Chinese-owned apps, including popular short-video app TikTok and mobile game PUBG, saying it had received reports that they were âstealing and surreptitiously transmitting users' data.â
	China and India have been locked in a bitter border dispute for months in the remote Ladakh region. The standoff between the Asian giants erupted in early May into a fierce brawl, and then worsened on June 15 into hand-to-hand combat with soldiers using clubs, stones and fists, leaving 20 Indian troops dead. China is believed to also have suffered casualties, but has not given any details.
	The two sides have held several rounds of talks among military and diplomatic officials, but the standoff has persisted.
	India's app bans have been hailed by governing party leaders as a way to curtail China's growing influence.
	Chinese-owned apps have found a fast-growing market in India, with some companies creating India-specific apps that have exploded in popularity."

              Russia says Sputnik V coronavirus vaccine 95 per cent effective 
          
","
              Russia said Tuesday its Sputnik V coronavirus vaccine was 95 per cent effective and would be cheaper and easier to store than some alternatives, as the global race heats up to develop a jab.

                ",https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/coronavirus/russia-says-sputnik-v-coronavirus-vaccine-95-per-cent-effective-1.5202264,"
	Russia said Tuesday its Sputnik V coronavirus vaccine was 95 per cent effective and would be cheaper and easier to store than some alternatives, as the global race heats up to develop a jab.
	The announcement was the latest in a flurry of breakthroughs as several vaccine makers worldwide published preliminary data showing efficacy rates of 90 per cent and higher.
	Countries are hoping to begin inoculating their populations by year's end or in early 2021 to stop a pandemic that has claimed the lives of nearly 1.4 million people.Â 
	Russia was one of the first to announce the development of a vaccine in August -- dubbed Sputnik V after the Soviet-era satellite -- but before the start of final clinical trials.
	In statement on Tuesday, the vaccine's developers said preliminary data after trials involving thousands of volunteers showed ""an efficacy of the vaccine above 95 per cent"" after a second dose.
	Russia's health ministry, the state-run Gamaleya research centre and the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) said in the statement they expected the vaccine to record an even higher effectiveness after the next analysis.
	""No unexpected adverse events were identified as part of the research,"" it said, though some of those vaccinated suffered short-term effects including fever, weakness, fatigue, and headache.
Less than US$10 per dose
	The two-dose vaccine will be available on international markets for less than US$10 (8.40 euros) per dose, they said, and will be free for Russian citizens.
	It can be stored at between two and eight degrees Celsius (between 35.6 and 46.4 degrees Fahrenheit), they said, instead of the temperatures far below freezing required for some other vaccines.
	Pharma giants Pfizer and BioNTech announced that their virus vaccine is 95 per cent effective, while U.S. company Moderna said last week early results showed its candidate was 94.5 per cent effective.
	Western experts have in the past expressed concern over Russia's vaccine, fearing that its development could be rushed.
	Several welcomed Tuesday's announcement though they said more data was needed.
	""This is yet more good news demonstrating a high interim vaccine efficacy,"" said Azra Ghani, an infectious diseases specialist at Imperial College London.
	""The lack of any serious adverse events in approximately 20,000 trial participants is also very encouraging,"" she said.
	Russia has applied to the World Health Organization for accelerated registration and pre-qualification of the Sputnik V vaccine.Â 
	President Vladimir Putin last week said that Russia had manufacturing agreements in place with China and India and encouraged Brazil and South Africa to also mass produce Russian-developed vaccines.
	The head of the RDIF, Kirill Dmitriev, said Tuesday that European Union member Hungary would also manufacture the Sputnik V vaccine.
	Russia in recent weeks has registered a steep increase in new coronavirus infections but has stopped short of introducing strict measures like some European countries.
'Alarming' rise in Russia cases
	The country's total infections on Tuesday stood at 2.14 million, the fifth-highest caseload in the world.
	But at 37,031, virus deaths are significantly lower than other badly hit countries, raising concerns that the authorities are downplaying the pandemic's severity.
	Data published by Russia's federal statistics service earlier this month indicated excess deaths of more than 117,000 year-on-year between March and September, suggesting that virus fatalities could be much higher.
	While Moscow remains the epicentre of Russia's outbreak, the country's poorly funded regions are taking the brunt of the second wave.Â 
	Deputy Prime Minister Tatiana Golikova on Tuesday said that in six of Russia's 85 regions, over 90 per cent of hospital beds dedicated to Covid-19 patients were occupied.
	Russia hopes to avoid a second nationwide lockdown by accelerating the production of vaccines.
	Putin has dismissed talk of another lockdown and emphasized last week that vaccines are on their way despite voicing concern over the country's ""alarming"" case totals and fatality rate.
	He last month announced that Russia had registered a second coronavirus vaccine, EpiVacCorona.Â 
	Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Tuesday said that Putin -- who has said that one of his daughters took part in the Sputnik V clinical trials -- could not volunteer to take the vaccine as ""head of state""."

China reports 2 new virus cases after mass testing

	China on Tuesday reported two new coronavirus cases in the cities of Shanghai and Tianjin as it seeks to prevent small outbreaks from becoming larger ones.
	The National Health Commission said there were two new locally spread cases in the previous 24-hour period, one in each city. It also reported 20 cases among people who had arrived from overseas.
	In Shanghai, the mass testing of 17,719 workers at the city's Pudong aiport found one infection, a Fedex employee. Everyone else tested negative.
	Three UPS workers at the airport have also tested positive in recent days, along with the wife of one of them. In all, Shanghai has reported eight non-imported cases since Friday.
	In Tianjin, where 2.3 million people had been tested as of Monday, the city reported one case in a person who developed symptoms after testing positive earlier. China does not include people without symptoms in its confirmed case count.
	To date, the health commission has recorded 86,464 confirmed cases and 4,634 deaths.
	In other developments in the Asia-Pacific region:
	Authorities in Hong Kong have ordered bars and nightclubs to close as the city grapples with new local infections. From midnight on Thursday, entertainment venues such as bars, nightclubs and saunas must shut temporarily as part of tightened social distancing measures.
	The city on Tuesday reported 80 new infections, its highest daily increase since the first week of August. Of the new cases, 54 were linked to an outbreak in dancing studios which so far has led to 187 infections.
	Health minister Sophia Chan said Tuesday that there are âmultiple transmission chainsâ in the city as well as infections with untraceable sources, and that social distancing measures must be tightened. She urged people to avoid large gatherings and stay at home.
	Authorities are also making it compulsory for hotels, restaurants and fitness centres to display a QR code linked to the government's âLeave Home Safeâ mobile app to facilitate contact tracing.
	Health officials are also making it compulsory for high-risk groups to be tested for the virus, including taxi drivers and staff working at homes for the disabled or elderly. Hong Kong has recorded 5,782 infections, including 108 deaths.
	Philippine officials say about 60 million Filipinos are being targeted for vaccination against the coronavirus next year at a cost of more than 73 billion pesos (US$1.4 billion) to develop considerable immunity among a majority of Filipinos.
	Carlito Galvez Jr., who oversees government efforts to secure the vaccines, said negotiations were underway with four Western and Chinese pharmaceutical companies, including U.S.-based Pfizer Inc. and China's Sinovac Biotech Ltd., to secure the vaccines early next year. He said that one company based in the U.K., AstraZeneca, can commit to supply up to 20 million vaccines.
	The Philippines has had more than 420,000 confirmed cases, the second-most in Southeast Asia behind Indonesia, and 8,173 deaths.
	Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has urged states that are experiencing a surge in coronavirus cases to establish cold storage facilities for the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines and asked them to review the situation.
	Modi's meeting Tuesday with heads of the states comes at a time when India's cases have soared past 9.18 million. More than 134,000 people have died from COVID-19.
	Modi said his government is in touch with vaccine developers around the world. âOur priority is to make the vaccine available for all,â he said. âThis mission of coronavirus vaccination of each citizen is like a national commitment.â
	India has some of the world's biggest vaccine makers and there are five vaccine candidates under different trial stages in the country. But state-run cold storage facilities used to keep vaccines refrigerated are inadequate for the enormous challenge of distributing a COVID-19 vaccine.
	To address the issue, the government is augmenting cold storage facilities and transport systems for vaccines. It is also readying a database of healthcare and frontline workers who will be inoculated first.
	Even though the number of new daily cases nationwide has remained below 50,000 for several weeks after peaking in September, the situation in some states, including Delhi, has given rise to concern. Several cities are seeing a jump in cases and are implementing stricter restrictions like night curfews. On Tuesday, the country reported 37,975 new confirmed cases and 480 more deaths."

              What you need to know about minks and the coronavirus
          
","
              Farmed for their soft fur, minks are the only animal proven to both contract the new coronavirus and re-infect humans, thereby compromising efforts to stop the spread of the virus.

                  Tuesday, Nov. 24, 2020
                ",https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/coronavirus/what-you-need-to-know-about-minks-and-the-coronavirus-1.5202207,"COPENHAGEN, DENMARK -- 
	Farmed for their soft fur, minks are the only animal proven to both contract the new coronavirus and re-infect humans, thereby compromising efforts to stop the spread of the virus.
	While the small creatures haven't played a major role in the spread of the virus so far, alarm bells were recently sounded in Denmark.
	The first case of a mink being infected with the new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, and a mink farm worker subsequently being infected, was registered in the Netherlands in April, according to a recent report by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC).
	""It has been established that human-to-mink and mink-to-human transmission can occur,"" the ECDC wrote.
	Since then, mink infections have been reported in a number of other countries, including Denmark, France, Italy, Spain, Sweden and the United States.
	In Denmark, the world's biggest exporter of mink pelts and the country hardest hit by mink infections, more than 280 mink farms were contaminated and the minks culled.
	A total of 373 people in Denmark have been infected with one of several mutated mink strains, according to the most recent tally last week.
	While several animals, such as cats, can become infected with the new coronavirus, they are currently not known to re-infect people.
	Why minks then? According to the French Agency for Food, Environmental and Occupational Health and Safety, minks are more likely to re-infect humans because the animals are more likely to get a heavy viral load in their crowded cages and therefore be more infectious.
	The mutated mink strains are no more contagious or dangerous to humans than other strains of the virus, according to the ECDC.
	But scientists have warned that minks could become a viral source that could both easily infect people and lead to new mutations.
	The ECDC has urged member states to beef up testing at mink farms.
	In most of the affected countries, minks at contaminated farms have been slaughtered. Some countries, such as Ireland, have decided to cull their stocks even though they have not registered any cases.
	RNA viruses like the novel coronavirus that first appeared in China at the end of 2019 regularly mutate without any major consequences.
	But in early November, experts from Denmark's infectious disease institute SSI identified a new mink strain, dubbed ""Cluster 5"", that had infected 12 people in August and September.
	The strain has a mutation in the gene encoding the coronavirus' spike protein, which it uses to enter cells. This concerned experts because changes in this region could affect the immune system's ability to detect the infection, as many vaccines train the immune system to block the spike protein.
	As a result, any future vaccine against Covid-19 could be less effective on this strain.
	Following the discovery, the Danish government, which had already ordered infected farms to cull their animals, announced the slaughter of all of the country's 15 to 17 million minks.
	It also imposed strict restrictions on the 280,000 people living in the regions where the human cases of ""Cluster 5"" had occurred.
	Authorities last week announced that no new cases of ""Cluster 5"" had been detected in minks or people since mid-September, and said the strain was ""most likely"" extinct.
	Scientists remain cautious about the real danger the mutation posed to vaccines.
	It ""could... have an impact on the effectiveness of developed vaccine candidates"", but ""investigations and studies are ongoing to clarify the extent of these possible implications,"" the ECDC noted.
	The slaughter of all minks in Denmark and the Netherlands means the industry -- which provides pelts to fashion houses -- will never recover, according to farmers who say it takes more than 10 years to cultivate minks with top quality fur.
	Even before the virus, the sector had struggled in recent years with growing opposition to wearing fur.
	Some countries have already banned mink farming, while several major fashion houses such as Chanel and Gucci have stopped using fur, with ""fur prices dropping sharply as a result. In fact fur farming hasn't been a profitable business for years,"" Joh Vinding, head of animal rights association Anima, told AFP.
	According to Statistics Denmark, mink pelt exports fell by 63 percent between 2013 and 2019, to 4.9 billion kroner (657 millions euros, US$782 million).
	China is the world's biggest market for furs."

COVID-19 is running unabated across almost every American community, and one model projects it will take the country just under two months to reach a staggering 20 million cases.
	The U.S. could nearly double its current numbers -- about 12.4 million reported infections -- by January 20, according to the Washington University in St. Louis forecasting model.
	The prediction comes as COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations nationwide are exploding, with more than 3.1 million infections reported in the U.S. since the start of November -- the most reported in a single month ever.
	Hospitalizations are at harrowing highs, with more than 85,800 hospitalized COVID-19 patients in the US, another record set for the 14th day in a row, according to the COVID Tracking Project.
In California, hospitalizations climbed by 77% over the past 2 weeks, while ICU admissions were up 55%. Ohio hospitalizations increased at least 59% over two weeks, the governor said, adding the state currently has the most ICU patients since the pandemic's start. Pennsylvania's top health official warned Monday the state could run out of ICU beds within a week.
	Some experts have predicted that health care workers -- already overwhelmed and exhausted -- could soon be faced with difficult decisions of rationing care as hospitals reach capacity.
	And as numbers continue to rise, hundreds more Americans will lose their lives to the virus each day. More than 10,000 people have died in just the past week -- many of them alone and without the chance to say goodbye to their loved ones.
	More than 257,600 people have died in the U.S. since the pandemic's start -- more than any other country by far. And another 140,000 could die over the next two months, according to projections from the University of Washington's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation.

	Things will get worse in the coming weeks, before they begin getting better with the help of a potential vaccines, experts have cautioned.
	But with millions of travellers already ignoring the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warnings against traveling for the holidays, many fear Thanksgiving celebrations will only help fuel an already rampant spread of the virus.
	Speaking during a live interview with The Washington Post Monday, Dr. Anthony Fauci urged Americans to reconsider traveling for Thanksgiving as cases surge across the US -- and cautioned of what could come next.
	""We are in a very steep escalation of cases right now in the mid-fall season,"" he said. ""If in fact, you're in a situation when you do the things that are increasing the risk -- the travel, the congregate settings, not wearing masks -- the chances are you will see a surge superimposed upon a surge.""
	This week, he said, ""the safest thing you can do is to confine the activities in your own with the immediate occupants of that home.""
	It's a suggestion that's been repeated by experts, health officials and local and state leaders across the country in recent weeks ahead of the holiday.
	Alabama's top doctor said Monday that ahead of the holidays, ""our numbers are worse than they have ever been"" and urged residents to think of the more vulnerable members in their community when preparing their holiday plans.
	""What kind of Thanksgiving we have is going to go a long way to determining what December looks like, what's our holiday season going to look like,"" State Health Officer Dr. Scott Harris said. ""Are we going to be here a month from now trying to have the same conversation?""
	""I really, really hope not.""
	Â 
	Â 
	Amid the crisis, Americans can take a simple step to protect themselves, according to Dr. Scott Gottlieb, the former US Food and Drug Administration commissioner: ""Buy a better mask.""
	""While there are still some shortages of medical masks, health care workers have dedicated supply chains,"" Gottlieb wrote in a Wall Street Journal op-ed on Sunday. ""It's time to revise the guidance to consumers.""
	N95 masks and their equivalents offer the best protection against the virus, he wrote, and will filter out at least 95% of the infectious particles. Their equivalents include the KN95 from China and the FFP2 from Europe.
	Surgical masks offer protection of about 60%, Gottlieb said. But quality matters.
	""A real medical-procedure mask will be cleared by the Food and Drug Administration and designated as offering one of three levels of protection. Generally, a level 2 or level 3 medical mask is best,"" he wrote.
	Cloth masks are the least protective, but if they're the only option, they should be thick, snug-fitting and made of cotton-polyester blends.
	""Slowing the current cycle of spread will be difficult. But encouraging Americans to wear higher-quality masks is a simple step that might make a difference,"" he wrote.
	More governors have moved in recent weeks to mandate masks across their state amid Covid-19 surges.
	In North Carolina, Gov. Roy Cooper announced he was tightening the state's mask requirement to make it clear that ""everyone needs to wear a mask whenever they are with someone who is not from the same household.""
	The governor's new order will also require masks in public indoor spaces even when residents are maintaining six feet of distance, gyms while exercising, all schools and all public or private transportation when residents are traveling with people outside of their household. The order will also require large retail businesses to station an employee near entrances to ensure customers are wearing masks and following occupancy limits.
	""I have a stark warning for North Carolinians today: We are in danger, Cooper said in a statement. ""This is a pivotal moment in our fight against the coronavirus. Our actions now will determine the fate of many.""

	It's not just adults getting infected at rapidly rising rates.
	There were more than 256,000 new COVID-19 cases reported in children between November 5 and November 19, according to a joint report from the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Children's Hospital Association.
	That means as of November 19, nearly 1.2 million children had tested positive for the virus since the pandemic's start -- representing nearly 12% of all Covid-19 cases in states that report infections by age. The numbers in the report come from 49 states, New York City, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and Guam.
	The report comes as more leaders across the country have begun shutting down schools amid case surges.
	The Metro Nashville Public School district announced Monday schools will return from Thanksgiving break to all-virtual learning, and will remain that way for the rest of the semester.
	""Our transmission rate, new cases per 100,000 residents, and 7-day positivity rate are at their highest points in months, and the situation may only be getting worse,"" Director of Schools Dr. Adrienne Battle said in a statement. 
	""This is a serious and dramatic public health emergency that requires us all to renew our vigilance and take the safety precautions necessary to keep ourselves, our families, our friends, and those we may encounter safe through the wearing of masks, social distancing, and avoidance of large -- especially indoor -- gatherings whenever possible.""
	And New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio announced last week public school buildings would close out of an ""abundance of caution"" after the city's 7-day average reached the 3% positive testing rate threshold. 
	Also last week, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear issued an executive order halting in-person learning at K-12 public and private schools starting this week. He also called for middle and high school students to continue remote learning until at least January 4, while it would allow for elementary schools to reopen December 7 as long as the school isn't in a ""Red Zone"" county -- something that's determined by the state's health department standards and adheres to other state guidance.
	On Friday, the state's attorney general announced he would join a federal lawsuit against the order, arguing it is unconstitutional because it would prevent religious organizations from providing private education.
	Â 
	Â 
	Meanwhile, as state leaders navigate the coming weeks, a possible vaccine candidate could be on the way.
	On Friday, Pfizer and BioNTech submitted to the FDA for emergency use authorization for their Covid-19 vaccine candidate. Pfizer previously said a final analysis of the Phase 3 trial of their vaccine shows it was 95% effective in preventing infections, even in older adults, and caused no serious safety concerns.
	Early data released last week showed the Moderna vaccine also has a stunningly high success rate -- 94.5% effective against the virus. And AstraZeneca announced Monday its experimental COVID-19 vaccine has shown an average efficacy of 70% in large-scale trials.
	The FDA has now asked members of its vaccine advisory committee to reserve December 17 and 18 for meetings, presumably to discuss the vaccine being developed by Moderna, according to a source familiar with the process.
	The FDA consults with its Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee before allowing any vaccine -- including a COVID-19 vaccine -- to go on the market.
	The FDA has also called a meeting of the committee for December 10 to consider Pfizer's application for emergency use authorization.
	Moderna is awaiting more data on study participants who became ill with the coronavirus and could apply to the FDA for emergency use authorization in the next week, according to a Moderna spokesman.
	""Within the next week or so, we expect to see efficacy data based on 151 COVID-19 cases per our protocol, and, if appropriate based on the data, make an EUA submission shortly thereafter,"" spokesman Ray Jordan told CNN."

              Lunar mission is latest milestone in China's space ambitions
          
","
China's latest trip to the moon is another milestone in the Asian powerhouse's slow but steady ascent to the stars.
        ","
                  Tuesday, Nov. 24, 2020
                ",https://www.ctvnews.ca/sci-tech/lunar-mission-is-latest-milestone-in-china-s-space-ambitions-1.5201981,"WENCHANG, CHINA -- 
	China's latest trip to the moon is another milestone in the Asian powerhouse's slow but steady ascent to the stars.
	China became the third country to put a person into orbit 17 years ago and the first to land on the far side of the moon in 2019. Future ambitions include a permanent space station and putting people back on the moon more than 50 years after the U.S. did.
	But even before the latest lunar mission lifted off before dawn Tuesday, a top program official maintained that China isn't competing with anyone.
	""China will set its development goals in the space industry based on its own considerations of science and engineering technology,"" Pei Zhaoyu, deputy director of the Lunar Exploration and Space Engineering Center at the China National Space Administration, told reporters hours before the Chang'e 5 mission was launched.
	""We do not place rivals (before us) when setting those goals,"" Pei said.
	Whether that is true or not is debatable. China has a national plan aimed at joining the United States, Europe and Japan in the top ranks of technology producers, and the space program has been a major component of that. It also is a source of national pride to lift the reputation of the ruling Communist Party.
	What's clear is that China's cautious, incremental approach has racked up success after success since it first put a person in space in 2003, joining the former Soviet Union and the United States. That has been followed by more crewed missions, the launch of a space lab, the placing of a rover on the moon's relatively unexplored far side and, this year, an operation to land on Mars.
	The Chang'e 5 mission, if successful, would be the first time moon rocks and debris are brought to Earth since a 1976 Soviet mission. The four modules of the spacecraft blasted off atop a massive Long March-5Y rocket from the Wenchang launch centre on Hainan island.
	The mission's main task is to drill 2 metres (about 7 feet) into the moon's surface and scoop up about 2 kilograms (4.4 pounds) of rocks and other debris. The lander will deposit them in an ascender. A return capsule will deliver them back to Earth, landing on the grasslands of the Inner Mongolia region in mid-December.
	""Pulling off the Chang'e 5 mission would be an impressive feat for any nation,"" said Florida-based expert Stephen Clark of the publication Spaceflight Now.
	China prides itself on arriving at this point largely through its own efforts, although Russia helped early on with astronaut training and China's crewed Shenzhou space capsule is based on Russia's Soyuz.
	While there has been collaboration with some other nations, notably those belonging to the European Space Agency, which has provided tracking support for Chinese missions, the United States isn't one of them.
	U.S. law requires Congressional approval for co-operation between NASA and China's military-linked program. Ongoing political and economic disputes, notably accusations that China steals or compels the transfer of sensitive trade secrets, appear to dim the prospects for closer ties.
	China's space program has at times been seen as recreating achievements attained years ago by others, primarily the U.S. and the former Soviet Union. Even China's permanent space station, now under construction, is partly a response to its exclusion from the International Space Station, mainly at the insistence of the U.S.
	Other countries are also forging ahead, underscored by the dramatic landing of America's Curiosity Mars rover in 2012 and the return to Earth next month of Japan's explorer Hayabusa2 with samples collected from the asteroid Ryugu.
	Still, China can boast an ""increasingly sophisticated and demonstrated space expertise,"" said Henry Hertzfeld, director of the Space Policy Institute at George Washington University's Elliot School of International Affairs.
	Lunar exploration remains a priority for China, something that in the future will likely take the form of ""a human-machine combination,"" Pei told reporters.
	No target date for a crewed moon mission has been announced, but Pei said a goal down the line is to build an international lunar research station that can provide long-term support for scientific exploration activities on the lunar surface.
	""We will determine when to implement a manned lunar landing based on scientific needs and technical and economic conditions,"" he said.

	Canada's main stock index surged higher Tuesday alongside other North American markets, as the Dow Jones industrial average passed the 30,000-mark for the first time.
	Investors reacted positively on Tuesday to an injection of certainty into the future of the economy, said Craig Jerusalim, senior portfolio manager at CIBC Asset Management.
	Jerusalim pointed to this week's news about AstraZeneca's potential COVID-19 vaccine, the start of the presidential transition in the U.S., and the potential for a familiar face in the U.S. Treasury Department if former Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen is confirmed.
	While markets may be hitting key ""psychological"" levels -- with the Dow Jones industrial average up 454.97 points at 30,046.24, and the December gold contract down US$33.20 at US$1,804.60 an ounce -- Jerusalim said he is still being cautious with his portfolio.
	""The best analogy, I would say, is that we see the light at the end of the tunnel, but remember we are still in the tunnel,"" he said, noting the recent growth of some speculative investments, such as Bitcoin.
	""There are still a lot of tough months ahead of us. On the virus front, lockdowns are expanding. Investors should be aware of that and not get too ahead of themselves.""
	The S&P/TSX composite index was up 179.72 points at 17,274.25, still shy of its February record high of 17,970.51.The S&P 500 index was up 57.82 points at 3,635.41, while the Nasdaq composite was up 156.15 points at 12,036.78.
	Jerusalim said that the energy sector is helping the TSX on the path to its own record. Energy stocks gained nearly four per cent on Tuesday, with shares of Suncor Energy up 4.88 per cent and Enbridge Inc. up 3.98 per cent.
	Suncor has announced a plan to become the operator of Syncrude's oilsands mine and upgrader works, while Enbridge Inc. received approvals for U.S. federal permits for its Line 3 project. The January crude contract was up US$1.85 at US$44.91 per barrel and the January natural gas contract was up 7.7 cents at US$2.90 per mmBTU.
	""So, two positive developments on the energy front that investors are cheering,"" said Jerusalim.
	Jerusalim also noted that demand in China and emerging markets has boosted copper, as the December copper contract was up more than four cents at nearly US$3.30 a pound.
	The Canadian dollar traded for 76.73 cents US on Tuesday, compared with 76.44 cents US on Monday.
	Jerusalim said he will be watching upcoming quarterly earnings reports from Canadian banks, as well companies such as Shopify and CargoJet as Black Friday kicks off the holiday shopping season.
	""I don't think we are going to revert back to the prior balance of bricks-and-mortar and e-commerce,"" said Jerusalim.
	""Then we have the positive backdrop of Black Friday, Cyber Monday, and the Christmas holiday shopping period. As lockdowns increase it could shape up to be the strongest e-commerce period ever.""

	Foreign Affairs Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne warned Monday that tough talk about China could hurt efforts to gain the release of two arbitrarily detained Canadians.
	Testifying before the House of Commons Canada-China relations committee, Champagne urged MPs to keep the fate of Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig in mind when they spout off about the perils and perfidy of China's Communist regime.
	""I know, Mr. Chair, that some like to talk tough on China,"" Champagne told the committee.
	""To those who are seduced by this one-dimensional view, I say this: while it is easy to be tough, let's continue to be smart. Let's not fall into the temptation of tough and irresponsible rhetoric that will generate no tangible result for Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, our farmers and entrepreneurs, and human rights victims and advocates.""
	The two Michaels, as they've come to be known, have been imprisoned in China for almost two years in retaliation for Canada's arrest of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou on an extradition request from the United States.
	Canadian farmers, fishers and exporters have also been hurt by retaliatory measures taken by China in the wake of Meng's arrest.
	Champagne's plea came a week after the House of Commons passed a Conservative motion calling on the government to decide by Dec. 18 whether to allow Huawei to be involved in development of Canada's next generation 5G wireless network.
	The motion, passed with the support of all opposition parties over the objections of the government, also called on the government to unveil within 30 days a robust plan to deal with growing intimidation by China of Canadians within Canada's borders.
	The motion is not binding and Champagne told the committee that government action on both fronts will be guided by national security requirements, not by arbitrary deadlines.
	Since taking over the helm of the Conservatives last August, Erin O'Toole has made standing up to China a central pillar of his pitch to Canadian voters.
	The Conservative leader has accused Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's Liberal government of being ""willing to look past the Chinese government's numerous human rights abuses, flagrant trade abuses and security issues because the potential to sell into the massive Chinese market was so lucrative.""
	""Trudeau's approach to China has failed, and it's weakened our standing in the world. We must stand up for our citizens who have been detained as bargaining chips in an extradition case, even if it leads to more reprisals from Beijing,"" O'Toole argued in an op-ed in the National Post in September.
	O'Toole has called for an ""eyes wide open"" approach to relations with China. But Champagne contended that's precisely the approach his government is taking.
	He argued that Canada's policy towards China has evolved as China itself has evolved, increasingly flouting the international rules-based order, violating the human rights of Uighurs in Xinjiang province and democracy protesters in Hong Kong, and engaging in ""coercive diplomacy"" to get its way.
	""The China of 2020 is not the China of 2015 or even the China of 2018,"" Champagne said.
	""We see a country and a leadership increasingly prepared to throw its weight around to advance its interests.""
	Champagne said the government has adopted a new framework for dealing with China. He described it as a three-pronged approach in which there will be areas, such as human rights abuses, where Canada needs to challenge China.
	In other areas, such as trade matters, he said Canada needs to compete with China, and still other areas where Canada needs to co-operate with China, such as the fight against climate change.
	China's more aggressive posture is not just a challenge for Canada, he argued. Countries around the world are grappling with it.
	Champagne said the best antidote is for all liberal democracies to band together to speak with one voice to pressure China to change its ways -- just as Canada has rallied other countries to speak out against the detention of Kovrig and Spavor.

	AstraZeneca and Oxford University said their prospective vaccine had proved on average 70 percent effective at stopping the virus after trying it on 23,000 people, days after tests of two other candidate vaccines suggested they had more than 90 percent effectiveness.
	""With the latest positive news from vaccine trials, the light at the end of this long dark tunnel is growing brighter. There is now real hope that vaccines in combination with other tried and tested public health measures, will help to end the pandemic,"" said Tedros.
	""The significance of this scientific achievement cannot be overstated. No vaccines in history have been developed as rapidly as these. The scientific community has set a new standard for vaccine development.""
	POOLED VACCINES PROJECT
	The novel coronavirus has killed nearly 1.39 million people and more than 58.6 million cases have been registered since the outbreak emerged in China last December, according to a tally from official sources compiled by AFP.
	Anticipating the huge demand for any approved vaccine, the WHO has helped create the so-called Covax facility to ensure equitable distribution. Tedros said 187 countries were now on board.
	The international vaccine procurement pool aims to lay its hands on two billion doses of safe and effective vaccines by the end of next year.
	However, it is struggling to raise the funds needed to provide for the 92 low-income countries and other economies that quickly signed up.
	Tedros said $4.3 billion was needed immediately to support the mass procurement and delivery of COVID-19 vaccines, tests and treatments, while a further $23.8 billion would be needed in 2021.
	""The real question is not whether the world can afford to share COVID-19 vaccines and other tools; it's whether it can afford not to,"" said Tedros.
	Leaders at the virtual G20 summit said Sunday they would ""spare no effort"" to ensure fair distribution of coronavirus vaccines, but the united front was punctured by Angela Merkel who voiced concern about slow progress.
	The German chancellor said she was concerned that no major vaccine agreements had yet been struck for poorer nations, even as rich countries have already bought up huge numbers of doses from pharmaceutical firms.
	The summit pledged to support poor countries whose economies have been ravaged by the crisis but offered little detail."

              Shanghai airport momentarily descends into chaos after workers test positive for COVID-19

              Shanghai's biggest international airport momentarily descended into chaos Sunday night, after authorities ordered a mass testing drive-in response to a small outbreak of COVID-19 linked to several cargo handlers.

	Shanghai's biggest international airport momentarily descended into chaos Sunday night, after authorities ordered a mass testing drive-in response to a small outbreak of COVID-19 linked to several cargo handlers.
	Since the beginning of November, seven cargo workers and their close contacts at the Shanghai Pudong International Airport have been diagnosed as confirmed coronavirus cases, including two reported on Sunday.
	In a bid to contain the cluster, authorities ordered all cargo staff at the airport to undergo coronavirus tests overnight and set up a temporary testing site on the second floor of a parking garage, according to a statement from the Shanghai government.
	Photos and videos circulating on Chinese social media show hundreds of people packed closely together inside the garage -- the opposite of social distancing -- with a line of people in hazmat suits trying to hold back crowds pushing forward.
	But the chaos appeared to have calmed before midnight, when the airport police posted photos on Weibo showing workers lining up orderly for the tests.
	As of Monday morning, 17,719 samples had been collected. Of the 11,544 samples that have been tested, all received negative results, officials said at a news conference.
	While the initial chaos has drawn criticism on Chinese social media, the swift, drastic response over just a few cases highlights the length the Chinese government is willing to go to in order to stamp out any resurgence of the virus.
	China's zero-tolerance approach is in stark contrast to the United States, which is struggling to cope with its largest wave of infections since the pandemic began. Contact tracing seems almost impossible, with daily new cases above 100,000 for three straight weeks.
	On Saturday, the US caseload surpassed 12 million -- an increase of more than 1 million cases in less than a week. On the same day, U.S. President Donald Trump skipped a special side-conference focused on the pandemic during his final Group of 20 summit.
	Trump was spotted at his golf course outside of Washington, DC, while world leaders including French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, and South Korean President Moon Jae-in discussed global responses to the virus and how to improve pandemic preparedness.
	In China, several cities have reported new coronavirus cases over the past week -- and all have been met with immediate action from authorities, from extensive testing and contact tracing to partial lockdowns.
	In the port city of Tianjin, some 600 miles (965 kilometers) from Shanghai, authorities are testing 2.6 million residents in one district after reporting five locally transmitted cases on Friday, the Tianjin Health Commission said in a statement.
	The mass testing, which started on Saturday, will cover all residents living in the Binhai New Area district, and is expected to be completed in three days.
	As of Sunday evening, Tianjin has received more than 2.25 million test samples, of which over 1 million have come back negative, the health commission said.
	The more targeted approach -- focusing on one district instead of the entire city of 15 million people -- differs from the city-wide testing drives adopted by large cities such as Wuhan and Qingdao during earlier local outbreaks.
	Smaller cities, however, appear intent on testing every resident. Manzhouli, a major land port on the Chinese border with Russia, announced plans to test the whole city in three days after two local infections were reported Saturday. According to the Global Times, a state-run tabloid, a total of 300,000 residents will be tested.
	Manzhouli's main train station has suspended operations, while its airport has halted all transfer flights to the regional capital of Hohhot. Schools are suspended, mass gatherings are banned, and non-essential businesses are closed, according to the city government.
	While these measures have become a standard response to new outbreaks in China, other governments have so far appeared reluctant to introduce similar measures.
	In Hong Kong, the local government tried to roll out city-wide testing for its 7 million residents during its third wave of infections in September. In the end, only 1.7 million people showed up for the two-week testing drive.
	As the city faces another surge in coronavirus cases, Health Secretary Sophia Chan said on Sunday the government will give a HK$5,000 ($645) handout to anyone in the city who tests positive to encourage people to undergo testing.
	As the winter approaches, countries in Asia have also faced a second wave of coronavirus. While most will be unlikely to adopt China's zero-tolerance approach, many have tightened restrictions to slow its spread.
	In Japan, daily coronavirus cases have surpassed 2,000 for five days in a row. Amid surging cases, the country's Prime Minster Yoshihide Suga announced last week that the government's travel and dining promotion program will be halted in coronavirus hotspots to curb further infections.
	On Monday, South Korea declared an ""emergency period"" in the capital city of Seoul until the end of the year, due to a spike in Covid-19 cases, according to the city's acting mayor Seo Jung-hyup.
	Under the announcement, public transportation will reduce capacity by 20% after 10 p.m. and gatherings of more than 10 people will be banned. The city will also conduct regular coronavirus tests on some 40,000 workers and users of nursing hospitals and daycare centers.
	The measures come after a series of new restrictions were announced for Seoul on Sunday, including mandatory mask wearing indoors and closures of entertainment facilities such as clubs. Restaurants are only allowed to do deliveries and takeout after 9 p.m., gatherings will be limited to 100 people, and schools must operate at one-third capacity."

	The Solomon Islands is reportedly planning to ban Facebook after the government received harsh criticism on the social media platform, sparking outrage among rights groups and opposition figures in the Pacific island nation.
	Communication Minister Peter Shanel Agovaka drafted plans for a temporary ban this week and discussions were underway with internet service providers on how to implement it, the Solomon Times reported.
	""Abusive languages against ministers, Prime Minister (Manasseh Sogavare), character assassination, defamation of character, all these are issues of concern,"" he told the publication.
	Sogavare's office did not respond to queries about the government's plans, which opposition leader Matthew Wale said would represent unjustified censorship.
	""Social media, especially Facebook has been a key platform for free exchange of views by citizens,"" Wale told AFP.
	""There are no grounds weighty enough to warrant a ban on Facebook or social media at this time -- an animated and engaged citizenry is critical to accountable government.""
	Facebook is widely used in the Solomons, where the population of 700,000 is spread among rugged volcanic islands and coral atolls, making other forms of communication difficult.
	Sogavare himself regularly uses the platform to distribute government messages, including updates on COVID-19 infection numbers.
	Facebook said it was ""reaching out"" to the Solomons government about the plan.
	""This move will impact thousands of people in the Solomon Islands who use our services to connect and engage in important discussions across the Pacific,"" it said in a statement.
	Amnesty International said interfering with a vital information source during a global pandemic could cost lives and urged the government to reconsider.
	""To ban a social media site simply because people are posting comments the authorities don't like is a blatant and brazen attack on human rights,"" Amnesty's Pacific researcher Kate Schuetze said.
	She said that if the plan went ahead, the Solomons would join China, North Korea and Iran as the only countries to have totally banned Facebook.
	Another Pacific island nation, Nauru, curbed access to Facebook from 2015 to 2018 after coming under pressure for hosting an Australian-bankrolled asylum seeker detention camp.
	The Samoa government flagged a similar ban in July this year but has not yet taken any action.
	Honiara-based lawmaker Peter Kenilorea Jr., who heads parliament's influential foreign relations committee, accused the Solomons' government of ""strangling"" free expression.
	""This decision has deep and far-reaching consequences for us as a nation -- it cuts to the heart of the democratic principles and values upon which our nation rests,"" he told AFP.
	Our Telekom, one of the nation's largest internet providers, said it had received no communications from the telecoms regulator and could not comment further."

China launches mission to bring back material from moon
          
","
China launched an ambitious mission on Tuesday to bring back rocks and debris from the moon's surface for the first time in more than 40 years -- an undertaking that could boost human understanding of the moon and of the solar system more generally.
        ","
                  Monday, Nov. 23, 2020
                ",https://www.ctvnews.ca/sci-tech/china-launches-mission-to-bring-back-material-from-moon-1.5200368,"WENCHANG, CHINA -- 
	China launched an ambitious mission on Tuesday to bring back rocks and debris from the moon's surface for the first time in more than 40 years -- an undertaking that could boost human understanding of the moon and of the solar system more generally.
	Chang'e 5 -- named for the Chinese moon goddess -- is the country's boldest lunar mission yet. If successful, it would be a major advance for China's space program, and some experts say it could pave the way for bringing samples back from Mars or even a crewed lunar mission.
	The four modules of the Chang'e 5 spacecraft blasted off at just after 4:30 a.m. Tuesday (2030 GMT Monday, 3:30 p.m. EST Monday) atop a massive Long March-5Y rocket from the Wenchang launch centre along the coast of the southern island province of Hainan.
	Minutes after liftoff, the spacecraft separated from the rocket's first and second stages and slipped into Earth-moon transfer orbit. About an hour later, Chang'e 5 opened its solar panels to provide its independent power source.
	Spacecraft typically take three days to reach the moon.
	The launch was carried live by national broadcaster CCTV which then switched to computer animation to show its progress into outer space.
	The mission's key task is to drill 2 metres (almost 7 feet) beneath the moon's surface and scoop up about 2 kilograms (4.4 pounds) of rocks and other debris to be brought back to Earth, according to NASA. That would offer the first opportunity for scientists to study newly obtained lunar material since the American and Russian missions of the 1960s and 1970s.
	The Chang'e 5 lander's time on the moon is scheduled to be short and sweet. It can only stay one lunar daytime, or about 14 Earth days, because it lacks the radioisotope heating units to withstand the moon's freezing nights.
	The lander will dig for materials with its drill and robotic arm and transfer them to what's called an ascender, which will lift off from the moon and dock with the service capsule. The materials will then be moved to the return capsule to be hauled back to Earth.
	The technical complexity of Chang'e 5, with its four components, makes it ""remarkable in many ways,"" said Joan Johnson-Freese, a space expert at the U.S. Naval War College.
	""China is showing itself capable of developing and successfully carrying out sustained high-tech programs, important for regional influence and potentially global partnerships,"" she said.
	In particular, the ability to collect samples from space is growing in value, said Jonathan McDowell, an astronomer at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. Other countries planning to retrieve material from asteroids or even Mars may look to China's experience, he said.
	While the mission is ""indeed challenging,"" McDowell said China has already landed twice on the moon with its Chang'e 3 and Chang'e 4 missions, and showed with a 2014 Chang'e 5 test mission that it can navigate back to Earth, re-enter and land a capsule. All that's left is to show it can collect samples and take off again from the moon.
	""As a result of this, I'm pretty optimistic that China can pull this off,"" he said.
	The mission is among China's boldest since it first put a man in space in 2003, becoming only the third nation to do so after the U.S. and Russia.
	Chang'e 5 and future lunar missions aim to ""provide better technical support for future scientific and exploration activities,"" Pei Zhaoyu, mission spokesperson and deputy director of the Chinese National Space Administration's Lunar Exploration and Space Engineering Center told reporters at a Monday briefing.
	""Scientific needs and technical and economic conditions"" would determine whether China decides to send a crewed mission to the moon, said Pei, whose comments were embargoed until after the launch. ""I think future exploration activities on the moon are most likely to be carried out in a human-machine combination.""
	While many of China's crewed spaceflight achievements, including building an experimental space station and conducting a spacewalk, reproduce those of other countries from years past, the CNSA is now moving into new territory.
	Chang'e 4 -- which made the first soft landing on the moon's relatively unexplored far side almost two years ago -- is currently collecting full measurements of radiation exposure from the lunar surface, information vital for any country that plans to send astronauts to the moon.
	China in July became one of three countries to have launched a mission to Mars, in China's case an orbiter and a rover that will search for signs of water on the red planet. The CNSA says the spacecraft Tianwen 1 is on course to arrive at Mars around February.
	China has increasingly engaged with foreign countries on missions, and the European Space Agency will be providing important ground station information for Chang'e 5.
	U.S. law, however, still prevents most collaborations with NASA, excluding China from partnering with the International Space Station. That has prompted China to start work on its own space station and launch its own programs that have put it in a steady competition with Japan and India, among Asian nations seeking to notch new achievements in space.
	China's space program has progressed cautiously, with relatively few setbacks in recent years. The rocket being used for the current launch failed on a previous launch attempt, but has since performed without a glitch, including launching Chang'e 4.
	""China works very incrementally, developing building blocks for long-term use for a variety of missions,"" Freese-Johnson said. China's one-party authoritarian system also allows for ""prolonged political will that is often difficult in democracies,"" she said.
	While the U.S. has followed China's successes closely, it's unlikely to expand co-operation with China in space amid political suspicions, a sharpening military rivalry and accusations of Chinese theft of technology, experts say.
	""A change in U.S. policy regarding space co-operation is unlikely to get much government attention in the near future,"" Johnson-Freese said."

China tests millions after coronavirus flare-ups in 3 cities

              Chinese authorities are testing millions of people, imposing lockdowns and shutting down schools after multiple locally transmitted coronavirus cases were discovered in three cities across the country last week.

	Chinese authorities are testing millions of people, imposing lockdowns and shutting down schools after multiple locally transmitted coronavirus cases were discovered in three cities across the country last week.
	As temperatures drop, widescale measures are being enacted in Tianjin, Shanghai and Manzhouli, even though the number of new cases remains low compared to the United States and other countries that are seeing new waves of infections.
	Experts and government officials have warned that the chance of the virus spreading will be greater in cold weather. Recent flareups have shown that there is still a risk of the virus returning, despite being largely controlled within China.
	On Monday, the National Health Commission reported two new locally transmitted cases in Shanghai over the previous 24 hours, bringing the total to seven since Friday. China has recorded 86,442 cases overall and 4,634 deaths since the virus was first detected in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year.
	The two latest cases confirmed in Shanghai were close contacts of another airport worker who was diagnosed with COVID-19 earlier in November. On Sunday night, the city's Pudong International airport decided to test its workers, collecting 17,719 samples through the early hours of Monday morning. Plans call for testing others in surrounding communities if further cases are detected.
	Videos on social media purportedly from workers showed what appeared to be chaotic scenes at the airport as they were given last-minute orders to get tested. In the videos, people are seen standing in large groups pushing back and forth against officials in hazmat suits.
	Shanghai has been more selective with mass testing, targeting people associated with a particular place, such as the airport or the hospital where someone who has tested positive had worked, rather than an entire district.
	In Tianjin, health workers have collected more than 2.2 million samples for testing from residents in the Binhai new district, after five locally transmitted cases were discovered there last week.
	In Manzhouli, a city of more than 200,000 people, local health authorities are testing all residents after two cases were reported on Saturday. They also shut down all schools and public venues and banned public gatherings such as banquets.
	China has resorted to its heavy, top-down approach each time new cases of local transmission are found -- shutting down schools and hospitals, locking down residential communities and entire neighbourhoods, and testing millions.
	Tianjin authorities shut down a kindergarten and moved all the teachers, family and students to a centralized quarantine space. They also sealed the residential compound where the five cases were found.
	China's approach to controlling the pandemic has been criticized for being draconian. It locked down the city of Wuhan, where cases were first reported, for more than two months to contain the virus, with the local government shutting down all traffic and confining residents to their homes. Domestically, however, China has called its strategy ""clear to zero"" and has boasted of its success.
	""In the entire world, only China has the ability to get to zero. Other countries don't have this ability,"" Zeng Guang, the chief epidemiologist at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said in a webinar hosted by Chinese media in September. ""It's not just getting to zero, even for them to control the first wave of the epidemic is hard.""
	""`Clearing to zero' is actually the most economically effective way to do epidemic prevention. If you don't do that, then this problem will get more troublesome,"" he said. ""Use a heavier hand, and get to zero, then people will feel reassured.""

	U.S. President Donald Trump railed against the Paris climate accord on Sunday, telling world leaders at a virtual summit that the agreement was designed to cripple the U.S. economy, not save the planet.
	""To protect American workers, I withdrew the United States from the unfair and one-sided Paris climate accord, a very unfair act for the United States,"" Trump said in a video statement from the White House to the Group of 20 summit hosted by Saudi Arabia. His comments came during a discussion among the world's largest economies on safeguarding the Earth.
	President-elect Joe Biden, who takes office in January, has said he will rejoin the global pact that the U.S. helped forge five years ago.
	Trump contended the international accord was ""not designed to save the environment. It was designed to kill the American economy.""
	Trump, who has worked to undo most of President Barack Obama's efforts to fight climate change, said that since withdrawing from the climate agreement, the U.S. has reduced carbon emissions more than any nation.
	That is true, but not that remarkable. With its giant economy, the U.S. has far more raw emissions of climate-damaging carbon dioxide to cut than any other country except China.
	A more telling measure of progress in various countries is to look at what percentage of emissions a county has cut. Since 2005, the United States hasn't been even in the top 10 in percentage of greenhouse gas emission reductions.
	More than 180 nations have ratified the accord, which aims to keep the increase in average temperatures worldwide ""well below"" 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) and ideally no more than 1.5C (2.7 F), compared with pre-industrial levels. Scientists say that any rise beyond 2 degrees Celsius could have a devastating impact on large parts of the world, raising sea levels, stoking tropical storms and worsening droughts and floods.
	The U.S. formally exited the Paris pact on Nov. 4. On Saturday, the U.S. formally left the Open Skies Treaty, which permits 30-plus nations to conduct unarmed, observation flights over each other's territory. Those overflights were set up decades ago to promote trust and avert conflict.
	The administration said it wanted out of the treaty because Russia was violating the pact, and imagery collected during the flights can be obtained quickly at less cost from U.S. or commercial satellites.
	During the discussions at the climate session, President Xi Jinping of China, the world's largest emitter, said the G-20 should continue to take the lead in tackling climate change and push for the full implementation of the Paris accord.
	""Not long ago, I announced China's initiative to scale up its nationally determined contributions and strive to peak carbon dioxide emissions by 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2060,"" he said. ""China will honour its commitment and see the implementation through.""
	India's prime minister, Narendra Modi, said ""climate change must be fought not in silos, but in an integrated, comprehensive and holistic way."""

              The United States hopes to begin a sweeping program of COVID-19 vaccinations in early December, according to the head of the government coronavirus vaccine effort.

	The United States hopes to begin a sweeping program of COVID-19 vaccinations in early December, the head of the government coronavirus vaccine effort said Sunday as cases surge across the worst-hit nation.
	The beginning of vaccinations could be a crucial turning point in the battle against the virus that has claimed more than 255,000 lives in the U.S., the world's highest reported toll, since emerging from China late last year.
	""Our plan is to be able to ship vaccines to the immunization sites within 24 hours of approval"" by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Moncef Slaoui told CNN, pointing to possible dates of Dec. 11-12.
	FDA vaccine advisors reportedly will meet Dec. 10 to discuss approving vaccines which pharmaceutical firms Pfizer and Moderna say are at least 95 per cent effective.
	Worldwide, nearly 1.4 million people have died this year and at least 58 million cases have been registered.
	Slaoui estimated that 20 million people across the U.S. could be vaccinated in December, with 30 million per month after that.
	He said that by May, with potentially 70 per cent of the population having been vaccinated, the country could attain ""herd immunity,"" meaning the virus can no longer spread widely -- and that people can move closer to resuming their pre-coronavirus way of life.
	But Slaoui added a note of caution, saying, ""I really hope and look forward to seeing that the level of negative perception of the vaccine decreases and people's acceptance increase.
	""That is going to be critical to help us.""
	A recent Gallup poll showed that four in 10 Americans still say they would not get a COVID-19 vaccine, though that is down slightly from five in 10 surveyed in September.
	Slaoui said he thought it would help in persuading vaccine skeptics to learn that trials have shown the new vaccines to be 95 per cent effective -- well above the 50 per cent level that an earlier target for vaccine approval.
	Officials have yet to announce which groups in the population would receive the vaccine first, though health care workers are certain to receive priority, followed by vulnerable groups like the elderly.
	Slaoui said that while the trials had ensured only short-term safety, decades of experience showed that nearly all adverse effects of vaccines occurred within 40 days of being administered, while the current trials protectively covered 60 days.
	With the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, Slaoui added, there were no serious adverse effects in that period.
	For now, the vaccines have not been tested on young children, but the doctor said trials are underway, with a chance toddlers could be vaccinated starting in the second quarter of 2021, with infants coming afterward.
	Countries worldwide, as well as international organizations, were working out plans for global distribution of these vaccines and potentially others still being developed.
	The G20 countries, in a virtual meeting hosted by Saudi Arabia, plan to pledge to ""spare no effort"" in ensuring fair distribution of coronavirus vaccines worldwide, according to a draft communique seen by AFP on Sunday.
	The communique offered no details, however, on how the effort would be funded."

	U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Sunday defended his tour of Gulf Arab states and the Trump administration's continued efforts to squeeze Iran, even as a new U.S. administration led by Joe Biden prepares to enter the White House in January.
	Although Pompeo has not taken questions from U.S.-based reporters travelling with him over the past 10 days, he sat down with the Saudi-owned broadcaster Al-Arabiya in Dubai for brief televised remarks Sunday.
	""Our policies don't change. Our duty doesn't change. My responsibilities don't change,"" he said. ""I still have an obligation -- every hour, every minute -- to defend the American people and to keep them foremost in our efforts, and we'll do that. We'll do that to the very last minute.""
	In what was likely his final tour of the Persian Gulf as secretary of state, he touted the Trump administration's Mideast strategy that focused on Iran as ""the central threat inside the region"" and for a maximum pressure campaign that hampered Iran's ability to support militias in Iraq, Lebanon and Syria.
	""It'll be our policy until our time is complete,"" he said, stopping short of saying when he'd cease work as the top U.S. diplomat.
	President Donald Trump has refused to concede to Biden, despite the Trump campaign's futile efforts to block the certification of votes in various states.
	The Trump administration is attempting to ramp up pressure on Iran before Biden takes office as president. Biden has said he wants to return to rapprochement with Iran. Analysts say Biden is expected to be more willing to engage the Iranians in order to avoid major escalation, although he's likely to press Tehran on its missile program and not just its nuclear program.
	Trump is viewed favourably by Gulf heavyweights Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates for pulling the U.S out of a nuclear accord with Iran and reimposing sweeping sanctions that have drained Iran of vital oil revenue.
	Pompeo is scheduled to travel to Saudi Arabia late Sunday to meet Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman before heading back to Washington. His tour also included stops in France, Turkey and Israel, including an Israeli settlement in the occupied West Bank and a museum that honours Christian Zionists.
	Trump was recently talked back from moving ahead with a military strike on Iran's main nuclear site by advisors who included Pompeo, according to a New York Times report. When asked about this, a State Department official travelling with Pompeo told reporters that ""all options are on the table"" and that the Trump administration ""will continue to pursue its policies until it's not in office anymore.""
	Pompeo started his Gulf tour in the UAE capital of Abu Dhabi early Saturday, meeting the emirate's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed, who's seen as the day-to-day ruler and the powerful figure behind the country's major policy decisions.
	The State Department said they discussed the progress of the UAE's decision to normalize ties with Israel -- a move that was followed by Bahrain and Sudan. They also discussed ""security co-operation and countering Iran's malign influence in the region, as well as that of China,"" the U.S. statement said.
	Pompeo ""also underscored the importance of Gulf unity.""
	The UAE, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Egypt have largely balked at U.S. efforts to reconcile with Qatar, which they accuse of sponsoring terrorism and backing violent Islamist groups across the region. The quartet cut ties with Qatar in mid-2017 and have demanded the gas-rich Arab state shutter its flagship Al Jazeera news network among other demands, which Qatar has rejected outright, along with the accusations.
	Pompeo departed Abu Dhabi for Qatar on Saturday, although there are no direct commercial flights due to the stalemate.
	He had lunch with the ruler, Emir Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, and met with Qatar's foreign minister. The State Department said Pompeo discussed regional issues, and ""the importance of a united Gulf to stand against the Iranian regime's destabilizing activity, and the risk to the region presented by China.""
	Qatar, however, has warm ties with Iran. The two countries also share a massive underwater gas field in the Persian Gulf.
	While in Qatar, Pompeo additionally met with representatives of the Afghan government and Taliban, where the warring sides are holding talks about the future of the country. Despite a sharp rise in violence this year, Washington plans to withdraw an estimated 2,500 troops before the middle of January, leaving about 2,000 soldiers in Afghanistan."

              Canada, Britain ink new trade deal, beating Brexit

              Canada and Britain struck a new trade deal on Saturday, allowing the long-standing partners to trumpet a commercial triumph in the face of the economic devastation wrought by the COVID-19 pandemic.
        ","
                  Saturday, Nov. 21, 2020
                ",https://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/canada-britain-ink-new-trade-deal-beating-brexit-1.5199139,"OTTAWA -- 
	Canada and Britain struck a new trade deal on Saturday, allowing the long-standing partners to trumpet a commercial triumph in the face of the economic devastation wrought by the COVID-19 pandemic.
	The interim deal beat the looming Dec. 31 Brexit deadline, replacing Canada's current agreement with Britain under the European Union that covers trade between the two countries. Saturday's interim pact, announced amid a virtual gathering of G-20 leaders, is a placeholder that buys Canada and Britain another year to reach a more comprehensive agreement while also warding off a no-deal scenario that would have triggered new tariffs on a range of Canadian exports on Jan. 1
	But few details were released about the new interim agreement. Breaking with past practice during trade negotiations, there were no pre-announcement briefings for journalists and no text was released.
	""This is a good moment,"" said Prime Minister Justin Trudeau as he announced the deal during a video news conference with his British counterpart, Boris Johnson.
	""Free trade is an important part of the way we're going to bounce back from COVID,"" Johnson said. ""And using that, this is a moment in which to tackle climate change, but also to create hundreds of thousands of jobs in green technologies.""
	The two leaders spoke on a shared video screen as they prepared to join their fellow G20 leaders at the start of their two-day virtual video summit hosted by Saudi Arabia.
	The G20, which includes the non-democratic countries of China and Russia as well as the large economies of India and Brazil, is facing its greatest challenge since it rose to prominence in 2008 to battle the Great Recession -- rebooting a global economy decimated by COVID-19.
	Trudeau said the new pact sent a strong message about the importance of global trade.
	""This continued sign of our collaboration, co-operation, and deep, deep friendship and partnership is really important not just for people in our two countries, but people around the world as well,"" he said.
	Britain's decision to leave the EU after its Brexit referendum means that the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, or CETA, will no longer apply to the country at the end of the year.
	The new deal preserves CETA's key provision -- the elimination of tariffs on 98 per cent of Canadian exports to Britain -- until a more comprehensive agreement can be reached later. Britain is Canada's fifth-largest trading partner, with $29 billion in two-way merchandise trade in 2019.
	International Trade Minister Mary Ng said legislation would be introduced in Parliament soon so the interim deal could be ratified. Ng noted that Canada did not give Britain any additional market access to British cheese, preserving the status quo of the country's supply management system.
	Canada's dairy industry has complained loudly in the past about the additional foreign access to the Canadian market under previous trade deals, including CETA and the new Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement.
	Ng and her British counterpart, Liz Truss, committed to negotiating a new and more comprehensive agreement in the coming year. Ng said the new deal would explore co-operation around women's economic empowerment, the environment and digital trade.
	Conservative trade critic Tracy Gray accused the government of presenting an ""11th-hour trade deal"" that was temporary and would require more negotiation.
	""We will do our due diligence as expected by Canadians to study the enacting legislation for this transitional agreement to ensure it is a good deal for Canada and does not leave Canadian exporters worse off compared to CETA,"" Gray said.
	Canada's business community offered a mixed reaction, welcoming the economic certainty the interim deal offered while asking for more specifics.
	Mark Agnew, the international policy director for the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, called on both governments to publish the full details of their agreement.
	But he said MPs must work towards ""prompt passage of the necessary legislation to "" provide certainty for Canadian businesses.
	Dan Darling, president of the Canadian Agri-Food Trade Alliance, described the deal as ""a welcome stop gap."" But he also called on the government to fix the market-access obstacles that Canadian producers have faced under the current EU deal.
	""For other agri-food exporters, a transitional arrangement simply reinforces a situation that remains unacceptable under CETA,"" he said.
	""That is why we are urging both parties to return to the negotiating table as soon as possible in order to reach a comprehensive and more ambitious pact that removes tariffs and non-tariff barriers.""
	Goldy Hyder, president of the Business Council of Canada, said the transitional deal will prevent a disruption of Canada-British trade, but noted he wanted to see its specific terms.
	""In the future, we believe there is an opportunity to enhance our bilateral trade and investment ties even further with a comprehensive and ambitious free trade deal,"" Hyder said.
	Canada and Britain have operated under an 11-month transition phase since the European country left the EU at the end of January. For Canada, the transition has meant CETA continued to apply to its trade relations with Britain.
	Canadian and British negotiators have been meeting since the summer to strike a new deal.

              APEC leaders, including Trump, agree on free trade

	Leaders from the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, including U.S. President Donald Trump, pledged Friday to work toward free, open and non-discriminatory trade and investment to revive their coronavirus-battered economies.
	The leaders cast aside differences to issue their first joint statement since 2017, in which they agreed to further deepen regional integration by working toward a massive free trade agreement involving the 21 APEC economies.
	This year's host, Malaysian Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin, told a news conference that the U.S.-China trade war that had hampered talks in the past has ""been eclipsed"" by the COVID-19 pandemic.
	With growth in the Asia-Pacific region expected to slump 2.7% this year, from a 3.6% growth in 2019, he said APEC's focus was on accelerating economic recovery and developing an affordable vaccine.
	""The health risks and its impact on the global economic ecosystem has been the major priority agenda for all APEC economies this year,"" he said.
	APEC, whose members account for 60% of global GDP, has also ""pledged to refrain from backtracking and resorting to protectionist measures to keep markets and borders open,"" he added.
	The APEC leaders' meeting was the first since 2018 after last year's host, Chile, cancelled the annual summit due to violent domestic protests. But at the Papua New Guinea summit in 2018, APEC leaders failed to issue a joint statement for the first time amid a U.S.-China row over trade policies.
	Trump's participation Friday, his first since 2017, came as a surprise as he challenges the outcome of the U.S. presidential election, won by Joe Biden. Last weekend, Trump skipped the East Asia Summits and withdrew from speaking at an APEC CEO meeting earlier Friday.
	Trump, whose ""America First"" policy has alienated trading partners, addressed the meeting but his speech wasn't immediately available.
	Chinese President Xi Jinping, in his remarks, urged countries to ""defend multilateralism"" and called for the establishment of an ""Asia-Pacific free trade zone at an early date.""
	He told the meeting that Beijing would also ""actively consider"" joining the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade agreement that includes Japan, Canada, Mexico and other regional economies but not the United States. Trump pulled out of the CPTPP's predecessor, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which never took effect.
	Xi's comments came just after Beijing and 14 Asian nations inked the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, the world's largest free trade agreement.
	If China were to join the CPTPP, that would make Xi's government a member of the Asia-Pacific region's two biggest trade arrangements, while Washington is part of neither.
	APEC leaders adopted the Putrajaya Vision 2040, a new 20-year growth vision to replace the Bogor Goals named after the Indonesian town where leaders agreed in 1994 to free and open trade and investment.
	They pledged to build an ""open, dynamic, resilient and peaceful region"" by 2040, and tasked officers to draw up implementation plans by next year.
	""We recognize the importance of a free, open, fair, non-discriminatory, transparent and predictable trade and investment environment to drive economic recovery at such a challenging time,"" according to the joint statement.
	""We resolve to further navigate the region towards recovery along the path of strong, balanced, inclusive, sustainable, innovative and secure economic growth,"" the statement added.
	Earlier Friday, the leaders of Japan and New Zealand warned countries against the temptation of retreating into trade protectionism.
	Speaking by video link from Tokyo to the meeting of APEC CEOs, Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga said ""making rules for a free and fair global economy is critically important.""
	While continuing to promote WTO reform, he said Japan will ""aspire for the Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific.""
	New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, who will be next year's APEC host, voiced hope that APEC leaders will join hands to bolster the regional economy.
	""As we confront this generation's biggest economic challenge, we must not repeat the mistakes of history by retreating into protectionism. APEC must continue to commit to keeping markets open and trade flowing,"" she said.
	APEC brings together Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Peru, Philippines, Russia Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand and the United States.
	New Zealand will also host next year's APEC meetings virtually due to the pandemic.

	Canada's ambassador to China has visited two Canadians detained for almost two years amid a dispute over the arrest of an executive of Chinese technology giant Huawei.
	The Canadian government said that Ambassador Dominic Barton met with former diplomat Michael Kovrig on Thursday and with businessman Michael Spavor on Nov. 10.
	The two have been confined since December 2018, just days after Canada detained Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou, who is also the daughter of the company's founder. It was their third consular visit this year.
	No information has been released about where the Canadians are being detained or under what conditions.
	Canada accuses China of arbitrarily arresting the two in order to pressure it into releasing Meng, who lives under a form of house arrest in Vancouver while she challenges a U.S. extradition order to face fraud charges related to trade sanctions on Iran.
	China says Canada has no right to hold Meng and that Kovrig and Spavor are suspected of national security crimes. Yet, Beijing has long drawn a link between their cases, demanding that Canada release Meng while offering no details about specific accusations against the two Canadians.
	China has also sentenced two other Canadians to death and suspended canola imports in an apparent effort to pressure Ottawa. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau recently referred to China's actions as ""coercive diplomacy"" and spoke with U.S. President-elect Joe Biden about working together to resolve the issue.
	On Friday, foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian renewed China's accusation that Meng's detention was a politically motivated plot engineered by Washington.
	""No matter how the Canadian government conceals the truth and misleads the public, it will never change the political nature of the Meng Wanzhou incident, nor will it change the disgraceful role that Canada has played in this incident as an accomplice and pawn of the U.S.,"" Zhao told reporters at a daily briefing.
	American officials say Huawei might facilitate Chinese spying, which the company denies and the administration has been lobbying European and other allies to exclude it and other Chinese suppliers as they upgrade their telecommunications networks."

              Trudeau to tout climate and trade as China, U.S. set to dominate Asia-Pacific summit

              Prime Minister Justin Trudeau will pitch the economic benefits of fighting climate change and doing business with Canada as he meets with counterparts from both sides of the Pacific during today's Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation leaders' summit.

	Prime Minister Justin Trudeau will pitch the economic benefits of fighting climate change and doing business with Canada as he meets with counterparts from both sides of the Pacific during today's Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation leaders' summit.
	Yet the degree to which the prime minister's sales pitch will even be heard by APEC leaders remains unclear as Canada's tensions with China and the much bigger dispute between Beijing and Washington threaten to overshadow the meeting.
	Trudeau hinted at his planned approach to the summit during a speech on Thursday that was followed by a question-and-answer session in which Ottawa's tense ties with Beijing and relationship with the White House figured prominently.
	The summit, which is being hosted by Malaysia but held online because of COVID-19, is supposed to focus on the pandemic, particularly its economic impacts and what actions the members can take to mitigate those now and recover afterward.
	Chinese President Xi Jinping and U.S. President Donald Trump will be among the participants, with the latter likely marking one of his last such international gatherings following this month's presidential election.
	This year's meeting also comes days after China joined nearly a dozen other Asian countries along with Australia and New Zealand in inking what is being billed as the world's largest free-trade agreement, which excludes Canada and U.S.
	Trudeau stopped short Thursday of saying Canada was interested in joining the new Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, but instead suggested Ottawa would be watching to see how Beijing behaves in the trade deal.
	China ""is an important player in the global economy that we need to try and include and get to play by better international rules,"" the prime minister said during the question-and-answer session during the APEC CEO Dialogue on Thursday.
	""So if the RCEP deal is able to actually start to create level playing fields, that's going to be something very, very interesting. So we're going to watch carefully.""
	Trudeau during the same session defended the detention of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou, who is facing extradition to the U.S. to face fraud charges, and whose case has become a weeping sore in the relationship between Canada and China.
	The prime minister also indicated that he planned to not only push back against growing protectionism around the world, particularly during the pandemic, but also call for more of the benefits of free trade and globalization reach everyday people.
	Much of the attention, however, will be on Trump and Xi. The former has refused to concede this month's U.S. presidential election to challenger Joe Biden, and has made a point in the past of calling out China on trade and security.
	The Trump administration during the last APEC summit in 2018 refused to sign off on a final statement over those same issues.
	The APEC meeting today will be followed this weekend by the G20 leaders' summit, which is being hosted by Saudi Arabia and will also focus on responding to the economic damage wrought by the COVID-19 pandemic.
	While the first G20 leaders' summit held in 2008 was aimed to ensure a unified international response to the financial crisis that year, experts say the ensuring 12 years have seen growing polarization around the world along with more populism and instability.
	""We're in a geopolitically polarized environment that's not getting any better,"" said Fen Hampson, chancellor's professor at Carleton University's Norman Paterson School of International Affairs.
	""And unless there is a will on the part of the great powers to co-operate even at a minimum, you're just not going to see a whole lot of action. So yes, you may get a communique. But it's likely to be quite anodyne.""

	Japan's foreign minister announced Friday that his Chinese counterpart will visit Tokyo next week as the two Asian powers discuss ways to resume bilateral visits to revive their pandemic-hit economies.
	""There are various issues of concern between Japan and China, and it is important that we resolve them one by one through high-level meetings like this,"" Japanese Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi said. ""I hope to frankly exchange our views on regional issues, the global expansion of the coronavirus pandemic, as well as other international issues.""
	During the Nov. 24-25 visit, Motegi and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi are expected to discuss resuming business trips between the world's No. 2 and No. 3 economies through the ""business track"" program that allows visitors to engage in limited business activity during their 14-day quarantine period.
	Motegi noted that Chinese visitors topped the number of tourists in Japan before the pandemic and that he hoped to discuss how they can resume travel while taking disease prevention measures.
	The visit will come amid growing concerns stemming from China's increasing influence in the region.
	Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison held talks this week with Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga in which they agreed to step up their military partnership and co-operation to promote peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific region as a counter to China's rise.
	Motegi said a meeting is being arranged for Wang to meet with Suga during his visit, the first by a top Chinese official since the February visit by China's foreign policy chief Yang Jiechi.
	Motegi said a rescheduling of Chinese President Xi Jinping's state visit to Japan, postponed from the spring due to the pandemic, is not being considered as the two countries focus on their fight against the pandemic."

              December vaccine rollout possible for U.S. and Europe, BioNTech CEO says

	BioNTech co-founder Ugur Sahin said on Thursday the frontrunner COVID-19 vaccine his German firm is developing with Pfizer could be rolled out before the year is over in the United States or Europe.
	""We are working at full speed,"" he told AFP in a Zoom interview, confirming that the companies planned to apply for emergency use authorisation of their jab in the U.S. on Friday, while European regulators will receive another batch of data ""next week"".
	""There is a chance that we can receive approval from the U.S. or Europe or both regions this year still,"" said Sahin, 55, who is also BioNTech's chief executive.
	""We may even start delivering the vaccine in December,"" he added, ""if everyone works together very closely"".
	The BioNTech/Pfizer shot and another one being developed by U.S. firm Moderna have taken the lead in the global chase for a vaccine, after large-scale trial data this month showed that their jabs were around 95 per cent effective against COVID-19.
	The twin breakthroughs have lifted hopes for an end to a pandemic that has infected more than 56 million people and caused more than 1.3 million deaths worldwide since the virus first emerged in China late last year.
	The U.S., the European Union and a slew of other nations have already placed orders for hundreds of millions of doses of the top vaccine candidates in development.
	Health workers, carers and people considered at high risk for severe COVID-19 are set to be first in line for the jabs.
'A NORMAL WINTER'
	Speaking from the western German city of Mainz, Sahin said if all the players involved -- governments, pharma companies and vaccine logistics firms -- ""do a really good job"", then ""we can succeed in vaccinating 60 to 70 per cent of the population by the autumn of 2021.""
	""And when we've accomplished that then we could have a normal winter. Without another shutdown.""
	Beyond the U.S. and EU, more than 30 countries are at different stages of negotiations to secure the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine, Sahin said.
	With concerns growing that poor nations could be left behind in the scramble, Sahin said BioNTech was talking to organisations like the World Health Organization and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation on distributing the vaccine ""worldwide"", and finding ways to reduce its cost.
	The price of the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine is expected to be around $20 (17 euros) per dose, with a booster shot to be taken 28 days after the first.
EXPERIMENTAL TECH
	Sahin and his wife Ozlem Tureci, both children of Turkish immigrants to Germany, founded BioNTech in Mainz in 2008.
	They set out to fight cancer using an experimental technology known as ""mRNA"", before the pandemic shifted their focus.
	No mRNA vaccine has ever been approved but both the BioNTech/Pfizer and the Moderna efforts are based on it.
	The technology uses synthetic versions of molecules called ""messenger RNA"" to hack into human cells, and effectively turn them into vaccine-making factories.
	Other contenders in late-stage testing like AstraZeneca/Oxford University and Johnson & Johnson are using the traditional approach of injecting people with modified viruses to trigger an immune response.
	Sahin said he was ""very confident"" his vaccine was safe, a day after Pfizer and BioNTech announced that a completed study of their trial -- involving some 43,000 volunteers, more than 21,000 of whom received the jab -- showed no serious side effects.
	German Chancellor Angela Merkel, a former scientist who has been praised for her handling of the coronavirus crisis so far, on Thursday said ""we don't want to take any risks"" on a vaccine, and that the latest news was encouraging.
	Sahin predicts many more mRNA-based vaccines and drugs to come, potentially transforming cancer treatments.
'SECOND GENERATION'
	Sahin said he and his wife planned ""of course"" to get their jabs as soon as possible.
	In a nod to vaccine sceptics, he said the only option was to keep providing ""answers, information and transparency"".
	He predicts that many people will want to be innoculated once a vaccine becomes available, numbers that would only grow when those people shared their positive experiences.
	One big question that remains unanswered is how long the vaccine's protection lasts.
	Sahin estimates it could be ""at least a year, if not longer"" but he stressed that more data was needed to reach a final conclusion.
	A key challenge with BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine lies in the distribution, since it needs to be stored at minus 70 degrees Celsius (- 94 degrees Fahrenheit).
	Sahin said Pfizer and BioNTech would use special cool boxes to store and transport the vaccine in the first few months.
	But they are already developing a ""second generation"" of the vaccine that could stand warmer temperatures, he said.Â "

              PM Trudeau: No regrets about arrest of Huawei executive, says world must stand up to China

	Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Thursday defended the arrest of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou and urged countries to stand up to Chinese bullying as he prepared for two potentially explosive international summits.
	Canada's relations with both China and the U.S. figured prominently during a question-and-answer session with Trudeau ahead of Friday's Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation meeting.
	Both the prime minister and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, are set to attend. But beforehand, Trudeau spoke to a virtual gathering of chief executives from APEC countries.
	After he touted his government's legislation on cutting greenhouse-gas emissions and called for more trade between Canada and Asia, Trudeau was asked whether he regretted that Canadian border authorities in Vancouver detained Meng in December 2018.
	The Huawei executive was arrested, and is now facing extradition, because she is wanted in the U.S. on fraud charges. Her detention set off a steadily deepening diplomatic crisis with Beijing, which has arbitrarily detained two Canadians and imposed other retaliatory measures.
	âDo I regret that Canada followed its laws? Do I regret that Canada lived up to a long-standing extradition treaty with our closest ally? Absolutely not,â Trudeau said.
	âCanada is a country of the rule of law. And obeying those laws can't just be when it's convenient or when it's easy. If you're a country of the rule of law, if you're a country of values, you need to stick up for those. And that's exactly what we're doing.â
	The prime minister also criticized China for its âaggressive coercive diplomacy,â which includes the arrests of Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, and accused it of âtrying to use its weight to get its way,â before calling for countries to work together to counter China's efforts.
	âIn the face of pressure and increasingly coercive moves by one of the world's great powers, I think that really highlights at which point we need to be working together as allies, as neighbours, as friends, as countries,â he said.
	âVery few countries could stand up on its own to a superpower, to a great power. But working together in alignment, we can make sure there is a recognition that the path that China is choosing to take right now is probably not going to be as effective - even for them - as they think it will.â
	Canadian Ambassador to China Dominic Barton spoke with Kovrig on Thursday as part of a rare virtual consular visit, according to Global Affairs Canada.
	Trudeau's words ahead of Friday's APEC summit are unlikely to ease tensions between Canada and China, which Ottawa and its allies have also roundly criticized for cracking down on democracy in Hong Kong and over its treatment of its Muslim Uighur minority.
	Further complicating matters is the fact China and 14 other countries this week signed what is being billed as the world's largest free-trade deal, the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, which does not include the U.S. or Canada.
	Yet the main fireworks during that summit as well as a G20 leaders' meeting being hosted by Saudi Arabia on Saturday and Sunday are expected to come from China and the U.S., with Donald Trump set to make what are likely to be some of his final appearances as president.
	Both summits are supposed to be focused on the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly its economic impacts and what actions the international community should be taking to mitigate them now and recover afterward.
	Trudeau hinted during his address ahead of APEC on Friday that his plan is to call for more action on climate change while pushing back against protectionism, with an eye to ensuring more of the benefits of free trade and globalization reach everyday people.
	âBut the focus is obviously going to be on Trump's farewell to China and other APEC partners, and is he going to kick the can on the way out or not,â said Fen Hampson, chancellor's professor at Carleton University's Norman Paterson School of International Affairs.
	âTrump may well use the occasion to once again point fingers at China on COVID, even though the focus of the summit is prosperity and how do we restart the global economy.â
	Trump prevented APEC members from agreeing on a joint concluding communique during the last leaders' summit in 2018 because of his unhappiness with China over trade and security. Those tensions have, if anything, grown worse in the past two years.
	The G20 summit also threatens to be a prickly affair, because of host Saudi Arabia's abysmal human rights record and the fact the gathering will feature Trump, Xi as well as the autocratic leaders of Russia, Turkey and other countries.
	While the first G20 leaders' summit was held in 2008 and aimed to ensure a unified international response to the financial crisis that year, University of Waterloo international-affairs expert Bessma Momani said much has changed.
	That includes more polarization and less co-operation around the world, Momani said, as evidenced by the rush for personal protective equipment - and the likely similar rush for vaccines - during the COVID-19 pandemic.
	Trudeau was asked Thursday about the breakdown in international co-operation, and whether he hoped that Joe Biden's election as president would lead to more leadership from the U.S., to which he said that Biden is not a âpanaceaâ for the problems of the world.
	âThere's going to be a lot of work for all of us to do to try and move the world forward in the right direction,â he said.
	âI'm sure that president-elect Biden is going to be a powerful ally in that. But we cannot expect to just sort of sit back and say: `OK, bigger countries are going to do the heavy lifting we couldn't.â'

	A year after they were shut out of major categories, Latin trap kings Bad Bunny and J Balvin have a chance of winning the top honours at the Latin Grammy Awards.
	Both performers are double nominees for album of the year: their collaborative project, ""Oasis,"" is up for the prize and their solo albums -- Bad Bunny's ""YHLQMDLG"" and Balvin's ""Colores"" -- are also in contention.
	Balvin, who is the leading nominee with 13 bids, is also a double nominee for record of the year: His song ""Rojo"" is nominated as is ""China,"" his collaboration with Anuel AA, Daddy Yankee, Karol G and Ozuna. Bad Bunny's ""Vete"" will also compete for record of the year.
	It's a far cry from the 2019 Latin Grammys, where popular reggaeton and Latin trap musicians such as Balvin, Bad Bunny, Ozuna, Karol G, Daddy Yankee, Nicky Jam, Maluma and more were dissed in top categories like album, song and record of the year. As a result social media exploded as Latin artists posted images of the Grammy logo with a large red ""X? across it, with words on the image reading in Spanish: ""Without reggaeton, there's no Latin Grammys.""
	Balvin even skipped the live show last year and Bad Bunny, who won best urban music album during the telecast, told the audience: ""With all due respect, reggaeton is part of the Latin culture.""
	But this year the Latin Grammys have changed its tune. They added new categories like best reggaeton performance and best rap/hip-hop song, while contemporary stars scored major nominations: Bad Bunny has nine, Ozuna picked up eight and Karol G scored four, including bids for record and song of the year for her global, Nicki Minaj-assited hit ""Tusa."" Karol G's fiance, Puerto Rican rapper-singer and first-time nominee Anuel AA, earned seven nominations including one for best new artist.
	Most of the 53 awards will be handed out at a pre-ceremony. The show, which will air on Univision at 8 p.m. EDT, will include performances (most of them pre-taped) by Balvin, Camilo, Ricky Martin, Prince Royce, Anuel AA, Marc Anthony, Pedro Capo, Karol G, Kany Garcia and Sebastian Yatra. Bad Bunny will perform from San Juan, Anitta will sing from Rio de Janeiro and Pitbull will be joined by frontline workers to honour their courageous work during the coronavirus pandemic.
	Because of the pandemic, the show will not have a live audience or a red carpet."

              Denmark says corona mink mutation 'most likely eradicated'
          
","
              Two weeks after sounding the alarm about a mutated variant of the new coronavirus in minks that could threaten the effectiveness of a future vaccine, Denmark says the strain has likely been eradicated.

	Two weeks after sounding the alarm about a mutated variant of the new coronavirus in minks that could threaten the effectiveness of a future vaccine, Denmark said Thursday the strain has likely been eradicated.
	Noting that no new cases had been detected since Sept. 15, the government said most of the strict restrictions it had imposed on Nov. 5 on seven municipalities in the North Jutland region, home to 280,000 people, would be lifted on Friday.
	But Denmark, which had ordered a nationwide cull of all its 15 to 17 million minks, has already killed around two-thirds of stocks and plans to carry out the full cull to avoid any new mutation.
	""There have been no new cases of the 'Cluster 5' mink mutation since September 15, which has led the Danish infectious disease authority SSI to conclude that this variant has most likely been eradicated,"" the health ministry said in a statement.
	SSI told AFP no cases had been detected in either people or minks since that date.
	While the problem posed by 'Cluster 5' for vaccines was only made public in early November, the variant was detected in minks and 12 people in August and September.
	With three times more minks than people, the Scandinavian country is the world's biggest exporter, selling pelts for around 670 million euros (US$792 million) annually, and the second-biggest producer behind China.
	But the animal has posed a problem in the fight against the new coronavirus. The minks can catch the virus, and also pass it back to humans, and Denmark, like several other countries in Europe, began culling sick minks this summer.
	Ireland said Thursday that it was planning a nationwide cull of mink on its commercial farms, which are reported to house around 100,000 animals.
	Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen had raised the alarm about the mutation in early November, ordering all the country's minks slaughtered.
	So far, a total of 10.2 million have been killed.
	Her government was forced to admit last week that it had no legal power to order the cull of healthy minks outside the contaminated zones, leading to the resignation on Wednesday of the agriculture minister and dealing a blow to public confidence in the government.
	Frederiksen has insisted the cull is ""non-negotiable"", and her government is now preparing legislation to make it possible -- by banning mink farming until Jan. 1, 2022.
	Health authorities said initial studies had shown that future vaccines against COVID-19 could be less effective on the 'Cluster 5' variant.
	Some experts have questioned the conclusions drawn by Danish health authorities about the danger posed by the strain, and suspect them of overreacting.
	Meanwhile, the strict restrictions in North Jutland -- including shutdowns of public transport, bars and restaurants, and limitations on movement -- had originally been due to stay in place until Dec. 3.
	They were now to be lifted early, as of Friday, now that the variant is believed to have disappeared.
	Denmark and the United States are among six countries that have reported new coronavirus cases linked to mink farms, the World Health Organization said on November 7.
	Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Sweden are the other nations to have discovered SARS-CoV-2 in minks, the agency said in a statement."

	The UN's climate chief says deadlines set by some of the world's top polluters to end greenhouse gas emissions, along with U.S. President-elect Joe Biden's pledge to take Washington back into the Paris accord, have boosted hopes of meeting the pact's ambitious goals.
	The agreement signed in the French capital five years ago aims to keep global warming well below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) -- ideally no more than 1.5 C (2.7 Fahrenheit) -- compared to pre-industrial times by the end of the century. Experts say the world is far off track and that, with average temperatures already up by about 1 C (2 Fahrenheit), drastic action is needed in the next 30 years.
	But the recent announcement by China, the world's top polluter, that it will phase out emissions by 2060, and pledges by Japan and South Korea to do the same a decade earlier, have drawn cautious optimism from climate campaigners. Their hopes were further boosted by Biden's election win earlier this month and his pledge to undo President Donald Trump's withdrawal from the Paris agreement.
	""These announcements are really extraordinary,"" Patricia Espinosa, head of the UN climate office, told The Associated Press. ""Just a few months ago, I don't think anybody would have really predicted that we would see these kinds of announcements at this time. And especially in the middle of the pandemic.""
	Espinosa said countries' willingness to commit to tougher emissions limits shows that curbing global warming remains a political priority -- and that the target set in Paris is a possibility.
	""Science has told us that we still have a chance to achieve it,"" she said. ""Looking at these announcements, I think that we should be also having even more hope.""
	But Espinosa cautioned against complacency. ""I don't want to sound like it's a done deal,"" she said. ""We are still far from there.""
	The pandemic brought a sudden halt to the UN's carousel of climate meetings, disrupting complex negotiations on a wide range of environmental issues and forcing the cancellation of the global body's annual climate summit for the first time in a quarter century.
	""It has been challenging,"" Espinosa said by video from her agency's headquarters in Bonn, Germany, noting how carefully forged relationships were suddenly confined to virtual conversations. ""It does not substitute the in-person contacts, but it works.""
	In some ways, however, the coronavirus crisis has proved to be an opportunity to change old habits, she added.
	""Everybody is clear that we will not go back to the normal that we had before the pandemic,"" Espinosa said, recalling her globe-trotting days as Mexico's top diplomat from 2006 to 2012 that sometimes included two long-distance flights a day. ""You cannot continue to travel like you used to travel.""
	The 62-year-old praised young people in particular for being willing to adapt, forgoing some of the planet-warming habits of older generations such as owning cars and indulging in meat-heavy diets that scientists say need to change.
	""This deep transformation is very much going to be driven by the youth,"" Espinosa said.
	Still, political leadership remains key to weaning economies off fossil fuels, especially in countries where large numbers of jobs are tied to extraction of oil, natural gas and coal, she said, adding that governments will also have to look beyond national interests when it comes to investing in low-carbon solutions.
	That will mean denying COVID-19 economic recovery funds to polluting industries while putting up the $100 billion each year world leaders pledged in Paris to help poor countries tackle climate change by 2020, she said.
	""It is absolutely indispensable that we align those recovery packages to the goals of the Paris agreement,"" Espinosa said. ""We should not go back to the past. We cannot continue to invest in a gray future.""
	Her comments were echoed Thursday by UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, who called on the European Union to ramp up its emissions target for 2030, from 40% cuts to at least 55%.
	""I urge you to continue to lead with concrete and ambitious near-term commitments,"" Guterres said in a speech to the European Council on Foreign Relations, a think-tank .
	The 27-nation bloc, which has also tentatively committed to reaching ""net zero"" emissions by 2050, is in talks to earmark parts of a vast stimulus package for `green recovery' projects.
	""The proposed 1.85 trillion euro ($2.1 trillion) investment package is an opportunity to invest in measures and technologies needed to achieve climate neutrality by 2050,"" Guterres said."

              Xi: China will avoid decoupling amid tension with U.S., Europe

China's President Xi Jinping on Thursday spurned suggestions that his country might decouple or separate itself from the U.S. and other trading partners amid tension with Washington and Europe over technology and security.

	China's President Xi Jinping on Thursday spurned suggestions that his country might decouple or separate itself from the U.S. and other trading partners amid tension with Washington and Europe over technology and security.
	Speaking by video link from Beijing to a meeting of Asia-Pacific CEOs, Xi promised to open China's market wider but announced no initiatives to respond to complaints the ruling Communist Party improperly subsidizes and shields technology and other industries from foreign competitors.
	Xi rejected suggestions Beijing might respond to U.S. sanctions on its fledgling technology companies by trying to separate their industries from global trading partners.
	The ruling Communist Party has promoted its own standards for mobile phones and other technology, which would encourage customers that adopt them to use Chinese suppliers. That has prompted fears world markets might split into smaller segments with incompatible industry standards, hurting productivity.
	""We will never go back in history by seeking to decouple or forming a `small circle' to keep others out,"" Xi said.
	Thursday's event came ahead of a meeting of Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation leaders hosted by Malaysia. The meeting Friday is due to be conducted via video conference due to the pandemic.
	Xi's comments followed Sunday's signing of the world's largest free trade agreement, the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, by Beijing and 14 other Asian neighbours.
	The Chinese-initiated RCEP appeals to other developing countries because it reduces barriers to trade in farm goods, manufactured goods and components, which make up most of their exports. It says little about trade in services and access for companies to operate in each other's economies, which the United States and other developed countries want.
	The Trump administration has cut off Chinese tech giant Huawei's access to most U.S. components and technology on security grounds. Washington has shut Huawei and a rival Chinese telecom equipment vendor, ZTE, out of the U.S. market. The White House is pressing the Chinese owner of video service TikTok to sell its U.S. operation, which American officials say is a security risk.
	Xi promised to cut tariffs but gave no details.
	""We will further reduce tariffs and institutional costs, cultivate a number of import trade promotion innovation demonstration zones, and expand imports of high-quality products and services from various countries,"" he said.
	China's repeated promises to set up trade zones and ease import restrictions prompt complaints by the United States, Europe, Japan and other trading partners that Beijing is using such isolated steps to avoid complying with promises made when it joined the World Trade Organization in 2001 to allow foreign companies to compete freely in its economy.
	China is one of the world's biggest importers, but the United States and other governments complain Beijing is dragging its feet on carrying out two-decade-old promises to open its markets to foreign competitors in banking, finance and other services.
	Leaders from Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia also spoke at Thursday's event, calling for a deeper commitment to open and free trade to bolster the region's economy.
	Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said RCEP was a ""big step forward"" for Asian economic integration as progress in APEC was hampered by Washington's inward-looking trade policy.
	With new President-elect Joe Biden's government seen as more supportive of multilateral trade, Lee voiced hope the new U.S. government will be more constructive in its dealings with other countries.
	""Taking care of America's interests does not mean having to ride roughshod over other countries' interests,"" Lee said.
	Malaysian Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin said free and open trade and investment, regional economic integration, as well as economic and technical co-operation must remain APEC's priorities moving forward.
	But he said there is now a need ""to ensure a delicate balance between our health priorities and economic needs.""
	Indonesian President Joko Widodo defended a controversial new jobs law that he said would improve the business climate and prop up his country's economic growth.
	The law approved last month revises dozens of existing regulations to cut red tape. It sparked violent protests from workers who fear it will cripple labour rights and harm the environment.
	""Indonesia is using the momentum of this crisis to carry out extraordinary structural reforms....so that we can move quickly through these difficult times. We are ready to open the doors widely for businessmen and for investors in new ways,"" Widodo said."

	A united federal opposition has supported a Conservative motion to insist the Liberal government take a harder line against what it says are national-security threats from China.
	The motion, sponsored by Tory foreign affairs critic Michael Chong, passed Wednesday by 179 votes to 146 and calls on the government to decide within 30 days whether to allow China's Huawei Technologies to supply equipment for Canada's next generation 5G wireless networks.
	It also calls on the government to table a plan within 30 days to deal with growing intimidation by China of Canadians within Canada's borders.
	The motion says Canada needs to ""develop a robust plan, as Australia has done, to combat China's growing foreign operations here in Canada and its increasing intimidation of Canadians living in Canada, and table it within 30 days of the adoption of this motion.""
	The Liberal government has delayed deciding on which companies can supply equipment for providers of 5G networks since China imprisoned two Canadians, Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, nearly two years ago in apparent retaliation for the RCMP's arrest of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou on a U.S. extradition warrant.
	China blames the Trump administration for trying to undermine Huawei by targeting Meng, which has left Canada in the middle of a trade war between the world's two major economic powers.
	The U.S. says Huawei is an espionage arm of the Chinese military and has urged Canada and Western allies not to use its technology, but the company rejects that accusation.
	Alykhan Velshi, vice-president of corporate affairs for Huawei Technologies Canada, said Wednesday that the company has been a good corporate citizen since coming to Canada in 2008.
	""During these 12 years in Canada, Huawei has never received a complaint from the Canadian government or any of our customers about a single privacy or security breach involving Huawei equipment in Canada,"" said Velshi, who previously worked as a senior adviser in the office of former Conservative prime minister Stephen Harper.
	He noted that in 2012, Harper travelled to Beijing and ""witnessed the signing of one of Huawei's first commercial agreements with a Canadian telecom operator.""

	The World Health Organization's emergencies director warned Wednesday that vaccines would not arrive in time to defeat the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic.
	The WHO's Michael Ryan said vaccines should not be seen as a ""unicorn"" magic solution -- and countries battling a resurgence of the virus would once again have to ""climb this mountain"" without them.
	""I think it's at least four to six months before we have significant levels of vaccination going on anywhere,"" he said, during a public question and answer session live on social media.
	Despite recent promising announcements from final-phase candidate vaccine trials, ""We're not there with vaccines yet,"" said Ryan.
	""Many countries are going through this wave, and they're going to go through this wave, and continue through this wave, without vaccines.
	""We need to understand and internalise that, and realise: we have got to climb this mountain this time, without vaccines.""
	Pfizer said Wednesday that a completed study of its experimental vaccine showed it was 95 percent effective, while fellow US firm Moderna said this week that its own candidate was 94.5 percent effective. Russia claims its candidate is more than 90 percent effective.
	Ryan warned against slackening off individual vigilance against the virus in the mistaken belief that vaccines would now solve the problem instead.
	""Some people think a vaccine will be, in a sense, the solution: the unicorn we've all been chasing. It's not,"" the Irishman said.
	""If we add vaccines and forget the other things, COVID does not go to zero.""
GRIEVING GRANDCHILDREN
	The number of new Covid-19 cases in Europe declined last week for the first time in over three months, but deaths in the region continued to climb,Â WHO data showed Wednesday.
	While at least 55.6 million cases worldwide have been registered since the outbreak emerged in China last December, the novel coronavirus has killed more than 1.3 million people around the globe, according to a tally from official sources compiled by AFP.
	Ryan voiced concerns about how the pandemic has left many bereaved grandchildren who have been unable to go through the normal grieving process due to the restrictions imposed to combat the virus.
	""A lot of kids in this have lost grandparents,"" he said.
	""There's quite a bit of trauma out there amongst kids.
	""The grieving process for kids -- it's tough, because you don't have all the natural things: the funeral situation, you don't get to say goodbye, you don't have the gatherings, so it's grieving interrupted.
	""I am concerned if the child's need to grieve the loss of a grandparent has been interrupted, because that has a lifelong impact."""

	Canadaâs top cybersecurity agency has named China, Russia, Iran, and North Koreaâs state-sponsored cyber activity as posing the âgreatest strategic threatsâ to Canadaâs critical infrastructure, intellectual property, and political events like elections.
	In its 2020 National Cyber Threat Assessment, the Canadian Centre for Cyber Security within the Communications Security Establishment warns that state-sponsored cyber activity is the most sophisticated and actors are âvery likelyâ attempting to develop capabilities to disrupt critical systems; will âalmost certainlyâ continue conducting commercial espionage against Canadian governments, businesses, and organizations; and are keeping up ongoing online foreign influence campaigns aimed at altering discourse around current events to divide Canadians.
	âThe most sophisticated capabilities belong to state sponsored cyber threat actors who are motivated by economic, ideological, and geopolitical goals. Their activities include cyber espionage, intellectual property theft, online influence operations, and disruptive cyber attacks,â states the report.
	âWe assess that almost certainly the state-sponsored programs of China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea pose the greatest state-sponsored cyber threats to Canadian individuals and organizations. However, many other states are rapidly developing their own cyber programs, benefiting from various legal and illegal markets to purchase cyber products and services,â it continues.
	The report is a reminder that Canada canât let its guard down, said National Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan in the foreword of the report.
	âForeign state-sponsored cyber programs are probing our critical infrastructure for vulnerabilities. Foreign efforts to influence public discourse through social media have become the ânew normal.â More than that, the internet is at a crossroads, with countries like China and Russia pushing to change the way it is governed, to turn it into a tool for censorship, surveillance, and state control,â Sajjan wrote.
	The report is an update to the 2018 version, and offers forecasts on the threat environment through to 2022. The agency cautions that the threat assessment does not include an exhaustive list of activity, but is based on classified and unclassified sources available up to Oct. 20.
	âWhen we call actors out, and specifically into sectors, we see the sector respond quite rapidly to the threat,â said Scott Jones, the head of the Canadian Centre for Cyber Security, during a teleconference discussing the new report. He cited the decision the agency took in July to allege alongside the United Kingdom that Russia tried to steal information and intellectual property from researchers working on a COVID-19 vaccine.
	The 2020 threat assessment warns about cyber actors targeting organizations responsible for essential services like utilities and health care by going after their Industrial Control Systems (ICS).
	Given more and more aspects of infrastructure are being connected to the internet, the risk of the software becoming vulnerable to cyber attacks is increasing.
	One specific area the report delves into is the threat to Canadaâs electricity grid, where itâs anticipated state actors are trying to develop capacities needed to disrupt Canadaâs electricity supply.
	A recent example of countries getting into this kind of behaviour include when Russian-associated actors âprobed the networks of electricity utilities in the U.S. and Canadaâ in 2019. As well, the report cites U.S. utility employees being targeted by China; Iranian hacking groups targeting control system infrastructure in rival nations like Israel, and North Korean malware being found in the IT networks of Indiaâs power plants.
	âWe assess that cybercriminals will very likely increase their targeting of ICS in the next two years in an attempt to place increased pressure on critical infrastructure and heavy industry victims to promptly accede to ransom demands,â reads the report.
	While the report says the reality of an attack like this remains âvery unlikely,â it could cause major damage and interruptions to wide swaths of the country.
	âWhat you could see is shutting off of transmission lines, you could see them opening circuit breakers â meaning electricity simply won't flow to our homes, to our businesses, to other pieces of Canada's critical infrastructureâ¦ We want to get ahead of this trend and make sure that we're getting ahead of it before you see those implications happening in critical infrastructure that could affect large numbers of people at the same time,â Jones said.
	âWeâre not trying to scare people, weâre certainly not trying to scare people into going off grid by building a cabin in the woods, etc. Weâre here to say âletâs tackle these now while theyâre still paper, while theyâre still a threat that weâre writing downâ before itâs a threat that can become real in the future,â he said, adding that work is underway to raise the awareness in the energy sector about these threats.
	The cyber centreâs threat assessment also notes that âa number of statesâ have deployed online influence campaigns âas part of their daily businessâ in an effort to change civil discourse, policymakers' decisions, and the reputations of politicians.
	âThey try to delegitimize the concept of democracy and other values such as human rights and libertyâ¦ They also try to exacerbate existing friction in democratic societies around various divisive social, political, and economic issues,â reads the report.
	While usually these efforts increase around elections, the agency says itâs seeing the campaigns have broadened out since 2018 to target trending stories and popular political issues.
	âIt happens every day now. This is something where itâs just constant misuse or misinformation on the internet. And this is where weâre saying, âLook we need to start turning to authoritative sources,ââ Jones said in an interview on CTVâs Power Play.
	In Canada, this has included Russian and Iranian efforts to sway minds related to terrorism and the 2017 Quebec City mosque shooting, the Trans Mountain pipeline construction, domestic policies on immigration and refugees, and climate change.
	More recently, attempts to influence Canadians have been seen in relation to COVID-19 and government responses to the pandemic.
	Going forward, the report notes that Canadaâs position on âhigh-tension geopolitical issuesâ could elevate the threat.
	The report also states that relative to other countries, Canadians are lower-priority targets for online foreign influence, but because our âmedia ecosystem is closely intertwined with that of the United States and other allies,â when our neighbour is targeted, Canadians become exposed to the online influence.
	Jones said that Canada has been sharing information about what itâs seeing when Canadians or domestic institutions are caught up in online interference efforts.
	In addition to digging into the foreign state actor threat, the report highlights the uptick in online threats to Canadians and national institutions posed by fraudsters and other bad actors, in the face of the COVID-19 that are preying on the fears and anxieties that many people are experiencing during the pandemic, as well as the heightened use of online tools to work from home and stay connected others.
	The CSE stated that cybercrime remains the greatest direct threat to Canadians and Canadian organizations, many of which are not doing enough to protect their passwords, software, and increasing cadre of digital devices from hacks or other attacks.
	âCybersecurity is a team sport, and as any hockey coach will tell you, to mount an effective defence you need to know what youâre up against,â Jones said."

	A federal agency that monitors brewing online threats warns of fraudsters dangling COVID-19-related content to fool victims into clicking on malicious links and attachments.
	Online tricksters know people are anxious about the future and are less likely to act prudently when they see emails, text messages or advertisements related to the pandemic, the Canadian Centre for Cyber Security said in a report Wednesday.
	The report, the centre's latest look at the cyberthreat landscape, says while criminal activity is the most likely danger, the state-sponsored programs of China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea pose the greatest strategic threats to Canada.
	COVID-19 lures often attempt to imitate the branding and style of legitimate institutions, such as international organizations and public health agencies, the centre said.
	It noted that cyberthreat actors can produce convincing copies of government websites and official correspondence.
	One text-message phishing campaign claimed to provide access to a Canada Emergency Response Benefit payment, but only after the target handed over personal financial details.
	Another campaign impersonated the Public Health Agency of Canada's chief public health officer to deliver malware through a fake COVID-19 update that appeared official and legitimate, the report says.
	""We're all hyper-connected now,"" centre head Scott Jones told a news conference. ""It's important to take a breath, to say, hey, do I know this person?""
	The COVID-19 pandemic has illustrated the extent to which the Canadian economy relies on digital infrastructure, the report says.
	""With a sudden increase in the number of Canadians working from home, the protection and security of cyber and telecommunications infrastructure, hardware and software, and the supply chains that support them, is critical to national security and economic prosperity.""
	Shifts in March 2020 due to the pandemic quickly changed the online environment, as more Canadians began to work, shop and socialize remotely, the report notes.
	""We foresee this trend continuing, bringing more facets of Canadian economic, social and political life online and exposing them to cyberthreats, which have also been evolving to take advantage of the growing importance of the internet and related technologies.""
	Canada, Britain and the United States denounced Russian hackers in July for trying to steal research on COVID-19 vaccines from organizations in all three countries and around the world.
	State-backed players are expected to continue trying to pilfer intellectual property related to managing COVID-19 to support their domestic public health responses or to profit from its illegal reproduction by their own firms, the new report warned.
	While online foreign-influence activities tend to increase around elections, these ongoing campaigns have broadened since 2018, expanding to react to current events, shifting their content strategies around trending news stories and popular political issues, the centre said.
	""For instance, we have observed recent campaigns focus their content around COVID-19 and government responses to the pandemic,"" the report noted.
	""Disinformation campaigns have also sought to discredit and criticize Canadian politicians to damage their reputations.""
	State-sponsored actors are also very likely attempting to develop capabilities to meddle with Canadian critical infrastructure, such as the electricity supply, to further their goals, the report said.
	""We judge that it is very unlikely, however, that cyberthreat actors will intentionally seek to disrupt Canadian critical infrastructure and cause major damage or loss of life in the absence of international hostilities.""
	Nevertheless, they might target Canadian organizations to collect information, position themselves for future activities or simply intimidate.
	In addition, ransomware attacks directed against Canada, in which swindlers hold data or computer systems hostage in exchange for payment, will almost certainly continue to target large enterprises and critical infrastructure providers, the report said.
	During the COVID-19 pandemic, many health-sector organizations have experienced ransomware attacks, including hospitals and health-care centres in the Czech Republic, the U.S., Spain, and Germany, it noted.
	""Health-sector organizations are popular ransomware targets because they have significant financial resources and network downtime can have life-threatening consequences for patients, increasing the likelihood that victims will pay the ransom.""

	A former national security adviser will lead a probe of whether Canada's pandemic warning system failed just before COVID-19 struck, Health Minister Patty Hajdu said Wednesday.
	Margaret Bloodworth will chair a three-member review panel studying what went wrong with the Global Public Health Intelligence Network.
	She will be joined by former deputy public health officer Dr. Paul Gully and Mylaine Breton, who studies the organization of front-line health care at Universite de Sherbrooke in Quebec.
	The network, known commonly as GPHIN, was created more than two decades ago and helped flag both the SARS pandemic in 2003 and H1N1 flu in 2009, before either really exploded. It is a big part of the World Health Organization's work gathering intelligence on health concerns arising around the world, such as the Ebola outbreak in West Africa in 2014.
	But its focus on international outbreaks of disease shifted in 2019 when the Public Health Agency of Canada adjusted the network's mandate to focus more on domestic matters.
	Some experts have said that shift left Canada without much early intelligence or consistent warnings on the novel coronavirus as it emerged in China last fall.
	Dr. Theresa Tam, the federal chief public health officer, has said GPHIN notified her last Dec. 31 of a mysterious cluster of pneumonia cases linked to a potentially new virus, and notified her provincial counterparts within days.
	According to Chinese reports, that was just four days after Chinese authorities were notified by doctors in Hubei province about a SARS-like virus causing pneumonia -- but a month after the first discussion of symptoms of an unknown virus began in China.
	GPHIN's warning also was issued the day after a warning came from ProMED, a similar alerting system run by the International Society for Infectious Diseases.
	At the end of October Tam said COVID-19 has provided many lessons for public health about the systems Canada had in place to respond to an emerging pandemic, what worked and what didn't, including as it relates to GPHIN.
	""GPHIN is something that we should be proud of,"" Tam said, at a news conference releasing her annual report Oct. 28. ""We need to think about what the next iteration of GPHIN looks like.""
	Hajdu said she ordered the review after scientists at the Public Health Agency of Canada said their concerns about GPHIN's priorities were not being heard by senior officials at the agency. She said the three panellists will report to her in the spring.
	""I think that they will do an exemplary job at discovering why those decisions were made,"" Hajdu said.
	Hajdu said a network like GPHIN is ""a critically important tool for Canada.""
	""I think it's very, very important that we understand what happened and, furthermore, how we ensure that we build it up to to make sure it has the strongest potential to alert Canada to emerging health threats, both globally but also here domestically,"" she said.
	Conservative health critic Michelle Rempel Garner said Hajdu doesn't need a review panel because the decisions to adjust GPHIN's priorities would not have been finalized without the minister herself signing off on the plan.
	""Why did she sign off on it or who did?"" said Rempel Garner. ""I don't think we need an inquiry for that. We just need them to be honest.""

              Watchdog slams U.K. over secrecy in virus equipment contracts

	The British government spent billions without proper transparency in a scramble to secure protective equipment early in the coronavirus outbreak, the country's public watchdog said Wednesday.
	The National Audit Office said in a report that companies with links to politicians were fast-tracked and had more chances of getting a coronavirus contract than other applicants.
	Like many countries, the U.K. was caught without enough masks, gowns, gloves and other items to keep health care workers and the public safe as coronavirus cases skyrocketed.
	In the push to build up stocks, the government awarded 8,600 contracts worth 18 billion pounds ($24 billion) between March and July, most without a competitive tender process. Some came from a âhigh-priority laneâ of firms referred by politicians, health professionals and government officials, which were considered more credible and processed more quickly than others. One in 10 of those firms got a contract, compared to one in 100 from the wider pool of applicants.
	The auditor said in a sample of cases it studied, âdepartments failed to document key decisions, such as why they chose a particular supplier or used emergency procurement, and failed to document their consideration of risks, including how they had identified and managed any potential conflicts of interest.â
	It said in some cases documents to support decisions were missing, or contracts were awarded after the work had already been done. In more than half the cases, contracts had not been published by Nov. 10.
	Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Conservative government has been accused of running a âchumocracyâ by awarding lucrative contracts and well-paid jobs to people with links to ministers and the governing Conservative Party - claims it denies. Two of highest-profile figures hired to lead the government's coronavirus response, Test and Trace chief Dido Harding and vaccines task force leader Kate Bingham, are both married to Conservative lawmakers.
	One example of the lucrative contracts on offer, not cited in the audit office report, saw Florida-based jewelry designer Michael Saiger land contracts worth more than 200 million pounds to supply the U.K. government with gloves and gowns. He contracted a Spanish businessman, Gabriel Gonzalez Andersson, to help procure the items from factories in China, and paid him $28 million.
	Saiger is now suing Andersson for fraud in the U.S., and details of the deal emerged in court papers.
	Opposition Labour Party lawmaker Meg Hillier, who heads Parliament's Public Accounts Committee, said the government had âripped up the rules and ridden roughshod over the taxpayer.â
	âThe high-priority lane is a real matter of concern,â she said. âThe fact that contracts haven't been published, so we can't see what happens -- they have been late getting that information out there - all smacks of secrecy and hiding things.â
	Business Secretary Alok Sharma defended the government, saying it had acted with urgency and under âhuge pressure.â
	âWe had to do an enormous amount of work very fast to secure PPE and that's what we did, and I'm not going to apologize for the fact that quite rightly we made that effort,â he told the BBC."

              Global luxury sales forecast to plunge 23 per cent due to pandemic

              Sales of luxury apparel, jewelry and beauty products are set to slide by nearly a quarter this year as the pandemic wipes out more than six years of growth, according to a study released Wednesday by the consultancy Bain.

	Sales of luxury apparel, jewelry and beauty products are set to slide by nearly a quarter this year as the pandemic wipes out more than six years of growth, according to a study released Wednesday by the consultancy Bain.
	Still, the drop is narrower than the 35% collapse forecast in the spring, thanks largely to a market recovery in China, which is generating nearly a third of all sales.
	For 2020, the sector is expected to generate 217 billion euros ($256 billion) in revenues, which is 2 billion euros below 2014 levels and down 64 billion euros from 2019, Bain said in the semi-annual study prepared for Italy's Altagamma association of high-end producers.
	It is the first decrease since the 2009 financial crisis, when the industry suffered a 9% drop but also quickly recovered the following year.
	The timing of any bounce back from the pandemic remains uncertain as a resurgence in the virus is leading countries to once again shut down non-essential retail and travel around the globe. It will largely depend on the timing of a vaccine, Bain partner Claudia D'Arpizio said in an interview.
	D'Arpizio expects the outlook to become clearer in the second quarter, when it will be easier to understand how strong spending is in China, the impact of any stimulus measures in the U.S. and Europe as well as any new tax policies by U.S. President-elect Joe Biden, which are likely to affect high-earners.
	""I see a lot of uncertainty for next year, with less uncertainty for the longer term,"" D'Arpizio said.
	Forecasts for 2021 growth fall in an unusually large range of 10% to 19%. Brands' profits are expected to drop 60% this year and recover only half of that next year.
	China, where the market is already improving, is expected to lead the trend. Bain foresees a full global recovery between 2022 and 2023, with Chinese customers responsible for nearly half of all sales by 2025.
	As more people around the globe were forced to stay home, apparel sales fell 30% to 45 billion euros. Footwear slid 12% to 19 billion euros, thanks to the sneaker trend which drove a second half rebound, while Asian consumers helped cushion a 15% decline in jewelry sales to 18 billion euros.
	The pandemic is accelerating transitions that were already under way in the sector, including a shift to online buying, a focus on sustainability and diversity, the growing role of younger generations and experimentation with digital platforms to replace or enhance the runway experience.
	""The pandemic has eliminated the excuses for brands that didn't understand the trends, to give a sense of urgency to the right investments,"" D'Arpizio said.
	She cautioned that the longer the crisis endures, some brands will run out of cash, forcing some out of business and others to restructure.
	""The more the situation is sustained, the more we risk the crisis will be permanent,"" she said."

              Boeing Max to fly again almost 2 years after deadly crashes
          
","
              After nearly two years and a pair of deadly crashes, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration has cleared Boeing's 737 Max for flight.
        ","
                  Wednesday, Nov. 18, 2020
                ",https://www.ctvnews.ca/business/boeing-max-to-fly-again-almost-2-years-after-deadly-crashes-1.5193818,"
	After nearly two years and a pair of deadly crashes, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration has cleared Boeing's 737 Max for flight.
	The nation's air safety agency announced the move early Wednesday, saying it was done after a âcomprehensive and methodicalâ 20-month review process.
	Regulators around the world grounded the Max in March 2019, after the crash of an Ethiopian Airlines jet. That happened less than five months after another Max flown by Indonesia's Lion Air plunged into the Java Sea. A total of 346 passengers and crew members on both planes were killed.
	Federal Aviation Administration chief Stephen Dickson signed an order Wednesday rescinding the grounding. U.S. airlines will be able to fly the Max once Boeing updates critical software and computers on each plane and pilots receive training in flight simulators.
	The FAA says the order was made in co-operation with air safety regulators worldwide.
	The move follows exhaustive congressional hearings on the crashes that led to criticism of the FAA for lax oversight and Boeing for rushing to implement a new software system that put profits over safety and ultimately led to the firing of its CEO.
	Investigators focused on anti-stall software that Boeing had devised to counter the plane's tendency to tilt nose-up because of the size and placement of the engines. That software pushed the nose down repeatedly on both planes that crashed, overcoming the pilots' struggles to regain control. In each case, a single faulty sensor triggered the nose-down pitch.
	The new software now requires inputs from two sensors in order to activate the software. Boeing says the software also does not override pilot controls like it did in the past.
	The company changed the software so it doesn't repeatedly point the nose of the plane down to counteract possible aerodynamic stalling. Boeing also must change the way wires are routed to a tail stabilizer bar.
	On CNBC Wednesday, Dickson said the design and pilot training changes required by the FAA âmakes it impossible for the airplanes to have the same kind of accident that unfortunately killed 346 people.â
	In an FAA video, Dickson said that for the time being, the FAA will inspect every new Max before letting the planes fly.
	Boeing shares rose 3.5% to $217.38 in early trading Wednesday. That's about half of the all-time high of $440.62 reached on March 1, 2019, just days before the Ethiopian crash, but well above the $95 trough in March, when the pandemic caused massive disruptions to travel and the global economy.
	âThese events and the lessons we have learned as a result have reshaped our company and further focused our attention on our core values of safety, quality and integrity,â Boeing CEO David Calhoun said in a statement.
	The aircraft maker's redemption comes in the middle of a pandemic that has scared away passengers and decimated the aviation industry, limiting the company's ability to make a comeback. Air travel in the U.S. alone is down about 65% from a year ago.
	Boeing sales of new planes have plunged because of the Max crisis and the coronavirus pandemic. Orders for more than 1,000 Max jets have been cancelled or removed from Boeing's backlog this year. Each plane has a sticker price of $99 million to $135 million, although airlines routinely pay less.
	John Hansman, an aeronautics professor at MIT, said people typically avoid airplanes for a few months after there are problems. But the Max case is unusual, and were it not for the novel coronavirus, Hansman said he would feel safe flying on a Max.
	âThis whole thing has had more scrutiny than any airplane in the world,â he said. âIt's probably the safest airplane to be on.â
	American is the only U.S. airline to put the Max in its schedule so far, starting with one round trip daily between New York and Miami beginning Dec. 29. United expects to start using the plane early next year, while Southwest said its Max jets won't fly before the second quarter of 2021.
	Some consumer groups urged airlines to fully disclose when Max flights are planned. That's usually on an airline's website, although passengers have to know where to click. Advocates are concerned about airlines using the Max in a last-minute switch.
	Nearly 400 Max jets were in service worldwide when they were grounded, and Boeing has built and stored about 450 more since then. All have to undergo maintenance before they can fly.
	Pilots must also undergo simulator training, which was not required when the aircraft was introduced. Hansman said training for qualified 737 pilots shouldn't take long because Boeing has fixed software problems.
	Relatives of people who died in the crashes aren't convinced the Max is safe. They accused Boeing of hiding critical design features from the FAA.
	âThe flying public should avoid the Max,â said Michael Stumo, whose 24-year-old daughter died in the second crash. âChange your flight. This is still a more dangerous aircraft than other modern planes.â
	Boeing's reputation has taken a beating since the crashes. Its then-CEO, Dennis Muilenburg, initially suggested that the foreign pilots were to blame. However, congressional investigators discovered an FAA analysis - conducted after the first Max crash - that predicted there would be 15 more crashes during the plane's life span if the flight-control software were not fixed.
	After an 18-month investigation, the House Transportation Committee heaped blame on Boeing, which was under pressure to develop the Max to compete with a plane from European rival Airbus, and the FAA, which certified the Max and was the last agency in the world to ground it after the crashes. The investigators said Boeing suffered from a âculture of concealment,â and pressured engineers to rush the plane to the market.
	Boeing was repeatedly wrong about how quickly it could fix the plane. When those predictions continued to be wrong, and Boeing was perceived as putting undue pressure on the FAA, Muilenburg was fired in December 2019.
	Dickson - a former Air Force and Delta Air Lines pilot - flew the plane personally before it was cleared.
	Europe's aviation regulator, the European Union Aviation Safety Agency, said it will take public comment on plans to clear the Max for flight and expects to finalize a plan by early next year. Some EU states will have to lift their own grounding notices as well. Regulators in Canada and China are still doing their own reviews.
	Relatives say it's too soon, and they and their lawyers say Boeing and the FAA are withholding documents. Anton Sahadi, who lives in Jakarta, Indonesia, and lost two brothers in the Lion Air crash, said it's too early for the Max to fly again.
	âThe cases from the incidents are not 100% finished yet,â he said. âI think all the victims' family in Indonesia and Ethiopia will feel the same, so regretful, why it can fly again because we are still in the recovery process for our problems because of the incidents.â
	Naoise Ryan, an Irish citizen whose husband died in the Ethiopian crash, said the Max is âthe same airplane that crashed not once but twice because safety was not a priority for this company.â

	The Danish minister in charge of farming resigned Wednesday as he took the blame for the government ordering the culling of all farmed mink without having the necessary legislation in place first.
	The culling was ordered after a mutated version of the coronavirus was found in some farms and had infected people. There is no evidence that the mutated version is more dangerous but the government moved quickly out of safety, though it lacked the legal basis to order the killing of healthy animals too.
	""I have today informed the prime minister that I want to resign from the government,"" said Mogens Jensen, the 57-year-old agriculture minister.
	The left-leaning parties that support the Social Democratic one-party, minority government said Wednesday that they no longer have confidence in Jensen. The centre-right opposition also expressed similar reservations.
	""I apologize ... and I take full responsibility for that,"" Jensen told Danish broadcaster DR.
	The government started the cull last month by killing infected animals. However, the order was also given that non-infected animals were to be culled though it did not have the legal authority for that. In total, roughly 15 million minks are to be killed.
	The government has scrambled to build political consensus, and said Tuesday that a parliamentary majority was now backing its decision to cull the minks.
	Danish mink farms are the world's biggest supplier of mink fur, accounting for 40% of global production. Most of exports go to China and Hong Kong.
	There are 1,139 mink farms in Denmark, employing about 6,000 people. Breeders have said the culling will put an end to the industry."

	The plane's disappearance follows the crash of an F-5E fighter during a training mission last month, killing the pilot.
	The incidents come as Taiwan's air force is under greater pressure to respond to incursions by warplanes from China, which claims Taiwan as its own territory to be brought under its control by force if necessary.

	In a first for the Pentagon's push to develop defences against intercontinental-range ballistic missiles capable of striking the United States, a missile interceptor launched from a U.S. Navy ship at sea hit and destroyed a mock ICBM in flight on Tuesday, officials said.
	Previous tests against ICBM targets had used interceptors launched from underground silos in the United States. If further, more challenging tests prove successful, the ship-based approach could add to the credibility and reliability of the Pentagon's existing missile defence system.
	The success of Tuesday's test is likely to draw particular interest from North Korea, whose development of intercontinental-range ballistic missiles and nuclear weapons is the main reason the Pentagon has sought to accelerate its building of missile defence systems over the past decade.
	North Korea has recently refrained from flight tests of ballistic missiles of intercontinental range and has not continued its nuclear testing. But the intentions of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un are uncertain as U.S. President-elect Joe Biden prepares to take office, succeeding President Donald Trump.
	Although the current U.S. approach to missile defence is designed to protect the U.S. homeland against an ICBM fired from North Korea, both Russia and China have expressed concern that the U.S. could use its missile defences to undercut the deterrent value of their nuclear forces, which are larger than those of North Korea.
	The U.S. move to add a sea-based defence against ICBMs is likely to make China feel a need to further expand its long-range missile arsenal, said Hans Kristensen, a nuclear weapons and missile expert with the Federation of American Scientists.
	""It's going to fuel further the mindset that this buildup is justified"" in China, Kristensen said in an interview. Russia, he said, is likely to see Tuesday's test as confirmation of its long-expressed concern that U.S. defences originally designed to deal with a limited number of intermediate-range missiles are being enhanced to threaten Russia's ICBM arsenal.
	Missile defence has long been a sticking point in U.S. arms control talks with Russia.
	Navy Vice Adm. Jon Hill, director of the Pentagon's Missile Defence Agency, which conducted Tuesday's test, called the result ""an incredible accomplishment and critical milestone"" for the program. He said this ship-based approach, if augmented with more capable systems for detecting and tracking hostile missiles in flight, could provide ""a hedge against unexpected developments in the missile threat.""
	Hill did not mention any countries by name, but North Korea is the main U.S. concern.
	Laura Grego, a physicist and missile defence expert at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said the prospect of a major U.S. expansion of missile defences by potentially equipping Navy ships globally with anti-ICBM capabilities is worrying.
	""It is likely to have a crushing effect on prospects for new arms control agreements and will also provide motivation (or justification) for Russia and China to diversify and grow their nuclear weapons arsenals,"" she wrote on Twitter.
	In Tuesday's test, the latest version of an Aegis SM-3 missile built by Raytheon Missiles & Defence was fired from a U.S. Navy destroyer situated in the Pacific, northeast of Hawaii. Its target was a mock ICBM that had been launched from a U.S. test range at Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands. The target missile was not equipped with decoys or other sophisticated systems of the kind that a U.S. missile interceptor might face in a real attack on the U.S. homeland.
	The test had been planned for last spring but was delayed because of restrictions related to the coronavirus pandemic.

              What Obama says about Putin, Merkel and other world leaders in his new memoir
          
","
              Former U.S. president Barack Obama offers poetic and often biting assessments of other world leaders his new memoir.

                ",https://www.ctvnews.ca/world/what-obama-says-about-putin-merkel-and-other-world-leaders-in-his-new-memoir-1.5192501,"WASHINGTON -- 
	Former U.S. president Barack Obama offers poetic and often biting assessments of other world leaders his new memoir ""A Promised Land,"" which he says he wrote entirely on his own in longhand.
	Here are some of his descriptions of other world leaders from his encounters with them between 2009 and 2011:
RUSSIAN PRESIDENT (THEN PRIME MINISTER) VLADIMIR PUTIN: ""Physically, he was unremarkable: short and compact -- a wrestler's build -- with thin, sandy hair, a prominent nose, and pale, watchful eyes. ... I noticed a casualness to his movements, a practiced disinterest in his voice that indicated someone accustomed to being surrounded by subordinates and supplicants.""
FRANCE'S THEN-PRESIDENT NICOLAS SARKOZY: ""With his dark, expressive vaguely Mediterranean features (he was half Hungarian and a quarter Greek Jew) and small stature (he was about five-foot-five but wore lifts in his shoes to make himself taller), he looked like a figure out of a Toulouse-Lautrec painting.
	""Conversations with Sarkozy were by turns amusing and exasperating, his hands in perpetual motion, his chest thrust out like a bantam cock's, his personal translator... always beside him to frantically mirror his every gesture and intonation as the conversation swooped from flattery to bluster to genuine insight, never straying from his primary, barely disguised interest, which was to be at the center of the action and take credit for whatever it was that might be worth taking credit for.""
ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER BENJAMIN NETANYAHU: ""Built like a linebacker, with a square jaw, broad features, and a gray comb-over, Netanyahu was smart, canny, tough and a gifted communicator in both Hebrew and English.""
	""Netanyahu could be charming, even solicitous, when it served his purposes.""
	""But his vision of himself as the chief defender of the Jewish people against calamity allowed him to justify almost anything that would keep him in power -- and his familiarity with American politics and media gave him confidence that he could resist whatever pressure a Democratic administration like mine might try to apply.""
GERMAN CHANCELLOR ANGELA MERKEL: ""Merkel's eyes were big and bright blue and could be touched by turns with frustration, amusement or hints of sorrow. Otherwise, her stolid appearance reflected her no-nonsense, analytical sensibility.""
TURKISH PRESIDENT (THEN PRIME MINISTER) RECEP TAYYIP ERDOGAN"": Personally, I found (Erdogan) to be cordial and generally responsive to my requests. But whenever I listened to him speak, his tall frame slightly stooped, his voice a forceful staccato that rose an octave in response to various grievances or perceived slights, I got the strong impression that his commitment to democracy and the rule of law might last only as long as it preserved his own power.""
INDIA'S THEN-PRIME MINISTER MANMOHAN SINGH: ""A gentle, soft-spoken economist in his 70s, with a white beard and a turban that were the marks of his Sikh faith but to the Western eye lent him the air of a holy man...
	""I would find Singh to be wise, thoughtful and scrupulously honest.""
CHINA'S THEN-PRESIDENT HU JINTAO: ""Whatever the topic, he liked to read from thick stacks of prepared remarks, pausing every so often for translations to English that seemed to have been prepared in advance and, somehow, always lasted longer than his original statement. ... I was tempted more than once to suggest that we could save each other time by just exchanging papers and reading them at our leisure."""

              Catriona Le May Doan Canada's chef de mission for 2022 Winter Olympics
          
","
              Catriona Le May Doan says she's ready to mentor and shield Canada's athletes at the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing.

	Catriona Le May Doan says she's ready to mentor and shield Canada's athletes at the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing.
	The two-time Olympic gold medallist in speedskating was named Canada's 2022 chef de mission Tuesday by the Canadian Olympic Committee.
	Le May Doan won gold in the 500 metres in 1998 and 2002. She became the first Canadian to successfully defend an Olympic title.
	The 49-year-old from Saskatoon lives in Calgary, where she's president and chief executive officer of Sport Calgary.
	The four-time Olympian worked as a CBC and CTV Olympic commentator since retiring from her sport.
	Le May Doan served on the Canadian team's mission staff in 2018 in Pyeongchang, South Korea.
	She was a lead athlete mentor working alongside chef de mission Isabelle Charest, from whom Le May Doan inherits the job.
	""It was a great experience in 2018 being on the mission team. I knew that I wanted to do more than that,"" Le May Doan told The Canadian Press.
	""It really does kind of complete my Olympic circle, having been athlete, media and mission team. It was something I really wanted, I think maybe more than I even understood.""
	Canadian athletes won 29 medals, including 11 gold, to rank third behind Norway and Germany in the overall medal count in Pyeongchang.
	The chef de mission, or ""head of mission"", is an ambassador for the entire team leading into and during the Games.
	Once a role given to Canadian sport administrators, the volunteer position is now filled by former Olympic athletes.
	Champion rower Marnie McBean is Canada's chef for the 2021 Summer Olympics in Tokyo.
	Previous chefs include cyclist Curt Harnett (2016), skier Steve Podborski (2014), swimmer Mark Tewksbury (2012), speedskater Nathalie Lambert (2010) and diver Sylvie Bernier (2008).
	""Catriona has huge credibility and respect in the sport and broader community, is an inspiring leader and is passionate about sport and the Olympic movement,"" COC president Tricia Smith said in a statement.
	""Between her vast experience in the world of sport, her integrity and the way she consistently lives the Olympic values of excellence, respect and friendship, we are all extremely fortunate and excited to have Catriona as chef for Beijing 2022.""
	In addition to mentorship, the chef de mission also deals with Canadian team issues that can erupt into a firestorm.
	When Le May Doan claimed her first gold medal in Nagano, Japan, Canadian chef Bill Wakelin dealt with snowboarder Ross Rebagliati being stripped of his gold medal because he tested positive for marijuana.
	The medal was reinstated before the closing ceremonies because marijuana wasn't on the prohibited list of banned substances.
	Le May Doan carried Canada's flag into the 2002 opening ceremonies in Salt Lake City, where chef Sally Rehorick got little sleep because of a figure-skating judging scandal.
	Canadian pair Jamie Sale and David Pelletier performed what many believed was the superior free skate, but were given lower marks and a silver medal behind a Russian duo.
	The controversy burned and kept Canada front and centre at the Games until a duplicate set of gold medals were awarded to Sale and Pelletier.
	""There's stuff in every Games for sure. In certain ways for me, it was good because it took attention away from me,"" Le May Doan recalled. ""There's so much pressure you put on yourself.
	""When things are good, the chef steps aside and says the focus is on the athlete and that's what the Games are about.
	""But when things are stressful, if there's some situation you have to deal with, the chef's role is to then stand in front of the team and be that spokesperson and take that sort of distraction away from the athletes.""
	Canada's winter-sport athletes are facing travel complications, postponement and cancellation of events and shortened seasons because of the COVID-19 pandemic.
	Canada's relationship with China is strained. Canada arrested Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou in 2018 because of an extradition agreement with the United States.
	China immediately arrested Canadian citizens Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig, who are still in custody.
	Canada's United Nations ambassador Bob Rae criticized China's treatment of Uyghur people in The Globe and Mail this week.
	In the same article, Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology scholar Timothy Grose, who specializes in Chinese ethnic policy, suggested a boycott of the 2022 Olympics.
	When Le May Doan bore Canada's flag into the 2002 opening ceremonies, the man carrying the ""Canada"" placard in front of her was Brian Maxwell.
	He wasn't wearing a Canadian uniform, Le May Doan said, and Canada's athletes didn't know who he was
	Maxwell was a Canadian marathoner who wasn't allowed to race in the 1980 Summer Games in Moscow.
	Canada had joined other countries in boycotting the Games over the Soviet Union's invasion of Afghanistan.
	""A boycott only hurts the athletes. It does not solve anything,"" Le May Doan said.
	""My role as chef and the athletes' role is to prepare and then go to the Games to show Canadian values, to represent our country, to represent Olympic values on that world stage and build bridges between countries.""

              Tories push Liberals to decide 5G, Huawei amid China imprisonment of Kovrig, Spavor
          
","
              Conservative Leader Erin O'Toole says Chinese telecom giant Huawei rose to dominance by stealing the technology of the defunct Canadian firm Nortel.
        ","
                  Tuesday, Nov. 17, 2020

	Chinese telecom giant Huawei rose to dominance by stealing the technology of the defunct Canadian firm Nortel, Conservative Leader Erin O'Toole says.
	O'Toole levelled the industrial-espionage charge against Huawei and the Chinese Communist Party on Tuesday as he announced that the Conservatives are pushing the Liberals to decide within 30 days which companies can provide Canada's next-generation 5G wireless internet technology.
	""The rise of Huawei was itself facilitated by years of industrial espionage conducted by China against Nortel,"" O'Toole told a press conference on Parliament Hill.
	""Intellectual-property theft, counterfeiting and digital piracy are not exceptions to our dealings with China. They are the reality, and it's high time our government and many corporate leaders realize that,"" the Conservative leader added.
	""We may have lost Nortel to Huawei but we can and must learn from it. Because if we don't, we have to accept that another company will be next.""
	Nortel Networks Corp., a once mighty Canadian telecom giant, filed for bankruptcy in 2009, becoming one of the country's most spectacular business failures. Two years later, Nortel executed the biggest patent sale in history, raising billions in cash, when it auctioned off 6,000 patents to a consortium that included Apple and Microsoft.
	The Conservatives are tabling a motion in the House of Commons that demands the government decide whether Huawei ought to be banned from participating in Canadian 5G networks amid the ongoing diplomatic dispute between Canada and the People's Republic.
	Â 
	China has imprisoned two Canadians, Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, in apparent retaliation for the RCMP's arresting Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou nearly two years ago on a U.S. extradition warrant.
	The United States is pressuring Canada and its allies in the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing network to ban Huawei because it views the company as an espionage arm of the Chinese state, a charge the company denies.
	Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was noncommittal Tuesday on the timing of his government's long-awaited 5G decision. He reiterated his government's position that it is relying on the advice of security and intelligence agencies, is consulting with allies, and is committed to keeping Canadians and their businesses safe.
	O'Toole said he wants the matter debated in the Commons and wants a new strategy for relations with China, because the Liberals have not done enough stand up to its intimidation of Canada.
	Foreign Affairs Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne said during question period that he is open to working with the Conservatives on national security and foreign policy and would be prepared to propose constructive amendments moving forward.
	Champagne said the government is working on a new plan to deal with China because China is not the same country it was four years ago and Canada needs a plan to respond to the ""new reality.""
	O'Toole said China poses long-standing domestic risks, including threats from its foreign agents to Chinese-Canadians and the peddling of anti-western propaganda through post-secondary Confucius Institute partnerships as well as Chinese media outlets.
	""It is now fashionable in some quarters to say that say that standing up for human rights is anti-Chinese racism and that denouncing Chinese state bullying is paternalistic,"" said O'Toole.
	""When a dictatorship starts having so much influence, to the point that protecting Canadian citizens on Canadian soil is now an open question for a debate, you know we have a problem.""
	Trudeau told O'Toole during question period that Canadian security agencies are actively protecting Canadians from foreign influence and interference.
	""Not all of it appears in the newspapers. On the contrary, a lot of the work that is done in important situations is never heard of at all,"" Trudeau said.
	The prime minister also said the government is working with Canadian universities, industry partners and national security agencies to protect research projects from threats.
	""We will always protect data and intellectual property, advance science and ensure that international research partnerships are always beneficial to Canadians,"" said Trudeau.
	Champagne told reporters after a Monday night cabinet meeting that the government takes reports of Chinese foreign intimidation seriously and that he is working with Public Safety Minister Bill Blair, the RCMP and the Canadian Security Intelligence Service to address it.
	""Our security and intelligence community, including CSIS and the RCMP, are actively investigating threats of foreign interference and espionage, and where the evidence exists, we will take action,"" Blair said Tuesday.
	O'Toole acknowledged there could be an economic cost to Canada taking his proposed harder line against China, but he played down the potential effects.
	Asked whether his party's action would expose Kovrig and Spavor to reprisals from their Chinese captors, he blamed Trudeau for not doing enough to secure their release.
	""I think about the two Michaels every day, and I think many Canadians do,"" he said.

              Trump's transition sabotage threatens vaccine rollout

        ","
                  Tuesday, Nov. 17, 2020
                ",https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/coronavirus/trump-s-transition-sabotage-threatens-vaccine-rollout-1.5192279,"
	U.S. President Donald Trump's refusal to coordinate with President-elect Joe Biden on the critical COVID-19 vaccine is bringing a staggering possibility into clearer view: that an outgoing U.S. commander in chief is actively working to sabotage his successor.
	Trump's denial of his election defeat, his lies about nonexistent mass coordinated voter fraud and his strangling of the rituals of transferring power between administrations are not just democracy-damaging aberrations.
	Given the current national emergency, they threaten to cause practical fallout that could damage Biden's incoming White House not just in a political sense.
	There are increasing concerns that Trump's obstruction will slow and complicate the delivery of the vaccine that brings the tantalizing prospect of a return to normal life amid stunning news from trials showing doses are effective in stopping more than 90% of coronavirus infections.
	The distribution operation will be a massively complex and historic public vaccination effort targeting hundreds of millions of Americans -- many millions of whom have resisted following basic safety protocols like wearing masks because Trump has encouraged them not to.
	The inoculation campaign will require a high level of public trust and will involve sharp ethical debates among officials about who should get the vaccine first. The entire program could be damaged if it is politicized. But unless something changes, the Biden team may face the task of tackling those issues afresh, in a frantic catch-up operation.
	It's not just on the vaccine where Trump is threatening the success of the next administration. Attacks by the president and aides on governors stepping into his leadership vacuum as the pandemic rips across all 50 states mean the situation Biden will inherit will be worse than it needed to be.
	The victims of this neglect will be thousands of Americans whom health experts expect to die or get sick in the absence of a coordinated national response to the winter spike in infections and workers caught up in new restrictions imposed on business by local leaders trying to get the virus under control -- as well as the millions of schoolchildren who are already falling behind while classrooms remain shuttered.
	""More people may die if we don't coordinate,"" Biden warned bluntly on Monday, stepping up his pressure for Trump to recognize his defeat in the election and impending exit from office.
	Unlike Trump, who is wallowing in his sense of personal grievance and fury at what he sees as a humiliating loss, Biden does have a sense of urgency and new proposals, and he is calling for a coordinated national effort to mitigate the harrowing impact of the nationwide spike in infections.
	But while he has the moral standing of an election win, he has no power to implement his plans until Inauguration Day on January 20.
CNN reported on Monday that Trump has no intention of abandoning his false attacks on the election to initiate an orderly transition process or to accept that Biden is the rightful next president.
	Instead, his legal challenges, which have made little headway in the courts, seem expressly aimed at boosting conspiracy theories among his supporters and preserving his hold on the Republican Party, and ultimately to cast Biden's tenure as illegitimate. The failure of many GOP leaders in Washington, who remain hostage to Trump's political base, to unequivocally refer to Biden as President-elect or to rebuke Trump for his undemocratic conduct are only further undermining the next administration.
	Two weeks after the election, it remains surreal and extraordinary that the president is refusing to accept Biden's victory, which matched the 306 Electoral College votes that he himself stacked up in 2016. That he would act in such a way in the middle of a grave national crisis, with 246,000 Americans already dead from Covid-19 and millions out of work, is an even more revealing glimpse into the mind of a President who has consistently prioritized his own goals and gratification over a traditional view of the national interest.
	It is not unusual for there to be animosity between outgoing and incoming administrations, especially when a president has been ejected from office. The transition from President Herbert Hoover to President-elect Franklin Roosevelt in 1932-33 -- in the middle of another crisis, the Great Depression -- was notoriously prickly.
	Many White House teams have used their rule-making power to frustrate the policy-making goals of administrations of the opposite party. Trump is already taking things a step further. Military commanders expect orders in the coming days from the commander in chief to begin significant drawdowns in Iraq and Afghanistan to be completed by January 15, CNN's Barbara Starr reported on Monday. If there are consequences from such a move -- like a collapse of the Afghan government under a Taliban resurgence -- it will be up to Biden to deal with the fallout.
	There are also expectations that the President will take steps in foreign policy, including stiffened tariffs on China or strengthened sanctions on Iran, that will further trim the next White House's negotiating room.
	The New York Times reported Monday that the president sought options to strike Iran after his ""maximum pressure"" policy failed to rein in its nuclear program. Such action would make it almost impossible for Biden to revive the Obama administration's agreement with Tehran and international powers. But the report said advisers had dissuaded Trump from triggering attacks that could spark a wider conflict and undercut one of his proudest legacy achievements: avoiding new Middle East wars.
	And in another apparent attempt to complicate the next administration's quest to lessen America's dependence on fossil fuels, the White House on Monday solicited tenders for oil and gas drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.
	In recent years, presidents of both parties have prioritized a peaceful and effective transfer of power over personal political pique, recognizing their duty to secure the health, security and welfare of the American people.
	Warm letters of welcome left in the Oval Office desk -- for instance, from President George H.W. Bush to Bill Clinton -- have become the norm. George W. Bush's team showed deference to incoming President Barack Obama during the 2008 financial crisis.
	The 44th President then ordered his team to make life as easy as possible for Trump's incoming White House -- a fact Michelle Obama recalled in a tartly worded Instagram post Monday: ""I was hurt and disappointed -- but the votes had been counted and Donald Trump had won. ... My husband and I instructed our staffs to do what George and Laura Bush had done for us: run a respectful, seamless transition of power -- one of the hallmarks of American democracy.""
	So the current President's behavior, apparently motivated by fury over his defeat and a conspiratorial belief that the probe into his team's suspicious and multiple links to Russians was part of a plot to render his presidency illegitimate, is a stark departure from recent norms.
	Ironically, Trump's mood, characterized by wild tweets divorced from any factual anchor, is detracting from his administration's own undeniable achievement in shepherding the swift development of vaccines.
	Early data released Monday found that the Moderna vaccine currently in trials is 94.5% effective against the coronavirus. This followed news that Pfizer's vaccine was more than 90% effective. The news brought the prospect of a return to normal life and economic activity in 2021.
	One of Trump's few recent references to the worsening pandemic was a tweet on Monday in which he demanded that historians recognize his role in the vaccine breakthroughs.
	The president has ordered government agencies not to offer the traditional cooperation with the incoming administration or to allow the release of millions of dollars in funding, office space in agencies and briefings from government officials.
	Biden initially reacted with circumspection to the move, apparently eager not to further antagonize Trump as the president comes to terms with his dashed hopes of winning a second term. But increasingly, the president-elect is warning of the damage caused by the impasse and is highlighting the vaccine in particular.
	""The sooner we have access to the administration's distribution plan, the sooner this transition would be smoothly moved forward,"" Biden said in Wilmington, Delaware, on Monday.
	While the nation's top infectious disease specialist, Dr. Anthony Fauci, has said the vaccine could begin to be administered to high-priority patients like health care workers and the elderly in December, it will likely be at least April until it is available to most Americans.
	""Transitions are important, and if you don't have a smooth transition, you would not optimize whatever efforts you're doing right now,"" Fauci told CNN's Jim Sciutto on ""Newsroom"" Tuesday morning, comparing the task to a ""relay race in which you're passing the baton and you don't want to slow down what you're doing, but you want the person to whom you're giving the baton to be running with it as opposed to stopping and starting all over again.""
	Dr. Luciana Borio, a member of Biden's COVID-19 advisory board, told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on Monday night that obstruction from the administration on the vaccine could have a serious impact on its eventual distribution.
	""It's very important to know what are the timelines for manufacturing the vaccines,"" Borio said. ""This is not going to be easy; this is a complex task.""
	But Oregon Democratic Gov. Kate Brown told CNN's Jake Tapper that during a call between state leaders and the White House coronavirus task force on Monday, Vice President Mike Pence made no mention of transferring responsibility for vaccine distribution.
	""The Vice President clearly articulated a strategy for distributing the vaccines across the country,"" Brown said. ""But the conversation was extremely disingenuous when we have a new administration coming in in a matter of weeks. There was no conversation about what the hand-off was going to be and how they were going to ensure that the Biden-Harris administration would be fully prepared and ready to accept the baton."""

	Frenchman Vince Reffet, part of the ""Jetman"" team which has performed groundbreaking stunts above Dubai using jetpacks and carbon-fibre wings, was killed in a training accident Tuesday, a spokesman said.
	The Jetmen have pulled off a series of dramatic flights over the Gulf city, soaring in tandem above the world's tallest building Burj Khalifa and alongside an Emirates Airbus A380, the world's largest commercial airliner.
	""It is with unimaginable sadness that we announce the passing of Jetman Pilot, Vincent (Vince) Reffet, who died this morning, 17 November, during training in Dubai,"" Jetman Dubai spokesman Abdulla Binhabtoor told AFP.
	Aged 36, ""Vince was a talented athlete, and a much-loved and respected member of our team. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family and all those who knew and worked with him.""
	The accident, which happened at Reffet's Jetman base in the desert outside the city, is now under investigation.
	""We are working closely with all relevant authorities,"" Binhabtoor said.
	Reffet's exploits went viral earlier this year, with video of him taking off from the ground and climbing to 1,800 metres (nearly 6,000 feet) over Dubai's waterfront, in a feat reminiscent of Marvel's ""Iron Man"" and hailed as a world first.
	The Frenchman hovered five metres above the waters of Dubai's coast before shooting off into the air and skimming the city's skyline.
	The Jetmen had previously launched themselves into the air by jumping down from high platforms.
	Reffet's carbon fibre wings are powered by four mini jet engines. The equipment, which is controlled by the pilot's movements, is capable of reaching speeds of 400 kilometres (250 miles) per hour.
	The Jetman team also includes fellow Frenchman Fred Fugen and Emirati pilot Ahmed Alshehhi.
	Last year, Reffet and Fugen also flew through the famed ""Heaven's Gate"" archway in the mountains of China's Hunan province."

              Danish government gets backing for plan to cull minks

              The Danish government said Tuesday that a majority in parliament backed its decision to cull the country's 15 million minks over concerns about a mutated version of the virus that has spread among the animals.

                ",https://www.ctvnews.ca/world/danish-government-gets-backing-for-plan-to-cull-minks-1.5191991,"COPENHAGEN -- 
	The Danish government said Tuesday that a majority in parliament backed its decision to cull the country's 15 million minks over concerns about a mutated version of the virus that has spread among the animals.
	The government had announced the cull despite not having the right to order the killing of healthy animals, an embarrassing misstep that caused it to scramble to build political consensus for a new law.
	The one-party Social Democratic, minority government made a deal late Monday with four left-leaning and centre parties to support a law proposal that would allow for the culling of all mink, including those outside northern Denmark where infections have been found. The law proposal also bans mink farming until the end of 2021.
	""There is now an agreement that will take care of that,"" Mogens Jensen, the agriculture minister, told parliament. ""I would like to apologize to the Danish mink breeders that it was not made clear that there was no legal basis.""
	It was unclear when a parliamentary vote would take place.
	The mutated version of the coronavirus found among the mink can be transmitted to people, though there is no evidence so far that it is more dangerous or resistant to vaccines. Earlier this month, authorities said that 11 people were sickened by it.
	According to official figures, 283 farms have recorded infections and 265 have had their animals culled. On top of that more than 200 people in six mink pelting companies have tested positive, Danish authorities said Tuesday.
	The government began last month killing farmed minks and later announced that all minks in the country should be culled, though it did not yet have the legal basis for it.
	In a separate session in Parliament, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen once again apologized. She said the government had not been not aware that there was no legal basis for its decision. ""I do not mean to disregard the law,"" she said.
	The centre-right opposition asked why the government didn't stop the culling of healthy animals when it realized it did not have a legal right. Jakob Ellemann-Jensen, head of the largest opposition party, the Liberals, called the lack of a legal basis ""a scandal"" and said the government ""deliberately had run a red light.""
	There are 1,139 mink farms in Denmark, employing about 6,000 people, according to the industry. They account for 40% of global mink fur production and are the world's biggest exporter. Most exports go to China and Hong Kong.
	Lawmakers have not yet reached a deal on how to compensate breeders.
	On Monday, Denmark also ordered the culling of 25,000 chickens after bird flu was found on a farm in northern Denmark and wild bird populations. The H5N8 bird flu has been registered in several locations across Europe in recent months but has not been found to infect humans.
	As a result, Denmark's poultry and egg exports to countries outside the European Union is stopping for at least three months."

China positions rocket ahead of ambitious lunar mission

China on Tuesday moved a massive rocket into place in preparation for launching a mission to bring back materials from the moon for the first time in four decades.

	China on Tuesday moved a massive rocket into place in preparation for launching a mission to bring back materials from the moon for the first time in four decades.
	The Long March-5 was transported by tractor from its hangar to the nearby launch site at the space base in Wenchang along the coast of the southern island province of Hainan.
	The Chang'e 5 mission it will carry is scheduled to launch early next week, placing a lander on the moon that will drill 2 metres (almost 7 feet) beneath the surface and scoop up rocks and other debris to be brought to earth. That would allow scientists to study newly obtained lunar materials for the fist time since the American and Russian missions of the 1960s and 1970s.
	The mission, named for the Chinese moon goddess, is among China's most ambitious as its space program continues to build steam since it first put a man in space in 2003, becoming only the third nation to do so after the U.S. and Russia.
	China currently has a mission on the way to Mars, along with a rover on the moon's far side that is providing the first full measurements of radiation exposure from the lunar surface, information vital for any country that plans to send astronauts to the moon.
	China has increasingly engaged with foreign countries on missions, although U.S. law still prevents collaboration with NASA, excluding China from partnering with the International Space Station. That has prompted China to work on its own space station and launch its own programs that have put it in a steady competition with Japan and India among Asian nations seeking to notch new achievements in space.
	The space program has progressed cautiously, with relatively few setbacks in recent years. The Long March-5, nicknamed ""Fat 5"" because of its bulky shape, failed on a previous launch attempt, but China's enormous pool of technical and engineering talent appears to have allowed it to overcome most obstacles."

              Wikipedia was source of security concern questions for Meng: Border officer
          
","
              A border officer who examined Meng Wanzhou at Vancouver's airport before her arrest says the Huawei executive was ""calm and open"" until he turned to questions about security concerns surrounding the company's products.

	A border officer who examined Meng Wanzhou at Vancouver's airport before her arrest says the Huawei executive was ""calm and open"" until he turned to questions about security concerns surrounding the company's products.
	Sanjit Dhillon was an acting superintendent with Canada Border Services Agency in December 2018 when Meng was detained for three hours then arrested by the RCMP.
	Meng is facing extradition to the United States on fraud charges. Meng and Huawei deny the allegations she lied to HSBC, putting the bank at risk of violating American sanctions against Iran.
	""At the beginning she was calm and open. When I started asking questions specifically about the security concerns regarding her company she got a little closed off,"" Dhillon said.
	Dhillon testified at an evidentiary hearing Monday in B.C. Supreme Court where Meng's lawyers are trying to gather evidence to support their argument that she was subject to an abuse of process. Her legal team alleges RCMP and border officials co-ordinated their actions to obtain evidence against her before her arrest.
	Dhillon was not the border officer leading the examination but as a superior, he said he sometimes steps in when he believes he can help.
	Court documents have previously shown that he questioned Meng about Huawei's activity in Iran.
	Before Meng's plane landed, Dhillon said she was flagged in an internal database for an outstanding warrant in her name.
	Anticipating her arrival, Dhillon testified he found a Wikipedia page about Huawei that said the company doesn't operate in the United States because of security concerns and that Huawei was suspected of violating U.S. economic sanctions with Iran.
	Dhillon said he stepped in when Meng asked why she was being held for so long.
	""I interjected and asked specific questions to Ms. Meng about her company and also what I found during the open-source query,"" Dhillon testified. ""I wanted to further the examination.""
	The purpose of the customs and immigration exam was to determine Meng's admissibility to Canada, which could be affected by possible criminality or national security concerns, he said.
	Dhillon asked Meng what she did. She said she was the chief financial officer of a global telecommunications company, he told the court.
	He asked where the company did business. When she listed countries without including the United States he asked her why.
	""She said we don't sell our products in the United States,"" Dhillon said.
	He asked if there was a reason why and Meng responded she didn't know. Dhillon said he then reframed the question.
	""Since she's the chief financial officer of this telecommunications company, I would assume that she would know why her company isn't able to sell its products in one of the most lucrative markets in the world,"" Dhillon said.
	""She was quiet. She didn't respond right away. And eventually she said there was a security concern with the product the U.S. government had.""
	He testified Meng didn't say what those concerns were.
	Dhillon said his questions were based on his own online search and he was not directed by anyone to ask her questions.
	Dhillon is the fourth witness to testify in the evidence hearings. Meng's legal team will argue next year that Canadian officials gathered evidence under the pretence of a routine immigration exam and kept intentionally poor notes.
	Supt. Bryce McRae, a colleague of Dhillon's, testified Monday that at no point was he instructed to avoid taking notes.
	McRae also denied an allegation by Meng's defence lawyer Mona Duckett that he ""fabricated"" part of his testimony regarding instructions he received from the border agency's national security unit.
	McRae said he phoned the unit for guidance and was provided a series of questions to ask Meng, including where her residences are around the world.
	He shared the questions orally with at least one of the border officers in the examination room but did not write them down, he said.
	""I suggest that when you spoke to (her) she informed you you should shut down this exam,"" said Duckett.
	""I don't recall ever receiving that information,"" McRae responded.
	Duckett pointed to McRae's notes, which recorded the calls to the unit as happening after an officer questioned Meng about her homes.
	""I suggest ... your evidence about the advice you received is an entire fabrication,"" said Duckett.
	McRae denied the suggestion.
	He told the court that officers under his supervision would have had their own questions for Meng and would not have solely relied on guidance from the national security unit.
	Since Meng's arrest, relations between Canada and China have eroded, and China's arrest of Canadians Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor are widely considered to be retaliation for her detention.

              Facebook, Twitter CEOs to be pressed on U.S. election handling

              The CEOs of Facebook and Twitter are being summoned before Congress to defend their handling of disinformation in the 2020 U.S. presidential election, even as lawmakers questioning them are deeply divided over the election's integrity and results.

	The CEOs of Facebook and Twitter are being summoned before Congress to defend their handling of disinformation in the 2020 presidential election, even as lawmakers questioning them are deeply divided over the election's integrity and results.
	Prominent Republican senators have refused to knock down President Donald Trump's unfounded claims of voting irregularities and fraud, even as misinformation disputing Democrat Joe Biden's victory has flourished online.
	Sen. Lindsey Graham, a close Trump ally who heads the Senate Judiciary Committee to which the CEOs will testify Tuesday, has publicly urged, ""Do not concede, Mr. President. Fight hard.""
	Both Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg and Twitter's Jack Dorsey promised lawmakers last month that they would aggressively guard their platforms from being manipulated by foreign governments or used to incite violence around the election results -- and they followed through with high-profile steps that angered Trump and his supporters.
	Twitter and Facebook have both slapped a misinformation label on some content from Trump, most notably his assertions linking voting by mail to fraud. On Monday, Twitter flagged Trump's tweet proclaiming ""I won the Election!"" with this note: ""Official sources called this election differently.""
	Facebook also moved two days after the election to ban a large group called ""Stop the Steal"" that Trump supporters were using to organize protests against the vote count. The 350,000-member group echoed Trump's baseless allegations of a rigged election rendering the results invalid.
	For days after the election as the vote counting went on, copycat ""Stop the Steal"" groups were easily found on Facebook, with one nearing 12,000 members as of last week. As of Monday, Facebook appeared to have made them harder to find, though it was still possible to locate them, including some groups with thousands of members.
	Facebook didn't immediately respond to a request for information on its specific actions currently toward such groups.
	Warily eyeing how the companies wield their power to filter speech and ideas, Trump and the Republicans accuse the social media companies of anti-conservative bias. Democrats also criticize them, though for different reasons. The result is that both parties are interested in stripping away some of the protections that have shielded tech companies from legal responsibility for what people post on their platforms. Biden has heartily endorsed such an action.
	But it's the actions that companies have taken around the election that are likely to be a dominant focus at Tuesday's hearing.
	The GOP majority on the Judiciary panel threatened Zuckerberg and Dorsey with subpoenas last month if they didn't agree to voluntarily testify for Tuesday's hearing. Republicans on the Senate Commerce Committee lambasted the two CEOs and Sundar Pichai, Google's chief executive, at a hearing last month for what they said was a pattern of silencing conservative viewpoints while giving free rein to political actors from countries like China and Iran.
	Despite fears over security in the run-up to Nov. 3 and social media companies bracing for the worst, the election turned out to be the most secure in U.S. history, federal and state officials from both parties say -- repudiating Trump's unsubstantiated claims of fraud.
	Facebook insists that it has learned its lesson from the 2016 election and is no longer a conduit for misinformation, voter suppression and election disruption. This fall Facebook said it removed a small network of accounts and pages linked to Russia's Internet Research Agency, the ""troll factory"" that has used social media accounts to sow political discord in the U.S. since the 2016 election. Twitter suspended five related accounts.
	But critical outsiders, as well as some of Facebook's own employees, say the company's efforts to tighten its safeguards remain insufficient, despite it having spent billions.
	""Facebook only acts if they feel there's a threat to their reputation or their bottom line,"" says Imran Ahmed, CEO of the Center for Countering Digital Hate. The organization had pressed Facebook to take down the ""Stop the Steal"" group.
	There's no evidence that the social media giants are biased against conservative news, posts or other material, or that they favour one side of political debate over another, researchers have found. But criticism of the companies' policies, and their handling of disinformation tied to the election, has come from Democrats as well as Republicans.
	Democrats have focused their criticism mainly on hate speech, misinformation and other content that can incite violence, keep people from voting or spread falsehoods about the coronavirus. They criticize the tech CEOs for failing to police content, blaming the platforms for playing a role in hate crimes and the rise of white nationalism in the U.S. And that criticism has extended to their efforts to stamp out false information related to the election.
	If you thought disinformation on Facebook was a problem during our election, just wait until you see how it is shredding the fabric of our democracy in the days after,"" Biden spokesman Bill Russo tweeted.

              Canadian manufacturers, supply chain gearing up for distribution of future COVID-19 vaccine
          
","
              With a second large pharmaceutical company announcing promising trial results for a potential COVID-19 vaccine, one Canadian company is gearing up to pitch in to the logistical challenges of storing millions of doses in hyper-cold temperatures.

	With a second large pharmaceutical company announcing promising trial results for a potential COVID-19 vaccine, Canadian companies are gearing up to pitch in to the logistical challenges of storing millions of doses in hyper-cold temperatures.
	Guelph, Ont.-based Danby, maker of compact appliances such as fridges, freezers, microwaves, and air conditioners, will soon announce the production of a new line of -80 C freezers, company CEO and owner Jim Estill told CTVNews.ca in a phone interview.
	He said the company is finalizing specifications and will officially announce the new line next week. He said full production will take about 120 days, âwhich is not out of line with the timing of the need.â Â 
	Estill expects super-cold storage will be required in hospitals, pharmacies and courier hubs across Canada to handle an estimated 70 million vials of vaccines that require two doses for each recipient.
	360 Medical, which provides cold storage equipment to labs, clinics, hospitals and pharmacies, is seeing a âmassive increase in demandâ for -80 C freezers, president Paul Greco told CTVNews.ca in a phone interview.
	The Schomberg, Ont.-based distributer is fielding inquiries from doctorâs offices, hospitals and the Red Cross, he said.
	The freezers range from about $8,500 to $20,000, but Greco says even small units can hold about 20,000 doses.
	360 Medicalâs supplier Haier Biomedical, which is based in China, has reassured that supply of hyper-cold storage equipment wonât be an issue, said Greco.
	Moderna made headlines Monday with its reports that preliminary clinical trial data of its vaccine candidate show 94.5 per cent effectiveness in preventing COVID-19.
	Last week, competitor Pfizer Inc. announced similar results for its vaccine candidate.
	Both companies are developing what are called mRNA vaccines, a new technology that doesnât include any of the coronavirus itself, but instead contains a piece of genetic code that trains the immune system to recognize the virus. Both need cold storage, but the requirements vary.
	âmRNA vaccines are essentially brand new, but they are the vaccines of the future. The need now is for the coronavirus, but it will be used for other vaccines, too,â said Estill.
	Moderna and Pfizer both said they would seek permission for emergency use from U.S. regulators within weeks.
	The news provides some hope while COVID-19 cases surge in Canada, the U.S. and many parts of the world. But the challenge of producing and distributing a future vaccine to millions in this large country with a highly dispersed population looms large.
	Never mind that every country in the world will be vying for vaccine supply at the same time.
	Moderna president Dr. Stephen Hoge said Monday that âmany vaccinesâ will be needed to meet global demand.
	Canada has signed deals with seven vaccine developers, including Pfizer and Moderna, to reserve millions of doses of approved vaccines.
	Purolator CEO John Ferguson said Canada has the necessary supply chain infrastructure in place to handle the challenge and his company is ready, too, to deliver a vaccine to hospitals, clinics, pharmacies, and long-term care facilities.
	âWe are used to shipping across Canada to every nook and cranny, every city, every suburb and every rural area,â he said in a phone interview from Toronto.
	âThis is on a big scale but I feel confident Canada is in good shape.â
	Extreme cold storage will be required at central distribution hubs, where vaccine vials may stay for days or weeks. But during the âlast mileâ courier delivery that Purolator specializes in, temperatures can be maintained by ice packs, dry ice or other packaging, said Ferguson.
	The distribution system is already in place to handle flu vaccines and other immunizations, along with a wide range of time-sensitive cancer therapeutics and other drugs, said Ferguson.
	Distributing a COVID-19 vaccine will build on that experience, with Purolator adding dedicated workers, equipment and trucks.
	âThis is going to take governments, manufacturers and supply chain all pulling together to make sure this is done right.â
	Danby, which has been in operation in Canada since 1947 and also owns a subsidiary in the United States, launched a medical refrigerator last year and has been ramping up its engineering since the emergence of COVID-19, said Estill.
	âWe are pulling out all the stops. Itâs a top priority of the company,â said Estill, who has owned Danby since 2015.
	âThis can make a very meaningful impact in the world. A vaccine is no good if it canât be distributed or stored.â
	Danby has also pivoted into building ventilators in partnership with Canadian medical device maker Baylis Medical, and has built about 6,500 of an intended 10,000. The company has also donated 500 UV-light air purifiers to the Toronto District School Board.
	An ongoing challenge of production geared to COVID-19 response is securing the necessary components, which are in short supply, said Estill.
	Danbyâs first hyper-cold freezer will be about 10 cubic feet, or roughly half the size of a large consumer chest freezer, and will cost C$10,000. That size will be easily shipped and will plug in to a normal wall outlet, said Estill, but future production will include a range of sizes.
	âThe complexity of building an -80 C freezer is massively huge. Itâs not at all a simple freezer, but we make half a million freezers a year, so we can do it.â
	To compare how cold that is, Health Canada recommends that home freezers be set at -18 C or lower to keep food safe. Dry ice, which is solid state carbon dioxide, also freezes to a temperature of -80 C. Touching items frozen at those temperatures with bare hands for more than a second or so can result in frostbite that could require hospital treatment.
	Pfizer Canada spokesperson Christina Antoniou said in a statement provided to CTVNews.ca that the company is âworking with urgencyâ with governments, and public health authorities to âdetermine the logistics of the vaccine distribution in Canada, pending regulatory approval.â
	She said the company will manufacture a vaccine at multiple sites in the U.S. and Europe and will transport on a âjust in timeâ system.
	âFor Canada, our distribution approach will be to largely ship from our manufacturing sites direct to the point of use.â
	Pfizer will use dry ice in to maintain storage temperatures for up to 15 days, along with GPS-enabled thermal sensors in each âthermal shipperâ that can be tracked at each stage of delivery.
	âThese GPS-enabled devices will allow Pfizer to proactively prevent unwanted deviations and act before they happen,â she wrote.
	Depending on their formulation, vaccines could have different storage requirements.
	Moderna says its COVID-19 vaccine candidate can be stored at normal refrigerator temperatures (2 C to 8 C) for up to 30 days and at -20 C for up to six months. Itâs also stable at room temperature for up to 12 hours, company data has shown.
	Pfizerâs candidate will require long-term deep freeze, says the company. That has led to a run on ultra-cold freezers in the U.S., but is raising concerns that rural hospitals wonât be able to afford the units, which cost up to US$15,000 each.Â 
Medical news site STAT says the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has advised state health departments against purchasing ultra-cold freezers, with the idea that other vaccines with less demanding storage requirements will be available soon.Â "

              Internal email reveals 65 virus cases among WHO Geneva staff
          
","
              The World Health Organization has recorded 65 cases of the coronavirus among staff based at its headquarters, including five people who worked on the premises and were in contact with one another, an internal email obtained by The Associated Press shows.

	The World Health Organization has recorded 65 cases of the coronavirus among staff based at its headquarters, including five people who worked on the premises and were in contact with one another, an internal email obtained by The Associated Press shows.
	The U.N. health agency said it is investigating how and where the five people became infected -- and that it has not determined whether transmission happened at its offices. WHO's confirmation Monday of the figures in the email was the first time it has publicly provided such a count.
	""To my knowledge, the cluster being investigated is the first evidence of potential transmission on the site of WHO,"" Dr. Michael Ryan, the agency's chief of emergencies, told reporters Monday after the AP reported on the internal email.
	The email said about half of the infections recorded so far were in people who had been working from home. But 32 were in staff who had been working on premises at the headquarters building, where more than 2,000 people usually work and the agency says it has put in place strict hygiene, screening and other prevention measures.
	In the email, which was sent to staff on Friday, Raul Thomas, who heads business operations at WHO, noted that five people -- four on the same team and one who had contact with them-- had tested positive for COVID-19. That could indicate that basic infection control and social distancing procedures in place may have been broken.
	""We have had some cases that have been associated with the premises. We do have some cases in the last week that are linked together,"" Maria Van Kerkhove, WHO's technical lead on COVID-19, confirmed Monday.
	Of the linked cases, she added: ""There are possible ways in which they were infected outside of the premises. So we're still doing the epidemiologic investigation with that.""
	Two weeks ago, Van Kerkhove had said there had been no transmission at headquarters to that point but added that the agency was monitoring it. WHO, which is co-ordinating the global response to the pandemic, had previously said that staffers had been infected but never provided a number or details.
	""As per standard protocols, these colleagues are receiving the necessary medical attention and are recovering at home,"" the email Friday said. ""These last five cases bring the total reported number of affected members of the Geneva based workforce to 65 since the beginning of the pandemic.""
	According to the email, 49 of the overall cases had occurred in the last eight weeks, ""thus very much in line with the situation being reported in Geneva and the surrounding areas."" He added that ""a higher number of cases among those who telework might have gone unreported."" The timing of the other 16 cases was not clear.
	The revelation comes amid a surge of cases in Europe, host country Switzerland, and the city of Geneva, in particular.
	The email did not specify who was infected, but a WHO staffer with direct knowledge of the situation who spoke on condition of anonymity because she was not authorized to speak to the press said the five linked cases included a member of the WHO director-general's leadership team who is also an infection control specialist.
	Thomas' email was sent after other WHO officials raised concerns that people who had been in contact with the group were still working in the Geneva building and potentially exposing others to COVID-19, the staffer said.
	The senior manager reportedly held several in-person meetings at WHO in early November before testing positive last week. The person, contacted by the AP, referred all comments to the WHO media office.
	""We have not yet established whether transmission occurred on campus, but are looking into the matter,"" Farah Dakhlallah, a WHO spokeswoman, said in an email to the AP.
	WHO has faced repeated criticism of its handling of the pandemic. U.S. President Donald Trump accused the U.N. agency of ""colluding"" with China to hide the extent of the initial outbreak. In June, the AP found WHO publicly lauded China for its speed and transparency, even though private meetings showed WHO officials frustrated that the country sat on releasing critical outbreak information.
	The email obtained by the AP said enhanced measures to ""reduce our risk profile"" were being considered.
	""Finally, members of the workforce are reminded that physical meetings, including gatherings in common areas or in the cafeteria, are strongly discouraged and should only take place where absolutely necessary,"" it added.
	Elsewhere in Geneva, restaurants are among many public venues that have been closed to prevent the spread of COVID-19.
	Last month, Thomas told WHO staffers the agency was restricting access to its Geneva headquarters to critical staffers, including senior directors, their assistants and management officers. ""All members for the workforce are reminded to always keep proper hand hygiene, respect physical distancing standards (at least one meter) and wear masks, when distancing is not possible,"" he wrote.
	In normal times, an estimated 2,400 people regularly work at WHO's seven-story headquarters overlooking Geneva. As the pandemic has swelled in the area, staffers have been encouraged to work from home when possible. Non-staff visitors have been required to wear masks, and access to the building has been curtailed.
	And ahead of WHO's weeklong meeting of its member states last week -- which was mostly virtual -- staffers were told in an internal email to take extra precautions, including mask-wearing in public places.
	On Monday, from a vast meeting room at the headquarters, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus and other officials were participating in a session of the agency's latest executive board meeting, which was largely conducted by video conference. He was returning from a two-week self-quarantine at home after coming into contact with a person who tested positive. Because Tedros did not show any symptoms himself, he was not tested for COVID-19 but stayed at home out of an abundance of caution.

	French President Emmanuel Macron held a closed-door, low-key meeting Monday with U.S. President Donald Trump's top diplomat, a delicate tip-toe around the ticklish fact that France has already recognized President-elect Joe Biden as the U.S. election winner.
	The zero fanfare welcome for U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, a Trump loyalist, at the presidential Elysee Palace was in itself indicative of how Macron's government is already looking ahead to the Biden era.
	No press conferences were held, depriving journalists of an opportunity to ask Macron's office, his Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian or Pompeo about whether they discussed their conflicting interpretations of the U.S. election result. Unusually, Le Drian met Pompeo at the Elysee Palace, rather than his own office.
	Macron's office described Pompeo's stop as a âcourtesyâ visit. The State Department said Pompeo and Macron âdiscussed âsignificant threats to global security, efforts to counter violent extremism, Iran's destabilizing behaviour, and Hezbollah's malign influence in Lebanon.â It said Pompeo had also stressed the importance of transatlantic alliance, NATO unity and countering China's increasing global influence.
	Pompeo tweeted a photo of himself wearing a Stars and Stripes face mask in the meeting with âmy good friendâ Le Drian and said they had an âimportant discussion.â
	âThere is no challenge we cannot conquer when the U.S.-France Transatlantic relationship is strong,â he tweeted.
	The State Department said Pompeo and Le Drian had covered a range of topics, including NATO, stabilization efforts for Libya and Africa's Sahel region and what a statement described as âour strong alliance in countering the Chinese Communist Party's malign activity in Europe.â The nature of the alleged activity wasn't detailed.
	Still, it wasn't clear why Pompeo came so far in the midst of the pandemic and for so long, on a three-day stop in Paris that is largely locked down because of a surge of coronavirus cases, for such a low-visibility outcome.
	Officials in Pompeo's team said French authorities told them that no press access was possible due to concerns over the pandemic.
	Pompeo appeared last week to cast doubt on Trump's election defeat, speaking instead of â a smooth transition to a second Trump administration.â
	Macron last week spoke by phone with Biden to congratulate him.
	Before meeting Macron and Le Drian, Pompeo laid a bouquet of red, white and blue flowers at a memorial to victims of terrorism at a Paris landmark, the Hotel des Invalides.
	The ceremony lasted about a minute.
	âThe United States stands with France. We mourn the victims, pray for their families, and condemn in the strongest terms these senseless attacks against innocent French citizens.â Pompeo tweeted.
	From Paris, Pompeo travelled on to Turkey, where he will meet religious leaders in Istanbul but not government officials.
	Senior State Department officials said the lack of official meetings in Turkey was due to scheduling issues during the brief stop. They said meetings had been sought but Turkish officials were unable to come to Istanbul from the capital of Ankara during the time Pompeo will be there. The officials noted that Pompeo and his Turkish counterpart plan to see each other in early December at a meeting of NATO foreign ministers.
	Pompeo's stop in Turkey will focus on promoting religious freedom and fighting religious persecution, which is a key priority for the U.S. administration, officials said. Pompeo will discuss religious issues with the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople Bartholomew I, considered the âfirst among equalsâ in the Orthodox world, and with the apostolic nuncio to Turkey, Archbishop Paul Russell.
	Later stops on the tour will include visits to Israeli settlements in the West Bank that have been avoided by previous secretaries of state.

              Beijing blasts Bob Rae after ambassador calls for UN to investigate genocide claims
          
","
              The Chinese government is firing back at Canada's ambassador to the United Nations for calling on the UN to investigate whether China's persecution of ethnic Muslim Uighurs in its Xinjiang province is a genocide.

                ",https://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/beijing-blasts-bob-rae-after-ambassador-calls-for-un-to-investigate-genocide-claims-1.5190566,"OTTAWA -- 
	The Chinese government is firing back at Canada's ambassador to the United Nations for calling on the UN to investigate whether China's persecution of ethnic Muslim Uighurs in its Xinjiang province is a genocide.
	During a news conference Monday in Beijing, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian described Bob Rae's comments as ""ridiculous,"" adding that Canada itself better fits the description of having perpetrated a genocide.
	Rae told the CBC on Sunday that he has asked the UN Human Rights Council to investigate China's treatment of the country's Uighurs in Xinjiang.
	Last month a Canadian parliamentary subcommittee concluded in a report that China's treatment of the Uighurs is a genocide. China rejected that report as baseless.
	China has been accused of using forced birth control to limit Uighur births, and detention camps to indoctrinate the mostly-Muslim minority into mainstream Chinese society. Beijing has denied any wrongdoing, saying it is running a voluntary employment and language-training program.
	Zhao on Monday used a number of select statistics that suggest China's Uighur population is growing at a faster rate than Canada's population to mock Rae's suggestions that the Uighurs are being persecuted.
	""I would like to ask this ambassador, if his logic is plausible in finding out who best fits the label of genocide, it seems that it is not the Uighurs who are persecuted, but rather the people of Canada, am I right?"" Zhao said.
	However, Zhao's statistics appear to have been incomplete or inaccurate and did not address a report by The Associated Press in June that birthrates have been dramatically cut in Uighur-dominated areas of Xinjiang.
	Rae told the CBC on Sunday that ""there's no question that there's aspects of what the Chinese are doing that fits into the definition of genocide in the genocide convention.""
	Yet even as he levelled the allegation, he said an investigation needs to be conducted to gather the required evidence.
	In response, Zhao questioned how Rae ""reached his conclusion without any evidence?""
	Foreign Affairs Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne did not dispute Rae's assertion of a genocide but he would not repeat it either.
	""We have expressed on many occasions that we are gravely concerned about the situation in Xinjiang,"" he said following a cabinet meeting Monday.
	Champagne said he's raised the issue privately and publicly with China's foreign minister and he noted that Canada has joined 38 other countries in calling for experts to go into Xinjiang ""to assess the situation and to report back.""
	""We will stand up, we will speak up whenever we feel it is appropriate,"" Champagne said, maintaining that human rights are a core pillar of Canadian foreign policy.
	""We have done that with respect to Xinjiang. We have done that with respect to Hong Kong more recently and we will continue to do so.""
	Relations between Canada and China are at an all-time low not only because of Beijing's treatment of its Uighurs, but also due to its continued detention of two Canadian citizens in retaliation for the arrest of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou.
	Canada has also joined Western allies in condemning Beijing's recent actions in Hong Kong, where the Communist regime has been accused of violating international agreements by cracking down on democracy in the former British colony.
	Champagne said the government is also taking ""very seriously"" reports that China has sent covert agents to Canada to spy on and intimidate Chinese-Canadians.
	""We are very much seized of that,"" he said, adding that foreign interference ""won't be tolerated.""
	""We are working now with CSIS, with the RCMP, with Minister Blair to come up with a framework to make sure that we can continue to protect Canadians in light of this new threat.""
	At a meeting Monday evening of the Canada-China relations committee, Immigration Minister Marco Mendicino was repeatedly asked by opposition MPs whether Canada has revoked visas for anyone involved in acts of intimidation against Chinese-Canadians.
	He would not answer directly, saying it would be inappropriate to comment on individual cases. But Mendicino did say that conduct that amounts to espionage or interference or a criminal act in Canada is taken seriously by public safety officials.

	A top British diplomat has become a hero in China after video of him rescuing a student from a swollen river racked up tens of millions of views on social media.
	Britain's mission in Chongqing said Monday that Consul General Stephen Ellison leapt into action in nearby Zhongshan at the weekend to save a woman who had fallen into a river coursing through the tourist town.
	""Due to the timely rescue, the woman quickly recovered her breathing and consciousness,"" read the post on the consulate's official Weibo page.
	Ellison, 61, was visiting the town Saturday when he heard a cry from a crowd of people as the woman fell into the water.
	Bystander video footage shared by the consulate and various Chinese media outlets show Ellison, 61, jump fully clothed into the river, where the unnamed woman was struggling to stay afloat.
	Ellison -- by several media accounts an accomplished triathlete -- dragged her to a lifebuoy thrown from the riverbank before dragging the two of them to shore.
	""We are all immensely proud of our Chongqing Consul General,"" the U.K. diplomatic mission in China tweeted Monday.

	The hashtag ""British Consul-General in Chongqing saves female student who fell in the water"" had gained almost 40 million acknowledgements on Weibo by Monday evening as news of Ellison's bravery spread.
	""For a man of such advanced age to save another person from the water in such cold weather, regardless of his own safety, he is a hero and gentleman!"" read one comment, liked nearly 2,000 times.
	""Regardless of our differences... to act heroically is a virtue and should be praised,"" wrote another.
	Ellison took up his post in June after serving as a senior diplomat at the British Embassy in Beijing since 2014.
	U.K.-China ties have been strained this year over the UK's decision to ban Chinese telecoms giant Huawei from its 5G networks, as well as the U.K.'s frequent criticisms of China's human rights record on issues including Hong Kong and Xinjiang."

China signs huge Asia Pacific trade deal with 14 countries

China has just joined forces with more than a dozen countries across the Asia Pacific region to sign a huge free trade deal nearly a decade in the making.

	China has just joined forces with more than a dozen countries across the Asia Pacific region to sign a huge free trade deal nearly a decade in the making.
	The Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership spans 15 countries and 2.2 billion people, or nearly 30% of the world's population, according to a joint statement released by the nations on Sunday, when the deal was signed. Their combined GDP totals roughly $26 trillion and they account for nearly 28% of global trade based on 2019 data.
	The deal includes several of the region's heaviest economic hitters aside from China, including Japan and South Korea. New Zealand and Australia are also partners, as are Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam in Southeast Asia.
	The trade agreement was first proposed in 2012 as a way to create one of the world's largest free-trade zones.
	It's tough to gauge the immediate economic significance of the deal. The members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations â a group of 10 countries that signed the agreement â said that it would eliminate tariffs and quotas on 65% of the goods that are traded in the region.
	The partner countries also noted the importance of the agreement as the world tries to recover from the coronavirus pandemic, saying in a joint statement that the deal ""will play an important role in building the region's resilience through inclusive and sustainable post-pandemic economic recovery process.""
	""Its symbolic value has always exceeded its actual value,"" said William Reinsch, a trade expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies who served for 15 years as president of the National Foreign Trade Council. He pointed out that India opted out of the deal late last year, lessening the importance of the agreement in terms of actual trade.
	Reinsch said, though, that the agreement could have consequences in the long term, and added that China's involvement ""is a sign of its willingness to play a constructive role, despite its aggressive actions in the South China Sea, Hong Kong, and elsewhere.""
	China and Australia, for example, have been caught up in trade disputes lately, but that hasn't stopped them pressing ahead with the RCEP.
	""Both countries see huge benefits from their deeper economic integration with other Asian countries,"" said Murray Hiebert, senior associate of the Southeast Asia Program at CSIS. ""The RCEP could potentially provide Beijing and Canberra another platform where they could discuss and hammer out their differences.""
	Others noted that the deal was further evidence of Asia's growing power. Economists at HSBC said Sunday that the agreement ""signals that Asia keeps pushing ahead with trade liberalization even as other regions have become more skeptical.""
	""It may reinforce a trend that's been already underway for decades: that the global center of economic gravity keeps pushing relentlessly to the East,"" they wrote in a research note.
	It's not clear whether the deal will have an impact on the most important global trading relationship of all: That between the United States and China, who have been fighting over trade and related issues for the last few years.
	""Whether it means a shift in the regional dynamic in favor of China depends on the US response,"" Reinsch said of the new trade deal. He pointed to the importance of the election of Joe Biden, who will succeed President Donald Trump in January.
	""If the U.S. continues to ignore or bully the countries there, the influence pendulum will swing toward China,"" he added. ""If Biden has a credible plan to restore the US presence and influence in the region, then the pendulum could swing back our way.""

              Belgian racing pigeon fetches record price of US$1.9 million
          
","
              A wealthy Chinese fan put down a world record price of 1.6 million euros for the Belgian-bred racing pigeon New Kim.
        ","
                  Sunday, Nov. 15, 2020
                ",https://www.ctvnews.ca/lifestyle/belgian-racing-pigeon-fetches-record-price-of-us-1-9-million-1.5189736,"HALLE, BELGIUM -- 
	New Kim is worth her weight in gold and then some -- actually much, much more.
	A wealthy Chinese pigeon racing fan put down a record price of 1.6 million euros (US$1.9 million) for the Belgian-bred bird, saying a lot more than merely what kind of money can be made in the once-quaint sport, which seemed destined to decline only a few years back.
	During a frantic last half hour Sunday at the end of a two-week auction at the Pipa pigeon centre, two Chinese bidders operating under the pseudonyms Super Duper and Hitman drove up the price by 280,000 euros ($325,000), leaving the previous record that Belgian-bred Armando fetched last year well behind by 350,000 euros ($406,000).
	Super Duper got the hen, and behind the pseudonym is said to be the same wealthy Chinese industrialist who already had Armando, allowing for breeding with the two expensive birds.
	It was proof again that an age-old hobby in Western Europe identified with working-class men now has a new, elitist foreign lease on life. Top breeders relying on generations of family experience can now sell their birds for prices unheard of merely a decade ago, and often China is their destination.
	On this occasion, successful breeder Gaston Van de Wouwer retired at 76 and his son had too busy a professional life to continue the famed pigeon coop. All 445 birds were put on auction and the overall sale was already pushing past 6 million euros ($7 million). A second part of the auction is ending on Monday, but didn't include any bird that could match New Kim. It still amounted to an amazing weekend for one pigeon breeder.
	Belgians have long stood out as the best breeders, both because of their generations-long experience and the density of a network where many breeders can organize races close together. It's not a short-term endeavour, however, since becoming expert at genetic breeding with the constant mixing and mating of birds takes years, if not decades. Birds can live up to 15 years.
	""Everybody is interested in our pigeons,"" Pascal Bodengien, head of the Belgian pigeon federation, told The Associated Press.
	Only a decade ago, the record price for a pigeon stood at one-tenth of New Kim's price. And the current price of gold stands about 26,000 euros ($30,350) per pound.
	As so often, globalization has made the difference.
	With the rise of business wealth in China came also conspicuous consumption and a new venue for gambling. Somehow, pigeons fit the bill. China often features one-loft racing, where pigeons all get used to one coop for months and then are released many hundreds of miles away to make their way back with their unique sense of orientation and special speed training. Prize pots can reach into the tens of millions of euros.
	For breeding, though, there is no place like Belgium. This is where, little more than a generation ago, the national weekend radio news was followed by announcements on whether pigeons were released in faraway places in France or even Spain and what weather conditions the birds were facing.
	After World War II, Belgium had over 250,000 members in the pigeon fancier federation. Now there are 18,000, Bodengien says.
	Pigeon breeding demands constant attention, every single day of the year. Those demands had turned away many modern folk, once sending the sport into a decline.
	""To be the best, it has to be your life's work. For some, it may seem boring. Day in, day out. Winter and summer, always those pigeons."" he said.
	Once bitten though, many remain committed for life. And the news that a pigeon can sell for $1.9 million could prompt new challengers to enter the sport. Bodengien welcomed that development but urged patience and a reality check.
	""Anybody thinking about getting into our sport to get money out of it had better think again and move to another sport,"" he said."

                ",https://www.ctvnews.ca/business/asean-china-other-partners-set-world-s-biggest-trade-pact-1.5189708,"
	China and 14 other countries agreed Sunday to set up the world's largest trading bloc, encompassing nearly a third of all economic activity, in a deal many in Asia are hoping will help hasten a recovery from the shocks of the pandemic.
	The Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, or RCEP, was signed virtually on Sunday on the sidelines of the annual summit of the 10-nation Association of Southeast Asian Nations.
	""I am delighted to say that after eight years of hard work, as of today, we have officially brought RCEP negotiations to a conclusion for signing,"" said host country Vietnam's prime minister, Nguyen Xuan Phuc.
	""The conclusion of RCEP negotiation, the largest free trade agreement in the world, will send a strong message that affirms ASEAN's leading role in supporting the multilateral trading system, creating a new trading structure in the region, enabling sustainable trade facilitation, revitalizing the supply chains disrupted by COVID-19 and assisting the post-pandemic recovery,"" Phuc said.
	The accord will take already low tariffs on trade between member countries still lower, over time, and is less comprehensive than an 11-nation trans-Pacific trade deal that President Donald Trump pulled out of shortly after taking office.
	Apart from the 10 ASEAN members, it includes China, Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand, but not the United States. Officials said the accord leaves the door open for India, which dropped out due to fierce domestic opposition to its market-opening requirements, to rejoin the bloc.
	It will take time to fully assess exact details of the agreement encompassing tariff schedules and rules for all 15 countries involved -- the tariffs schedule just for Japan is 1,334 pages long.
	It is not expected to go as far as the European Union in integrating member economies but does build on existing free trade arrangements.
	The deal has powerful symbolic ramifications, showing that nearly four years after Trump launched his ""America First"" policy of forging trade deals with individual countries, Asia remains committed to multi-nation efforts toward freer trade that are seen as a formula for future prosperity.
	Ahead of Sunday's RCEP ""special summit"" meeting, Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga said he would firmly convey his government's support for ""broadening a free and fair economic zone, including a possibility of India's future return to the deal, and hope to gain support from the other countries.""
	The accord is also a coup for China, by far the biggest market in the region with more than 1.3 billion people, allowing Beijing to cast itself as a ""champion of globalization and multilateral co-operation"" and giving it greater influence over rules governing regional trade, Gareth Leather, senior Asian economist for Capital Economics, said in a report.
	China's official Xinhua News Agency quoted Premier Li Keqiang hailing the agreement as a victory against protectionism, in remarks delivered via a video link.
	""The signing of the RCEP is not only a landmark achievement of East Asian regional co-operation, but also a victory of multilateralism and free trade,"" Li said.
	The agreement is expected to help China, Japan and South Korea finally reach a trilateral free trade deal after years of struggling to bridge their differences.
	Now that Trump's opponent Joe Biden has been declared president-elect, the region is watching to see how U.S. policy on trade and other issues will evolve.
	Analysts are skeptical Biden will push hard to rejoin the trans-Pacific trade pact or to roll back many of the U.S. trade sanctions imposed on China by the Trump administration given widespread frustration with Beijing's trade and human rights records, and accusations of spying and technology theft.
	Critics of free trade agreements say they tend to encourage companies to move manufacturing jobs overseas. So, having won over disaffected rust-belt voters in Michigan and western Pennsylvania in the Nov. 3 election, Biden is ""not going to squander that by going back into TPP,"" Michael Jonathan Green of the Center for Strategic and International Studies said in a web seminar.
	But given concerns over China's growing influence, Biden is likely to seek much more engagement with Southeast Asia to protect U.S. interests, he said.
	The fast-growing and increasingly affluent Southeast Asian market of 650 million people has been hit hard by the pandemic and is urgently seeking fresh drivers for growth.
	RCEP originally would have included about 3.6 billion people and encompassed about a third of world trade and global GDP. Minus India, it still covers more than 2 billion people and close to a third of all trade and business activity.
	The United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA, the retooled version of the North American Free Trade Agreement under Trump, covers slightly less economic activity but less than a tenth of the world's population. The EU and Comprehensive and Progressive Trans-Pacific Partnership, the revised version of the deal Trump rejected, also are smaller. RCEP includes six of the 11 remaining CPTPP members.
	India balked at exposing its farmers and factories to more foreign competition. Among other concerns, Indian dairy farmers are worried about competition from New Zealand and Australian milk and cheese producers. Automakers fear imports from across the region. But overall the biggest fear is over a flood of manufactured goods from China.
	Trade and investment flows within Asia have vastly expanded over the past decade, a trend that has accelerated amid feuding between the U.S. and China, which have imposed billions of dollars' worth of punitive tariffs on each other's exports.
	The RCEP agreement is loose enough to stretch to fit the disparate needs of member countries as diverse as Myanmar, Singapore, Vietnam and Australia. Unlike the CPTPP and EU, it does not establish unified standards on labour and the environment or commit countries to open services and other vulnerable areas of their economies.
	But it does set rules for trade that will facilitate investment and other business within the region, Jeffrey Wilson, research director at the Perth USAsia Center, said in a report for the Asia Society.
	""RCEP, therefore, is a much-needed platform for the Indo-Pacific's post-COVID recovery,"" he wrote.
	ASEAN members include Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Myanmar, the Philippines, Thailand, Brunei, Singapore, Malaysia and Vietnam.

              What the end of the Trump era could mean for Canadian Conservatives
          
","
              To win the next general election, Canadian conservatives face a challenge: how to appeal both to the Trump-friendly supporters within their base, and to those Canadians who abhorred the Republican president and his policies.
        ","

                ",https://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/what-the-end-of-the-trump-era-could-mean-for-canadian-conservatives-1.5189685,"OTTAWA -- 
	When Donald Trump leaves the White House, a regular feature of the last four years of Canadian politics is going to change: Conservatives will no longer constantly have to distance themselves from such a polarizing president.
	But to win the next general election, they'll still face a challenge: how to appeal both to the Trump-friendly supporters within their base, and to those Canadians who abhorred the Republican president and his policies.
	For four years, Trump has served as a bogeyman for Conservative opponents, who would point to his divisive hold on U.S. politics and suggest that if a Conservative were elected in Canada, Trumpism would be imported here.
	During the last federal election campaign, Elizabeth May, leader of the Green party at the time, made the comparison explicit, suggesting that then Conservative leader Andrew Scheer was literally a puppet of the U.S. president.
	""I looked your policies on foreign policy today, Andrew, and I realized if anyone wants to know where you stand, just figure out what Trump wants,"" she said during the debate.
	But a Democrat in the White House provides some political cover.
	It will now be Justin Trudeau pressed on whether he'll follow Biden's lead on programs or policies, instead of the Tories pushed constantly on whether they'd follow Trump's.
	And if the Conservatives do form government in the next election, a Democratic president could be helpful, said Garry Keller, who served in several senior advisory roles in the last Conservative government.
	Republican president George W. Bush was in office between 2000 and 2008 and the Conservatives came to power in 2006. At the time, aligning with him could be politically toxic, Keller said, even if versions of Bush's policies made sense for Canada.
	""When (Barack) Obama came along, the math completely changed,"" he said.
	Keller said during the Obama years, it became common for ministers to ""hug"" Obama -- publicly linking policies with ""the Obama administration,"" instead of just saying they were aligning with the United States more generally.
	""Canadians were obviously very favourable to President Obama,"" he said.
	""So it did give room to do things with the Americans on certain things that you couldn't have done under the Bush administration.""
	The vast majority of Canadians across the political spectrum tell pollsters again and again they don't like Trump, but of those who do like him, most also tell pollsters they'd vote for the Tories. Among them: Conservative Senate leader Don Plett, who voiced his support for a second Trump term in a recent speech to the Senate.
	Trump will still loom large enough in the world's collective memory for Conservatives to be compared to him, said Andrea Van Vugt, who was a foreign-policy adviser to Stephen Harper.
	""The Conservative party and Erin O'Toole's team should expect that,"" she said.
	""They should anticipate it, they should understand how they're going to push back.""
	Van Vugt pointed out, however, that if Trump had truly poisoned conservatism in voters' minds, a slew of conservative premiers wouldn't have been elected over the last four years.
	Among them is Ontario's Doug Ford, whose ""man of the people"" style is seen as closest to Trump's of the group.
	O'Toole's approach could be seen as taking some pages from the Trump playbook.
	His leadership campaign slogan, ""Take back Canada,"" was interpreted by some as a northern play on Trump's ""Make America Great Again"" line, though O'Toole has been far more pro-immigration and free trade than Trump has.
	His aggressive stance against China, which also mirrors Trump's, may be one that Canadians are on side with, Van Vugt suggested.
	""I think that Canadians, if they sat back and thought about it for a minute, would say, 'Well, you know, maybe it's time for us to take a strong stand on China and the only recent memory we have a politician doing that is Trump,' "" she said.
	""And though we don't agree with anything else that he does, this is probably one of those areas.""
	Meanwhile, a decision to expressly court the union vote can also be seen as trying for the populism that worked for Trump -- going after working-class Americans left behind by modern-day politicians and the global economy.
	Trump won in 2016 on their support, and the reality of the 2020 presidential election is that in many cases he still had it, said Van Vugt.
	But in some ways, she said, the results in the U.S. mirror what happened in the 2019 federal election in Canada: a Liberal minority government.
	In both countries, she said, voters told the incumbent government it didn't deserve another chance at full control, but they didn't entirely trust the other side either.
	Understanding what's behind that and building a message that reaches people to earn their trust and a solid mandate to govern is a must for Canadian politicians, Van Vugt said.
	""For any political party -- the Conservatives, Liberals, the NDP -- that's the trick of the next election.""

	U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo discussed ""global challenges"" with a handful of members of a Paris think-tank Saturday at the start of a seven-country tour of Europe and the Middle East, travels that were certain to be awkward since all the nations on his schedule have congratulated President-elect Joe Biden for winning the White House.
	Pompeo was an all but invisible U.S. envoy on what may be his last official trip to France, tweeting out news of his arrival and from his private meeting with members of the Institut Montaigne, accompanied by photos.
	The trip is aimed at shoring up the priorities of the outgoing administration of President Donald Trump. It will include visits to Israeli settlements in the West Bank that have been avoided by previous secretaries of state.
	The United States' top diplomat -- as well as its president and much of his Republican Party -- have not accepted the results of the American election, and the unusual circumstances will likely overshadow the issues.
	In his latest tweet, Pompeo said he addressed ""the global challenges we are facing today, from terrorism to the COVID-19 pandemic"" with Institut Montaigne representatives. The independent think-tank says it promotes ""a balanced vision of society, in which open and competitive markets go hand in hand with equality of opportunity and social cohesion.""
	Pompeo arrived to a France in lockdown to fight a second wave of the coronavirus. In contrast to the few people seated around him, he did not wear a mask.
	Pompeo may find himself doing heavy-lifting on Monday, when he is scheduled to meet French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian and President Emmanuel Macron. According to Macron's office, the French president spoke with Biden by phone four days ago and conveyed his desire to work together in areas such as climate change, terrorism and health.
	For the outgoing secretary of state and the French officials, Monday's meetings will be a delicate demarche on tough issues.
	""For the moment, my counterpart is Mike Pompeo, until Jan. 20,"" Le Drian said Friday on French network BFMTV, referring to the date when Trump's term ends. ""He's coming to Paris. I receive him.""
	Le Drian noted the ""difficult subjects"" on the table, from the situation in Iraq and Iran to the Middle East and China.
	He said he plans to speak out on any accelerated withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq and Afghanistan, clearly concerned that Trump could end his presidency with such a move.
	""What he should not do, in our opinion,"" Le Drian said of a full withdrawal from Afghanistan. ""What should not be done either in Iraq, (we) will tell him.""
	Macron has had a tense relationship with Trump. Both leaders initially worked to woo each other with gestures of extravagance, such as Macron making Trump the guest of honour at a Bastille Day military parade. Trump later pulled out of the Paris global climate accord, a blow to Macron.
	The United States also left the hard-won Iran nuclear accord, and Pompeo said in a tweet before departing on his trip that ""Iran's destabilizing behaviour"" would be among topics of discussion.
	In an arrival tweet Saturday in France, Pompeo laid out the standard diplomatic groundwork for his Paris talks, noting that France is the ""oldest friend and Ally"" of the United States. ""The strong relationship between our countries cannot be overestimated,"" he tweeted.
	Promoting religious freedom and countering terrorism were also among topics on the table during his trip, he tweeted. Both issues are keenly relevant to France. There have been three terror attacks in recent weeks in France that have killed four people, linked to recently republished caricatures of the prophet of Islam. Anti-France protests rolled through some Muslim countries after Macron insisted on his nation's respect for freedom of expression, including the right to draw caricatures.
	After France, Pompeo's tour takes him to Turkey, Georgia, Israel, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Saudi Arabia. The leaders of all of those countries have offered public congratulations to Biden.
	Beside France, Turkey, Georgia and Qatar have had fractious relationships with the Trump administration, and it was not clear whether Pompeo planned public engagements with their leaders -- or whether he would take questions from the press, with whom he has had a frosty relationship.
	The administration's relations with Turkey have been particularly strained after the NATO ally's purchase of a Russian missile defence system, and Pompeo's stop in Istanbul next week will not include meetings with Turkish officials. Instead, Pompeo will meet with religious leaders to highlight his promotion of religious freedom.
	Palestinian officials, who have been snubbed by the Trump administration, have denounced Pompeo's plans to visit the West Bank settlement of Psagot. Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh tweeted on Friday that this was a ""dangerous precedent"" that legalizes settlements.
	In keeping with Trump's refusal to concede, and orders for Cabinet agencies not to co-operate with the Biden transition team, the State Department has not been involved with facilitating Biden's calls to foreign leaders, according to officials familiar with the process.
	At a news conference Tuesday, Pompeo said he would carry on as if there was no change.
	""I'm the secretary of state,"" he said. ""I'm getting calls from all across the world. These people are watching our election. They understand that we have a legal process. They understand that this takes time.""
	Yet his French counterpart Le Drian has been looking toward the future, saying last Sunday in Cairo that ""we will work with the new president of the United States and his team in the framework of new trans-Atlantic relations, we will need to re-found this.""

              Trump skips Asian summits as China set to expand influence
          
","
              U.S. President Donald Trump skipped summits with his Asian counterparts for the third year in a row on Saturday, even as rival China is set to expand its influence with a massive free trade deal in the region.
        ","
                  Saturday, Nov. 14, 2020
                ",https://www.ctvnews.ca/world/trump-skips-asian-summits-as-china-set-to-expand-influence-1.5189024,"HANOI, VIETNAM -- 
	U.S. President Donald Trump skipped summits with his Asian counterparts for the third year in a row on Saturday, even as rival China is set to expand its influence with a massive free trade deal in the region.
	National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien said Trump regretted he was unable to attend the online summit with the 10 members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, but stressed the importance of ties with the region.
	""At this time of global crisis, the U.S.-ASEAN strategic partnership has become even more important as we work together to combat the coronavirus,"" O'Brien said in remarks at the opening ceremony, which was livestreamed to ASEAN members watching from their respective countries.
	Trump attended the ASEAN summit in 2017, but sent only representatives during the last two meetings. A special summit with ASEAN that he was supposed to host in Las Vegas in March was called off due to the pandemic.
	Trump has been busy challenging the results of the Nov. 3 presidential election, insisting he was the victim of election fraud. Most countries have acknowledged Joe Biden's victory.
	O'Brien also represented the U.S. at an East Asia virtual summit later Saturday that included the ASEAN members as well as Australia, China, India, Japan, South Korea, New Zealand and Russia.
	Despite Trump's absence, the White House said in a statement that ASEAN remains central to his vision for a ""free and open Indo-Pacific,"" Washington's strategy to counter China's growing influence in the region.
	China's sway in the region is set to expand with a free trade agreement that will be signed Sunday. The pact, which will cover almost a third of the world economy, includes the ASEAN nations, China, Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand.
	India backed out of the plan last year, and the agreement also does not include the United States, despite America's $2 trillion in trade with the countries in the pact.
	In his remarks Saturday, O'Brien touted ASEAN as the fourth-largest trading partner for the U.S., with trade reaching over $354 billion last year.
	""We deeply appreciate ASEAN partners' efforts to keep the key supply chains open, factories operating and PPE flowing,"" O'Brien said, referring to personal protective equipment used to protect against the coronavirus.
	He noted that the U.S. had contributed $87 million to combat the coronavirus in Southeast Asia, including providing ventilators and PPE.
	""The United States has your back and we know you have ours,"" O'Brien said.
	At the East Asia summit later Saturday, UN Secretary-General Antonio Gutteres said the virus had infected at least 14 million people in Asia and killed more than a quarter million in the region. At least 39 million people could revert to extreme poverty in East Asia alone, he warned.
	The UN has urged countries to put together a stimulus package amounting to at least 10% of global gross domestic product, Gutteres said.
	With the global community facing its deepest recession since the Second World War, the World Bank is on track to commit a record $160 billion over 15 months, including grants and concessional financing, said its president, David Malpass.
	Still, the pandemic remains an enormous obstacle to development and a successful vaccination program will be key to recovery, he said.
	Earlier Saturday, China, Japan and South Korea sought deeper regional co-operation to battle the pandemic.
	""Facing a possible second wave as winter is setting in, we can work together to mitigate the pandemic and to reopen the economy,"" said Chinese Premier Li Keqiang.
	South Korean President Moon Jae-in said the region must work together toward the development and equitable supply of vaccines and treatments, and establish an effective mechanism to prepare to battle new infectious diseases.
	He said the speed of global economic recovery will be very uneven amid trade protectionism and uncertainties in the financial markets. An accelerated transition to a digital economy could also widen the gap between social classes, Moon warned.
	""We must work to strengthen the resilience of our economies and identify measures for inclusive, sustainable growth,"" he said.
	Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga said Tokyo has been engaged in boosting ASEAN's economic resilience and remains committed to deepening ties with Southeast Asia.
	Japan and South Korea have committed $1 million each to an ASEAN COVID-19 fund, meant to support member states in securing medical equipment and finance research on drugs and vaccines against the coronavirus.

              Drug formula combined with aspirin can reduce risk of heart attacks and strokes by up to 40 per cent: study

              An international study of people with an intermediate risk of heart disease or stroke has found a drug formula that can significantly reduce the risk of cardiovascular illnesses and procedures like heart surgery.

	An international study of middle-aged people with an intermediate risk of heart disease or stroke has found a drug formula that can significantly reduce the risk of cardiovascular illnesses and procedures like heart surgery.
	The formula, known as a âpolypill,â combines three blood pressure medications with a lipid lowering medication. Researchers say when taken with aspirin, the medications can reduce the risk of heart disease by up to 40 per cent.
	âThis is the start of a transformational approach to preventing heart disease,â Dr. Salim Yusuf, co-researcher and professor of medicine at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ont., said in a statement. âWe could save millions of people from experiencing serious heart disease or stroke each year with effective use of the polypill and aspirin.â
	The study says, only 4.4 per cent of those who took the polypill alone had a heart attack, stroke or some other kind of cardiovascular problem compared to 5.5 per cent of people who took the placebo.
	Researchers found even greater success among patients who took the combined polypill with aspirin.
	According to the study, cardiovascular diseases account for nearly 18 million deaths each year, with more than 80 per cent occurring in regions facing poverty. Researchers estimate that more than 40 million people around the world have been impacted by cardiovascular incidents like heart attacks or strokes.
	âA polypill is not only effective, it is likely to be cost effective since it is based on using commonly used generic drugs,â said Dr. Prem Pais, co-researcher and professor at St. Johnâs Medical College and Research Institute in Bangalore, India. âA polypill is convenient for patients to use as it combines several effective drugs in a single pill and is taken once a day, which would be expected to improve adherence.â
	Pais added, âThe results of the study have implications for reducing the burden of cardiovascular diseases globally. Even if only one third of eligible people receive a polypill, its use will likely avoid millions of individuals experiencing serious cardiovascular diseases worldwide.â
	Research for the study was conducted across nine countries and involved more than 5,700 people, largely from India and the Philippines. The study was co-ordinated globally by the Population Health Research Institute, a joint venture between McMaster University and Hamilton Health Sciences.
	Researchers say they examined a variety of methods and drug combinations, including comparing the polypill alone to aspirin or a placebo.
	Although the formulation of different polypills may vary, the one used in this study included 40 mg simvastatin, 100 mg of atenolol, 25mg of hydrochlorothiazide, and 10 mg of ramipril. Researchers say it can be combined with 75 mg of aspirin a day.Â 
	âThe use of the polypill widely will benefit people in both the rich and poor countries as there are major gaps in treatments in populations all over the world,â Dr. Philip Joseph, associate professor at McMaster and cardiologist with Hamilton Health Sciences said in a statement.
	The polypill tested in this study is currently available in India and in a few countries in Africa. Different polypills are available in Europe, South America and South Korea. New polypills are being developed in North America and China.Â "

              G20 agrees on framework for more debt relief amid COVID-19

              The Group of 20 nations, representing the world's biggest economies, announced Friday that low-income countries hardest hit by the fallout of the coronavirus pandemic could potentially get an extension on their debt payments beyond mid-2021, and in the mos...

	The Group of 20 nations, representing the world's biggest economies, announced Friday that low-income countries hardest hit by the fallout of the coronavirus pandemic could potentially get an extension on their debt payments beyond mid-2021, and in the most severe cases, a debt write-off.
The G20 statement, released after a virtual gathering of the group's finance ministers and central bank governors, declared that the countries had agreed on a ""common framework"" for ""timely and orderly"" debt restructuring that aims to treat creditors equally and negotiate debt on a case-by-case basis.
	But it did not specify which creditors would agree to possible debt cancellation. China, for instance, has repeatedly objected to portions of the debt relief plans. The country, considered to be Africa's largest creditor, is reluctant to give up the billions it is owed from its politically strategic projects across the developing world as its own economy slows.
	The meeting comes a month after the G20 agreed to suspend US$14 billion in debt payments for an additional six months to support 73 of the world's neediest countries in their fight against the pandemic. Developing nations now have until June 2021 to spend on healthcare and emergency stimulus programs without fretting about grueling debt repayments to foreign creditors.
	Although the pause on debt-service payments was welcomed as a reprieve, experts have pointed to the constraints of a scheme that leaves out private lenders like investment firms, banks and bondholders. Without buy-in from the private sector, economists say that poor countries' emergency funds may just land in other lenders' pockets, regardless of the G20's concessions.
	The group's new ""case-by-case approach"" to debt negotiations unveiled Friday, also endorsed by the Paris Club, a group of mostly Western sovereign lenders, requires ""fair burden sharing"" among all official creditors -- suggesting that China and its disparate lending agencies will have to get on board. It asks that private creditors offer debt treatment ""at least as favourable"" as that offered by creditor countries.
	Mohammed al-Jadaan, the finance minister for Saudi Arabia, this year's chair of the G20, hailed the framework as ""an unprecedented agreement and a major breakthrough in international debt agenda.""
	Kristalina Georgieva, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, echoed the praise, saying the agreement would make the participation of private creditors ""more likely"" and ""increase the viability of our action.""
	Still, she warned that the debt crisis ""is not over,"" adding that ""we need further support through debt relief and through fresh financing.""
	The group also announced Friday that it would reconvene next spring to see ""if the economic and financial situation requires"" an extension of the debt suspension by another six months. A repayment timetable of 5-6 years may be offered to eligible countries that make requests to individual creditors.
	Before COVID-19 struck, much of the developing world, already in dire need of doctors and medical equipment, was spending huge shares of revenue to service external debt. Now that the pandemic has closed borders, halted tourism, pulled down oil prices and wiped out remittances, poverty is rising and resources are shrinking.
	International aid groups have pushed for greater debt relief and partial forgiveness rather than mere suspension, arguing that poor countries should not cut spending that's badly needed for stimulus measures and healthcare systems under strain.
	Ahead of Friday's finance meeting, over a thousand medical professionals from around the world sent a letter to the G-20 urging debt cancellation for developing countries.
	""It is perverse that poor countries are having to pay $3 billion per month in debt repayments to rich banks, investment funds or the World Bank, while their populations fall further into poverty and destitution,"" wrote Chema Vera, Oxfam International's interim executive director."

              'Most remote island' creates massive marine protection zone
          
","
              Tristan da Cunha, an island with 245 permanent residents, has created a marine protection zone to safeguard wildlife in an area of the South Atlantic three times the size of the United Kingdom.

                ",https://www.ctvnews.ca/climate-and-environment/most-remote-island-creates-massive-marine-protection-zone-1.5187675,"LONDON -- 
	Tristan da Cunha, an island with 245 permanent residents, is creating a marine protection zone to safeguard endangered rockhopper penguins, yellow-nosed albatross and other wildlife in an area of the South Atlantic three times the size of the United Kingdom.
	The government of the British overseas territory, which calls itself the most remote inhabited island on Earth, said Friday that fishing and other âextractive activitiesâ will be banned from 627,247 square kilometres (242,181 square miles) of ocean around Tristan da Cunha and the archipelago's three other major islands.
	The sanctuary will be the biggest âno-take zoneâ in the Atlantic Ocean and the fourth biggest anywhere in the world, protecting fish that live in the waters and tens of millions of seabirds that feed on them, the territory said. The isolated area, roughly equidistant between South Africa and Argentina, supports 85% of the endangered northern rockhopper penguins, 11 species of whales and dolphins, and most of world's sub-Antarctic fur seals, according to the Pew Bertarelli Ocean Legacy Project.
	âOur life on Tristan da Cunha has always been based around our relationship with the sea, and that continues today,â James Glass, the territory's chief islander, said in a statement. âThat's why we're fully protecting 90% of our waters, and we're proud that we can play a key role in preserving the health of the oceans.â
	The protection zone will become part of the U.K.'s Blue Belt Program, which is providing 27 million pounds ($35.5 million) to promote marine conservation in the country's overseas territories. The initiative has now protected 11.1 million square kilometres (4.3 million square miles) of marine environment, or 1% of the world's oceans, Prime Minister Boris Johnson's office said.
	The waters around Tristan da Cunha serve as a feeding ground for the critically endangered Tristan albatross and endangered yellow-nosed albatross.
	The islands are also home to several species of land birds that live nowhere else, including the Wilkins bunting, the U.K.'s rarest bird, and the Inaccessible rail, the world's smallest flightless bird, according to the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds.
	The Pew Bertarelli project, which promotes the creation of marine reserves around the world, said it would help Tristan da Cunha protect its waters with technology that uses real-time data to evaluate ocean conditions and human activity such as fishing. The project is a joint venture of the Pew Charitable Trusts and the Bertarelli Foundation.
	âThis ambitious decision by the Tristan da Cunha Island Council to protect the archipelago's waters is a great example of local leadership that has a global impact,â Dona Bertarelli, co-chair of the Bertarelli Foundation, said in a statement.
	The territory includes four main islands, the largest of which is Tristan da Cunha, located 2,810 kilometres (around 1,750 miles) west of Cape Town, South Africa. It was discovered by the Dutch in 1643.
	Britain took possession of Tristan da Cunha 1816, establishing the territory's first permanent settlement. The island was evacuated after a volcanic eruption in 1961, but the islanders returned in 1963.
	The territory's most important source of income is commercial fishing for crayfish, known as the Tristan Rock Lobster, which is sold as a luxury product in the U.S., Europe, Japan and China.
	âThis small community is responsible for one of the biggest conservation achievements of 2020,â said Beccy Speight, chief executive of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds. âThis will protect one of the most pristine marine environments on the planet.â"

	Thick mud and debris coated many villages around the Philippine capital on Friday after a typhoon killed at least 42 people and caused extensive flooding that sent people fleeing to their roofs, officials said.
	Troops, police, coast guard and disaster-response teams rescued tens of thousands of people, including many who flooded radio and TV networks and social media with desperate pleas for help.
	Floodwaters receded and the weather cleared in many areas after Typhoon Vamco blew out into the South China Sea on Friday, but the military said it was still rescuing people trapped in some flooded communities.
	Amphibious assault vehicles usually used in counter-insurgency operations were deployed for the rescue work, military chief of staff Gen. Gilbert Gapay said in a meeting with disaster-response officials.
	""We'll continue to look for the missing, help in damage assessment,"" Gapay said.
	The national police reported that the death toll had risen to at least 42 with 20 missing. The government's main disaster-response agency, which waits for provincial reports and follows a laborious process of verifying casualties, reported a much lower death count, causing confusion.
	Among the dead were at least 12 villagers who were dug out from mud and rockslides in the northern provinces of Cagayan and Nueva Vizcaya, police said.
	After slamming into northeastern Quezon province, Vamco gained strength with sustained winds of 155 kilometres (96 miles) per hour and gusts of up to 255 kph (158 mph). It blew north of metropolitan Manila overnight Wednesday, toppling trees and power poles, swelling rivers, flooding residential communities and setting off landslides and storm surges.
	In hard-hit Marikina city in the capital region and the towns of Rodriguez and Cainta in nearby Rizal province, several villages were inundated by water that reached the second and third floors of many houses, prompting hundreds of residents to flee to their roofs and call TV and radio networks or post desperate messages on social media. The panic was exacerbated by widespread power outages and loss of internet access.
	Videos of Marikina showed a thick coat of muddy water covering roads and staining houses and cars. Residents carried appliances and furniture from their homes and used pails and shovels to remove the mud after the water receded.
	In a televised meeting of Cabinet and disaster-response officials Friday, a reporter asked where President Rodrigo Duterte was, prompting an annoyed response from his spokesman.
	""The president's whereabouts should not be asked. That's foolishness coming from the opposition. The president is not missing, he is always with us,"" presidential spokesman Harry Roque said, without offering any further details.
	More than 400,000 people were evacuated to higher ground before the typhoon hit, mainly residents of vulnerable coastal and low-lying areas.
	At least 3.8 million households lost power in the capital and outlying provinces, but crews later restored electricity in many areas. Government offices were closed and most classes were suspended Friday.
	Vamco hit the Philippines on the heels of Typhoon Goni, one of the strongest typhoons in the world this year, which left more than 30 people dead or missing and damaged or destroyed 270,000 houses. Tens of thousands of people were still displaced when Vamco hit.
	The Philippines is hit by about 20 typhoons and tropical storms each year and also has active seismic faults and volcanoes, making it one of the world's most disaster-prone countries.

              TikTok gets reprieve as U.S. holds off on enforcing ban

              The U.S. government announced Thursday it would delay enforcement of a ban on TikTok, saying it would comply with a court order in favor of the Chinese-owned social media sensation.

	The U.S. government announced Thursday it would delay enforcement of a ban on TikTok, saying it would comply with a court order in favor of the Chinese-owned social media sensation.
	The Trump administration has insisted on the need to ban the fast-growing app, saying it has links to the Chinese government through its parent company ByteDance, and that user data could be obtained by Beijing.
	The hit short-form video app -- which has some 100 million users in the U.S. -- was given a reprieve after the Commerce Department said it was holding off on banning it owing to an injunction by a federal judge issued on October 30.
	""The department is complying with the terms of this order,"" it said in a statement, adding that the ban ""will not go into effect pending further legal developments.""
	The government has launched an appeal against the judge's decision in the case, which was brought by TikTok influencers.
	The White House has said TikTok must become a U.S. firm controlled by American investors to avert a ban.Â 
	But any plan would likely need approval from Beijing, which has balked at giving up control of its social media star.
	China's commerce ministry published new rules in August that added ""civilian use"" to a list of technologies that are restricted for export, which could make it more difficult for ByteDance to sell TikTok, which features clips of everything from dance routines to politics.
	In a statement on the reprieve, TikTok said: ""(We) look forward to reaching a resolution that addresses their security concerns, even as we disagree with them.""
	ByteDance and TikTok have proposed creating a new company with IT firm Oracle as a technology partner and retail giant Walmart as a business partner, but no deal has been confirmed.
	ByteDance had been given until Thursday to restructure ownership of the app in the United States to address national security concerns, but it filed a petition in a Washington court this week asking for a delay.
	The company said in a Tuesday statement that it had asked the government for a 30-day extension because of ""continual new requests and no clarity on whether our proposed solutions would be accepted,"" but it was not granted.
	A separate case brought by TikTok is pending in another Washington court, which last month blocked the U.S. government from enforcing a ban on new downloads of the app.
	Donald Trump and his aides have claimed TikTok and ByteDance can be used to collect data on Americans for Chinese espionage, a claim they deny."

China congratulates Biden, but few U.S. policy changes seen

China on Friday became one of the last major countries to congratulate U.S. President-elect Joe Biden, who is expected to make few changes to U.S. policy in conflicts with Beijing over trade, technology and security.

	China on Friday became one of the last major countries to congratulate U.S. President-elect Joe Biden, who is expected to make few changes to U.S. policy in conflicts with Beijing over trade, technology and security.
	China, along with Russia, avoided joining the throng that congratulated Biden last weekend after he and vice-presidential running mate Kamala Harris secured enough Electoral College votes to unseat U.S. President Donald Trump.
	""We respect the choice of the American people,"" said a foreign ministry spokesman, Wang Wenbin. ""We congratulate Mr. Biden and Ms. Harris.""
	Wang gave no reason for the delay but said, ""the result will be confirmed according to U.S. laws and procedures.""
	U.S.-Chinese relations have plunged to their lowest level in decades amid a tariff war over Beijing's technology ambitions and trade surplus, accusations of spying and tension over human rights, the coronavirus pandemic, Hong Kong and control of the South China Sea.
	Trump labeled China a security threat and imposed export curbs and other sanctions on Chinese companies. On Thursday, he stepped up those sanctions by issuing an order that bars Americans from investing in securities issued by companies U.S. officials say are owned or controlled by the Chinese military.
	Forecasters had said even if lost his re-election bid, Trump was likely to try to increase pressure on Beijing before he leaves office on Jan. 20.
	Political analysts expect Biden to try to resume co-operation with Beijing on climate change, North Korea, Iran and the coronavirus. And they say Biden might pursue a more traditional, predictable policy toward China.
	However, economists and political analysts expect few big changes due to widespread frustration with Beijing's trade and human rights record and accusations of spying and technology theft.
	""A tough stance on China has broad support across the U.S. political spectrum,"" Louis Kuijs of Oxford Economics said in a report this week. ""Biden's own pronouncements and policy program suggest he will continue to try to maintain the U.S. technological lead and to attract manufacturing activity.""
	Some forecasters suggest the change from Trump, who rejected multilateral alliances, to Biden might increase pressure on China if Washington forms a coalition with other developed countries to push for policy changes.
	China has tried to recruit Germany, France, South Korea and other governments as allies against Washington but all have refused. They criticized Trump's trade tactics of surprise tariff hikes, which also were used against allies, but echo U.S. complaints that China is violating its free-trade commitments.
	Some Chinese trade experts have suggested Beijing might try to renegotiate the ""Phase 1"" agreement signed in January as a first step toward ending the trade war. It calls for China to increase purchases of U.S. goods in exchange for postponing further tariff hikes. But that came before the coronavirus derailed global trade, leaving China behind on meeting its commitments.
	Renegotiation might fit a ""more strategic, longer-term orientation"" expected from a Biden administration, but he ""cannot be seen to be `soft' on China"" after the ""hard rhetoric"" of the campaign, Kuijs said.
	Chinese leaders were quieter during this year's election than in the 2016 presidential race, when they favoured Trump over former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. They disliked her for carrying out then-President Barack Obama's foreign policy, which included pressuring Beijing on human rights. Trump's public image of business success resonated with the Chinese public.
	Trump shook up China's leaders by hiking tariffs on Chinese products in 2018 over complaints Beijing steals or pressures companies to hand over technology.
	The White House has lobbied allies to exclude telecom equipment giant Huawei Technologies Ltd., China's first global tech brand, from next-generation telecom networks on security grounds. Huawei's access to American components and technology was cut off over the past year, threatening to cripple its global sales.
	Trump is trying to bar Chinese social media companies from the United States, citing fears they might gather too much personal information about Americans. The White House is pressing video service TikTok to sell its U.S. operation and is trying to block companies from dealing with WeChat, the popular Chinese message service."

              Critics speak out on Tokyo Olympic costs, pandemic, fairness
          
","
              Postponed 7 1/2 months ago, the Olympics have been rescheduled to open on July 23, 2021. But there is a tiny murmur of resistance to the Olympic behemoth, particularly as the virus spikes around the world.

                ",https://www.ctvnews.ca/sports/critics-speak-out-on-tokyo-olympic-costs-pandemic-fairness-1.5187345,"TOKYO -- 
	Three-time Olympic champion gymnast Kohei Uchimura wants the postponed Tokyo Olympics to happen next year. But he's also talked openly about the skepticism in Japan where enthusiasm is muted by health risks, billions of dollars in taxpayer bills, and questions why the Games are a priority amid a pandemic.
	Polls over the last several months show Japanese -- and Japanese companies -- are divided about holding the Games, or doubtful they should be held at all.
	""Unfortunately, 80 per cent of the Japanese don't believe that the Tokyo Olympics can take place as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic,"" Uchimura said after a one-day exhibition gymnastics meet last weekend.
	""I would like people to change their minds from: We can't hold the Olympics to -- how can we do it?""
	Postponed 7 1/2 months ago, the Olympics have been rescheduled to open on July 23, 2021. Despite the public's ambivalence, the International Olympic Committee and Japanese organizers have unwavering support from Japan's ruling party and Tokyo's municipal government. The messaging is moulded around the Games overcoming the odds -- a heroic endeavour by Japan to lift global spirits, thanks to the Olympics.
	Should Japan fail, Asian rival China would take the stage six months later with Beijing's Winter Olympics opening Feb. 4, 2022.
	But there is a tiny murmur of resistance to the Olympic behemoth, particularly as the virus spikes around the world.
	There are fears of letting 15,400 Olympic and Paralympic athletes enter Japan, joined by tens of thousand of officials, coaches, VIPs and media; not to mention the possibility of allowing foreign fans to attend.
	""We should be talking about whether the Games are something we should forge ahead with in this way,"" Genki Sudo, a national legislator, told The Associated Press in an interview.
	Sudo, a former mixed martial artist, wrestler and kickboxer, argues the Olympics won't be fair to the athletes. Some can practice, but many can't because of the pandemic. He even half-jokingly suggested the Games should be held remotely, like a Zoom meeting.
	""If the training environment is so different, is that fair? It's absolutely not fair,"" Sudo said at his Parliamentary Upper House office adorned with pull-up bars.
	About 57 per cent of the qualification spots for Tokyo have been filled. Matt Smith, the head of World Rowing, said a few days ago that completing the qualification was ""really getting urgent.""
	Tomoko Tamura, a lawmaker with the opposition Japanese Communist Party, wants to have the Olympics but said a safe vaccine may not come in time. Organizers say they can hold the Games, vaccine or no vaccine.
	Some have suggested that healthy athletes should not be a priority for any vaccine. Can athletes refuse a vaccine and still compete? What if the vaccine makes an athlete ill days before the event?
	Japan has kept infections in check with fewer than 2,000 deaths attributed to COVID-19, though it's undergoing a mild spike. Incoming travel has been mostly halted, but it's sure to change for Olympic athletes and staff.
	IOC President Thomas Bach is to meet next week in Japan with new Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga, organizing committee president Yoshiro Mori, and probably any local sponsor that needs convincing the Olympics can still deliver. Local sponsors have chipped in US$3.3 billion to fund the Games, at least twice a much as any previous Olympics, driven by the Japanese advertising company Dentsu Inc.
	Bach was asked on Wednesday in Switzerland if contingency plans for cancelling the Olympics would be discussed in Tokyo.
	""No,"" he replied.
	Bach called off a visit to South Korea last month because of the pandemic's spread in Europe. He may be met by a small ""unwelcoming committee"" when he gets to Tokyo.
	About 30 anti-Olympic protesters showed up Sunday outside the gymnastic event. They distributed leaflets and warned Bach in their handout that they would be around when he arrives ""to deliver our message to cancel the Olympics.""
	Sonja Ganseforth, a researcher at the German Institute for Japanese Studies in Tokyo, has written about the anti-Olympic movement in Japan. Protesters say the Olympics have diverted billions from the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster recovery. In addition, they oppose the overwhelming use of public money and argue the Olympics landed in Japan because of an IOC vote-buying bribery scandal.
	""Once the decision to hold the Olympics in Tokyo had been made, many (Japanese) also considered it anti-social or even unpatriotic to protest openly against the Games,"" Ganseforth said in an email.
	""Anti-Olympic protests in Japan are not an entirely new phenomenon,"" she wrote in a paper entitled ""The difference between zero and one.""
	Ganseforth said there were .protests when Nagoya bid for the 1988 Olympics, which eventually went to Seoul. She wrote that opposition was silenced before Nagano was awarded the 1998 Winter Olympics. Bid records disappeared after the award amid widespread accusations of bribery.
	Olympic finances say the Games must go on -- particularly on television, which pays most of the bills.
	The IOC generated 73 per cent of its income of $5.7 billion over the latest four-year Olympic cycle from selling broadcast rights. American network NBC pays well over $1 billion for every Olympics.
	Tokyo organizers say they are officially spending $12.6 billion to stage the Games. However, a government audit last year said the amount was likely twice that large. All but $5.6 billion is public money.
	Over and above this is the cost of the one-year delay, estimated in Japan at $2 billion to $3 billion. The IOC has said it will chip in about $650 million in Japan toward the postponement, but has offered few specifics.
	A recent University of Oxford study said these are the most expensive Summer Olympics on record. Those were calculations made before the pandemic.
	Ryu Honma, who has written several books critical of the Olympics and Dentsu's ties to Tokyo's bid, said the Games will be a farce.
	""What has to happen is a taxi has to pick up athletes as they arrive at the airport, so they will get quarantined in the Athletes' Village,"" he told AP. ""They won't be allowed to have any exchanges. because otherwise the Athletes' Village may become an infection cluster. If you do all this, then maybe it's possible to hold the Games, but where are the principles of the Olympics?"""

              Denying Biden victory, Pompeo heads to Europe, Mideast

	After refusing to acknowledge U.S. President Donald Trump's loss in last week's election, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is leaving Friday on a trip to Europe and the Middle East, to countries where leaders have all congratulated former Vice-President Joe Biden for his victory.
	The seven-nation trip is aimed at shoring up the outgoing Trump administration's priorities, notably its anti-China and -Iran policies, and will include visits to Israeli settlements in the West Bank that have been avoided by previous secretaries of state.
	But the usual foreign policy issues are likely to be overshadowed by the extraordinary moment in global politics: Most of the world has accepted the results of America's election, while the United States' top diplomat -- as well as its president and much of his Republican Party -- have not.
	Pompeo's trip comes days after he raised eyebrows by dismissing a reporter's question about the presidential transition by saying ""there will be a smooth transition to a second Trump administration."" He appeared to be speaking in jest and went on to say, in a more serious tone, that the world should be assured that the State Department will be functional and successful with the president who takes office Jan. 20. But those comments and subsequent statements in interviews with conservative media did not acknowledge that it's Biden who will become president then.
	Pompeo's weeklong tour takes him to France, Turkey, Georgia, Israel, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Saudi Arabia. The leaders of each of those countries have offered public congratulations to Biden.
	Four of those countries -- France, Turkey, Georgia and Qatar -- have had a fractious relationship with the Trump administration and it was not clear if Pompeo would hold public engagements with any of their leaders. Pompeo has had a notoriously frosty relationship with the press, and it was unclear if he planned to take questions from reporters.
	The administration's relations with Turkey have been particularly strained after the NATO ally's purchase of a Russian missile defence system, and Pompeo's stop in Istanbul will not include meetings with Turkish officials. Instead, Pompeo will meet with religious leaders to highlight his promotion of religious freedom.
	Palestinian officials, who have been snubbed by the Trump administration, have denounced Pompeo's plans to visit the West Bank settlement of Psagot. ""This dangerous precedent legalizes settlements (and) a blow to int'l legitimacy/ UN Res's,"" Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh tweeted on Friday.
	In keeping with Trump's refusal to concede and orders for Cabinet agencies not to co-operate with the Biden transition team, the State Department has not been involved with facilitating Biden's calls to foreign leaders, according to officials familiar with the process.
	Pompeo's ardent support for Trump, who has claimed without evidence that the election was beset by fraud, threatens to hurt America's standing in making pronouncements about other countries' democratic shortcomings.
	On Thursday, Pompeo weighed in on Hong Kong's legislature, and he has in recent weeks denounced alleged electoral problems in Belarus, Tanzania and Ivory Coast. On Friday, he congratulated the Caribbean nation of St. Vincent and the Grenadines for its recent elections.
	Yet, at his news conference Tuesday, Pompeo roundly dismissed a question about whether Trump's unfounded protests have created problems for U.S. credibility. ""You asked a question that is ridiculous,"" he responded. ""This department cares deeply to make sure that elections around the world are safe and secure and free and fair, and my officers risk their lives to ensure that that happens.""
	Biden has already spoken with the leaders of Australia, Canada, Japan and South Korea and fielded congratulatory notes on social media and elsewhere from others.
	Yet, Pompeo said he would carry on as if there was no change.
	""I'm the secretary of state,"" he said. ""I'm getting calls from all across the world. These people are watching our election. They understand that we have a legal process. They understand that this takes time."""

              Trump bans U.S. investment in Chinese military-linked firms

              U.S. President Donald Trump has stepped up a conflict with China over security and technology by barring Americans from investing in companies that U.S. officials say are owned or controlled by the Chinese military.

	U.S. President Donald Trump has stepped up a conflict with China over security and technology by barring Americans from investing in companies that U.S. officials say are owned or controlled by the Chinese military.
	The Chinese government accused Washington of misusing national security as an excuse to hamper competition and warned Friday that Trump's order would hurt U.S. and other investors worldwide.
	The impact of Thursday's order wasn't immediately clear but it could add to pressure on companies including telecom equipment giant Huawei and video surveillance provider Hikvision that already face U.S. import bans and other sanctions.
	It is Trump's first major action toward China since he lost his reelection bid to challenger Joe Biden. Economists and political analysts had said that even if Trump was defeated he was likely to launch more actions against Beijing before leaving office on Jan. 20.
	Political analysts expect little change in policy under Biden due to widespread frustration with China's trade and human rights records and accusations of spying and technology theft.
	China's foreign ministry on Friday accused Washington of ""wantonly suppressing Chinese companies under the pretext of national security"" and violating market principles.
	""The U.S. government maliciously slandered China's military-civilian integration development policy out of political motives and abused national power to unreasonably suppress Chinese companies,"" said a foreign ministry spokesman, Wang Wenbin.
	""This move will not only seriously damage the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese companies, but will also damage the interests of investors from all countries, including the United States,"" Wang said.
	He said Beijing will ""firmly safeguard"" the rights of Chinese companies, a statement Beijing often makes following unwelcome U.S. policy changes but that often results in no action.
	U.S. officials complain China's ruling Communist Party takes advantage of access to American technology and investment to expand its military, already one of the world's biggest and most heavily armed.
	Thursday's order said the companies targeted ""directly support"" the Chinese military, intelligence and security apparatus. It said Beijing ""exploits United States investors"" to finance military development by selling securities in American and foreign financial markets.
	The order bars American investors from conducting any transactions in publicly traded securities issued by any Chinese companies designated by the secretary of defence as being linked to the Communist Party's military wing, the People's Liberation Army.
	The Pentagon earlier designated 31 companies as being owned or controlled by the Chinese military. Many are military contractors or state-owned companies such as phone carrier China Telecom Ltd. But the list also includes Huawei Technologies Ltd. and Hikvision Digital Technology Co., which say they are private and deny they are controlled by the military.
	Hikvision criticized its inclusion in Thursday's order as unjustified. The company said it is independent of the PLA and never has participated in research and development for ""military applications.""
	""As we have shown time and again, Hikvision is not a `Chinese military company,""' a Hikvision statement said. ""These punitive actions against the company do not make America, or the world, any safer.""
	Most of those companies have no shares traded in the United States but many sell stocks, bonds and other securities in markets outside mainland China that are accessible to American investors.
	Sales made to divest securities of those companies will be allowed until one year from now on Nov. 11, 2021."

	As of Thursday, 155 British Columbians were hospitalized with COVID-19, a grim new milestone as infections in the province soar and frontline health-care workers grow increasingly alarmed at the cases they anticipate handling.
	The previous record for hospitalizations came on April 2, when 149 people were hospitalized. At that time, 68 were in intensive care, compared to 44 on Thursday, but one of the key health officials at St. Paulâs Hospital says medical personnel are already on tenterhooks treating the patients they currently have.
	âIt takes more time to care for these patients because every single time you go into and out of a room you have to don PPE and doff PPE when you leave,â said Dione Nordby, a registered nurse and critical care senior patient care manager at St. Paulâs. âThe feeling of isolation is present both for the patientâs perspective and the nurses and health-care workersâ perspective. As a patient, you are in a room where the doors are closed, we use intercoms to speak to you and there is less physical presence and touching than a patient who doesnât have COVID because of the requirements to have PPE and try to limit the exposure. Itâs also isolating for health-care workers because youâre in a closed room, thereâs windows so everybody can see you, but itâs not the same as with our regular patients in how we provide care all the time â those non-verbal communications.â
	Each patient is attended to dozens of times a day by nurses, doctors, respiratory therapists, social workers, mental health professionals and others who care for them at various stages of hospitalization.
	âIt is not limited to elderly people,â said Nordby. âItâs a different patient demographic (now) than we saw in March; we are seeing younger patients in the intensive care unit.â
	B.C.âs health minister addressed the rising hospitalization numbers, but also pointed out there are empty beds available in every health authority and that none of the âsurge capacityâ beds health officials arranged at the start of the pandemic have been occupied.
	â155 people is too many to have in hospitals because of COVID-19, we want to see those numbers reduced,â said Health Minister Adrian Dix.
	CTV News Vancouver pointed out that the current hospitalizations outstrip the number from the spring when the province established a makeshift hospital in the Vancouver Convention Centre and asked how high the number of hospitalized COVID-19 patients would have to be before using that location and other âalternate care centresâ around the province. Dix said they donât appear necessary at this point.
	âIn the spring, we prepared for scenarios based on what had happened in Wuhan (China) and what happened in Italy and that didnât come to pass,â he said. âEven though those beds are there, we donât expect, certainly at this time, to even consider using them. But what I would also say is we havenât seen the beginning of cold and flu season.â
	Several health-care workers told CTV News they are disappointed and frustrated by people flouting provincial health orders and partying on the Granville strip or holding big family gatherings. Nordby echoed the sentiment and pointed out many of her peers are feeling exhausted and stressed.
	âI think thereâs definitely an emotional toll associated for caring for these people for many reasons,â she said. âFor one, that constant need to be so conscious of every single action to avoid contamination, the perceived risk associated with caring for those patients on behalf of the health-care workers, but also broader with their families because (workers) are thinking about the risk and what that may look like when they have at-risk loved ones at home.â
	âWe also see the potential that this could overwhelm our health-care system and then it really will impact not just the COVID patients but all the patients that need medical care, and for us in particular, ICU care, which is really challenging to think about.âÂ "

	The U.N. Security Council voted Thursday to prevent the sale or shipment to Somalia of components of improvised explosive devices if there is ""significant risk"" they may be used to manufacture the often deadly devices that are increasingly being used in attacks by al-Shabab extremists.
	It also urged the Somali government to keep cracking down on the militant group's illegal financing methods that U.N. experts estimate raised over US$21 million last year.
	The resolution, adopted by a 13-0 vote with Russia and China abstaining, reaffirmed the arms embargo on Somalia and banned the resale or transfer of any weapons or military equipment sold or supplied to help develop Somalia's National Security Forces and security sector.
	Al-Qaida-linked al-Shabab remains the most active and resilient extremist group in Africa, controlling parts of southern and central Somalia and often targeting checkpoints and other high-profile areas in the capital, Mogadishu. It has fired several mortars this year at the heavily defended international airport, where the U.S. Embassy and other missions are located.
	In their latest report, experts monitoring the arms embargo and other sanctions against Somalia said: ""The threat posed by al-Shabab to peace, security and stability in Somalia goes beyond the impact of the group's conventional military action and asymmetric warfare to include sophisticated extortion and `taxation' systems, child recruitment practices and an effective propaganda machine.""
	The panel said al-Shabab raised more than the US$21 million it spent last year on fighters, weapons and intelligence. Its investigation found the extremist group generated approximately US$13 million in just four case studies -- a ""taxation"" checkpoint in Lower Juba, its extortion of businesses in Kismayo, two bank accounts associated with the group's collection of taxes on imports into the port in Mogadishu, and ""zakat"" -- an annual religious obligation.
	The resolution adopted by the Security Council ""notes with concern al-Shabab's ability to generate revenue and launder, store and transfer resources.""
	It calls on the Somali government ""to continue working with Somali financial authorities, private sector financial institutions and the international community to identify, assess and mitigate money laundering and terrorist financing risks."" It encouraged the government to consider a national identification program to help reduce the risks.
	The council condemned al-Shabab attacks in Somalia and beyond, saying the group ""continues to pose a serious threat to the peace, security and stability of Somalia and the region, particularly through its increased use of improvised explosive devices."" It also expressed ""grave concern"" at the presence of affiliates linked to the Islamic State extremist group in Somalia.
	The resolution demands that countries prevent the sale, supply or transfer of a list of components including explosive materials, explosive precursors, explosive-related equipment and related technology ""if there is sufficient evidence to demonstrate that the item(s) will be used, or a significant risk they may be used, in the manufacture in Somalia of improvised explosive devices.""
	It requires any country supplying an item on the list to Somalia to notify the committee monitoring U.N. sanctions at least 15 days in advance with details and the purpose for the sale or transfer.
	Russia's deputy U.N. ambassador, Anna Evstigneeva, noted that the amendments ""meant to optimize the arms embargo"" were made at the Somali government's request and expressed hope that ""they will support normalization and reduce the terrorist threat coming, in the first place, from Al-Shabaab.""
	But she said Russia abstained because the resolution didn't take on board ""our principled and duly substantiated proposals,"" including references to Djibouti and Eritrea, whose relations pose ""no threat to international peace and security,"" and to human rights in Somalia, which should be dealt with by the Geneva-based Human Rights Council.
	China's deputy U.N. ambassador, Dai Bing, said Beijing abstained because the council didn't accept its amendments calling for the council to explore benchmarks for assessing the lifting of the arms embargo on Somalia weren't accepted.
	""The current embargo has been a serious impediment to enhance security capacity of the Somali government,"" he said. ""The text fails to make a deep response to the strong desire of the Somali government to have the arms embargo lifted.""
	U.S. political co-ordinator Rodney Hunter welcomed the continuation of U.N. sanctions and the extension of the work of the panel of experts for another 12 months.
	He said every council member has committed to uphold the arms embargo ""in the interest of securing peace and stability both in Somalia, and in the broader region."" To achieve that, Hunter said, the United States also supports ""the increased focus on thwarting Al-Shabaab's exploitation of the financial system."""

                ",https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/coronavirus/europe-gates-pledge-funds-to-get-vaccines-for-poor-nations-1.5186399,"PARIS -- 
	European governments and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation pledged Thursday to provide hundreds of millions of dollars in emergency funds for a global effort aimed at ensuring eventual vaccines against the coronavirus are quickly available to poor countries -- though it remains unclear how that might actually happen.
	The money will go to vaccine development and distribution efforts co-ordinated by a World Health Organization program called ACT-Accelerator. That includes Covax, an ambitious but troubled global project to buy and deliver virus vaccines for the world's poorest people.
	None of the experimental COVID-19 vaccines being tested has finished the advanced testing needed to prove their safety and efficacy, but several might have data to present in the coming weeks.
	""If people in low- and middle-income countries miss out on vaccines,...the virus will continue to spread, and the economic recovery will continue to be delayed,"" WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said Thursday at the Paris Peace Forum, where the pledges were announced.
	France and the European Union's executive commission each promised 100 million euros (about $118 million) for the WHO vaccine efforts. Spain promised 50 million euros (about US$59 million), and the Gates Foundation promised $70 million (about 59.3 million euros).
	Germany and other European governments have already pledged similar funds. The new financing is in addition to the funds that countries previously contributed to Covax.
	Criticizing rich countries that he said are ordering many more vaccines than they have people, Tedros said, ""This is a moment for saying `no' to vaccine nationalism and `yes' to all our shared humanity.""
	Britain, for example, has ordered 350 million vaccine doses for its population of about 67 million, although some vaccines require two doses. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has repeatedly promised that U.K. residents will be ""at the front of the pack"" for vaccine delivery.
	The vast majority of the world's expected COVID-19 vaccine supplies through 2021 have already been reserved by rich countries. It's therefore very unlikely that the developing world will get any significant amounts next year unless vaccine manufacturers can significantly ramp up capacity or intellectual property issues are addressed.
	WHO has avoided pushing drug companies to surrender their intellectual property rights on vaccines, arguing that such rights are not the main barrier to increasing the global supply. But many critics say WHO and its partners have been too unwilling to challenge the pharmaceutical industry.
	European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the EU is also funding efforts to ramp up manufacturing capacity to meet the huge global demand for a coronavirus vaccine.
	The governments chipping in funds Thursday have already signed multiple bilateral deals with pharmaceutical companies to secure their own supplies.
	Europe and the United States have seen a dramatic resurgence in reported virus infections in recent weeks. Many European countries are back under various levels of lockdowns and with their hospitals under heavy strain.
	""We do care, of course for European citizens, but also for the rest of the world,"" von der Leyen said at Thursday's meeting. ""The logic is that no one is safe until everyone is safe.""
	WHO chief Tedros said that the UN health agency is seeking $28.5 billion overall for COVID-fighting efforts, including $4.5 billion in emergency funds for the rest of this year.
	The money committed Thursday does not go to any specific vaccine. Pfizer appears to have the most advanced candidate at the moment, based on preliminary data it released this week, but it does not have a deal so far with Covaxe.
	Meanwhile, the United States, China and Russia have said they do not intend to join Covax, which is facing potential shortages of money, cargo planes and refrigeration.

	In light of Chinaâs ongoing crackdown on democracy, the federal government is offering new immigration programs aimed at attracting young people from Hong Kong to Canada, and is promising to expedite paperwork for Canadians living there to come home.
	Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Marco Mendicino made the announcement on Thursday, saying that he remains âdeeply concernedâ about the imposition of a sweeping national security law thatâs prompted large pro-democracy demonstrations in Hong Kong.
	In an effort to attract students and youth, Canada will be offering a new expedited three-year open work permit to recent Hong Kong graduates and those with essential work experience who want to come to Canada to continue their studies or find employment. Eligible applicants are those who have graduated from a recognized post-secondary institution in the last five years, and their spouses and children will also be eligible to seek permanent Canadian residency.
	There will also be two new streams to permanent residency for âthe best and the brightestâ Hong Kong residents already in Canada who have graduated with a degree in the last three years, and for those with recent degrees and a year of full-time work experience in Canada who want to come back here, once the existing COVID-19 travel restrictions are lifted.
	Mendicino said the first applicants could be eligible to come to Canada in âearly 2021.â
	These new measures come on the heels of China removing four democratically elected lawmakers from office in Hong Kong, which Canadaâs Foreign Affairs Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne has called âa further assault on Hong Kongâs high degree of freedoms.â
	In a statement Champagne called it a âconcerning disregardâ for Hong Kongâs autonomy and said Canada stands with the people of Hong Kong.
	âWe are deeply disappointed that China has chosen to break its international obligations,â the foreign affairs minister said.
	In response to the legislation, Canada has frozen its extradition treaty and revised its Hong Kong travel advice, but has yet to move to offer a more widespread asylum stream or expedite asylum claim approvals to Hong Kong residents looking to leave.
	Mendicino said that pro-democracy protesters are able to claim asylum or apply to other Canadian immigration programs so long as they have not committed any crime that would be recognized by Canadian law.
	âWe remain very concerned with the situation in Hong Kong and as I said, that is very much the backdrop to this announcement today, but at the same time what we are highlighting is that in these new immigration routes, we see a silver lining. A silver lining for young Hong Kongers who may wish to come work in Canada, study in Canada, bring their families in Canada and build a better life in Canada,â Mendicino said.
	However, Alliance Canada Hong Kong's Cherie Wong told CTV News that when protesters are arrested in Hong Kong, their travel documents are often confiscated so additional resources may be needed to help eligible applicants leave.
	âI fear for the safety of a lot of folks, my frontline activist friends, my fellow Canadians in Hong Kong and in China,â she said. âI think today is a great example that Canada has taken a strong step in protesting what China has been doing to Hong Kong, but it is only one first small step and we have more to do.â
	From the perspective of Vivian Tam, a Canadian professor living in Hong Kong, every day the situation gets âa little bit worse.â
	She said that she has peers who are looking to get out of Hong Kong and are assessing the offerings from the U.K. and Canada, and right now the U.K. is processing applications faster.
	Conservative immigration critic Raquel Dancho echoed this, saying in a statement that Canada should âput in place a clear, expedited path for pro-democracy protestors and political refugees fleeing Hong Kong.â
	âCanada needs to do more than offer Hong Kongâs pro-democracy activists an economic immigration system crippled by years-long backlogs and beset by ongoing delays because of the COVID-19 pandemic,â Dancho said.
	But immigration lawyer Chantal Desloges is questioning the rationale behind the federal governmentâs decision to target these programs at younger, highly-educated foreign nationals.
	âThere are all around the world various situations where people are under threat of political persecution or other very serious situations, and why do we have a special program for Hong Kong that exists only for these people as opposed to a broader program that might help people from other countries?â she said.
	âWhat is so special about the situation in Hong Kong that is compelling the government to take this exceptional measure?â asked Desloges.
	These measures come in addition to a promise of expediting document application such as family sponsorship for Canadians currently living in Hong Kong who want to come home.
	The minister emphasized in his announcement that Canadians and Canadian permanent residents in Hong Kong can return to Canada at any time, and family members in Hong Kong of Canadians and Canadian permanent residents can also travel to Canada under the current compassionate exemptions to travel restrictions, though they must quarantine for 14 days upon arrival.
	Ottawaâs top diplomat in Hong Kong told MPs on the Special Committee on Canada-China Relations on Nov. 2 that the federal government had made preparations to evacuate some 300,000 Canadian citizens out of Hong Kong should the situation worsen.
	âWe have detailed plans in place, and we have resources available and identified to cover a range of situations up to and including a situation where the urgent departure of a large number of Canadians would be necessary,â Jeff Nankivell, Canadaâs consul general in Hong Kong and Macau said.
	In a separate press conference where Canadian politicians focused in on the situation in China, MPs on the House of Commons Subcommittee on International Human Rights, discussed a report they recently put out on the situation of the Uyghurs in China, saying they felt it was important for Canadians to be aware of what has been occurring.
	In its findings released on Oct. 21, the committee unanimously agreed the actions of the Chinese government constitutes a genocide of the Muslim minority in Xinjiang through mass detentions, forced labour, state surveillance, and imposed population control.
	âThis is a non-partisan issue, this is a humanitarian issue, this is an issue of genocide, of crimes against humanity,â said Liberal MP Sameer Zuberi.
	The MPs warned in the report that âif the international community does not condemn the human rights abuses in Xinjiang province by the Government of China, a precedent will be set, and these methods will be adopted by other regimes.â
	Last month during a press conference reflecting on the 50th anniversary of the establishment of now-strained diplomatic relations between China and Canada, Chinaâs Ambassador to Canada Cong Peiwu cautioned the federal government about interfering in internal Chinese affairs.

                ",https://www.ctvnews.ca/world/u-s-envoy-insists-pressure-on-iran-will-persist-under-biden-1.5185870,"ABU DHABI, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES  -- 
	The U.S. special representative for Iran insisted Thursday that a pressure campaign of sanctions targeting Iran would persist into the administration of Joe Biden, even as the president-elect has pledged to potentially return America to Tehran's nuclear deal with world powers.
	Elliot Abrams, who also serves as the U.S. special representative to Venezuela, said sanctions targeting Iran for human rights violations, its ballistic missile program and its regional influence would go on. That, as well as continued scrutiny by United Nations inspectors and American partners in the Mideast, would maintain that pressure, he said.
	Iran now has far more uranium than allowed under the deal since U.S. President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew from the accord in 2018. The Mideast also has been roiled by tensions between Tehran and Washington, which pushed the two countries to the brink of war at the beginning of the year.
	""Even if you went back to the (deal) and even if the Iranians were willing to return ... this newly enriched uranium, you would not have solved these really fundamental questions of whether Iran is going to be permitted to violate long-term commitments it has made to the world community,"" Abrams told The Associated Press in an interview at the U.S. Embassy in Abu Dhabi.
	Iran's politicians have increasingly discussed the possibility of the U.S. returning to the deal, which saw Iran limit its enrichment of uranium in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions.
	Alireza Miryousefi, a spokesman for Iran's mission to the UN, dismissed Abram's comments.
	""The policy of maximum pressure and sanctions against Iran has failed,"" Miryousefi told the AP. ""The U.S. effort to abuse this corrupt policy is futile and will only lead to further isolation of the U.S. on the international stage.""
	Abrams replaced Brian Hook as America's envoy on Iran, who announced he'd leave his post in August after serving as the face of Trump's maximum-pressure campaign. That effort has floundered internationally as the U.S. and its Gulf Arab allies failed to convince the UN to stop an arms embargo on Iran from expiring in October.
	Iran's enriched uranium stockpile, which would have been under 300 kilograms (660 pounds) in the deal, now stands at over 2,440 kilograms (5,380 pounds) , according to the latest report by UN inspectors. That's potentially enough material to make at least two nuclear weapons, experts say, if Iran chose to pursue the bomb.
	Iran also is enriching uranium to as much as 4.5% purity, higher than allowed under the accord but still far lower than weapons-grade levels of 90%. Tehran abandoned all limits on its enrichment months after Trump's pullout from the agreement, even as the deal's other international partners China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom and Germany have tried unsuccessfully to salvage it.
	Meanwhile, Iran has begun construction at its underground Natanz enrichment site after a fire and explosion it described as ""sabotage"" struck its advanced centrifuge assembly plant in July.
	Abrams described the construction as ""another Iranian challenge"" to the International Atomic Energy Agency, the UN agency that Iran still allows to monitor its nuclear sites. He also criticized Iran for its slow response in allowing the IAEA to investigate a suspicious site outside of Tehran where it discovered particles of uranium of man-made origin.
	Iran long has insisted its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes. However, the IAEA has said Iran ""carried out activities relevant to the development of a nuclear explosive device"" in a ""structured program"" through the end of 2003.
	""Iran denies that it ever had a nuclear weapons program,"" Abrams said. ""Therefore, it can't now say, well, things you found from 2003, were part of our old nuclear weapons program. They're caught in their own lie.""
	Abrams mentioned U.S. citizens still imprisoned by Iran, who activists and their families insist are chips in future negotiations. He also said the United Arab Emirates' normalization deal with Israel also put new pressure on Iran, especially as the U.S. plans a $23 billion arms deal for Emiratis to purchase F-35 stealth fighter jets and drones.
	""I hope that next year the leverage that we've built up through our sanctions program is used (with) any form of pressure including, for example, Iranian fears about a developing relationship between Israel and Arab states in the region,"" he said. ""All of this pressure should be brought to bear to get Iran to change its conduct.""
	In the 1980s, during the Reagan administration, Abrams worked in the State Department and convinced the sultan of Brunei to deposit $10 million in a White House-controlled Swiss bank account to aid Nicaragua's Contra rebels despite a Congressional ban. But the White House later put the money into the wrong account in a clerical error, as investigators later discovered.
	Abrams, now 72, ultimately co-operated with those investigating the so-called Iran-Contra Affair and pleaded guilty to two misdemeanour charges. Then-President George H.W. Bush pardoned him in 1992."

	As the coronavirus exploded around the globe, scientists at the World Health Organization were sometimes privately frustrated by the mistakes made by some of their top donor countries but reluctant to say so publicly, leaked recordings of internal meetings show.
	After sharp criticism for not taking a stronger role in curbing the pandemic, the UN health agency holds its annual meeting this week under intense pressure to reform. WHO is also hoping that U.S. President-elect Joe Biden will reverse a decision by Washington to leave the organization made by the Trump administration in June.
	One of WHO's central dilemmas is that it has no enforcement powers or authority to independently investigate epidemics. Instead, the agency relies on behind-the-scenes talks and countries' co-operation.
	As the pandemic gained pace, WHO often shied away from calling out some of its biggest donors, including Japan, France and Britain. WHO scientists labeled some of their approaches as ""macabre"" and ""an unfortunate laboratory to study the virus,"" according to dozens of leaked recordings of internal WHO meetings and documents from January to April obtained by The Associated Press.
	""By not speaking up when countries are doing questionable things, WHO is undermining its own authority while the planet burns,"" said Sophie Harman, a professor of international politics at Queen Mary University in London.
	Others said it would be politically unwise for WHO to be too outspoken unless countries give the agency more power.
	""If Tedros was to take a very aggressive stance toward member countries, there would be repercussions,"" said Suerie Moon, co-director of the Global Health Centre at the Graduate Institute of Geneva, referring to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.
	WHO spokeswoman Farah Dakhlallah said that since the beginning of the coronavirus outbreak, ""WHO officials have had and continue to have, frank and open discussions with government counterparts ÎÃÂª We are proud of an organizational culture that fosters candid discussions.""
	It's not unprecedented for WHO to publicly question its member states. It threatened to close its China office when the country was hiding cases during the SARS outbreak and loudly called for Nigeria to reverse its boycott of the polio vaccine in 2003.
	WHO's reticence to call out countries started with China, as the AP earlier reported. Despite a January meeting between Tedros and Chinese President Xi Jinping, information from Beijing was still sparse throughout February. Maria Van Kerkhove, WHO's technical lead for COVID-19, noted that the agency lacked ""enough detail to say what has worked and what hasn't.""
	WHO scientists soon grew concerned about Japan. On Feb. 1, a passenger who disembarked the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Hong Kong tested positive for the coronavirus. At the ship's next stop in Yokohama, authorities put all 3,711 people aboard under lockdown.
	WHO emergencies chief Michael Ryan told reporters at the time: ""Let's be careful here not to overreact."" But on Feb. 10, the case count nearly doubled overnight.
	""(That's) not surprising given the nature of the response of the investigation,"" Ryan said at an internal meeting, noting Japan had only assigned a small number of epidemiologists to investigate.
	Dr. Thomas Grein, WHO's chief of acute events management team, said they had failed to glean much information from their Japanese counterparts, calling it a ""very, very sensitive issue.""
	Although WHO was keenly aware the situation was deteriorating, scientists said the outbreak could help in understanding COVID-19 transmission.
	""(It's) unfortunate, but a useful opportunity to study the natural history of the virus,"" Ryan said.
	In late February, the virus also gained a foothold in Italy, turning Europe into the epicenter of the pandemic.
	At WHO, Grein told his colleagues that WHO's efforts to get more detail about the spiraling outbreaks in Italy and elsewhere had ""spectacularly failed"" as officials worried about the lack of action taken across Europe.
	Yet on March 8, Tedros tweeted that ""the government & the people of Italy are taking bold, courageous steps aimed at slowing the spread of the .coronavirus.""
	Lawrence Gostin, director of the WHO Collaborating Center on Public Health Law and Human Rights at Georgetown University, said WHO should be obligated to report when countries are not sharing data, saying it was dangerous for the agency to be ""flying blind.""
	WHO also complained in private about Western countries hoarding scarce pandemic supplies.
	""We had the terrible situation yesterday with (protective personal equipment) where all the supplies were requisitioned in France and we lost access,"" Ryan told his colleagues.
	As countries across Europe adopted social distancing measures and cancelled mass gatherings in early March, Ryan noticed one country did not: Britain.
	""There isn't a single sports event in Europe and yet all of the Premier League matches in the U.K. are to go ahead,"" he said. Ryan described Britain's pandemic strategy as ""problematic"" after hearing the U.K.'s chief scientific officer say the country was aiming for herd immunity.
	""For that to happen, hundreds of thousands and millions of older people are going to become infected and there is just going to be so much death,"" Ryan said. Still, he said the different approaches to tackling COVID-19 globally could prove to be ""a massive ecological study"" that would allow WHO to document what worked.
	""It's macabre in some ways, but it's reality,"" he said.
	Going forward, WHO's role trying to stop the pandemic will depend in part on the independent panel review. Harman, the expert from Queen Mary University, sympathized that WHO had enormous responsibility in the early months of COVID-19, but said even greater challenges loom now.
	""With the next wave of the pandemic, I think the time for quiet diplomacy has passed,"" she said.

              Republican senators push for Biden to receive intelligence briefings
          
","
              As U.S. President Donald Trump refuses to allow President-elect Joe Biden to receive intelligence briefings -- even those he was getting during the campaign -- an increasing number of Trump's allies are calling for Biden to have access to the information.

	As U.S. President Donald Trump refuses to allow President-elect Joe Biden to receive intelligence briefings -- even those he was getting during the campaign -- an increasing number of Trump's allies are calling for Biden to have access to the information.
	""I just don't know of any justification for withholding the briefing,"" Texas Sen. John Cornyn, a member of the Senate intelligence committee, said Thursday.
	""I see no problem with that,"" said Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley, the Republican Party's longest-serving senator.
	""I think so, yes,"" said Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, one of Trump's closest confidants, when asked if Biden should be briefed.
	The Senate Republicans advocated for Biden to receive the classified national security information even as they refused to acknowledge that the Democrat has won the presidential election, citing Trump's baseless claims of fraudulent votes.
	""At this point at least, I think he should absolutely be getting intelligence briefings,"" Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley said of Biden. ""The briefings he's been getting as a candidate should continue. I think he should continue to get what he's been getting and then let's get on with the resolutions on some of these disputes.""
	The GOP pile-on supporting the intelligence briefings amounted to miniscule cracks in support for Trump as he refuses to concede the race, but was also in line with Republicans' occasional, carefully worded answers about his actions during his presidency. While only a handful of Republicans have called Biden the president-elect, most were comfortable Thursday challenging the Trump administration on withholding intelligence information, which could constitute a national security risk when Biden assumes office.
	""Both sides need to have access to the information because we don't know who the president is going to be, so allow that part of this process to still continue just for the sake of national security,"" said Sen. James Lankford, echoing Trump's unsubstantiated claims of voting problems.
	Lankford said he would pressure Trump administration bureaucrats to move ahead with the process of transition so Biden could be read in on classified matters. He said Wednesday that he would ""get involved"" if that didn't move forward.
	For now, the office of National Intelligence Director John Ratcliffe, a loyal ally to Trump, says it can't begin talking with the Biden transition team until the government starts that transition process. But the Trump administration is delaying it.
	Ratcliffe's office, which oversees more than a dozen U.S. intelligence agencies, said it must follow the Presidential Transition Act, which requires the General Services Administration to first ascertain the winner of the election, which Trump is contesting without evidence. GSA administrator Emily Murphy, who was appointed by Trump, has not yet officially designated Biden as the president-elect.
	Intelligence agencies have given generalized intelligence briefings -- minus information on covert operations and sources and methods -- for presidential nominees since 1952. President Harry S. Truman authorized them for both parties' candidates because he was upset about not learning about the U.S. effort to develop an atomic bomb until 12 days into his presidency.
	Biden was receiving those briefings, along with counterintelligence briefings, but is no longer getting that information, according to a person familiar with the process who was not authorized to discuss it publicly. A spokesman for Biden's transition team declined to comment.
	Biden has played down the significance of the delay in getting access to the intelligence.
	""Look, access to classified information is useful. But I'm not in a position to make any decisions on those issues anyway,"" Biden said Tuesday. ""As I said, one president at a time. He will be president until Jan. 20. It would be nice to have it, but it's not critical.""
	Biden is familiar with the President's Daily Brief, having read the most sensitive intelligence document prepared for U.S. officials during his eight years as vice-president. But threats are ever-changing and as Inauguration Day nears, his need for Trump to let him get eyes on the classified information will become more critical.
	National security and intelligence experts say they hope Trump changes his mind, citing the need for an incoming president to be fully prepared to confront any national security issues on Day One.
	U.S. adversaries can take advantage of the country during an American presidential transition, and key foreign issues will be bearing down on Biden the moment he steps into the Oval Office in January.
	For example, unless Trump extends or negotiates a new nuclear arms accord with Russia before Inauguration Day, Biden will have only 16 days to act before the expiration of the last remaining treaty reining in the world's two largest nuclear arsenals. Perhaps U.S. spies have picked up tidbits about the Russians' red lines in the negotiations or about weapons it really wants to keep out of the treaty.
	That's the type of information that might be in the daily summary of high-level, classified information and analysis on national security issues that's been offered to presidents since 1946.
	Having access to it also could help Biden craft a possible response to North Korea, which has a history of firing off missiles or conducting nuclear tests shortly before or after a new president takes office.
	Biden, a former vice-president, has decades of experience in foreign affairs and national security. But he probably has not been privy to the latest details about how Iran is back to enriching uranium or the active cyber attack operations of Russia, China and Iran. China's crackdown on Hong Kong is heating up. The threat from Islamic extremists, although curbed, still remains.
	The 9-11 Commission Report on the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks warns of the danger in slow-walking presidential transition work in general, not just the intelligence piece. The George W. Bush administration didn't have its deputy Cabinet officers in place until the spring of 2001 and critical subcabinet positions were not confirmed until that summer -- if then, the report said.
	""President-elect Joe Biden and his transition team should not suffer a similar delay,"" John Podesta, who served as White House chief of staff under Clinton, and Bush's chief of staff Andrew Card wrote this week in The Washington Post. ""We have since learned the serious costs of a delayed transition.""

              Unwelcome milestone: California nears million COVID-19 cases

              California may soon be the second state -- behind Texas -- to eclipse a million known cases. The grim milestone in a state of 40 million comes as the U.S. has surpassed 10 million infections.

                ",https://www.ctvnews.ca/world/unwelcome-milestone-california-nears-million-covid-19-cases-1.5185614,"LOS ANGELES -- 
	A month ago, Antonio Gomez III was a healthy 46-year-old struggling like so many others to balance work and parenting during the coronavirus pandemic.
	This week, he's struggling to breathe after a three-week bout with the virus.
	Gomez said he let down his guard to see his parents and contracted one of the nearly 1 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 in California. For months, the virus has hammered the economy, disproportionately affected the poor and upended daily life -- and now the state and the rest of the country are trying to curb another surge of infections.
	California will be the second state -- behind Texas -- to eclipse a million known cases. The grim milestone in a state of 40 million comes as the U.S. has surpassed 10 million infections.
	The timeline of COVID-19 in America often comes back to California. It had some of the earliest known cases among travellers from China, where the outbreak began. The Feb. 6 death of a San Jose woman is the first known coronavirus fatality in the U.S. That same month, California recorded the first U.S. case not related to travel and the first infection spread within the community.
	On March 19, Gov. Gavin Newsom issued the nation's first statewide stay-at-home order, shuttering businesses and schools to try to prevent hospital overcrowding.
	The spread slowed, but California faced the same challenges as other states: providing enough protective gear for health workers, doing enough testing and providing timely results, tracking infections and those potentially exposed.
	As the state tried to balance public health and the economy, cases rose as it relaxed business restrictions. Eleven counties this week had to reimpose limits.
	The virus has struck poor Californians and Latinos especially hard. Latinos make up 39 per cent of the population but account for more than 60 per cent of infections.
	In working-class neighbourhoods near downtown Los Angeles, one in five people tested positive at community clinics during the pandemic's early days, said Jim Mangia, president and chief executive of St. John's Well Child and Family Center.
	Many caught the virus in essential low-wage jobs or on public transit and brought it back to crowded homes.
	""The tragedy of it all is that patients are getting infected at their work, they come to us and get tested, and they're not being allowed to come back to work until they have a negative test,"" Mangia said. ""So, we have patients who have lost their jobs, lost their homes.""
	Maria Elena Torres faces that prospect. In late October, the 52-year-old housecleaner from Long Beach started feeling lethargic. Then, her head ached. When nausea kicked in, she called the clinic. By the time she was diagnosed a few days later, she was vomiting so severely she had to pray for strength to make it back to her bedroom.
	Torres doesn't know how she got infected. Three weeks later, she still has bouts of nausea and chills, which she nurses with oregano tea. She can't work and risks falling behind on $1,200 in monthly bills. The office that collects her rent told her she can pay 25 per cent now and the rest in 2021.
	""I said, `That's not help,""' Torres said. ""`If the virus doesn't kill me, you all are going to kill me with a heart attack.""'
	The clinic is conducting follow-up checks to assess the long-term impact of the virus, finding patients with stress and anxiety. ""People are suffering,"" Mangia said.
	With people worn out by isolation, health officials warned against get-togethers as the holidays approach and people spend more time indoors, where the virus spreads more easily.
	That's what happened to Gomez, a finance professional living in Simi Valley with his wife, a nurse, and three children, ages 1 to 6.
	As his birthday approached last month, Gomez decided to let his parents visit. They had been following social restrictions, and he feared they were becoming depressed.
	Gomez and his wife had done the right things -- wearing masks, social distancing -- but were tired from juggling work and child care and missed their family.
	""We thought even in spite of the risks, to allow my parents to visit for a few days and have some time where we could be together,"" Gomez said Tuesday, breathing supplemental oxygen. ""Somewhere along the way, the virus came through my father, managed to infect him, and he carried it right into our house.""
	On Gomez's 47th birthday, his father had a runny nose and cough. The father learned he had COVID-19 two days later after returning home. Gomez said flu-like symptoms ""hit me hard and hit me fast"" the following day.
	On day six, as it became harder to breathe, he went to the emergency room. He was discharged and told to return if his condition worsened.
	Five days later, he did. He'd be at Providence Cedars-Sinai Tarzana Medical Center for 12 days with acute respiratory failure. He received new treatments, such as remdesivir, the steroid dexamethasone and an experimental anti-inflammation drug.
	""My body was spiraling downwards,"" he said. ""If things continued to progress for the worse, who knows what would have happened.""
	Dr. Tom Yadegar, a pulmonologist who treated Gomez, said he fears more cases like Gomez's as people gather for the holidays.
	""He's one who got super sick and that is, unfortunately, what we see,"" Yadegar said. ""Some have no symptoms. You can get infected and have very minimal symptoms, and your spouse can get infected and she can die.""
	Gomez's father was hospitalized for five days. His mother got sick but managed her symptoms at home. His wife, also infected, did the same while looking after their children.
	Gomez has a lot to be thankful for this Thanksgiving. But he's going to celebrate it only with his wife and kids.
	""I absolutely believe I made the wrong decision to allow (my parents) to come,"" Gomez said. ""I really want people to think twice, to know the real risks to getting together with family for even a few hours on Thanksgiving or Christmas Day.

              Hong Kong pro-democracy legislators hand in resignations

              Pro-democracy legislators in Hong Kong began resigning Thursday to protest the expulsion of four other lawmakers, heightening a conflict with Beijing over the semi-autonomous Chinese territory's future.

	Pro-democracy legislators in Hong Kong began resigning Thursday to protest the expulsion of four other lawmakers, heightening a conflict with Beijing over the semi-autonomous Chinese territory's future.
	Pro-democracy activists say China's ruling Communist Party, which has tightened control in Hong Kong in response to demands for more democracy, is destroying the civil liberties and rights that were promised the territory when Britain returned it to China in 1997.
	The 15 remaining lawmakers in the pro-democracy bloc said Wednesday they will resign en masse after China's central government passed a resolution this week that led to the four lawmakers' disqualification.
	The four had urged foreign governments to sanction China and Hong Kong over Beijing's crackdown on dissent in the territory. The Communist Party accused them of violating their oaths of office.
	Most of the 15 lawmakers did not attend a regular session of the legislature on Thursday, and some later handed in resignation letters at the Legislative Council's secretariat.
	China sharply criticized the move. Its Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office called the mass resignation âan open challengeâ to the authority of the central government and the Basic Law, Hong Kong's constitution.
	âIf these lawmakers hope to use their resignation to provoke opposition and beg for foreign interference, they have miscalculated,â it said in a statement.
	Wu Chi-wai, the head of the pro-democracy bloc, said the Chinese and Hong Kong governments were trying to take away the separation of powers in the city, since the ousting of the four lawmakers bypassed the courts.
	âWe lost our check-and-balance power, and all the constitutional power in Hong Kong rests in the chief executive's hands,â Wu said.
	He said it was the end of the city's âone country, two systemsâ framework under which Hong Kong enjoyed autonomy and freedoms not found on the mainland since it was returned to China in 1997.
	Claudia Mo, a pro-democracy lawmaker who also handed in her resignation, said: âWe are quitting the legislature only at this juncture. We're not quitting Hong Kong's democracy fight.â
	Earlier in the day, one of the pro-democracy lawmakers, Lam Cheuk-ting, unfurled a banner from a balcony inside the Legislative Council building saying city leader Carrie Lam had brought disaster to Hong Kong and its people, and that her infamy would last ten thousand years.
	The mass departure will leave Hong Kong's legislature with just 43 legislators, 41 of whom belong to the pro-Beijing bloc. This means that the legislature could pass bills favoured by Beijing with little opposition.
	The lawmakers announced their decision to resign hours after the Hong Kong government said it was disqualifying the four legislators - Alvin Yeung, Dennis Kwok, Kwok Ka-ki and Kenneth Leung.
	A resolution passed this week by the Standing Committee of China's National People's Congress said that any lawmaker who supports Hong Kong's independence, refuses to acknowledge China's sovereignty over the city, threatens national security, or asks external forces to interfere in the city's affairs should be disqualified.
	Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin on Thursday reiterated Beijing's support for Hong Kong's government in âfulfilling its duty according to the NPC Standing Committee's decision.â
	âNo country will turn a blind eye to acts of betrayal of the country by public officials, including members of the Legislative Council, who break their oaths of office,â Wang said at a daily news briefing.
	Britain, the United States, Australia and the EU denounced China's move.
	The U.K. summoned China's ambassador in London to register âdeep concern at this latest action by his government,â Foreign Office minister Nigel Adams told lawmakers Thursday.
	Adams said it was âanother sad day for the people of Hong Kongâ and that the British government has declared it the third breach of the Sino-British Joint Declaration on the territory's handover since it came into force in 1997 and the second time in the last six months.
	He said China's actions are âdesigned to harass and stifle all voices critical of China's policies.â
	Hong Kong's people, he added, are left now with a âneutered legislature.â
	President Donald Trump's national security adviser, Robert O'Brien, said the Chinese Communist Party has violated its international commitment to the people of Hong Kong.
	â'One country, two systems' is now merely a fig leaf covering for the CCP's expanding one-party dictatorship in Hong Kong,â he said.
	Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne said the disqualification of the four lawmakers âseriously underminedâ Hong Kong's democratic processes and institutions.
	The EU's foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, said China's moves âconstitute a further severe blow to political pluralism and freedom of opinion in Hong Kong.â
	âWe call for the immediate reversal of these decisions by the authorities in Beijing and Hong Kong Government and for the immediate reinstatement of the Legislative Council members,â he said in a statement.
	In recent months, Beijing has increasingly clamped down on Hong Kong, despite promising when it took control in 1997 to leave the territory's more open legal and economic systems intact for 50 years until 2047.
	Beijing imposed a national security law in June that some have labeled draconian after anti-government protests rocked the city for months last year, and it has used it to crack down on opposition voices.
	In response, the U.S. levelled sanctions on several officials, including Carrie Lam. Several Western countries have suspended their extradition treaties with the territory, and Australia and Britain have offered Hong Kongers easier paths to settle in those countries.
	Earlier in the year, the four lawmakers were barred from seeking reelection in a vote originally scheduled for September.
	The government eventually postponed the election by a year, citing the coronavirus. The pro-democracy camp criticized the move as an attempt to block them from winning a majority of seats in the legislature - which was a possibility in the election.

              Typhoon-ravaged northeast Philippines pummeled by new storm

              A typhoon swelled rivers and flooded low-lying areas as it passed over the storm-battered northeast Philippines, where rescuers were deployed early Thursday to help people flee the rising waters.

	A typhoon swelled rivers and flooded low-lying areas as it passed over the storm-battered northeast Philippines, where rescuers were deployed early Thursday to help people flee the rising waters.
	The typhoon passed north of Manila between Bulacan and Pampanga provinces, toppling trees and knocking out power. Officials had said previously that nearly 200,000 people had been evacuated, some of them forcibly, from vulnerable coastal and low-lying areas.
	Rescue teams were deployed to flooded areas in Rizal province near the capital, Adm. George Ursabia, the coast guard chief, told DZBB radio.
	From the Rizal town of Rodriguez, resident Yolanda Laude called the radio station to ask to be rescued. ""We're all on the roof. The water has risen high and reached our second floor. We've been here on the roof since 3 a.m., there are six families on our roof,"" she told DZBB, which asked for details of her location.
	In Pasig city in metropolitan Manila, Carla May Juico and her family went up to the third and last floor of their house as the waters rose during the night. Now, the water has reached the third floor. ""We're thinking of going to the roof. We'll asked to be rescued,"" she told DZBB by phone.
	Marikina city Mayor Marcie Teodoro said the fierce winds knocked down power lines overnight, leaving many areas without power and internet connection. Heavy rains also flooded many areas and the Marikina River was swollen.
	""There are many areas that historically don't get flooded but now, they are swamped like the city hall,"" he told DZBB radio.
	Typhoon Vamco had maximum winds of 130 kilometres per hour (80 mph) with stronger gusts Thursday morning. It was moving west-northwest at 30 kph (19 mph) and would soon leave the main Luzon Island for the South China Sea.
	Flooding in 32 villages and a few landslides were already reported Wednesday from the typhoon, and disaster officials said a man died and three other people were missing, without immediately providing details.
	The government's main disaster-response agency had pleaded to the media to relay typhoon alerts in northeastern areas devastated by the earlier Typhoon Goni, saying the agency's messages could not be sent by cellphones due to damaged telecommunications systems.
	Goni, one of the strongest tropical cyclones in the world this year, left more than 30 people dead or missing and damaged or destroyed more than 270,000 houses and shanties, many along coastal villages. Tens of thousands of people remain displaced.
	The Philippines is hit by about 20 typhoons and storms each year. It's also located on the so-called Pacific ""Ring of Fire,"" where earthquakes and volcanic eruptions are common, making it one of the world's most disaster-prone countries.

              Future of business travel unclear as virus upends work life
          
","
              As the pandemic continues and some flights remain grounded, the future of business travel remains unknown for the many airlines and hotel chains that depend on it.
        ","
                  Wednesday, Nov. 11, 2020
                ",https://www.ctvnews.ca/business/future-of-business-travel-unclear-as-virus-upends-work-life-1.5184872,"
	Brian Contreras represents the worst fears of the lucrative business travel industry.
	A partner account executive at a U.S. tech firm, Contreras was used to travelling frequently for his company. But nine months into the pandemic, he and thousands of others are working from home and dialing into video conferences instead of boarding planes.
	Contreras manages his North American accounts from Sacramento, California and doesn't expect to travel for work until the middle of next year. Even then, he's not sure how much he will need to.
	âMaybe it's just the acceptance of the new normal. I have all of the resources necessary to be on the calls, all of the communicative devices to make sure I can do my job,â he said. âThere's an element of face-to-face that's necessary, but I would be OK without it.â
	That trend could spell big trouble for hotels, airlines, convention centres and other industries that rely so heavily on business travellers like Contreras.
	Work travel represented 21% of the $8.9 trillion spent on global travel and tourism in 2019, according to the World Travel and Tourism Council.
	Delta Air Lines CEO Ed Bastian recently suggested business travel might settle into a ânew normalâ that is 10% to 20% lower than it used to be.
	âI do think corporate travel is going to come back faster than people suspect. I just don't know if it will be come back to the full volume,â Bastian told The Associated Press. Right now, Delta's business travel revenue is down 85%.
	Dubai-based MBC Group, which operates 18 television stations, says it's unlikely employees will travel as often once the pandemic ends because they've proven they don't need to.
	âWe have managed to deliver projects and negotiate deals very successfully, though remotely,â MBC spokesman Mazen Hayek said. MBC has reduced trips by more than 85%, Hayek said.
	Amazon, which told it employees to stop travelling in March, says it has saved nearly $1 billion in travel expenses so far this year. The online shopping giant, with more than 1.1 million employees, is the second-largest employer in the U.S.
	At Southwest Airlines, CEO Gary Kelly said while overall passenger revenue is down 70%, business travel - normally more than one-third of Southwest's traffic -- is off 90%.
	âI think that's going to continue for a long time. I'm very confident it will recover and pass 2019 levels, I just don't know when,â Kelly told the AP.
	U.S. hotels relied on business travel for around half their revenue in 2019, or closer to 60% in big cities like Washington, according to Cindy Estis Green, the CEO of hospitality data firm Kalibri Labs.
	Peter Belobaba, who teaches airline management at MIT, said business travel is down partly because some people are afraid to fly and partly because companies fear liability if employees contract COVID-19 while travelling for work.
	Companies have also reined in travel because times are lean, he said. ExxonMobil cut business travel in February - even before the pandemic's full impact was felt in the U.S. - because of falling global demand for oil.
	Those who want to travel may also be limited by travel restrictions, Belobaba added. Last month, Polestar CEO Thomas Ingenlath observed a mandatory 14-day quarantine in China after flying in from Sweden for the Beijing Auto Show.
	Polestar, an electric car brand jointly owned by Sweden's Volvo and China's Geely, has always tried to limit travel for environmental reasons. But the 14-day quarantine has restricted travel even further, said Kiki Liu, Polestar's head of communications.
	The cutback in travel has been a boon for teleconferencing services. Zoom said it had 370,200 customer businesses with at least 10 employees at the end of July, more than triple the number it had at the end of April.
	But for some workers, teleconferencing can't replace being there in person.
	Rebecca Lindland, an automotive consultant and founder of Rebecca Drives, used to travel 38 weeks each year for test drives and auto shows. This year, she didn't fly from March until September. Test drives have been cut back to regional events, so attendees don't have to travel as far.
	Lindland misses the downtime air travel gave her, and she's confident she can return to the skies safely. She wears a mask, and even before the pandemic she always carried Lysol wipes and hand sanitizer.
	âI've been wiping down my tray tables since 1985,â she said with a laugh.
	Sam Clarke, an assistant professor in the college of business at California State University San Marcos, agrees that some in-person events - like trade shows - will still be important in the future. But he thinks new kinds of business travel could also emerge.
	Lockdowns have taught employees how to adapt to different work environments, he says, so hotels, airlines and even cruise ships should beef up their connectivity and cater to business travellers.
	Late last month, Marriott introduced flexible options aimed at business travellers, including one-day stays with an evening check-out.
	Clarke also expects some companies will flip their travel. Instead of letting a few executives travel a lot, he said, companies could let most employees work from home and fly them all back to their headquarters once a year.
	Some businesses are already changing the way their work is done. Cynthia Kay and Co., a media production company based in Grand Rapids, Michigan, used to send its seven employees around the country to make videos for clients like Siemens.
	When travel came to a halt in March, the company invested in proprietary software and sent iPads and other equipment to clients so it could coach them through their own video shoots, President Cynthia Kay said.
	As a result, the company's sales are down only 15-20% even though its travel spending has plunged 75%.
	Still, Kay and her staff were eager to get back on the road once they felt they could do that safely. Kay began travelling again last month.
	âFor some people, this is the way they will work going forward,â Kay said. âBut you can't account for the spark that happens when you get people in the same room.â

              Next up in hunt for COVID-19 vaccine: Testing shots in kids
          
","
              The global hunt for a COVID-19 vaccine for kids is only just beginning â a lagging start that has some U.S. pediatricians worried they may not know if any shots work for young children in time for the next school year.

                  Wednesday, Nov. 11, 2020
                ",https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/coronavirus/next-up-in-hunt-for-covid-19-vaccine-testing-shots-in-kids-1.5184740,"
	The global hunt for a COVID-19 vaccine for kids is only just beginning â a lagging start that has some U.S. pediatricians worried they may not know if any shots work for young children in time for the next school year.
	Older adults may be most vulnerable to the coronavirus, but ending the pandemic will require vaccinating children, too. Last week, Pfizer Inc. received permission to test its vaccine in U.S. kids as young as 12, one of only a handful of attempts around the world to start exploring if any experimental shots being pushed for adults also can protect children.
	âI just figured the more people they have to do tests on, the quicker they can put out a vaccine and people can be safe and healthy,â said 16-year-old Katelyn Evans, who became the first teen to get an injection in the Pfizer study at Cincinnati Childrenâs Hospital.
	Multiple vaccine candidates are in final-stage studies in tens of thousands of adults, and scientists are hopeful that the next few months will bring evidence that at least some of them are safe and effective enough for widespread use.
	But when the first shots arrive, theyâre unlikely to be recommended for children. Vaccines canât be given to youngsters unless theyâve been tested in their age group -- a major hurdle in efforts to reopen schools and resume more normal activities that are critical to familiesâ well-being.
	âThe public doesnât understand that,â said Dr. Evan Anderson of Emory University, who has been pushing for pediatric testing of COVID-19 vaccines. While heâs encouraged by Pfizerâs study in adolescents, he finds it âvery concerningâ that children younger than 12 may not have a vaccine by next fall.
	Children represent about 10% of COVID-19 cases documented in the U.S. And while children are far less likely than adults to get seriously ill, about 120 have died in the U.S. alone, according to a tally by the American Academy of Pediatrics. Thatâs about how many U.S. children die from flu in an average year. Additionally, a small number have developed a serious inflammatory condition linked to the coronavirus.
	Overall, Anderson says COVID-19â²s impact on children is greater than some other diseases that require routine pediatric vaccinations.
	Aside from their own health risks is the still unanswered question about how easily children can infect others. In a letter to federal health officials, the AAP cited recent evidence that those over age 10 may spread the virus just as easily as adults do.
	Add missing school and other factors unique to children, and itâs unethical âto allow children to take on great burdens during this pandemic but not have the opportunity to benefit from a vaccine,â Dr. Sara Goza, president of the pediatrics academy, wrote.
	Globally, pediatric studies are only hesitantly emerging. In China, Sinovac and SinoPharm have opened studies that can test children as young as 3.
	A British study of a vaccine by AstraZeneca allows for testing of a low dose in certain children but the company says it wonât be recruiting youngsters until it has âsufficientâ safety data in adults.
	In the U.S., Moderna Inc., Johnson & Johnson and Novavax all hope to begin some pediatric research later in the year, in varying age groups.
	Doing so is critical, said Dr. Robert Frenck, who directs the Vaccine Research Center at Cincinnati Childrenâs.
	âIf we immunize adolescents -- and potentially move down into younger children -- weâre going to have the effect of keeping those children from getting infected. But then also they donât bring the infection home to parents and grandparents,â he said.
	Frenck is finding lots of interest in Pfizerâs adolescent testing, with 90 families seeking more information in just a week after his team issued a call for 16- and 17-year-old volunteers. The researchers plan to enroll 12- to 15-year-olds soon.
	Katelyn, the suburban Cincinnati volunteer, doesnât know if she got a dummy shot or the real vaccine. But the high school junior is excited to be part of the study. And with science class still fresh, she grasped the researchersâ explanation of how Pfizerâs vaccine works -- using a piece of genetic code to train the body to recognize if the coronavirus comes along.
	âIâve learned about DNA and RNA and all that stuff in biology in freshman year. And I guess I didnât really know, like, how it applied to the real world until now,â she said.
	It makes sense to start pediatric testing in teenagers and gradually work down in age, Frenck said, because adolescents usually receive adult-sized doses of other vaccines -- and so far with Pfizerâs shots, serious safety problems havenât emerged in adult testing.
	Assuming Pfizerâs shot is proven to work in adults, Frenck said the key will be if the vaccine revs up adolescentsâ immune systems the same way -- without different side effects. He said if all goes well, itâs possible scientists may have an answer about the 12-and-older group by spring.
	But younger children need their own testing. Anderson, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at Childrenâs Healthcare of Atlanta, said those studies may be more complex because smaller tots may need different doses or, because of their typically more robust immune systems, show different reactions to the shots.
	âIt is quite important for us to begin the process because this will take some time to do the studies the right way,â he said."

	K-Pop band Blackpink has sparked outrage in China after videos were circulated showing band members handling a giant panda cub in a South Korean zoo.
	The band aired footage of members holding Fu Bao -- the first panda to be born in South Korea -- in a clip posted to YouTube this month, Reuters reported. 
	According to South Korea's Yonhap news agency, Fu Bao was born at the Everland Resort theme park, about 20 miles south of Seoul, to pandas sent to the country in 2016 from China's Sichuan province.
	For years, China has sent giant pandas abroad as a sign of friendship and cooperation between Beijing and other countries -- part of a campaign known as ""panda diplomacy,"" fostering ties between governments while also offering foreigners a chance to see the rare animals in person.
	But Blackpink's clip, which showed band members touching the animal and was due to be aired as part of the band's ""24/365 with BLACKPINK"" reality series, generated an angry response. The clip is no longer available to view online.
	China's Wildlife Conservation Association issued a statement asking Everland Zoo to immediately stop allowing non-professional contact with giant panda cubs, claiming the zoo ""violated the professional requirements for the protection of giant pandas"" in allowing band members contact with the animal.
	""On November 5, the China Wildlife Conservation Association sent a formal letter to South Korea's Everland Zoo after the zoo violated the professional requirements for the protection of giant pandas as it organized performance-related personnel to have close contact with giant panda cubs and producing entertainment programs,"" the association said in a statement.
	""Here we ask the zoo to stop playing and disseminating related content videos. [We suggest to the zoo that] it is necessary to further strengthen management, scientific management and protection, and resolutely prevent such incidents from happening again,"" the association said.
	Blackpink said they had decided to postpone the release of the show, scheduled to be uploaded on Nov. 7, but said the visit with the panda was conducted in the presence of professional veterinarians and breeders, and following ""strict anti-virus management and hygiene rules.""
	The band, which became a global sensation after forming in 2016, added in a statement released on Twitter: ""In honor of the recommendations of panda experts and international cooperation practices saying that 'the behavior of non-professionals in close contact with baby pandas can cause misunderstanding of others,' we decided to delay the screening of related videos.""
	Still, users of the Chinese social media platform Weibo expressed anger. In the comment section of a news post detailing Blackpink's statement, thousands demanded an apology from the band.
	""They didn't explain why they touched the baby panda with heavy makeup! "" one user wrote, while another popular comment read: ""BLACKPINK should apologize.""
	Others directed their irritation at the theme park, with one popular comment asking: ""What was Everland doing? They are professionals. Jeez..""
	Giant pandas are among some of the rarest animals on the planet, though efforts to preserve the species have shown some success in recent years. There are only an estimated 1,800 of the creatures, which are considered ""vulnerable,"" living in the wild, according to the World Wildlife Fund."

	Chinese consumers spent over a hundred billion dollars during this year's Singles' Day shopping festival, signalling a rebound in consumption as China recovers from the coronavirus pandemic and a battering of the economy.
	From Nov. 1 to Nov. 11, shoppers spent 498.2 billion yuan (US$75.1 billion) on Taobao and Tmall, the e-commerce platforms operated by Alibaba, China's largest e-commerce company.
	The final sales figure exceeded last year's $38.4 billion over 24 hours, after Alibaba extended its sales period this year for the first time as it sought to help boost sales for merchants affected by the coronavirus pandemic.
	On rival platform JD.com, consumers racked up 271.5 billion yuan ($40.9 billion) in sales over the same period.
	The annual Singles' Day shopping festival, the world's largest of its kind, offers shoppers generous discounts on a variety of products, from fresh produce to luxury items.
	Merchants big and small, from small online stores to international brands like Apple, Nike and L'Oreal, participate in the festival by slashing prices on their products.
	The annual shopping festival is closely watched as a barometer for consumption in China. Alibaba, which pioneered the shopping festival, held its first Singles' Day sale in 2009. Over the past decade, the shopping bonanza has become the world's largest, regularly dwarfing Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales in the U.S.
	The Singles' Day festival is named as such because the main shopping day falls on Nov. 11, which when written numerically as 11.11 resembles ""bare branches"", a Chinese expression for the single and unattached."

	The Pacific island nation of Vanuatu, formerly one of the few places in the world untouched by coronavirus, has recorded its first COVID-19 case.
	This week, a 23-year-old man who'd returned from travelling to the U.S. tested positive while he was quarantining. The man, who'd flown back to Vanuatu on November 4, was asymptomatic, Vanuatu's health ministry said Tuesday.
	""Physical distancing and personal protection measures were applied and maintained during the flight, throughout the arrival process, during transport to and during registration at the quarantine facility,"" the ministry said in a news release.
	The man will remain in isolation until health clearance is given, the ministry said.
	Coronavirus has spread to 217 countries and territories, and there are over 51 million cases of COVID-19 worldwide. Over 1.3 million people have died from the virus since China reported its first case in late December 2019.
	Vanuatu, a country of nearly 300,000, had avoided recording any COVID-19 cases. It likely avoided the virus because of its remote location -- it's over 1,000 miles from Australia, its largest neighbor -- and because it's made up of several smaller, unconnected islands.
	Vanuatu considers the single case of COVID-19 a ""border case"" and will move to contain the spread of the virus. It won't shut down schools or workplaces or impose restrictions on gatherings, but it will maintain handwashing stations throughout the country and encourage residents to follow hygiene measures.
	The country's next stage, if a cluster of cases are recorded, will include travel restrictions between islands and the use of masks for people with COVID-19 symptoms."

	The European Union expressed hope Wednesday that it could start vaccinating people against the novel coronavirus as early as next year, as Italy recorded more than one million cases and Britain said its death toll has surpassed the 50,000 mark.
	The head of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), Andrea Ammon, told AFP that a vaccination programme could be kicked off ""optimistically (in the) first quarter next year, but I can't be more precise,"" as trials in both the US and Russia suggested that vaccines currently in the final stages of testing were so far proving very effective.
	A vaccine is seen as the best chance to break the cycle of deadly virus surges and severe restrictions across much of the world since COVID-19 first emerged in China late last year and ballooned into a pandemic.
	So the announcement by US pharma giant Pfizer on Monday that a vaccine it is developing with Germany's BioNTech is 90 percent effective has sparked a wave of optimism across the globe that the pandemic might soon be brought under control.
	And the news Wednesday that Russia's own Sputnik V vaccine was 92 percent effective fuelled another rally on the world's stock markets.
	Nevertheless, the small glimmer of hope is not yet enough to eclipse the grim statistics still being recorded all across the globe.
	In Italy, the number of confirmed coronavirus cases passed the symbolic one million mark, while almost 43,000 people have died, official data showed.
	In Britain, the death toll topped 50,000 after another 595 fatalities recorded in the last 24 hours, government data showed.
	""Every death is a tragedy... we're not out of the woods yet,"" said Prime Minister Boris Johnson.
	And in Spain, the death toll surged over 40,000 with infections passing the 1.4 million mark as the rate of new cases continued to grow, health ministry data showed.
	In Gibraltar, an elderly woman living in a care home became the first person to die of COVID-19 there, the government said.
	According to the World Health Organization, some 42 ""candidate vaccines"" are currently undergoing clinical trial, up from 11 in mid-June.
	In August, Russia became the first country to register a vaccine, but did so ahead of the large-scale clinical trials that are still under way.
	For Sputnik V, some 40,000 volunteers at 29 medical centres are taking part in the third and final phase of testing and overseas trials are also taking place in the United Arab Emirates, Venezuela, Belarus and other countries.
	Russia promised that the interim research data are to be published in one of the world's ""leading peer-reviewed medical academic journals"".
	But even when a vaccine is finally launched, it will not necessarily mark the end of the pandemic, many observers warn.
	""The recovery may not be linear, but rather unsteady, stop-start and contingent on the pace of vaccine roll-out,"" cautioned European Central Bank chief Christine Lagarde.
	""We could still face recurring cycles of accelerating viral spread and tightening restrictions until widespread immunity is achieved,"" she told a virtual forum on central banking.
	In the U.S., too, the caseload is soaring -- a record 200,000 new infections were registered on Tuesday and another 1,535 people lost their lives in 24 hours.
	The virus is also reaching the farthest corners of the earth, with the tiny Pacific Ocean state of Vanuatu reporting its first case, ending its status as one of the few remaining virus-free countries.
	And in Europe, which has suffered more than 317,525 deaths from 13,339,600 infections, many countries are struggling with a surging second wave.
	Greece, already under lockdown, announced on Wednesday that a curfew would additionally come into effect from Friday in a bid to curb the spread of the virus and ease pressure on its strapped hospitals.
	""The situation is extremely critical,"" said deputy civil protection minister Nikos Hardalias.
	Sweden, which has so far refused to follow the path of most other countries in imposing mandatory lockdowns, turned up the rhetoric on Wednesday to try to persuade people to take the situation seriously.
	""Everyone must follow the advice and the recommendations,"" said Prime Minister Stefan Lofven. ""The actions of everyone, the negligence of everyone are significant.""
	In Ukraine, however, nearly 2,000 people protested in Kiev against possible weekend restrictions that officials say may come into force to slow the spread of the virus there.
	The European Commission announced on Wednesday that it intended to build a new agency to prepare for similar crises in the future.
	While health policy is mainly the responsibility of the bloc's 27 member states, EU Health Commissioner Stella Kyriakides said the coronavirus pandemic had shown the need for coordination.
	Brussels plans to launch a new agency, the Health Emergency Response Authority (HERA), in 2023, Kyriakides said.
	On Tuesday, the EU parliament and member states struck a deal to pass the bloc's multi-annual budget, unblocking 750 billion euros ($886 billion) in coronavirus recovery funds.
	The virus has claimed at least 1,275,113 lives worldwide, according to an AFP tally, with more than 51 million cases registered across the globe.Â "

	As countries around the world scramble to become the first to develop a vaccine to protect against COVID-19, one expert says sheâs concerned that it may be used as a geopolitical tool.
	There are currently 11 vaccine candidates in at least Phase 3 of their clinical trials, which means they have begun large-scale testing in people for efficacy and safety.
	The U.S. and China are leading other countries with the most vaccine candidates at the critical Phase 3 testing with four each. Because of heightened tensions between the two countries in recent years, concerns are being raised about what that will mean should one of the countries create a vaccine first.
	Margaret McCuaig-Johnston, a senior fellow at the University of Albertaâs China Institute, said there is a lot of competition among the different countries racing to develop a vaccine for coronavirus.
	âActually, this is good in terms of the vaccine researchers and production facilities because itâs getting them all to really focus on a critical health challenge that the world now has,â she told CTVâs Your Morning on Wednesday.
	âThis is terrific because theyâre all giving top priority to this and that means that weâre going to get high-quality products as soon as possible.â
	And, while the prospect of an effective and safe vaccine in the near future is welcome news, McCuaig-Johnston said if China is the first to develop it, there could be repercussions for those countries that donât have friendly relations with the ruling Communist Party.
	McCuaig-Johnston pointed to the development of a vaccine by CanSino Biologics, a Chinese biopharmaceutical company, which was working in collaboration with Canadian researchers.
	âPart of the deal was that we were going to get it for Phase 3 testing and it was already to come to Canada and got blocked by senior Chinese government officials at customs leaving China,â she explained.
	âIt was there for months and we just weren't getting the access that we had expected that we would.â
	McCuaig-Johnston said the vaccine candidate ultimately went to Russia and Saudi Arabia instead, because China wanted to improve relations with those countries. She said China is still punishing Canada for the arrest of Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer and heiress to Chinaâs telecom giant Huawei in 2018.
	So in that sense, McCuaig-Johnston said China has already started using a vaccine candidate as a geopolitical tool, even before itâs been fully approved.
	Thatâs also despite Chinaâs recent move to join an international initiative to distribute COVID-19 vaccines to countries worldwide known as COVAX, which is led by the World Health Organization (WHO).
	The alliance was created to ensure the equitable distribution of vaccines, particularly to developing countries. Â 
	Chinese leader Xi Jinping has said the country would make the vaccine a global public good and distribute shots in Africa, but only after its own population has been immunized.
	The U.S., on the other hand, has refused to join the alliance with President Donald Trump decrying that it was âinfluenced by the corrupt WHO and China.â
	McCuaig-Johnston said China may use the vaccine to enhance its friendships with developing countries in Africa, South America, and Central America where it has already established ties through its Belt and Road Initiative â a global infrastructure project.
	While Canadaâs relationship with China may be on thin ice, McCuaig-Johnston said sheâs not overly concerned because the Canadian government has already signed agreements with a number of different companies that are currently developing vaccines.
	âWeâre pretty well set already in that score,â she said.

	China's sales of vehicles including trucks and buses rose 12.5% over a year earlier in October as the industry recovered from the coronavirus, but total purchases in the year's first 10 months still were below pre-virus levels, an industry group reported Wednesday.
	Sales in the biggest global auto market rose to 2.6 million, according to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers. It said sales of SUVs and other passenger vehicles grew faster than overall purchases but gave no details.
	Sales growth was down from September's 17.4%.
	In the year through October, total vehicle sales declined 4.7% from a year earlier to 19.7 million. That was an improvement over the 6.9% contraction for the first nine months of the year.

              Hong Kong's pro-democracy lawmakers resign en masse
          
","
              Hong Kong's pro-democracy lawmakers announced Wednesday they would resign en masse after four of them were ousted from the semiautonomous Chinese territory's Legislature in a move one legislator said could sound the 'death knell' for democracy there.

	Hong Kong's pro-democracy lawmakers announced Wednesday they would resign en masse after four of them were ousted from the semiautonomous Chinese territory's Legislature in a move one legislator said could sound the ""death knell"" for democracy there.
	The resignation of the 15 remaining pro-democracy lawmakers will ratchet up tensions over the future of Hong Kong, a former British colony that has long been a regional financial hub and bastion of Western-style civil liberties but over which China's government has increasingly tightened its control. A new national security law imposed by Beijing this year has alarmed the international community.
	The mass departure will also leave Hong Kong's Legislature with only pro-Beijing lawmakers, who already made up a majority but can now pass bills favoured by Beijing without much opposition.
	The lawmakers told a news conference they would submit their letters of resignation on Thursday. The announcement came hours after the Hong Kong government said it was disqualifying the four legislators -- Alvin Yeung, Dennis Kwok, Kwok Ka-ki and Kenneth Leung.
	The ousters came after China's National People's Congress Standing Committee passed a resolution this week saying that any lawmaker who supports Hong Kong's independence, refuses to acknowledge China's sovereignty over the city, threatens national security, or asks external forces to interfere in the city's affairs should be disqualified.
	""Today we will resign from our positions because our partners, our colleagues have been disqualified by the central government's ruthless move,"" Wu Chi-wai, the leader of the pro-democracy camp, told reporters.
	During the news conference, the lawmakers held hands and chanted, ""Hong Kong add oil! Together we stand!"" The phrase ""add oil"" is a direct translation of a Chinese expression of encouragement.
	""This is an actual act by Beijing ... to sound the death knell of Hong Kong's democracy fight because they would think that, from now on, anyone they found to be politically incorrect or unpatriotic or are simply not likable to look at, they could just oust you using any means,"" lawmaker Claudia Mo told reporters.
	In recent months, Beijing has increasingly clamped down on Hong Kong, which it took back control of in 1997, despite promising at the time to leave the territory's more open legal and economic systems intact for 50 years until 2047.
	Beijing imposed a national security law in June that some have labeled draconian after anti-government protests rocked the city for months last year, and it has used it to crackdown on opposition voices.
	In response, the U.S. levelled sanctions on several officials, including Hong Kong's pro-Beijing leader, several Western countries have suspended their extradition treaties with the territory, and Australia and Britain offered Hong Kongers easier paths to settle in those countries.
	Britain said Wednesday that the decision to remove the lawmakers raises further concerns.
	""This campaign to harass, stifle and disqualify democratic opposition tarnishes China's international reputation and undermines Hong Kong's long-term stability,"" Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said in a statement.
	Beijing has rejected the criticism and lashed out at what it calls gross foreign interference in Chinese politics.
	On Wednesday, Hong Kong's leader, Carrie Lam, defended the lawmakers' removal, telling reporters that legislators must act properly and that the city needs a body comprised of patriots.
	""We cannot allow members of the Legislative Council who have been judged in accordance with the law to be unable to fulfil the requirements and prerequisites for serving on the Legislative Council to continue to operate in the Legislative Council,"" Lam said.
	Still, Lam said that the Legislature would not become a rubber-stamp body, and that diverse opinion is welcome.
	""In terms of legality and constitutionality, obviously, from our point of view, this is clearly in breach of the Basic Law and our rights to participate in public affairs, and a failure to observe due process,"" Kwok, one of the ousted lawmakers, told reporters, referring to Hong Kong's mini-constitution.
	Earlier in the year, the four lawmakers were barred from seeking reelection in a vote originally scheduled for September -- but remained in their posts. They were disqualified over their calls for foreign governments to impose sanctions on Hong Kong and Beijing.
	The government eventually postponed the planned September election by a year, citing the coronavirus, but the pro-democracy camp criticized the move as an attempt to block them from taking a majority of seats in the Legislature -- which was a possibility in the coming election.
	Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said that the disqualification was necessary to maintain rule of law and constitutional order in Hong Kong.
	""We firmly support the (Hong Kong) government in performing its duties in accordance with the Standing Committee's decision,"" Wang said at a regular news conference Wednesday."

              U.S. says WHO not sharing enough info on probe into COVID-19 in China

	A senior U.S. government official complained Tuesday that the World Health Organization has not shared enough information about its planned mission to China to investigate the animal origins of the coronavirus.
	Garrett Grisby of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services griped that the criteria for WHO's China mission had not been shared with other nations. He spoke during a weeklong meeting of the U.H. health agency's member countries.
	""The (terms of reference) were not negotiated in a transparent way with all WHO member states,"" he said via video conference, referring to the mission's criteria. ""Understanding the origins of COVID-19 through a transparent and inclusive investigation is what must be done.""
	In recent months, a long-planned WHO-led team seeking to investigate the coronavirus' animal origins in China has stalled. Although pandemic travel restrictions and the focus on stemming the overwhelming number of new coronavirus cases have complicated matters, some scientists worry that China has still not provided key details about what research is already ongoing.
	The U.S. objections came as an independent panel commissioned by WHO to evaluate its management of the global COVID-19 response said it's considering whether the U.N. health agency has enough power and financing to stop future pandemics.
	Former New Zealand Prime Minister Helen Clark, who co-chairs the panel, said the group was especially interested in establishing an accurate chronology of the very first coronavirus alerts and what responses were taken.
	""The Independent Panel will do its best to shed light on what has happened, is still happening and why,"" Clark said. ""We are asking whether WHO has the right mandate, the right powers, the right capacities and the right financing to deliver on pandemic preparedness and response.""
	Critics, including President Donald Trump, have slammed WHO for allegedly ""colluding"" with China to hide the extent of the initial coronavirus outbreak. Earlier this year, The Associated Press reported that senior Chinese officials didn't warn the public about the pandemic threat of coronavirus for six days and that they stalled on sharing the virus' genetic sequence and other key data with WHO experts.
	Clark said the panel would also review ""how well the World Health Organization and the international system at large have been able to deliver on country needs and expectations.""
	On Monday, WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus pleaded for more funds, saying the agency's budget was the equivalent of what the world spends on tobacco every day.
	Clark has shied away from criticizing WHO or member states like China for their COVID-19 efforts.
	Last month, Germany and France led a call from European Union countries arguing that WHO should have more powers to independently investigate outbreaks in countries and that their funding should be boosted.
	Earlier this year, the Trump administration halted U.S. funding for the WHO and vowed to pull the United States -- its biggest single donor -- out of the U.N. health agency by next summer. President-elect Joe Biden has said he plans to keep the United States in the organization.
	The WHO meeting finishes Saturday. So far the world has seen over 50 million confirmed coronavirus cases and 1.26 million deaths, but experts say all numbers understate the pandemic's true toll."

	Over the weekend in Whistler Bobsleigh Canada met with its athletes, in order to determine if it was worth travelling, in an accelerating pandemic, to Europe to compete in races through December.
	As it turns out, everyone agreed that with the increasing rates of COVID-19 in Canada and in Europe it just didnât make any sense to travel overseas.
	Justin Kripp, who pilots Canada One, said thereâs no question it was the correct decision.
	âWeâve been kind of monitoring the situation over the summer and over the last few weeks,â Kripps said.
	âThings have really started to go in the wrong direction in Europe and here - everywhere basically - and we looked at what the trip is actually gong to look like for us, what the consequences are as far as quarantines and restrictions (would be), and it just wasnât worth it.â
	Kripps and his team will stay and train in Calgary until at least January.Â  Kripps said he wasnât too worried about missing out on some competitions.

	âBeing 10 years into my driving career it doesnât take me too long to shake off the rust,"" Kripps said.Â  ""So I think itâs actually going to be more of a positive.Â  Itâs a long grind of a tour (that) we usually do.â
	Ben Coakwel,Â  the Team Kripps brakeman, said he isnât at all worried about his pilot.
	âFor Kripps it will be tough not driving for an extended period of time, but heâs such a good driver,â Coakwell told CTV.
	âIâve seen him have great runs at the start of the season.Â  Itâs just keeping your mind sharp and focused on what we have planned.â
	The plan for Team Kripps is to focus on the World Championships, scheduled to be held in Altenberg, Germany in February.Â  And then the Olympic test event to be held in Bejing, China in March.
	Coakwell said no matter how many events the team competes in this winter,Â  the end goalÂ  remains the same.
	âThe Olympics is the goal,"" he said. "" Itâs why we do a four year cycle and train as hard as we do.â

	Added Kripps: âOur goal is not qualifying for the Olympics, itâs winning the Olympics.Â  And weâre still on track for that goal to still be the priority.""
	The advantageÂ  for Canadian Bobsleigh athletes is that if they do need more track time they don't need to be in Europe to find world-class bobsleigh facilities: they can always go back to Whistler for more training."

              Trump likely 'taking names' on Biden congrats after Trudeau outreach: expert

	The current president of the United States has warranted nary a mention from Prime Minister Justin Trudeau since Democrat Joe Biden became president-elect on Saturday.
	While that might be setting Trudeau and Canada up for some retaliatory pain from Donald Trump, analysts are divided on how much misery even a very vindictive lame-duck president could inflict on his closest neighbour.
	On Monday, Trudeau became the first international leader to speak to Biden, following his swift congratulations to the former American vice-president and his running mate Kamala Harris on Saturday.
	The Prime Minister's Office released a statement congratulating Biden within 45 minutes of multiple news outlets having called the Democrat's pivotal victory in Pennsylvania.
	Bessma Momani, an international affairs expert at the University of Waterloo, says Trump is likely keeping track of who is congratulating Biden.
	She said there is no ruling out that Trump could find a way to retaliate against Canada in his remaining time in the Oval Office.
	""Certainly, if one looks at why the Chinese have still held out on congratulating Trump, there is fear that Trump could be punitive on trade or other matters for those who are seen to side with Biden in the legal battle Trump has undertaken,"" said Momani.
	""One should not doubt that Trump is taking names and personalizing the congratulatory good wishes to Biden.""
	Trump has refused to concede defeat and is threatening legal action, claiming without evidence that he was cheated out of victory. His top diplomat, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, told reporters Tuesday he expects a ""smooth transition to a second Trump administration.""
	Trump imposed punitive tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum in 2018 using a seldom-used section of U.S. trade law that gives the executive branch that power to protect national security.
	The tariffs were ostensibly levied to block the flood of cheap Chinese steel into the U.S. through Canada. But Trump's commerce secretary said at the time they were being imposed because the Americans were unhappy with the slow pace of the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement.
	Trump eventually removed the tariffs but reimposed a levy on Canadian aluminum in August, which was lifted less than a week before the presidential election.
	""I don't have any suspicion that Mr. Trump is going to try to cause trouble from a trade point of view over the next couple of months,"" said Dennis Darby, the president of Canadian Manufacturers and Exporters.
	Trump is likely not preoccupied with foreign opinions of him, and will turn his remaining days in office to making life miserable for his political opponents within the U.S., said Sarah Goldfeder, a former U.S. diplomat who is now an Ottawa-based consultant.
	""I think Trump has two things on his mind and neither is Canada,"" said Goldfeder. Those are his political and financial survival ""and making life hard for the Democrats and never-Trumpers.""
	She said ""Trudeau did not reveal anything that Trump didn't already know"" by calling Biden.
	Trudeau and Biden released separate readouts of their conversation Monday, which summarized areas of potential co-operation as well as differences.
	Trudeau's office said he and Biden discussed COVID-19, climate change, fighting anti-Black racism and China's detention of two Canadians, Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor.
	Biden's statement said he was looking forward to working closely with Trudeau on global health, revitalizing bilateral economic ties as well as the broader North American partnership, and working with Canada on a range of regional and global challenges.
	Meredith Lilly, the Simon Reisman Chair in trade policy at Carleton University's Norman Paterson School of International Affairs, said Trump's bigger worries are all domestic and the Biden-Trudeau call likely hasn't even registered with him.
	French President Emmanuel Macron has also now spoken with Biden, as will more world leaders in the coming days, ""so we have some comfort in numbers,"" said Lilly.
	""During the lame-duck period, it will be important for Canadian officials to maintain constructive working relations with the Trump administration, and I'm confident that Ambassador (Kirsten) Hillman and her team in Washington will do this with professionalism.""
	Fen Hampson, an international affairs expert at Norman Paterson who authored a book about Brian Mulroney's foreign policy, said it is not unusual for Canadian prime ministers to reach out to the winners of the U.S. presidential election before they have been formally sworn in, as Mulroney did with Bill Clinton.
	""The calculus surely was that Trump is a now lame duck and already has done as much damage as he can to bilateral relations,"" said Hampson, adding that Trudeau likely wanted to ""seize the day and not be too preoccupied with the downside risk.""

	MotoGP rider Andrea Iannone had his ban for doping with an anabolic steroid extended to four years on Tuesday because he could not prove contaminated meat was to blame.
	The Court of Arbitration for Sport said its three judges dismissed the Italian rider's appeal against an 18-month ban and upheld the World Anti-Doping Agency's counter appeal requesting a four-year sanction.
	The 31-year-old Iannone's ban originally imposed by the International Motorcycling Federation was extended to December 2023.
	Iannone cited eating contaminated meat for his positive test for Drostanolone at the Malaysian Grand Prix in November 2019.
	The CAS judges found he was not able to prove ""the precise type of meat he had consumed nor the origin of said meat.""
	""Moreover, the panel found that neither Andrea Iannone nor his experts were able to establish specifically that there was an issue of meat contamination by Drostanolone in Malaysia,"" the court said in a statement.
	Anti-doping rules place the burden of proof on the athlete to explain how a banned substance was present.
	Athletes have had explanations of contaminated meat accepted after testing positive for clenbuterol in China and Mexico where it has been used in livestock farming. A two-year ban could have resulted for a judgment of inadvertent doping.
	However, the panel decided even if meat contamination was possible in Iannone's case, he ""has not been able to provide any convincing evidence to establish that the (violation) he committed was unintentional. ""
	Iannone had a contract to ride for Aprilia Racing Team Gresini. His only MotoGP victory came at the 2016 Austrian GP."

	Canadian fans of brands like Supreme, Bape and Kaws may soon find it quicker and easier to fill or empty their closet of trendy and hard-to-find goods.
	StockX, the Detroit-based online marketplace and reseller of sneakers, streetwear, handbags and collectibles, is expanding its brick-and-mortar presence to Canada with its first authentication centre in the country.
	The company chose Toronto for the centre because of the market's enthusiasm and the demand it was seeing from users across the country, said StockX chief executive Scott Cutler.
	""We've seen extraordinary growth in Canada, particularly from our sellers, which have increased almost 200 per cent in just the last year alone and Canada, from a customer point of view, is awesome and an extremely passionate community of sneaker and streetwear enthusiasts,"" he said in an interview.
	For those unacquainted with his company that has been valued at more than US$1 billion and marketed itself as the ""stock market of thing,"" it focuses on luxury, limited edition or small-run goods from brands coveted by the under-35 crowd.
	For StockX users, rarer is better and money is often no object. That means instead of the china, stamps and coins their parents and grandparents collected, users of StockX clamour for Bearbrick figurines, FunkoPop toys, Air Jordan sneakers, Balenciaga purses and Rolex watches.
	Users with such items to sell post them on the StockX website, allowing people to bid on them or buy them right away by agreeing to pay an amount previously determined by the seller.
	StockX charges a three-per-cent fee for payment processing to all sellers and a transaction fee dependent on how much you use your account and the item you're selling. Transaction fees can be as high as 9.5 per cent for sellers rarely using the platform and as low as eight per cent for those that make 100 sales or $25,000 in sales in a year.
	Sellers pay $10 for shipping, while buyers fork over $19.99 to get their product to them. Buyers also cover all local, state, federal or international taxes, which are worked into prices when consumers shop, so they aren't surprised when the bill arrives later.
	Cutler hopes having an authentication centre in Toronto will translate to even more Canadians reaching deals at home and help cut down on hefty duties and taxes that can plague such sales when they cross the border to the U.S.
	""Buyers will get a lower shipping fee, shorter shipping time and sellers enjoy reduced shipping costs and faster payouts,"" he said.
	In October alone, he said the Canadian market helped push Adidas Yeezy Boost 350 V2 Carbon shoes and items from rapper Travis Scott's McDonalds and Fortnite collaborations to the top of StockX bestseller lists.
	StockX's expansion into the market comes as the COVID-19 pandemic has triggered mass layoffs, reductions in working hours and less expendable income for Canadians.
	Many have dusted off items from their basement or parted ways with beloved treasures to pay bills or rent, boosting the resale market and fuelling tracking for online marketplaces like Kijiji and eBay.
	Kijiji said a survey conducted by Universite du Quebec a Montreal and MBA Recherche said 82 per cent of Canadians participated in the second-hand economy in 2018, earning an average $961 from selling used items and $723 from buying them.
	Their research valued the second-hand economy in Canada at $27.3 billion, which is roughly 1.23 per cent of the country's GDP.
	With so much value, the market has also attracted more competitors encroaching on the business StockX has been building since 2016.
	Quebec department store chain Simons has been selling second-hand luxury accessories and clothing in partnership with resale companies LXRandCO and VSP Consignment.
	Then there are e-commerce options like Goat Group, Stadium Goods, Grailed, Bump and the Real Real, which are all following in StockX's footsteps.
	Some like the Goat Group and Stadium Goods have big backers too: Foot Locker and LMVH respectively.
	Cutler, who previously ran eBay's rival marketplace business, doesn't seem to be worried.
	""We're really confident in where we stand in the marketplace, but we also feel as though we are just the beginning of our opportunities because we're expanding around the world, we're expanding and other key markets,"" he said.
	""We're continuing to evolve the customer experience to stay in front of, quite frankly, any other marketplace that again is targeting the consumer.""

              Backers blast halt to Brazil trials of Chinese-made vaccine

              Brazil's health regulator has halted clinical trials of the potential coronavirus vaccine CoronaVac, citing an 'adverse, serious event.'

		Brazil's health regulator has halted clinical trials of the potential coronavirus vaccine CoronaVac, citing an ""adverse, serious event.""

		Adversaries of President Jair Bolsonaro said they feared the decision -- posted Monday night on Anvisa's website -- was motivated not by science but by the leader's political hostility to the country and state involved in producing the vaccine candidate.

		The potential vaccine is being developed by Chinese biopharmaceutical firm Sinovac and in Brazil would be mostly produced by Sao Paulo's state-run Butantan Institute. About 10,000 volunteers are taking part in the phase three tests in one of the nations hardest hit by COVID-19.

		Sao Paulo state health authorities said in a press conference on Tuesday that Anvisa sent a single email at 8:40 p.m. saying the tests should be halted. They also said the incident with one of the trial volunteers was unrelated to the trials.

		""Such news coming the way it did causes our surprise, insecurity and, in our case, indignation,"" said Dimas Covas, the head of the Butantan Institute.

		He said it was ""impossible"" that the volunteer's incident had any relation to the tests.

		Anvisa did not describe the Oct. 29 event that prompted the halt. But its president, Antonio Barra Torres, a close ally of Bolsonaro, denied on Tuesday that politics was involved, calling it a ""purely technical decision.""

		""This no joke,"" Torres said. ""Clear, precise and complete documents need to be sent to us, which did not happen.""

		He said trials will resume only after an independent international review of the case.

		Covas said on TV Cultura late Monday that a volunteer had died, but on Tuesday he said he had just been giving a hypothetical example and could not confirm details about the case for ethical reasons.

		Sinovac issued a short statement in China on Tuesday saying it was in touch with Brazilian authorities and insisted, ""The clinical study in Brazil is strictly carried out in accordance with GCP requirements and we are confident in the safety of the vaccine,"" referring to Good Clinical Practice, a set of international standards for ethics and data quality in clinical research.

		Temporary halts of drug and vaccine testing are relatively common. In research involving thousands of participants, some are likely to fall ill. Pausing a study allows researchers to investigate whether an illness is a side effect or a coincidence. Last month, two drugmakers resumed testing of their prospective coronavirus vaccines in the U.S. after they were halted earlier.

		Sao Paulo health authorities said they met with Anvisa leaders on Tuesday, but received no feedback on when the tests will be allowed to continue.

		""This is unpleasant news; it worries all volunteers that enrolled to take the shot,"" Covas said. ""This might raise doubts among those that still planned to volunteer.""

		The CoronaVac shot has already stirred controversy in Brazil, where President Bolsonaro has cast doubt on its prospective effectiveness. He publicly rejected it last month, saying Brazilians would not be used as guinea pigs. The declaration followed news that his health minister, Eduardo Pazuello, had agreed to purchase CoronaVac doses produced locally by Butantan.

		Bolsonaro has often expressed mistrust of China, particularly on the campaign trail in 2018, although he has softened his rhetoric somewhat in office. And the governor of the state producing the vaccine, Sao Paulo's. JoâÃºo Doria, is a political rival and an outspoken critic of the president's pandemic response.

		Bolsonaro took another jab at the Sinovac shot on Tuesday.

		""Death, invalidity, anomaly. This is the vaccine that Doria wanted to force all in Sao Paulo to take,"" he wrote on his Facebook page. ""The president said the vaccine should never be mandatory. Another one that Jair Bolsonaro wins.""

		JoâÃºo Gabbardo, the executive-secretary of Sao Paulo's COVID-19 committee and until months ago the No. 2 at Brazil's Health Ministry, criticized Bolsonaro's statement without mentioning him.

		""What shocks us is that while everyone is rushing, doing what is possible so we have this vaccine available to the population, some people are betting on the opposite, coincidentally on the same day that the Sao Paulo government announces the arrival of the first doses of the vaccine,"" he said.

		""Some people celebrate the fact that a death appeared to create this mess and try to denigrate a vaccine that is being produced in this partnership with the Chinese lab. It is very sad that I have to answer in such way.""

		Former President Fernando Henrique Cardoso, one of the leaders of Gov. Doria's centre-right party, said Anvisa's decision appeared to be unscientific.

		""What is happenning is regrettable; the politization of the vaccine that will rid us of the coronavirus...,"" Cardoso said on Twitter. ""Anvisa needs to explain. And quick.""

		CoronaVac is being tested in seven Brazilian states, plus the federal district where the capital Brasilia lies.

		Following the imbroglio last month surrounding the CoronaVac shot, Anvisa authorized the import from China of 6 million doses. The potential vaccine cannot be administered to Brazilians as it isn't yet approved locally, the agency said at the time.

		Earlier Monday, Sao Paulo state's health secretary, Jean Gorinchteyn, said the first 120,000 CoronaVac shots would arrive at Sao Paulo's international airport Nov. 20, though he said, ""They will only be taken to the public after a final authorization from Brazil's health regulator.""

		The secretary added that nearly all of the volunteers who were given two doses of the vaccine produced antibodies thought to protect people from the virus.

		Sao Paulo is also importing raw material to produce40 million CoronaVac shots, which is due to start arriving Nov. 27.

              Chinese shoppers splurge in world's largest shopping fest
          
","
              Chinese consumers are expected to spend tens of billions on everything from fresh food to luxury goods during this year's Singles' Day online shopping festival, as the country recovers from the pandemic.
        ","
                  Tuesday, Nov. 10, 2020
                ",https://www.ctvnews.ca/business/chinese-shoppers-splurge-in-world-s-largest-shopping-fest-1.5182026,"HONG KONG -- 
	Chinese consumers are expected to spend tens of billions on everything from fresh food to luxury goods during this year's Singles' Day online shopping festival, as the country recovers from the pandemic.
	The shopping festival, which is the world's largest and typically begins in November, is an annual extravaganza where China's e-commerce companies, including Alibaba, JD.com and Pinduoduo, offer generous discounts on their platforms.
	By 12:30 a.m. (1630 GMT, 11:30 a.m. EDT) on Wednesday, consumers had already spent 372.3 billion yuan (US$56.3 billion) on Alibaba's Taobao and Tmall e-commerce platforms since the company kicked off the shopping festival on Nov. 1.
	Rival JD.com also reported cumulative sales of 200 billion yuan ($30.2 billion) since Nov. 1, nine minutes after the clock struck midnight on Wednesday.
	The shopping festival got its name as the main shopping day falls on Nov. 11 every year. Also known as 11.11 or Double 11, the numbers look like ""bare branches"", an expression referring to those who are single and unattached in China. The day thus later became known as Singles' Day.
	This year's festival will be closely watched as a barometer of consumption in China, which is just beginning to bounce back from the coronavirus pandemic after months of lockdown earlier in the year.
	Analysts expect Chinese consumers to spend more on imported products and foreign luxury brands, since many Chinese tourists were unable to travel internationally due to the coronavirus pandemic and tightened travel restrictions.
	A survey by consulting firm Oliver Wyman found that 86% of Chinese consumers are willing to spend the same as or more than during last year's Singles' Day festival.
	""In the last six months or so, wealthy households have actually spent more money,"" said Sean Shen, customer and strategy competence leader for EY in Greater China. ""We also see that purchases of luxury segment products are increasing because of the international travel restrictions.""
	In 2018, Chinese consumers spent about 770 billion yuan ($116.3 billion) on luxury items, accounting for about a third of the global spend, with each luxury-consuming household spending an average of 80,000 yuan annually ($12,089), according to a 2019 McKinsey report on luxury.
	Sales of electronic goods and health and wellness products are also expected to rise, as more people work from home and pay more attention to their health amid the pandemic, according to a report by consultancy Bain & Company.
	To help merchants cope with the impact from the coronavirus, online platforms have extended the shopping festival period this year in hopes of boosting sales.
	Both Alibaba and JD.com, the country's two biggest e-commerce companies, began offering discounts on Oct. 21, three weeks ahead of Nov. 11. Some brands and merchants that slashed their prices booked hundreds of millions of yuan (tens of millions of dollars) in sales just hours into the shopping festival.
	Tang Chenghui, an electrical engineer who lives in Beijing sees Singles' Day as an opportunity to stock up on snacks and imported products such as milk from Australia. Ahead of the festival, Tang pre-ordered 3 boxes of duck eggs, 10 packets of soybean milk powder, two boxes of yogurt, coffee and wine.
	""I'm buying more snacks this year because I've just moved into a new apartment and have enough storage space to stockpile the snacks I like,"" said Tang. ""Some of these products are really cheap during the Singles' Day discounts.""
	Unlike Black Friday and Cyber Monday in the U.S., Singles' Day in China is not just about deep bargains. Alibaba pioneered the concept of Singles' Day and holds an annual gala on Nov. 11 with celebrity performances to entertain shoppers.
	E-commerce companies don't break down Singles Day sales volume by brands so it is hard to know what share goes to foreign companies, though some companies might announce their own performances.
	Sales via livestreaming and Alibaba's annual gala are part of a ""shoppertainment"" trend which blends shopping with entertainment in order to become more appealing and engaging to shoppers.
	Mini games within online shopping platforms entice shoppers with deeper discounts while encouraging them to spend more time within the app.
	""Because of COVID-19, brands and retailers have doubled down on e-commerce and livestreaming commerce to drive growth, and it will show strongly on (Singles' Day) this year,"" said Wang Xiaofeng, a senior analyst at Forrester.
	But while millions of shoppers spend hours on mini games hoping to snag better bargains, some are irked by the complexities required to win such discounts.
	""Black Friday discounts tend to be better, and they are more straightforward,"" said Liu Zhirou, a 27 year-old Beijing-based accountant. ""Now, I still ask my friends to help me buy things from the U.S. during Black Friday.""
	""The rules around Singles' Day discounts now are getting more and more complicated,"" she said. ""I usually just spend my money on Black Friday, and buy less on Singles' Day.""

              McDonald's sees sales rebound in U.S., plans to test new 'McPlant' burger
          
","
              McDonald's U.S. sales roared back in the third quarter with new menu items and attention-grabbing celebrity collaborations.
        ","
                  Monday, Nov. 9, 2020
                ",https://www.ctvnews.ca/business/mcdonald-s-sees-sales-rebound-in-u-s-plans-to-test-new-mcplant-burger-1.5181378,"
	McDonald's U.S. sales roared back in the third quarter with new menu items and attention-grabbing celebrity collaborations.
	And the burger giant says more is coming. In a virtual meeting for investors Monday, McDonald's said a much-anticipated crispy chicken sandwich with pickles -- an answer to competitors like Popeye's and Chick-fil-A -- will go on sale in the U.S. early next year. The company also plans to test McPlant, a plant-based burger, next year.
	McDonald's wouldn't say who might supply the plant-based burger. McDonald's tested pea protein-based patties from California-based Beyond Meat at Canadian restaurants earlier this year, but it ended the trial in April.
	With new choices like spicy chicken nuggets and a meal deal promotion with rapper Travis Scott, McDonald's exceeded most projections for the third quarter.
	McDonald's same-store sales -- or sales at locations open at least a year -- jumped 4.6% in the U.S. Customer traffic fell, but when diners came, they spent more on larger group orders. Dinner was particularly strong, McDonald's said, but other times of day were elevated as well.
	It wasn't the same story outside the U.S. Globally, same-store sales fell 2.2% between July and September. Sales increases in Japan and Australia were offset by declines in China, Europe and Latin America. Still, that was significantly better than the 24% drop the company saw in the second quarter.
	McDonald's warned that a resurgence of coronavirus cases in key markets like France, Germany and the United Kingdom could force dining room closures and other restrictions.
	""We're pleased with our recovery to date, but we also understand there inevitably will be more starts and stops with the virus resurgences,"" McDonald's Chief Financial Officer Kevin Ozan said Monday in a conference call with investors.
	Infections in the U.S. have now begun to surge as well. But 95% of U.S. McDonald's have drive-thru windows, which has allowed restaurants to continue to operate even though less than 20% have opened their dining rooms. Globally, only 65% of McDonald's have drive-thru windows.
	Mason Smoot, McDonald's chief U.S. restaurant officer, said drive-thru represents around 70% of McDonald's sales in its top markets, and the vast majority of new restaurants McDonald's is building will have drive-thru windows. Smoot said the company is testing automatic order taking at drive-thrus to improve accuracy. It's also testing express drive-thru lanes for mobile order pickups.
	McDonald's said digital ordering -- through mobile orders, in-store kiosks and delivery -- is expected to make up 20% of system-wide sales this year, or more than $10 billion. The company hopes to build on that with a new app, MyMcDonald's, which will be launched in six markets by the end of 2021.
	The app will let customers participate in a new loyalty program and get targeted dining offers. It's designed to make it easier to order, whether for carryout or delivery. Around 28,000 McDonald's restaurants worldwide now offer delivery, the company said.
	McDonald's cut menu items, including all-day breakfast, to make it easier and faster to fill orders during the pandemic. Even as sales improve, the company said, it wants to be careful about how much complexity it's adding. It also plans to emphasize its core products -- beef, chicken and fries -- which make up 70% of its sales.
	""We're going to be thoughtful and judicious as we add back to our menu,"" said Joe Erlinger, McDonald's U.S. president.
	The new chicken sandwich, for example, will replace a smaller, less popular one. And meal promotions with celebrities like Scott -- and, more recently, Colombian singer J Blevin -- feature core items that have been on McDonald's menu for decades.
	The $6 Scott meal, for example, includes a Quarter Pounder, fries and a Sprite. The meal promotion with Scott, introduced in September, was the first time McDonald's featured a celebrity's name on its menu since a Michael Jordan-branded meal deal in 1992.
	McDonald's also got a lift from the September introduction of spicy McNuggets. It was the first time the company had introduced a new flavour since McNuggets debuted in 1983.
	Third quarter net income rose 10% to US$1.8 billion. Earnings, adjusted for one-time items, were $2.22 per share.
	That surpassed Wall Street's expectations of $1.91 per share, according to analysts polled by FactSet.
	Revenue fell 2% to $5.4 billion. That was in line with expectations.
	Shares of the Chicago company were flat at $216.29 in afternoon trading."

	Itâs a company that started back in 1978 as a tractor dealership in the little hamlet of Salford in Oxford County. Now 42 years later, Salford Group has grown into a world-wide agricultural company.
	âWe have six manufacturing facilities.We have one in Russia, in Georgia, Iowa, Manitoba and two in Ontario. This one that is our head office in salford and a facility in Norwich Ontario,â says Geof Gray, president of Salford Group.
	Youâve probably heard of the name Salford Group, but didnât know that the company plays a large role in the agricultural industry.
	âWe primarily focus on farming equipment manufacturing and in our sector we focus on ground tillage equipment and fertilizer equipment,â says Gray.
	The equipment made at Salford is essential to many farms, especially when the pandemic hit and food security and availability became a fear for many.
	âThatâs where I became fearful,â says Gray.
	âIf the government did too much shut downs weâre all going to starve in six months, because the farms had to run and the equipment and the parts had to keep flowing so we were happy we were deemed an essential service so we could keep feeding the world.â
	Gray says once deemed an essential service, the manufacturing facilities became busier than ever, which has led to lots of job openings at the two manufacturing facilities in Oxford County.
	Currently there are around 200 employees total at Salford Group in Ontario and 30 or more staff members are needed ASAP.
	âSince this is head office we are hiring accountants to sales staff to engineering staff. We need manufacturers from welders, assemblers and fabricators,â says Gray.
	Gray says being in a rural area makes it difficult to quickly hire the staff needed, but the team is working hard to do so, however this is just a small piece of the growth expected at Salford Group.
	âMore and more we are shipping into China and looking for new markets whether itâs South Africa, Brazil and also bringing on new products. Thereâs lots of growth and the growth is what brings job opportunities and career growth to the employees as well.â"

	Starting his first full work week as president-elect on Monday, Joe Biden received his first phone call from a world leader -- Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who according to his office raised a series of key cross-border issues with his incoming U.S. counterpart.
	According to a message shared across the prime ministerâs social media channels on Monday afternoon, Trudeau spoke with his incoming U.S. counterpart about the âchallenges and opportunities facing our two countries,"" including COVID-19 and climate change, as well as about Chinaâs detention of Canadians Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor.
	âWe talked about those specific challenges today, as well as trade, energy, NATO, anti-Black racism, and Chinaâs arbitrary detention of Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor,â the post read.
	In a readout from the call released later on Monday, according to the PMO the pair agreed to work together on the pandemic, to support economic regrowth, and to work closely on global security with NATO, and at the G7.
	In the PMO statement about the call, the pair âagreed to stay in close contact.â
	The election of Biden has prompted some to wonder how both Canada and U.S. relations with China may be different, and Trudeau took the opportunity to raise the case of the two Michaels on Mondayâs call.
	Asked whether he thought Biden would put greater pressure on Beijing or possibly look to take an alternate approach to Huawei executive Meng Wanzhouâs extradition case during a Monday morning press conference, Trudeau voiced confidence about the role the Democratic administration will play.
	âWe've worked with allies around the world to put pressure on China around the arbitrary detention of two Canadian citizens. Their approach around coercive diplomacy is ineffective and extremely preoccupying for democratic nations around the world and we have all expressed that very clearly,â Trudeau said.
	âI am extremely confident that the incoming American administration will continue to be a good partner to Canada and other nations around the world as we look to impress upon China that the approach they're taking is simply not working, while at the same time, impressing upon them the importance of returning the two Canadians who've been arbitrarily detained for over 700 days now,â he continued.
	Canadaâs dealings with China have become intertwined on a few major files with significant political repercussions over the course of U.S. President Donald Trumpâs presidency, particularly after Canada acted on the U.S. extradition request to arrest Meng.
	While Biden campaigned on repairing relationships with foreign nations, he often emphasized Chinaâs authoritarianism during the Democratic primary debates. Foreign policy experts have previously told CTVNews.ca that Biden may be more open to forging a new, less combative approach to the tense standoff over the detainees.
	âI think itâs only good that can come,â said CTV News political commentator Tom Mulcair on CTV News Channel Monday morning about what Bidenâs win means for Canada.
	âOur ability to work with China is going to change. Weâre not going to feel the pressure from Donald Trump,â Mulcair said.
	While the pair has similar climate goals, one of the biggest points of difference in policy facing the two countries is on the fate of the Keystone XL pipeline and that came up on the call.
	The multi-billion dollar project would transfer more than 800,000 barrels per day of crude oil from Alberta to Nebraska, but Biden vowed early on that he would scrap the pipeline, despite Canadaâs backing and Alberta already investing billions into the project.
	Asked what Canada is going to do to fight the pipeline project from being killed, Foreign Affairs Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne said over the weekend that that the federal government will make its case as a reliable energy supplier.
	The fate of the project has been top of mind for some in Canadaâs energy industry, and according to the PMO, it was on Trudeauâs mind too, but details of what each side had to say during the call were not included. The readout only noted that Biden and Trudeau were looking forward to âengagingâ on the issue of âenergy cooperation,â and other resource issues like softwood lumber."

	Jimmy Lai, the 73-year-old Hong Kong media tycoon and advocate for democracy, was denied bail Saturday after being charged the previous day under the semi-autonomous Chinese territory's new national security law.
	Lai faces a charge of collusion with foreign elements to endanger national security, apparently for tweets he made and interviews or commentaries he did with foreign media.
	The Apple Daily, a feisty pro-democracy tabloid owned by Lai, said he is accused of asking a foreign country, organization or individual to impose sanctions or engage in other hostile activities against Hong Kong or China.
	His case was adjourned to April 16 at the request of prosecutors, who said police needed time to review more than 1,000 tweets and comments made on his Twitter account, the Apple Daily reported.
	The newspaper said his charge sheet listed several foreign politicians who followed Lai on Twitter and cited commentaries he wrote and interviews he did with foreign media.
	Lai, who was already being held on other fraud charges after police raided his media company, could be seen handcuffed to a chain around his waist as guards led him to a van to go from prison to court. He wore a navy blazer and an open-neck shirt.
	Beijing imposed the national security law on Hong Kong earlier this year after stormy protests in 2019 that started over an extradition bill and expanded to include demands for greater democracy in the former British colony.
	The new law outlaws secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces to intervene in Hong Kong's affairs. It has constricted free speech in the city, and democracy activists see it as a way to suppress dissent.
	U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo tweeted Saturday morning Asia time that the security law ""makes a mockery of justice."" He called for Lai's release, saying his only crime is speaking the truth about China's authoritarian Communist Party government.
	Lai, the highest-profile person charged under the security law, has also been arrested for other alleged offences this year. He has been charged with taking part in unauthorized protests and with fraud over alleged violations of office lease terms.
	He has advocated for other countries to take a harsher stance on China, and met with Pompeo and Vice-President Mike Pence in the U.S. last year to discuss the extradition bill, which the Hong Kong government eventually withdrew.
	Pence also tweeted about Lai, saying the charges against him are ""an affront to freedom loving people around everywhere."""

	Relatives of a dozen Hong Kong residents who have been detained in mainland China for more than 3 1/2 months made a plea Saturday to be informed of the timing of any trials and whether they can attend.
	The request underscored the sharp contrast between the relatively open legal system in Hong Kong, a semi-autonomous Chinese territory, and that of the mainland, where often little information is divulged until a trial is over.
	""I miss my son so much,"" the mother of Wong Wai-yin, one of the detainees, said, choking up. ""I want to visit him so badly. I haven't seen my son in a very long time -- it's almost four months. Please tell me (about the trial). I'm just an ordinary mother.""
	The 12 were arrested at sea in August while they were apparently making a bid to flee to Taiwan after a tough national security law took effect in Hong Kong earlier this year.
	They were picked up after entering mainland waters for crossing the maritime border without permission. At least some took part in anti-government protests in 2019 and were facing charges in Hong Kong.
	Though Hong Kong is a part of China, travellers must still pass through immigration when going to and from the mainland.
	Two are being held on suspicion of organizing an illegal border crossing. The group has been locked up in Shenzhen, a southern Chinese city that borders Hong Kong.
	The relatives covered their faces with masks, and some wore sunglasses, caps or hoods to hide their identities as they spoke at a news conference. They did not give their names.
	Owen Chow, an activist who has been helping the families, said they wanted to know whether the trials would be open to the public and if family members could attend.
	He and some family members questioned the authenticity of letters some of the latter had received, purportedly from their detained relatives, saying they were being held in a good environment and not abused.
	""The only thing I can do is to have dissatisfaction and be angry,"" said a relative of Tang Kai-yin, another detainee. ""I don't know what else to do."""

	U.S. President-elect Joe Biden pledged Saturday to rejoin the Paris climate accord on the first day of his presidency, as world leaders staged a virtual gathering to celebrate the fifth anniversary of the international pact aimed at curbing global warming.
	Heads of state and government from over 70 countries took part in the event -- hosted by Britain, France, Italy, Chile and the United Nations -- to announce greater efforts in cutting the greenhouse gas emissions that fuel global warming.
	The outgoing administration of U.S. President Donald Trump, who pulled Washington out of the Paris accord, wasn't represented at the online gathering. But in a written statement sent shortly before it began, Biden made clear the U.S. was waiting on the sidelines to join again and noted that Washington was key to negotiating the 2015 agreement, which has since been ratified by almost all countries around the world.Â 
	""The United States will rejoin the Paris Agreement on day one of my presidency,"" he said. ""I'll immediately start working with my counterparts around the world to do all that we possibly can, including by convening the leaders of major economies for a climate summit within my first 100 days in office.""
	Biden reiterated his campaign pledge that his administration will set a target of cutting U.S. emissions to net zero ""no later than 2050.""
	Experts say commitments put forward by the international community in the past five years have already improved the long-term outlook on climate change, making the worst-case scenarios less likely by the end of the century. But wildfires in the Amazon, Australia and America, floods in Bangladesh and East Africa, and record temperatures in the Arctic have highlighted the impact an increase of 1.2 degrees Celsius (2.2 Fahrenheit) since pre-industrial times is already having on the planet.
	""If we don't change course, we may be headed for a catastrophic temperature rise of more than 3 degrees (Celsius) this century,"" UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said, urging world leaders to declare a ""climate emergency.""
	The Paris agreement aims to cap global warming at well under 2 C (3.6 F), ideally no more than 1.5 C (2.7 F), by the end of the century. Meeting the temperature target will require a phasing-out of fossil fuels and better protection for the world's carbon-soaking forests, wetlands and oceans.
	The UN chief called the announced U.S. return to the Paris accord ""a very important signal.""
	""We look forward for a very active U.S. leadership in climate action from now on,"" Guterres said. ""The United States is the largest economy in the world, it's absolutely essential for our goals to be reached.""
	Biden insisted that the dramatic economic shifts needed would be positive for American workers.
	""We have before us an enormous economic opportunity to create jobs and prosperity at home and export clean American-made products around the world, harnessing our climate ambition in a way that is good for American workers and the U.S. economy,"" he said.
	American representatives at the virtual meeting included Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, Gov. Charlie Baker of Massachusetts and U.S. business leaders, such as Apple chief executive Tim Cook.
	Also absent from the event were major economies such as Australia, Brazil, Indonesia, Mexico, Russia and Saudi Arabia. Most have offered no significant improvements on their existing emissions targets lately.
	Environmental campaigners singled out Brazil's recent announcement that it will stick to its target of cutting emissions by 43 per cent over the next decade compared with 2005 levels and aim for net zero by 2060 -- later than most other countries.
	By contrast, an agreement Friday by European Union members to beef up the continent's 2030 targets from 40 per cent to at least 55 per cent compared with 1990 levels was broadly welcomed, though activists said it could have aimed even higher.
	China, the world's biggest emitter, also surprised the world in September by announcing a net zero target of 2060, with emissions peaking by 2030. In his speech Saturday, Chinese President Xi Jinping provided further details on his country's medium-term goal for improving energy efficiency and ramping up electricity generated from renewable sources of power such as wind and solar.
	But Xi also cautioned that ""unilateralism will lead us nowhere"" -- a veiled reference to discussions in the EU to impose tariffs on goods imported from countries that have less stringent emissions standards than the 27-nation bloc. The issue is likely to dominate discussion between China, the EU and the U.S. in coming years.
	The Maldives, an Indian Ocean nation made up of low-lying islands that are particularly vulnerable to sea level rise, announced Saturday that it will now aim to achieve net zero by 2030, one of the most ambitious goals worldwide. Bhutan and Suriname claim to have already achieved that goal.
	The 189 countries that are party to the Paris agreement are required to submit their updated targets to the United Nations by the end of the year. This would normally have occurred at the annual UN climate summit, but the event was postponed for a year because of the pandemic.
	The gathering, now scheduled to take place in Glasgow, Scotland, in November 2021, will see haggling over financial support for poor countries to cope with climate change, and fine-tuning the rules for international markets in emissions trading. Britain, next year's host, announced this month that it's aiming to cut emissions by 68 per cent over the next decade and end state support for fossil fuel industry exports.
	Former UN climate chief Christiana Figueres, who was a key player at the Paris negotiations, said leaders had a duty to be optimistic about their ability to curb global warming.
	""Because if we don't, the alternative is unthinkable,"" she said. ""None of us adults alive today want to have on our shoulders the responsibility of turning over a world that is a world of misery for generations to come.""

	The U.S. gave the final go-ahead Friday to the nation's first COVID-19 vaccine, marking what could be the beginning of the end of an outbreak that has killed nearly 300,000 Americans, according to a person familiar with the decision but not authorized to discuss it publicly.
	Shots for health workers and nursing home residents are expected to begin in the coming days after the Food and Drug Administration authorized an emergency rollout of what promises to be a strongly protective vaccine from Pfizer Inc. and its German partner BioNTech.
	Initial doses are scarce and rationed as the U.S. joins Britain and several other countries in scrambling to vaccinate as many people as possible ahead of a long, grim winter. It will take months of work to tamp down the coronavirus that has surged to catastrophic levels in recent weeks and already claimed 1.5 million lives globally.
	While the FDA decision came only after public review of data from a huge ongoing study, it has also been dogged by intense political pressure from the Trump administration, which has accused the agency of being too slow and even threatened to remove FDA chief Stephen Hahn if a ruling did not come Friday.
	The move sets off what will be the largest vaccination campaign in U.S. history -- but it also has global ramifications because it's a role model to many other countries facing the same decision.
	The world desperately needs multiple vaccines for enough to go around, and the Pfizer-BioNTech shot is the first based on rigorous scientific testing to emerge from that worldwide race -- a record-setting scientific achievement that shaved years off the usual process.
	""I don't think you would have found a scientist on this planet that would have predicted this 11 months ago,"" said Dr. Paul Offit, a vaccine expert at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia who advises the FDA.
	The U.S. is considering a second vaccine, made by Moderna Inc., that could roll out in another week. In early January, Johnson & Johnson expects to learn if its vaccine is working in final testing.
	Europe is set to make its own decision on the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna shots later this month, an important step as some other candidates that multiple countries were anxiously awaiting have hit roadblocks. Friday, Sanofi and GSK announced a months-long delay after early tests showed their vaccine didn't work well enough in older adults.
	And China and Russia didn't wait for final-stage tests before beginning vaccinations with some homegrown shots.
	About 3 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine are expected in the first shipments around the country, according to officials with Operation Warp Speed, the Trump administration's vaccine development program. A similar amount is to be held in reserve for those recipients' second dose.
	A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advisory committee is poised to recommend who's first in line. Expected to follow health workers and nursing homes are other essential workers, older adults and people at high risk because of other health problems. U.S. authorities don't expect enough for the general population before spring, and that's assuming there are no manufacturing glitches.
	In a still unfinished study of nearly 44,000 people, the FDA found the vaccine was safe and more than 90% effective across recipients of different ages, including older adults, races and those with health problems that put them at high risk from the coronavirus.
	Emergency use means the vaccine still is experimental. Most important for would-be recipients to know:
	--Some protection begins after the first dose, but it takes a second dose three weeks later for full protection. It's unclear how long protection lasts.
	--The vaccine protects against COVID-19 illness, but no one yet knows if it can stop the silent, symptomless spread that accounts for roughly half of all cases. The ongoing study will attempt to answer that but for now, the vaccinated still will need to wear a mask and keep their distance.
	--Expect a sore arm and some flu-like symptoms such as fever, fatigue, headache and chills after the second dose. While uncomfortable, those reactions only last about a day. ""That's just your immune system working. It's a good thing,"" Offit said.
	--Authorities are investigating several allergic reactions reported in Britain by people with a history of severe allergies. Offit said it is routine in the U.S. for the vaccinated to stick around for a half-hour so they could get prompt treatment if such reactions appear.
	If emergency use of Moderna's vaccine also is authorized, the U.S. expects to vaccinate 20 million people by the end of December. They hope to have enough for another 30 million people in January and 50 million in February.
	Getting shots into arms is the big challenge, especially as a new poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found only half of Americans want the vaccine when it's their turn. About a quarter say they won't get it and the rest aren't sure.
	Political interference has complicated health authorities' message that the testing was rigorous and cut no corners.
	President Donald Trump bashed the FDA, again, Friday for taking too long, complaining that the agency ""is still a big, old slow turtle."" One of his deputies even pressed Hahn to clear the shots by the end of the day or face possible firing, two administration officials said.
	The FDA is unique in analyzing drugmakers' raw data, a process that takes longer than many other countries' regulatory reviews. In addition, the FDA insisted that large COVID-19 vaccine studies track at least half the participants for two months to look for side effects, a time period when historically any vaccine problems appear.

	Canada is no longer training with the Chinese military, the Minister of National Defence Harjit Sajjan told the House of Commons on Thursday, after Conservative defence critic James Bezan questioned why Prime Minister Justin Trudeau would maintain such relations with China.
	The issue came to a head following a report by the Globe and Mail that top officials at Global Affairs, concerned the Chinese government would view it as a retaliatory move over its detention of Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, was âalarmedâ that General Jonathan Vance cancelled winter military exercises with the Peopleâs Liberation Army in 2019 at CFB Petawawa.
	The news comes as Kovrig and Spavor marked their second anniversary in Chinese prison on what Canada and its Western allies say are unfounded espionage charges that followed Canadaâs arrest of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou on a U.S. extradition warrant in December 2018.
	âOur government always stands up for Canadians at home and abroad and this includes our relationship with China. But let me be very clear, we do not train with Chinese military,â said Minister Sajjan, adding that this initiative was originally put in place by the Conservative government under Stephen Harper.
	âIt was the previous government that actually signed a co-operation plan initiative in 2013 under Rob Nicholson, when he was the Minister of National Defence â¦ because of the agreement they had signed, this is one of the reasons why we actually changed our approach because of the concerns the member outlined,â Sajjan said.
	Bezan, who served as Parliamentary Secretary of National Defence under Nicholson at the time, said Canada was engaging in âhostage diplomacyâ and that the Chinese government back then âis completely different to the Chinese government today.â
	Conservative leader Erin OâToole called the joint training exercise a âdangerous path for the Trudeau government to take"" and called Canada's dealings with China a ""dangerously naive approach [that] has put Canada and our citizens at risk.â
	The Canadian Armed Forces have participated in various joint and regional military exercises for decades with some two dozen Pacific Rim countries. Specifically, Canada advanced its bilateral defence relationship with China through talks between senior military officials on both sides in March 2012 and June 2013. The Cooperation Plan Initiative, which would guide defence-related activities, was signed in Ottawa in August 2013.
	Chinaâs President Xi Jinping, who came into power in March 2013, has tightened his control over the country in recent years through mass detention and surveillance of its Muslim population in Xinjiang, a crackdown on activism, heavy Internet censorship, consolidation of power and removal of presidential term limits. He has also taken a more assertive and harder-line approach to foreign affairs and defending Chinaâs interests.
	Mengâs arrest, and the subsequent arrest of Kovrig and Spavor shortly after, soured relations between Canada and China. Trudeau has spoken to U.S. president-elect Joe Biden about the situation, but has not said whether Biden might revisit the Justice Departmentâs efforts to extradite Meng. Should the U.S. withdraw its charges against Meng, it could give China a reason to release Kovrig and Spavor.
	âWe will always stand up for Canadians who are arbitrarily detained. This is one of the reasons why we actually stopped our training with the Chinese,â Sajjan said.

The USOPC is now heeding the calls from many of its own athletes and will no longer punish them for kneeling or raising fists or any other kind of acceptable demonstration at the Olympics.
	âWhen you sit in my seat, you have to make decisions that you think are on the right side of history,â said CEO Sarah Hirshland. âAnd I believe we're on the right side of history.â
	But there are details to iron out, and they strike to the heart of how much change is truly possible between now and next July, when the Tokyo Olympics are scheduled to take place.
	High on the list: What can athletes demonstrate about, and what will an acceptable demonstration look like?
	âThat becomes a difficult situation,â said Harry Edwards, the activist who helped brainstorm the gestures by Smith and Carlos 52 years ago. âBecause you could very easily get into a thing of trying to outdo someone else and it ends up having nothing to do with the spirit of the issue.â
	That confusion helps explain the calculated response to the USOPC that came from the IOC in the form of a short release from the head of its athlete commission, swimmer Kirsty Coventry of Zimbabwe.
	Well aware that the protest rule can't stay as-is for the foreseeable future, Coventry and the IOC are in the process of surveying athletes across the globe for their thoughts about possible changes. She said the majority of the respondents believe in the right of free speech, which is ârespectedâ at the Olympic Games (but only in certain settings) and âexpress support for preserving the ceremonies, the podium and the field of play.â
	Though Coventry's committee is still accepting feedback, and won't make any final decisions until early next year, she's previewing a far less radical adjustment to Rule 50 than the U.S. contingent would like.
	American athletes have been reeling from a summer of unrest over police violence against Black people in the United States. Every major sports league has agreed to change policies to give their players a bigger platform to discuss race and social injustice.
	But U.S. sports leagues and the Olympics are very different creatures. The Olympics are a behemoth that counts America as only one of 206 countries who are members.
	Some of the biggest members are among the IOC's most important partners - China, for instance, hosted the 2008 Olympics and will do so again in 2022 - and they don't share the same concerns or values about free speech or racial injustice as do the United States and many of its closest allies.
	âMany have also recognized the practical question of how to choose between the opinions of hundreds of issues from different angles across the world,â Coventry said of her survey respondents. âWe can see that it would be very difficult to make such a judgment without dividing the athlete community across all 206 NOCs.â
	Moushaumi Robinson, who led the U.S. athletes group that pressed for the changes, said she understands the complexities. Her group continues to discuss them to try to come up with solutions.
	âA lot of us just want to be able to say `I may not agree with you but I respect that you have a voice,â' she said. âAnd we want to be able to express it without someone punishing you for it.â
	All of which leads Edwards to believe that Thursday's move by the USOPC and its athletes is a sign of progress - not necessarily a huge leap but another step.
	âThis is an ongoing struggle, and it's going to continue to be a struggle,â he said. âAnd what today reflects is that this generation of athletes is more than willing to do their part.â"

              Diverse TV holiday season includes all-Asian Lifetime movie
          
","
              In one scene from the Lifetime TV movie, âA Sugar & Spice Holiday,â a co-worker says to Suzy, an Asian American architect in Los Angeles: âI didn't know if Christmas was a big deal where you're from.â
        ","
                  Friday, Dec. 11, 2020
                ",https://www.ctvnews.ca/entertainment/diverse-tv-holiday-season-includes-all-asian-lifetime-movie-1.5227204,"
	In one scene from the Lifetime TV movie, âA Sugar & Spice Holiday,â a co-worker says to Suzy, an Asian American architect in Los Angeles: âI didn't know if Christmas was a big deal where you're from.â
	Retorts Suzy: âI'm from Maine.â
	A lot of viewers of a cozy Christmas film might just shrug off the insinuation that Suzy is somehow not American. But for an Asian audience, that brief exchange is a knowing reminder that microaggressions don't take a holiday. They especially haven't in the wake of the pandemic, which has triggered anti-Asian racism and terms like âChinese virusâ and âkung flu.â
	âI think it's great timing for us for this movie to be coming out now during the pandemic with the perception of the Asian culture and the `flu' and all,â Canadian actor Jacky Lai, who plays Suzy, told The Associated Press. âI really do hope that this (movie) - with our faces - is able to hopefully be welcomed by people into their homes and see us as just your American/Canadian friends.â
	âA Sugar & Spice Holiday,â premiering Sunday, may be the first feel-good TV Christmas flick to feature a mostly Asian ensemble. It's one of several projects where cable channels are demonstrating a desire for inclusion this yuletide season. The shift comes a year after the Hallmark Channel dropped an ad that included a same-sex couple. The fallout pointed to an overall diversity problem in the genre with not just the LGBTQ community, but communities of colour. Recent months of racial unrest only added to the conversation within the entertainment industry about representation.
	Tia Maggini, vice-president of Lifetime Original Movies, says it was a coincidence that screenwriter Eirene Donohue, who is Asian American and had worked with the them before, came to them with the story pitch.
	âIt was exciting to be presented with this particular point of view that has been long overdue for the Christmas movie genre,â Maggini said in a statement. Most important: The movie itself was actually funny and âfull of Christmas heart.â
	Indeed, the rom-com has all the warm, familiar holiday movie tropes. Suzy returns to the small town where she grew up for Christmas, is persuaded to revive her baking skills for a local gingerbread house competition and is assisted by her former high school crush (Tony Giroux).
	Her father is played by veteran actor Tzi Ma. Despite a year filled with high profile film roles in âThe Farewellâ and âMulan,â Ma didn't hesitate to join a Lifetime movie.
	âIt was the first time a Chinese American family was featured on a Christmas story,â Ma said in an email. âLifetime has a tremendous Asian American following. It's a way to say thank you to them.â
	In Hollywood, it can often feel like studios only cast Asians in narratives where there's some kind of hardship or East-meets-West struggle. And with TV holiday movies, they're almost nonexistent. Meanwhile, there are white actors who have made a baker's dozen of them. Like any other group, Giroux says, Asians deserve to see themselves in lighthearted fare regularly.
	âI think it's so important to have all sorts of stories with any culture - for them to have exposure to the stories of struggle but it's such a delight to see something lighter, to see aspects of culture that aren't surrounded with times of difficulty,â Giroux says.
	Giroux, who is Canadian, is also looking forward to queuing up a movie where his grandparents can see themselves.
	âI'm really excited for them to see a story that covers part of their story. My grandparents immigrated here from China from in the `50s,â Giroux says. âThat's why being part of this project is telling a story that I'm really a part of.â
	Lai grew up loving romantic comedies. She remembers unexpectedly getting emotional watching âCrazy Rich Asians,â the first major Hollywood studio film with an all-Asian cast in 25 years.
	âYou hear people say there hasn't been a movie like this in 25 years. You hear those things. But it's not until I sat in the theatre and watched someone who looked like me on screen who wasn't a ninja or a nerd but someone just like me. I remember the way it felt,â Lai says. âI am so excited that there's another movie like that and hopefully we bring joy and open some minds with this movie and more opportunities.â
	The movie is lovingly sprinkled with Chinese American nuances on script and screen. These include a photo of Suzy's deceased grandma flanked by incense sticks and the entire family eating with chopsticks. And it is definitely the only Christmas movie to feature both gingerbread and stinky tofu, a beloved Chinese dish known for its pungent smell.
	âI love that we were able to kind of include a lot of nice details. ... It's really a romantic comedy where the characters happen to be Asian American,â says Jennifer Liao, the director. âIt's nice to make an Asian American movie that's not necessarily completely frontloaded with having to carry the weight of cultural identity issues and things like that.â
	âSugar & Spiceâ is not the only holiday movie expanding the definition of who can lead these kinds of flicks. A handful of networks, including Lifetime and Hallmark, have a Christmas-themed movie on their slate featuring a same-sex pairing. Tony winner Ali Stroker, who uses a wheelchair, stars in Lifetime's âChristmas Ever After.â
	Does Liao feel pressure as âthe firstâ even on such an innocuous project to bring in a sizeable audience? âI feel like the pressure is more to deliver something that I and everybody else worked on can be proud of. That was really no. 1,â Liao says.
	Lai doesn't see the point of getting caught up in things like ratings.
	âI think that it is really, really nice to hear when someone says `I got to see someone who looks like me on screen.' That will never get old,â Lai says. âWe get more responses like that - for me, the movie did its purpose.â

              Jimmy Lai, the 73-year-old Hong Kong media tycoon and advocate for democracy, was denied bail Saturday after being charged the previous day under the semi-autonomous Chinese territory's new national security law.

	Jimmy Lai, the 73-year-old Hong Kong media tycoon and advocate for democracy, was denied bail Saturday after being charged the previous day under the semi-autonomous Chinese territory's new national security law.
	Lai faces a charge of collusion with foreign elements to endanger national security, apparently for tweets he made and interviews or commentaries he did with foreign media.
	The Apple Daily, a feisty pro-democracy tabloid owned by Lai, said he is accused of asking a foreign country, organization or individual to impose sanctions or engage in other hostile activities against Hong Kong or China.
	His case was adjourned to April 16 at the request of prosecutors, who said police needed time to review more than 1,000 tweets and comments made on his Twitter account, the Apple Daily reported.
	The newspaper said his charge sheet listed several foreign politicians who followed Lai on Twitter and cited commentaries he wrote and interviews he did with foreign media.
	Lai, who was already being held on other fraud charges after police raided his media company, could be seen handcuffed to a chain around his waist as guards led him to a van to go from prison to court. He wore a navy blazer and an open-neck shirt.
	Beijing imposed the national security law on Hong Kong earlier this year after stormy protests in 2019 that started over an extradition bill and expanded to include demands for greater democracy in the former British colony.
	The new law outlaws secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces to intervene in Hong Kong's affairs. It has constricted free speech in the city, and democracy activists see it as a way to suppress dissent.
	U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo tweeted Saturday morning Asia time that the security law ""makes a mockery of justice."" He called for Lai's release, saying his only crime is speaking the truth about China's authoritarian Communist Party government.
	Lai, the highest-profile person charged under the security law, has also been arrested for other alleged offences this year. He has been charged with taking part in unauthorized protests and with fraud over alleged violations of office lease terms.
	He has advocated for other countries to take a harsher stance on China, and met with Pompeo and Vice-President Mike Pence in the U.S. last year to discuss the extradition bill, which the Hong Kong government eventually withdrew.
	Pence also tweeted about Lai, saying the charges against him are ""an affront to freedom loving people around everywhere."""

              Relatives make plea for info on Hong Kong detainees in China

	Relatives of a dozen Hong Kong residents who have been detained in mainland China for more than 3 1/2 months made a plea Saturday to be informed of the timing of any trials and whether they can attend.
	The request underscored the sharp contrast between the relatively open legal system in Hong Kong, a semi-autonomous Chinese territory, and that of the mainland, where often little information is divulged until a trial is over.
	""I miss my son so much,"" the mother of Wong Wai-yin, one of the detainees, said, choking up. ""I want to visit him so badly. I haven't seen my son in a very long time -- it's almost four months. Please tell me (about the trial). I'm just an ordinary mother.""
	The 12 were arrested at sea in August while they were apparently making a bid to flee to Taiwan after a tough national security law took effect in Hong Kong earlier this year.
	They were picked up after entering mainland waters for crossing the maritime border without permission. At least some took part in anti-government protests in 2019 and were facing charges in Hong Kong.
	Though Hong Kong is a part of China, travellers must still pass through immigration when going to and from the mainland.
	Two are being held on suspicion of organizing an illegal border crossing. The group has been locked up in Shenzhen, a southern Chinese city that borders Hong Kong.
	The relatives covered their faces with masks, and some wore sunglasses, caps or hoods to hide their identities as they spoke at a news conference. They did not give their names.
	Owen Chow, an activist who has been helping the families, said they wanted to know whether the trials would be open to the public and if family members could attend.
	He and some family members questioned the authenticity of letters some of the latter had received, purportedly from their detained relatives, saying they were being held in a good environment and not abused.
	""The only thing I can do is to have dissatisfaction and be angry,"" said a relative of Tang Kai-yin, another detainee. ""I don't know what else to do."""

              As leaders set fresh climate goals, Biden pledges U.S. support
          
","
              U.S. President-elect Joe Biden pledged Saturday to rejoin the Paris climate accord on the first day of his presidency, as world leaders staged a virtual gathering to celebrate the fifth anniversary of the international pact aimed at curbing global warming.

	U.S. President-elect Joe Biden pledged Saturday to rejoin the Paris climate accord on the first day of his presidency, as world leaders staged a virtual gathering to celebrate the fifth anniversary of the international pact aimed at curbing global warming.
	Heads of state and government from over 70 countries took part in the event -- hosted by Britain, France, Italy, Chile and the United Nations -- to announce greater efforts in cutting the greenhouse gas emissions that fuel global warming.
	The outgoing administration of U.S. President Donald Trump, who pulled Washington out of the Paris accord, wasn't represented at the online gathering. But in a written statement sent shortly before it began, Biden made clear the U.S. was waiting on the sidelines to join again and noted that Washington was key to negotiating the 2015 agreement, which has since been ratified by almost all countries around the world.Â 
	""The United States will rejoin the Paris Agreement on day one of my presidency,"" he said. ""I'll immediately start working with my counterparts around the world to do all that we possibly can, including by convening the leaders of major economies for a climate summit within my first 100 days in office.""
	Biden reiterated his campaign pledge that his administration will set a target of cutting U.S. emissions to net zero ""no later than 2050.""
	Experts say commitments put forward by the international community in the past five years have already improved the long-term outlook on climate change, making the worst-case scenarios less likely by the end of the century. But wildfires in the Amazon, Australia and America, floods in Bangladesh and East Africa, and record temperatures in the Arctic have highlighted the impact an increase of 1.2 degrees Celsius (2.2 Fahrenheit) since pre-industrial times is already having on the planet.
	""If we don't change course, we may be headed for a catastrophic temperature rise of more than 3 degrees (Celsius) this century,"" UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said, urging world leaders to declare a ""climate emergency.""
	The Paris agreement aims to cap global warming at well under 2 C (3.6 F), ideally no more than 1.5 C (2.7 F), by the end of the century. Meeting the temperature target will require a phasing-out of fossil fuels and better protection for the world's carbon-soaking forests, wetlands and oceans.
	The UN chief called the announced U.S. return to the Paris accord ""a very important signal.""
	""We look forward for a very active U.S. leadership in climate action from now on,"" Guterres said. ""The United States is the largest economy in the world, it's absolutely essential for our goals to be reached.""
	Biden insisted that the dramatic economic shifts needed would be positive for American workers.
	""We have before us an enormous economic opportunity to create jobs and prosperity at home and export clean American-made products around the world, harnessing our climate ambition in a way that is good for American workers and the U.S. economy,"" he said.
	American representatives at the virtual meeting included Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, Gov. Charlie Baker of Massachusetts and U.S. business leaders, such as Apple chief executive Tim Cook.
	Also absent from the event were major economies such as Australia, Brazil, Indonesia, Mexico, Russia and Saudi Arabia. Most have offered no significant improvements on their existing emissions targets lately.
	Environmental campaigners singled out Brazil's recent announcement that it will stick to its target of cutting emissions by 43 per cent over the next decade compared with 2005 levels and aim for net zero by 2060 -- later than most other countries.
	By contrast, an agreement Friday by European Union members to beef up the continent's 2030 targets from 40 per cent to at least 55 per cent compared with 1990 levels was broadly welcomed, though activists said it could have aimed even higher.
	China, the world's biggest emitter, also surprised the world in September by announcing a net zero target of 2060, with emissions peaking by 2030. In his speech Saturday, Chinese President Xi Jinping provided further details on his country's medium-term goal for improving energy efficiency and ramping up electricity generated from renewable sources of power such as wind and solar.
	But Xi also cautioned that ""unilateralism will lead us nowhere"" -- a veiled reference to discussions in the EU to impose tariffs on goods imported from countries that have less stringent emissions standards than the 27-nation bloc. The issue is likely to dominate discussion between China, the EU and the U.S. in coming years.
	The Maldives, an Indian Ocean nation made up of low-lying islands that are particularly vulnerable to sea level rise, announced Saturday that it will now aim to achieve net zero by 2030, one of the most ambitious goals worldwide. Bhutan and Suriname claim to have already achieved that goal.
	The 189 countries that are party to the Paris agreement are required to submit their updated targets to the United Nations by the end of the year. This would normally have occurred at the annual UN climate summit, but the event was postponed for a year because of the pandemic.
	The gathering, now scheduled to take place in Glasgow, Scotland, in November 2021, will see haggling over financial support for poor countries to cope with climate change, and fine-tuning the rules for international markets in emissions trading. Britain, next year's host, announced this month that it's aiming to cut emissions by 68 per cent over the next decade and end state support for fossil fuel industry exports.
	Former UN climate chief Christiana Figueres, who was a key player at the Paris negotiations, said leaders had a duty to be optimistic about their ability to curb global warming.
	""Because if we don't, the alternative is unthinkable,"" she said. ""None of us adults alive today want to have on our shoulders the responsibility of turning over a world that is a world of misery for generations to come.""

	The U.S. gave the final go-ahead Friday to the nation's first COVID-19 vaccine, marking what could be the beginning of the end of an outbreak that has killed nearly 300,000 Americans, according to a person familiar with the decision but not authorized to discuss it publicly.
	Shots for health workers and nursing home residents are expected to begin in the coming days after the Food and Drug Administration authorized an emergency rollout of what promises to be a strongly protective vaccine from Pfizer Inc. and its German partner BioNTech.
	Initial doses are scarce and rationed as the U.S. joins Britain and several other countries in scrambling to vaccinate as many people as possible ahead of a long, grim winter. It will take months of work to tamp down the coronavirus that has surged to catastrophic levels in recent weeks and already claimed 1.5 million lives globally.
	While the FDA decision came only after public review of data from a huge ongoing study, it has also been dogged by intense political pressure from the Trump administration, which has accused the agency of being too slow and even threatened to remove FDA chief Stephen Hahn if a ruling did not come Friday.
	The move sets off what will be the largest vaccination campaign in U.S. history -- but it also has global ramifications because it's a role model to many other countries facing the same decision.
	The world desperately needs multiple vaccines for enough to go around, and the Pfizer-BioNTech shot is the first based on rigorous scientific testing to emerge from that worldwide race -- a record-setting scientific achievement that shaved years off the usual process.
	""I don't think you would have found a scientist on this planet that would have predicted this 11 months ago,"" said Dr. Paul Offit, a vaccine expert at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia who advises the FDA.
	The U.S. is considering a second vaccine, made by Moderna Inc., that could roll out in another week. In early January, Johnson & Johnson expects to learn if its vaccine is working in final testing.
	Europe is set to make its own decision on the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna shots later this month, an important step as some other candidates that multiple countries were anxiously awaiting have hit roadblocks. Friday, Sanofi and GSK announced a months-long delay after early tests showed their vaccine didn't work well enough in older adults.
	And China and Russia didn't wait for final-stage tests before beginning vaccinations with some homegrown shots.
	About 3 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine are expected in the first shipments around the country, according to officials with Operation Warp Speed, the Trump administration's vaccine development program. A similar amount is to be held in reserve for those recipients' second dose.
	A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advisory committee is poised to recommend who's first in line. Expected to follow health workers and nursing homes are other essential workers, older adults and people at high risk because of other health problems. U.S. authorities don't expect enough for the general population before spring, and that's assuming there are no manufacturing glitches.
	In a still unfinished study of nearly 44,000 people, the FDA found the vaccine was safe and more than 90% effective across recipients of different ages, including older adults, races and those with health problems that put them at high risk from the coronavirus.
	Emergency use means the vaccine still is experimental. Most important for would-be recipients to know:
	--Some protection begins after the first dose, but it takes a second dose three weeks later for full protection. It's unclear how long protection lasts.
	--The vaccine protects against COVID-19 illness, but no one yet knows if it can stop the silent, symptomless spread that accounts for roughly half of all cases. The ongoing study will attempt to answer that but for now, the vaccinated still will need to wear a mask and keep their distance.
	--Expect a sore arm and some flu-like symptoms such as fever, fatigue, headache and chills after the second dose. While uncomfortable, those reactions only last about a day. ""That's just your immune system working. It's a good thing,"" Offit said.
	--Authorities are investigating several allergic reactions reported in Britain by people with a history of severe allergies. Offit said it is routine in the U.S. for the vaccinated to stick around for a half-hour so they could get prompt treatment if such reactions appear.
	If emergency use of Moderna's vaccine also is authorized, the U.S. expects to vaccinate 20 million people by the end of December. They hope to have enough for another 30 million people in January and 50 million in February.
	Getting shots into arms is the big challenge, especially as a new poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found only half of Americans want the vaccine when it's their turn. About a quarter say they won't get it and the rest aren't sure.
	Political interference has complicated health authorities' message that the testing was rigorous and cut no corners.
	President Donald Trump bashed the FDA, again, Friday for taking too long, complaining that the agency ""is still a big, old slow turtle."" One of his deputies even pressed Hahn to clear the shots by the end of the day or face possible firing, two administration officials said.
	The FDA is unique in analyzing drugmakers' raw data, a process that takes longer than many other countries' regulatory reviews. In addition, the FDA insisted that large COVID-19 vaccine studies track at least half the participants for two months to look for side effects, a time period when historically any vaccine problems appear.

	The issue came to a head following a report by the Globe and Mail that top officials at Global Affairs, concerned the Chinese government would view it as a retaliatory move over its detention of Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, was âalarmedâ that General Jonathan Vance cancelled winter military exercises with the Peopleâs Liberation Army in 2019 at CFB Petawawa.
	The news comes as Kovrig and Spavor marked their second anniversary in Chinese prison on what Canada and its Western allies say are unfounded espionage charges that followed Canadaâs arrest of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou on a U.S. extradition warrant in December 2018.
	âOur government always stands up for Canadians at home and abroad and this includes our relationship with China. But let me be very clear, we do not train with Chinese military,â said Minister Sajjan, adding that this initiative was originally put in place by the Conservative government under Stephen Harper.
	âIt was the previous government that actually signed a co-operation plan initiative in 2013 under Rob Nicholson, when he was the Minister of National Defence â¦ because of the agreement they had signed, this is one of the reasons why we actually changed our approach because of the concerns the member outlined,â Sajjan said.
	Bezan, who served as Parliamentary Secretary of National Defence under Nicholson at the time, said Canada was engaging in âhostage diplomacyâ and that the Chinese government back then âis completely different to the Chinese government today.â
	Conservative leader Erin OâToole called the joint training exercise a âdangerous path for the Trudeau government to take"" and called Canada's dealings with China a ""dangerously naive approach [that] has put Canada and our citizens at risk.â
	The Canadian Armed Forces have participated in various joint and regional military exercises for decades with some two dozen Pacific Rim countries. Specifically, Canada advanced its bilateral defence relationship with China through talks between senior military officials on both sides in March 2012 and June 2013. The Cooperation Plan Initiative, which would guide defence-related activities, was signed in Ottawa in August 2013.
	Chinaâs President Xi Jinping, who came into power in March 2013, has tightened his control over the country in recent years through mass detention and surveillance of its Muslim population in Xinjiang, a crackdown on activism, heavy Internet censorship, consolidation of power and removal of presidential term limits. He has also taken a more assertive and harder-line approach to foreign affairs and defending Chinaâs interests.
	Mengâs arrest, and the subsequent arrest of Kovrig and Spavor shortly after, soured relations between Canada and China. Trudeau has spoken to U.S. president-elect Joe Biden about the situation, but has not said whether Biden might revisit the Justice Departmentâs efforts to extradite Meng. Should the U.S. withdraw its charges against Meng, it could give China a reason to release Kovrig and Spavor.
	âWe will always stand up for Canadians who are arbitrarily detained. This is one of the reasons why we actually stopped our training with the Chinese,â Sajjan said.

              Olympics on tight timeline to chart new path on protest
          
","
              For generations, the IOC knew exactly where to look for key support of its ban against protests at the Olympics. This week, the American federation put the IOC on notice: It is no longer the IOC's partner when it comes to enforcing the contentious Rule 50.
        ","
                  Friday, Dec. 11, 2020
                ",https://www.ctvnews.ca/sports/olympics-on-tight-timeline-to-chart-new-path-on-protest-1.5227276,"
	For generations, the IOC knew exactly where to look for key support of its ban against protests at the Olympics.
	In 1968, it was the U.S. Olympic Committee that sent home its own athletes, Tommie Smith and John Carlos, when they raised their fists while on the medals stand at the Mexico City Games.
	In 2019, it was the same organization that placed its own athlete, Gwen Berry, on probation for doing the same after her win at the Pan-Am Games.
	This week, the American federation put the IOC on notice: It is no longer the IOC's partner when it comes to enforcing the contentious Rule 50. The USOPC is now heeding the calls from many of its own athletes and will no longer punish them for kneeling or raising fists or any other kind of acceptable demonstration at the Olympics.
	âWhen you sit in my seat, you have to make decisions that you think are on the right side of history,â said CEO Sarah Hirshland. âAnd I believe we're on the right side of history.â
	But there are details to iron out, and they strike to the heart of how much change is truly possible between now and next July, when the Tokyo Olympics are scheduled to take place.
	High on the list: What can athletes demonstrate about, and what will an acceptable demonstration look like?
	âThat becomes a difficult situation,â said Harry Edwards, the activist who helped brainstorm the gestures by Smith and Carlos 52 years ago. âBecause you could very easily get into a thing of trying to outdo someone else and it ends up having nothing to do with the spirit of the issue.â
	That confusion helps explain the calculated response to the USOPC that came from the IOC in the form of a short release from the head of its athlete commission, swimmer Kirsty Coventry of Zimbabwe.
	Well aware that the protest rule can't stay as-is for the foreseeable future, Coventry and the IOC are in the process of surveying athletes across the globe for their thoughts about possible changes. She said the majority of the respondents believe in the right of free speech, which is ârespectedâ at the Olympic Games (but only in certain settings) and âexpress support for preserving the ceremonies, the podium and the field of play.â
	Though Coventry's committee is still accepting feedback, and won't make any final decisions until early next year, she's previewing a far less radical adjustment to Rule 50 than the U.S. contingent would like.
	American athletes have been reeling from a summer of unrest over police violence against Black people in the United States. Every major sports league has agreed to change policies to give their players a bigger platform to discuss race and social injustice.
	But U.S. sports leagues and the Olympics are very different creatures. The Olympics are a behemoth that counts America as only one of 206 countries who are members.
	Some of the biggest members are among the IOC's most important partners - China, for instance, hosted the 2008 Olympics and will do so again in 2022 - and they don't share the same concerns or values about free speech or racial injustice as do the United States and many of its closest allies.
	âMany have also recognized the practical question of how to choose between the opinions of hundreds of issues from different angles across the world,â Coventry said of her survey respondents. âWe can see that it would be very difficult to make such a judgment without dividing the athlete community across all 206 NOCs.â
	Moushaumi Robinson, who led the U.S. athletes group that pressed for the changes, said she understands the complexities. Her group continues to discuss them to try to come up with solutions.
	âA lot of us just want to be able to say `I may not agree with you but I respect that you have a voice,â' she said. âAnd we want to be able to express it without someone punishing you for it.â
	All of which leads Edwards to believe that Thursday's move by the USOPC and its athletes is a sign of progress - not necessarily a huge leap but another step.
	âThis is an ongoing struggle, and it's going to continue to be a struggle,â he said. âAnd what today reflects is that this generation of athletes is more than willing to do their part.â"

              Diverse TV holiday season includes all-Asian Lifetime movie
          
","
              In one scene from the Lifetime TV movie, âA Sugar & Spice Holiday,â a co-worker says to Suzy, an Asian American architect in Los Angeles: âI didn't know if Christmas was a big deal where you're from.â
        ","
                  Friday, Dec. 11, 2020
                ",https://www.ctvnews.ca/entertainment/diverse-tv-holiday-season-includes-all-asian-lifetime-movie-1.5227204,"
	In one scene from the Lifetime TV movie, âA Sugar & Spice Holiday,â a co-worker says to Suzy, an Asian American architect in Los Angeles: âI didn't know if Christmas was a big deal where you're from.â
	Retorts Suzy: âI'm from Maine.â
	A lot of viewers of a cozy Christmas film might just shrug off the insinuation that Suzy is somehow not American. But for an Asian audience, that brief exchange is a knowing reminder that microaggressions don't take a holiday. They especially haven't in the wake of the pandemic, which has triggered anti-Asian racism and terms like âChinese virusâ and âkung flu.â
	âI think it's great timing for us for this movie to be coming out now during the pandemic with the perception of the Asian culture and the `flu' and all,â Canadian actor Jacky Lai, who plays Suzy, told The Associated Press. âI really do hope that this (movie) - with our faces - is able to hopefully be welcomed by people into their homes and see us as just your American/Canadian friends.â
	âA Sugar & Spice Holiday,â premiering Sunday, may be the first feel-good TV Christmas flick to feature a mostly Asian ensemble. It's one of several projects where cable channels are demonstrating a desire for inclusion this yuletide season. The shift comes a year after the Hallmark Channel dropped an ad that included a same-sex couple. The fallout pointed to an overall diversity problem in the genre with not just the LGBTQ community, but communities of colour. Recent months of racial unrest only added to the conversation within the entertainment industry about representation.
	Tia Maggini, vice-president of Lifetime Original Movies, says it was a coincidence that screenwriter Eirene Donohue, who is Asian American and had worked with the them before, came to them with the story pitch.
	âIt was exciting to be presented with this particular point of view that has been long overdue for the Christmas movie genre,â Maggini said in a statement. Most important: The movie itself was actually funny and âfull of Christmas heart.â
	Indeed, the rom-com has all the warm, familiar holiday movie tropes. Suzy returns to the small town where she grew up for Christmas, is persuaded to revive her baking skills for a local gingerbread house competition and is assisted by her former high school crush (Tony Giroux).
	Her father is played by veteran actor Tzi Ma. Despite a year filled with high profile film roles in âThe Farewellâ and âMulan,â Ma didn't hesitate to join a Lifetime movie.
	âIt was the first time a Chinese American family was featured on a Christmas story,â Ma said in an email. âLifetime has a tremendous Asian American following. It's a way to say thank you to them.â
	In Hollywood, it can often feel like studios only cast Asians in narratives where there's some kind of hardship or East-meets-West struggle. And with TV holiday movies, they're almost nonexistent. Meanwhile, there are white actors who have made a baker's dozen of them. Like any other group, Giroux says, Asians deserve to see themselves in lighthearted fare regularly.
	âI think it's so important to have all sorts of stories with any culture - for them to have exposure to the stories of struggle but it's such a delight to see something lighter, to see aspects of culture that aren't surrounded with times of difficulty,â Giroux says.
	Giroux, who is Canadian, is also looking forward to queuing up a movie where his grandparents can see themselves.
	âI'm really excited for them to see a story that covers part of their story. My grandparents immigrated here from China from in the `50s,â Giroux says. âThat's why being part of this project is telling a story that I'm really a part of.â
	Lai grew up loving romantic comedies. She remembers unexpectedly getting emotional watching âCrazy Rich Asians,â the first major Hollywood studio film with an all-Asian cast in 25 years.
	âYou hear people say there hasn't been a movie like this in 25 years. You hear those things. But it's not until I sat in the theatre and watched someone who looked like me on screen who wasn't a ninja or a nerd but someone just like me. I remember the way it felt,â Lai says. âI am so excited that there's another movie like that and hopefully we bring joy and open some minds with this movie and more opportunities.â
	The movie is lovingly sprinkled with Chinese American nuances on script and screen. These include a photo of Suzy's deceased grandma flanked by incense sticks and the entire family eating with chopsticks. And it is definitely the only Christmas movie to feature both gingerbread and stinky tofu, a beloved Chinese dish known for its pungent smell.
	âI love that we were able to kind of include a lot of nice details. ... It's really a romantic comedy where the characters happen to be Asian American,â says Jennifer Liao, the director. âIt's nice to make an Asian American movie that's not necessarily completely frontloaded with having to carry the weight of cultural identity issues and things like that.â
	âSugar & Spiceâ is not the only holiday movie expanding the definition of who can lead these kinds of flicks. A handful of networks, including Lifetime and Hallmark, have a Christmas-themed movie on their slate featuring a same-sex pairing. Tony winner Ali Stroker, who uses a wheelchair, stars in Lifetime's âChristmas Ever After.â
	Does Liao feel pressure as âthe firstâ even on such an innocuous project to bring in a sizeable audience? âI feel like the pressure is more to deliver something that I and everybody else worked on can be proud of. That was really no. 1,â Liao says.
	Lai doesn't see the point of getting caught up in things like ratings.
	âI think that it is really, really nice to hear when someone says `I got to see someone who looks like me on screen.' That will never get old,â Lai says. âWe get more responses like that - for me, the movie did its purpose.â

	India on Friday rejected a Chinese allegation that it is responsible for high tensions along their disputed border.
	Indian External Affairs Ministry spokesman Anurag Srivastava said the six-month standoff between the two countries' armies ""has been a result of the actions of the Chinese side, which has sought to effect a unilateral change in the status along the Line of Actual Control in Eastern Ladakh.""
	Srivastava was responding to a statement by Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying in Beijing on Thursday that ""the rights and wrongs of what has happened in the China-India border area are very clear and the responsibility lies squarely with the Indian side.""
	Hua also said that China is firmly committed to safeguarding its sovereignty. ""We hope that India will work with China in the same direction and do more things conducive to solidarity, co-operation and common development,"" she said.
	The standoff between the Asian giants erupted into a fierce brawl in May and worsened into hand-to-hand combat on June 15 with soldiers using clubs, stones and fists, leaving 20 Indian troops dead. China is believed to also have suffered casualties, but has not given any details.
	The countries have held a series of talks on ending the standoff without any breakthrough."

              Chinese authorities detain Bloomberg news assistant
          
","
              U.S. financial news service Bloomberg said Friday that Chinese authorities have detained one of its Beijing-based news assistants on what they said was suspicion of endangering national security.

	U.S. financial news service Bloomberg said Friday that Chinese authorities have detained one of its Beijing-based news assistants on what they said was suspicion of endangering national security.
	Bloomberg reported that Chinese citizen Haze Fan was seen being taken from her apartment building accompanied by security officers in plain clothes at about noon on Monday, shortly after her last contact with her editors.
	It quoted a Chinese government statement as saying Fan was detained by the Beijing branch of the National Security Bureau ""according to relevant Chinese law on suspicion of engaging in criminal activities that jeopardize national security.""
	China permits Chinese citizens to work only as translators, researchers and assistants for foreign news organizations, not as registered journalists able to report independently. China's own media are almost entirely state owned and tightly controlled, and the country has long been one of the leading jailers of journalists.
	Bloomberg said it has been seeking information about Fan's whereabouts from the Chinese government and from China's embassy in Washington, D.C.
	It said its parent company, Bloomberg LP, was informed Thursday that she was being held on suspicion of endangering national security, a vaguely defined charge that can lead to lengthy detention with little recourse to legal assistance.
	""We are very concerned for her, and have been actively speaking to Chinese authorities to better understand the situation. We are continuing to do everything we can to support her while we seek more information,"" a Bloomberg spokesperson was quoted as saying in the report.
	Fan began working for Bloomberg in 2017 after stints with a number of other foreign news organizations in China, the company said.
	China has detained news assistants in the past over reports that angered the ruling Communist Party, and authorities have also sought to punish foreign media more generally by limiting their operations, expelling journalists or issuing them only short-term visas.
	China this year expelled journalists from The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal and other American outlets amid complaints over content and moves by the U.S. to send home dozens of Chinese journalists working for state media.
	Bloomberg saw its business in financial information suffer in China several years ago in apparent retaliation for its reporting on the personal financial dealings of leading Chinese officials."

	Pakistan's foreign minister on Friday called for the United Nations and the European Union to investigate a recent report's findings that exposed a 15-year disinformation campaign to serve India's interests and discredit Pakistan.
	The extensive report was published earlier this week by EU DisinfoLab, a Brussels-based nongovernmental organization. The findings detail how 10 defunct but U.N.-accredited NGOs were ""revived"" in order to influence the EU and the U.N. Human Rights Council. It also uncovered over 750 fake local media outlets used to spread disinformation.
	At a news conference, Shah Mahmood Qureshi urged the U.N. and the EU to ""immediately begin an investigation and delisting of the 10 fake NGOs created by India to malign Pakistan.""
	""We also call on the United Nations to create processes that ensure that the international system is not manipulated through such influence operations,"" he said.
	The EU DisinfoLab report, entitled ""Indian Chronicles,"" did not explicitly attribute the campaign to the Indian government or its intelligence agencies.
	The report said the operation was led by the Srivastava Group, a business conglomerate that came into the spotlight in India after organizing a visit to the disputed Kashmir region for far-right members of the European Parliament in late 2019.
	Qureshi, however, directly accused New Delhi of running the campaign.
	""The scope and extent of India's operations against Pakistan under their hybrid war is now apparent for the world to see. Pakistan will take all necessary actions to protect its interests,"" he said.
	There was no immediate comment from India.
	The two nuclear armed rivals have a history of bitter relations, and have fought three wars since gaining independence from Britain in 1947.
	The EU DisinfoLab report comes less than a month after Pakistan accused India of sponsoring ""terrorism"" aimed at destabilizing the country and targeting its economic partnership with China.
	India has likewise accused Pakistan of sponsoring militant groups that have carried out attacks inside its borders in recent years.

	Sales in the industry's biggest global market rose 11.6% over a year earlier to 2.3 million, according to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers. Total vehicle sales, including trucks and buses, rose 12.6% to 2.8 million, holding steady at October's growth rate.
	From January to November, passenger vehicle sales were off 7.6% from the same period of 2019, at 17.8 million. Sales of commercial vehicles rose 20.6% to 4.7 million.
	Full-year auto sales are on track to decline for a third year after hitting a peak in 2017.
	China, where the pandemic began in December, became the first country to reopen its economy after the disease was declared under control in March.
	November sales of all-electric and gasoline-electric hybrid vehicles more than doubled, rising 104.9% over a year earlier. Sales in the first 11 months of 2020 edged back above pre-virus levels, rising 3.9% over a year earlier.
	Auto demand already was weak before China closed factories and dealerships in February to fight the coronavirus. Consumers are uneasy about slowing economic growth and a tariff war with Washington.
	That hurts global automakers that are looking to China to propel sales growth and are spending heavily to develop electric vehicles under pressure to meet Chinese government sales quotas."

              Tipping point? Experts say the Paris agreement changed the climate on climate
          
","
              Five years after it was passed, the Paris agreement may finally be changing the climate on climate change, with some activists saying it contributed to a stronger climate movement.
        ","
                  Friday, Dec. 11, 2020
                ",https://www.ctvnews.ca/climate-and-environment/tipping-point-experts-say-the-paris-agreement-changed-the-climate-on-climate-1.5226765,"
	Five years after it was passed, the Paris agreement may finally be changing the climate on climate change.
	""I've always known we're not going to act as soon as we could have,"" said Mark Jaccard, a widely consulted energy economist at Simon Fraser University.
	""I also know that when we do start to act, it'll be very fast. It'll be one of those tipping points and it could be that we're at one right now.""
	On Dec. 12, 2015, 196 countries met in Paris and put their signatures on a legally binding treaty to do what it took to limit global warming to below two degrees Celsius and to create carbon-neutral economies by 2050.
	Progress on those promises has been spotty.
	The United Nations annual emissions gap report released this week points out that greenhouse gas emissions have continued to grow and reached record levels in 2019. Even with a seven per cent decline in emissions expected this year because of the COVID-19 pandemic, atmospheric concentrations are expected to rise.
	The Liberal government has committed Canada to being carbon neutral by 2050. But it has released no plan for the three to four per cent annual cuts that it would take to get there. Canada has never met any of its previous climate goals and is one of five G20 countries behind on its Paris commitments.
	And yet ...
	""We have a much stronger climate movement that we did,"" said Keith Stewart of Greenpeace. ""A lot of the big forces in the world are starting to line up behind the transition.""
	More and more financial institutions -- including, just this week, the $225-billion New York state pension fund -- are divesting from fossil fuels or decarbonizing. The UN says 126 countries, including China, have either adopted binding net-zero goals or are considering them.
	The cost of renewable energy is plummeting -- 90 per cent for solar power, says an Oxford University publication. Some countries -- again, including China -- are putting end dates on the sale of gas-powered vehicles.
	""The effort is picking up speed,"" Jaccard said.
	Without Paris, Canada wouldn't have achieved what it has, federal Environment Minister Jonathan Wilkinson told an online webinar Thursday.
	""Canadians were really tired of inaction,"" he said. ""The pan-Canadian framework was something that came out of the Paris agreement.""
	The federal Liberals have implemented a carbon tax, signed agreements to reduce methane releases, promised a clean-fuel standard to cut vehicle emissions, announced $1.5 billion in funding for electric buses and charging stations, and helped phase out coal-generated power.
	""The Trudeau government is the only federal government Canada's had that is implementing the pricing and regulations that actually reduce emissions,"" Jaccard said.
	Wilkinson promises even more.
	""We know that more ambition will be required.""
	More is needed than just a new set of targets, Stewart said. Canadians who depend on the fossil fuel industry need help with the transition.
	""There's a whole bunch of people who are going to be hurt badly if we don't do this properly,"" he said. ""The rest of the country is going to be supporting Alberta, Saskatchewan and Newfoundland.""
	Jaccard said some way may be needed to prevent countries that aren't limiting emissions from having a trade advantage. Tariffs that penalize products from high-carbon jurisdictions are being discussed both at home and abroad, he said.
	""How do you get any kind of collective action when there are easy rewards for cheating? You have to have penalty mechanisms.""
	Paris made a real difference and progress is out there, said Jaccard.

A Chinese citizen who allegedly financed a turtle-trafficking ring has been extradited from Malaysia to the United States, the Department of Justice (DOJ) announced in a statement on Thursday.
	Kang Juntao, 24, from Hangzhou in eastern China, was initially charged with money laundering last February. Between June 2017 and December 2018, he allegedly financed a nationwide ring of people who purchased turtles in the U.S. belonging to five protected species, and arranged for them to be illegally shipped to Hong Kong.
	""The turtles were inhumanely bound with duct tape and placed in socks so as not to alert customs authorities,"" the DOJ statement said.
	According to Kang's indictment, at least 1,500 turtles -- with a total value of US$2,250,000 -- were smuggled out of the U.S.
	Using a PayPal account, Kang allegedly purchased turtles from sellers advertising on social media or reptile trade websites.
	These sellers allegedly shipped the turtles to ""middlemen"" who were ""typically Chinese citizens who entered the country on student visas,"" according to the DOJ. Kang allegedly paid and instructed them to repackage the turtles, and use false labels for shipment to Hong Kong.
	Once in Hong Kong, the turtles were allegedly sold on the black market for thousands of dollars each.
	Kang allegedly did not declare the turtles to U.S. or Chinese customs, or obtain required permits from the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES).
	Authorities allege Kang trafficked the eastern box turtle, the Florida box turtle, the Gulf Coast box turtle, the spotted turtle, and the wood turtle -- all protected species under the CITES treaty.
	Kang was arrested at Malaysia's Kuala Lumpur International Airport last January before his extradition to the U.S. on Thursday.
	""Wildlife trafficking is a serious crime that impacts imperiled species at home and abroad,"" said Aurelia Skipwith, director of the US Fish and Wildlife Service, in the DOJ statement."

	EEuropean Union leaders reached a hard-fought deal Friday to cut the bloc's net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55 per cent by the end of the decade compared with 1990 levels, avoiding a hugely embarrassing deadlock ahead of a UN climate meeting this weekend.
	Following night-long discussions at their two-day summit in Brussels, the 27 member states approved the EU executive commission's proposal to toughen the bloc's intermediate target on the way to climate neutrality by mid-century, after a group of reluctant, coal-reliant countries finally agreed to support the improved goal.
	""Europe is the leader in the fight against climate change,"" tweeted EU Council president Charles Michel as daylight broke over the EU capital city. ""We decided to cut our greenhouse gas emissions of at least 55 by 2030.""Â 
	German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the 21-hour summit during which the climate debate was a constant worry, had much to show for it. ""It was worth having a sleepless night,"" she said.
	UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres' spokesman, Stephane Dujarric, hailed Friday's deal.
	""It's a very welcome announcement, one that inscribes itself in the efforts the secretary-general has called on member states, the groups of member states, to take,"" Dujarric said.
	Five years after the Paris agreement, the EU wants to be a leader in the fight against global warming. Yet the bloc's leaders were unable to agree on the new target the last time they met in October, mainly because of financial concerns by eastern nations seeking more clarity about how to fund and handle the green transition.
	But the long-awaited deal on a massive long-term budget and coronavirus recovery clinched Thursday by EU leaders swung the momentum.
	Large swaths of the record-high 1.82 trillion-euro package are set to pour into programs and investments designed to help the member states, regions and sectors particularly affected by the green transition, which are in need of a deep economic and social transformation. EU leaders have agreed that 30 per cent of the package -- some 550 billion euros -- should be used to support the transition.
	Still, agreeing on common language was not an easy task. Negotiations were punctuated throughout the night by intense discussions in the plenary session and multiple chats in smaller groups on the sidelines.
	Another delay in revising the EU's current 40 per cent emission cuts objective for 2030 would have been particularly embarrassing before the virtual Climate Ambition Summit marking five years since the Paris deal, and leaders worked to the wire to seal a deal.
	The event on Saturday will be co-hosted by the U.K. with the United Nations and France.
	French President Emmanuel Macron praised ""a major signal"" that will enable EU leaders ""to bring in our wake our big international partners, especially the United States and China.""
	British Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced last week he wants the U.K. to cut greenhouse gas emissions by at least 68 per cent from 1990 levels by 2030 -- a more ambitious goal than the EU's.
	Poland, which last year didn't commit to the EU's 2050 climate neutrality goal, and other eastern countries, including the Czech Republic and Hungary, largely depend on coal for their energy needs. They considered it unfair that all member states should be submitted to the same ambition without considering their respective energy mixes.
	To win their approval, member states agreed that the new target should be delivered collectively. According to the Belgian Prime minister's office, ""leaders agreed that the cuts will be first achieved in sectors and countries where there is still plenty of room for improvement.""
	In addition, the European Commission will take into account specific national situations when drawing up the measures. A progress report will be submitted to the European Council in the spring.
	The accord also left the door open to member states to use gas or nuclear power as they drop fossil fuels. EU leaders agreed last year that nuclear energy would be part of the bloc's solution to making its economy carbon neutral, and they reiterated Friday that they would respect member states' rights to decide on their energy mix and to choose the most appropriate technologies to reach the goal.
	According to a French official who was not authorized to speak publicly about the meeting, Poland also obtained guarantees that the EU's Emissions Trading System -- a cap-and-trade scheme for industries to buy carbon credits covering about 40 per cent of the EU's greenhouse gas emissions -- would be revamped. Poland wants the reform of the system to redirect more revenues to the poorer EU countries.
	World leaders agreed five years ago in Paris to keep the global warming increase to below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit), and ideally no more than 1.5 degrees C (2.7 degrees F) by the end of the century. Under the Paris accord, countries are required to submit updated climate targets by the end of this year.
	Greenpeace and other environmental groups have said the improved EU target is insufficient to properly tackle climate change.
	""To increase the chances of limiting global heating to 1.5 C and avoid the worst effects of climate breakdown, Greenpeace is calling for at least a 65 per cent cut in EU emissions from polluting sectors by 2030,"" the NGO said.
	Climate Action Network Europe regretted that the revised ""net"" target includes carbon sinks like reforestation, meaning that emitting sectors will need to decarbonize less to reach the new goal.
	""As the Commission indicates itself in its 2030 Climate Target Plan, if the EU is successful in implementing the Commission's biodiversity, carbon removals could represent up to 5 per cent of emissions. In this case the real emissions reduction target would be as low as 50 per cent,"" the NGO said.
	EU leaders also encouraged the commission to propose a carbon tax at the bloc's borders for countries that did do not regulate CO2 emissions as strictly as the EU does.

	Hong Kong pro-democracy activist and media tycoon Jimmy Lai has been charged under the city's national security law, amid a widening crackdown on dissent, according to local media reports.
	Lai, who founded the Apple Daily tabloid, was charged on suspicion of colluding with foreign forces and endangering national security, local broadcaster TVB reported Friday. He is the most high-profile person out of more than two dozen charged under the law since it was implemented in June.
	He is scheduled to appear in court on Dec. 12, and could face a maximum punishment of life imprisonment.
	Police said in a statement that they arrested a 73-year-old man under the national security law, but did not name him.
	Lai was arrested under the national security law in August. He and two executives of Next Digital, the company that operates the Apple Daily newspaper, were later charged with fraud over accusations that they violated lease terms on office space the company. He was denied bail earlier this month.
	Beijing imposed the national security law in response to protests in Hong Kong that began in June 2019 over a proposed extradition law and expanded to include demands for greater democracy in the former British colony.
	The legislation outlaws secession, subversion, terrorism, and collusion with foreign forces to intervene in Hong Kong's internal affairs. In certain cases, those charged under the national security law could also face trial in mainland China, where the legal system is highly opaque.
	The sweeping legislation prompted more public protests and led to complaints that Beijing is violating the autonomy promised to Hong Kong when was handed over to China from Britain in 1997. Critics have said the law is also damaging Hong Kong's status as a business centre.
	Apple Daily criticized the law on its front page on July 1, calling it the ""final nail in the coffin"" of the territory's autonomy.
	Lai has advocated for other countries to take a harsher stance on China, and last year he travelled to the U.S. to meet with Vice-President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to discuss the proposed extradition bill.
	He was also arrested in February and April on charges of taking part in unauthorized protests. He also faces charges of joining an unauthorized vigil marking the anniversary of the June 4, 1989, crackdown on pro-democracy protests in Beijing's Tiananmen Square."

	The UN General Assembly approved a resolution over Russian objections Thursday commending progress in peace talks between the Afghan government and the Taliban while urging stepped-up efforts to tackle terrorist attacks by the Taliban, al-Qaida, the Islamic State extremist group and their affiliates.
	The vote in the 193-member world body was 130 in favour, Russia against, and China, Pakistan and Belarus abstaining. Fifty-nine countries did not vote.
	The 15-page resolution titled ""The Situation in Afghanistan"" covers a wide range of issues including peace and reconciliation, democracy, the rule of law, good governance, human rights, counter-narcotics, social and economic development and regional co-operation.
	While welcoming progress in the intra-Afghan talks, including the Dec. 2 agreement on rules of procedure for negotiations, the resolution ""condemns the high rate of continued violence."" It says this ""is contributing to an unacceptable number of casualties"" and calls for an immediate cessation of violence and strongly encourages the Afghan government and the Taliban ""to pursue confidence-building measures and to reduce violence.""
	The resolution reiterates the General Assembly's ""serious concern"" about the security situation in Afghanistan and stresses the need to continue to address the threat to the country's stability from violence committed by the Taliban, including the Haqqani Network, as well as al-Qaida, Islamic State, their affiliates ""and other terrorist and criminal groups.""
	Afghanistan's UN ambassador, Adela Raz, expressed regret that despite her government's strong support for the resolution it wasn't adopted by consensus, saying the measure reflects ""developments that are taking place on the ground and particularly the progress in the peace process.""
	Raz said the goal of the government, Afghanistan's neighbours and the General Assembly is to incorporate the Taliban as a political party. ""It is our utmost aim to see the Taliban as a constructive political party in the country, without the relationship with al-Qaida and other terrorist groups, working for prosperity and peace in Afghanistan,"" she said.
	Noting that UN experts monitoring sanctions against the Taliban say it ""maintains ties to terrorist groups such as al-Qaida,"" Raz said the resolution is balanced regarding ""the Taliban's willingness to take firm steps towards peace and reconciliation"" and its continuing attacks and terrorist ties.
	German Ambassador Christoph Heusgen, whose country led negotiations on the resolution, said that ""out of all the 'special years' for Afghanistan declared in the past two decades, 2020 was indeed singular."" Most important was the start of Afghan peace negotiations in September, he said after detailing all the events leading to the talks, starting with the U.S.-Taliban agreement in February.
	Heusgen also pointed to pledges of more than US$13 billion in foreign aid and stabilization for Afghanistan at a donors conference in Geneva just over two weeks ago as evidence that ""the international community stands firmly behind the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan and its ongoing quest to achieve self-reliance.""
	He said the resolution is ""constructive and forward-looking"" and the vote signals that the General Assembly ""stands behind the Afghan people in a very difficult period of the country.""
	Russia's deputy UN ambassador, Anna Evstigneeva, sharply criticized Germany's role in the negotiations, saying there was ""blatant disregard"" for Moscow's concerns. She also said it is ""an attempt to conceal the true scope"" of threats from the Islamic State extremist group and drug issues threatening the country's security.
	She accused Germany of having ""a pre-established biased position favouring one group of states,"" which she didn't name, and said it should no longer facilitate negotiations on the Afghanistan resolution in the General Assembly.
	Nonetheless, Evstigneeva said, ""we continue to support Afghanistan during this crucial period.""
	Germany's Heusgen responded by saying Russia's ""no"" vote sends the message that ""Russia today let down the Afghan people.""
	""All of us should have voted in favour and should have sent a strong signal to the Afghan people: In these difficult times, we stand behind you,"" he said."

              World carbon dioxide emissions drop 7 per cent in pandemic-hit 2020
          
","
              A locked-down pandemic-struck world cut its carbon dioxide emissions this year by 7%, the biggest drop ever, new preliminary figures show.
        ","

	A locked-down pandemic-struck world cut its carbon dioxide emissions this year by 7%, the biggest drop ever, new preliminary figures show.
	The Global Carbon Project, an authoritative group of dozens of international scientists who track emissions, calculated that the world will have put 37 billion U.S. tons (34 billion metric tons) of carbon dioxide in the air in 2020. That's down from 40.1 billion US tons (36.4 billion metric tons) in 2019, according a study published Thursday in the journal Earth System Science Data.
	Scientists say this drop is chiefly because people are staying home, travelling less by car and plane, and that emissions are expected to jump back up after the pandemic ends. Ground transportation makes up about one-fifth of emissions of carbon dioxide, the chief man-made heat-trapping gas.
	""Of course, lockdown is absolutely not the way to tackle climate change,"" said study co-author Corinne LeQuere, a climate scientist at the University of East Anglia.
	The same group of scientists months ago predicted emission drops of 4% to 7%, depending on the progression of COVID-19. A second coronavirus wave and continued travel reductions pushed the decrease to 7%, LeQuere said.
	Emissions dropped 12% in the United States and 11% in Europe, but only 1.7% in China. That's because China had an earlier lockdown with less of a second wave. Also China's emissions are more industrial based than other countries and its industry was less affected than transportation, LeQuere said.
	The calculations -- based on reports detailing energy use, industrial production and daily mobility counts -- were praised as accurate by outside scientists.
	Even with the drop in 2020, the world on average put 1,185 tons (1,075 metric tons) of carbon dioxide into the air every second.
	Final figures for 2019 published in the same study show that from 2018 to 2019 emissions of the main man-made heat-trapping gas increased only 0.1%, much smaller than annual jumps of around 3% a decade or two ago. Even with emissions expected to rise after the pandemic, scientists are wondering if 2019 be the peak of carbon pollution, LeQuere said.
	""We are certainly very close to an emissions peak, if we can keep the global community together,"" said United Nations Development Director Achim Steiner.
	Chris Field, director of the Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment, thinks emissions will increase after the pandemic, but said ""I am optimistic that we have, as a society learned some lessons that may help decrease emissions in the future.""
	""For example,"" he added, ""as people get good at telecommuting a couple of days a week or realize they don't need quite so many business trips, we might see behaviour-related future emissions decreases.""

	On the grim two-year anniversary of Michael Kovrigâs imprisonment in China, his wife says she worries most about the state of his mental health heading into yet another holiday season alone.
	""Here we are, two years later, still speaking about him being in detention. None of us would have imagined this was going to be the case,"" said Vina Nadjibulla in an interview on CTVâs Power Play on Thursday.
	""I hoped sincerely that Michael would be home by now and instead heâs facing a prospect of his third Christmas alone, in isolation, in detention.""
	Kovrig, a former diplomat, and fellow Canadian Michael Spavor were arrested in China on Dec. 10, 2018, and charged with allegations of state spying for Canada. The Canadian government calls their detention arbitrary, while most in the diplomatic community view it as retaliation for the arrest of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou days prior in Vancouver on a U.S. extradition request.
	Consular access has been limited throughout the pandemic; the two men went 10 months without communication with Canadian representatives.
	""Our contact has been very limited between January and October. There were no consular visits, there were very few letters from Michael. Finally, in October we were able to get a consular visit and at least confirmation and a reassurance that he is still healthy and is doing well,"" said Nadjibulla, who is married to Kovrig but separated.
	Canadaâs Ambassador to China Dominic Barton who is leading the effort to secure Kovrig and Spavorâs release, told a House of Commons committee this week that the two men looked ""robust"" and that one ""would be very impressed by seeing both of them.""
	Nadjibulla called that long-awaited visit this fall a ""huge relief"" but notes she remains deeply concerned about his mental health.
	""Michael is doing everything he possibly can to keep his mind occupied with positive thoughts, with virtuous thoughts, with prayers of gratitude, with philosophical passages. Reading really provides him solace day-to-day, he essentially says that is what gets him through moment-to-moment, is being able to read and have access to books, which weâve been advocating for quite a bit,"" said Nadjibulla.
	The Liberal government remains adamant itâs doing all it can to free the men, despite opposition criticism that Ottawa has been ""kowtowing"" to China over the last several years.
	""Today is the sad anniversary of the illegal abduction and imprisonment of two innocent Canadians in China,"" said Conservative Leader Erin OâToole during a press conference on Thursday.
	""For months China has unfairly targeted our farming exports. For years, the Chinese Communist Party has been carrying out mass internment of the Uighurs in concentration camps and still the Liberals keep pushing for more involvement and more engagement with China.""
	Optimism sparked last week when the Wall Street Journal reported the U.S. Justice Department was in talks with Mengâs legal team to resolve her fraud charges and allow her to return home should she admit to criminal wrongdoing. It led to speculation that the arrangement could pave a way for Kovrig and Spavorâs freedom.
	Nadjibulla says, more broadly, she was left hopeful after hearing that during the first call between Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and U.S. President-Elect Joe Biden the leaders discussed the fate of the two men.
	""I pray that we will be seeing the light at the end of the tunnel,"" she said.

	Saskatchewan is set to begin its rollout of Pfizerâs COVID-19 vaccine on Dec. 15, just under a year after the first cluster of novel coronavirus patients was reported in China. Itâs the quickest any vaccine has been developed and Health Canada is also reviewing other candidates. 
CTV News spoke with Volker Gerdts, director and CEO of VIDO-InterVac at the University of Saskatchewan, a lab dedicated to infectious disease and vaccine research, to learn about how these vaccines have been developed so fast, whether they present any new safety concerns, and the status of VIDO-InterVacâs own vaccine candidate. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.
	Normally, for human vaccines, it can take up to 10 to 12 years for a human vaccine. For animal vaccines itâs usually much faster, but even then it's still years before you have a product.
	Well, it's through a very concerted effort, through a lot of money and through the willingness to, along the production or the development pathway, lose money.
	So if I can use just a very simple analogy: if you are willing to send 10 horses into the race, knowing that at the end, you only need one and you maybe lose nine, you can accomplish much more than running and then testing 10 different candidates in a sequence. Right? And so, this year, many governments around the world or big international organizations have made large amounts of money available to manufacturers to develop a vaccine as quickly as possible.
	And so with that money, you're able to test multiple candidates, knowing that some of them may not work and others will. And if you are prepared to lose that money, you can obviously save some time by running them all in parallel.
	And the other thing that people have done is trying to do as many activities in parallel as possible. So same idea, instead of waiting until you have the data from the first step to then go into the next study, processes have taken place in parallel. People were willing to, like I said, invest and lose money, but also, you know, try to reduce the time in between these studies to the bare minimum.
	Okay, so in very simple terms, vaccines contain fragments, pieces if you want, of a pathogen in them. And those fragments, those pieces, are being produced in different systems.
	So you can have that piece being a piece of RNA, as Pfizer or Moderna vaccines are, or you can make a protein as we do, or we can deliver it with another vector, another virus, which is the AstraZeneca vaccine.
	Essentially, what you do is you take a part of the pathogen, you can also take the whole pathogen, but you make it non disease causing, and then you inject it and you show it to the immune system and the immune system recognizes it and forms an immune response to it.
	We are trying to use a safe form of the pathogen. So often we kill these pathogens, we chemically inactivate them, so then they canât cause disease anymore and then we can inject them. Or we just take fragments, pieces of those pathogens. And we pick the ones that are very important in the interaction between the pathogen and the host.
	For example, right now, with the COVID-19 pandemic, everybody is focusing on this spike protein, which is on the surface of the virus, and that's what the virus uses to attach to the cells.
	If you have an immune response against the spike protein, you have antibodies in your blood, they prevent the attachment of the virus to the host cell, and that's how we prevent the virus from causing disease.
	Yeah, that's right. So same idea, if you're willing to do something, and it may not work out and you lose it, you know, you can start all these steps already before you have approval.
	No. The regular safety assessments, the processes that are laid out by the regulators that are required for approval, are all the same.
	You still saw that all these candidates went through Phase One, Phase Two studies and Phase Three studies and that the results have to be reported and reviewed by Health Canada.
	In the case of the clinical trials, you remember, there was here and there a case where an individual had come down with disease and then needed to be specifically reviewed by the review board. The processes are the same as we would normally do for any vaccine.
	Well, I think we're seeing a shift in the field. I think we will see in the future that the times of developing vaccines in 10 to 15 years are over and vaccines will be developed much faster.
	Whether it's always as fast as this one, I canât see that happening, because the money that has gone into this, of course is enormous, right?
	In the situation of a global pandemic, yes, I can see that. But if it's a regular disease, which maybe doesn't have the global impact, it's hard to imagine that there will be billions of dollars coming from every government in the world towards the development of these vaccines.
	We're making what is called a protein subunit. This is a proven technology that is in a number of vaccines for humans. Diphtheria, tetanus, and whooping cough vaccines for children or the Hepatitis C vaccine.
	VIDO-InterVac is making a protein subunit vaccine which also has a lot of advantages in that it's easy to manufacture, it's cost effective and much easier in terms of storage.
	The Pfizer vaccine, for example, requires -70 C storage and so on. Our technology does not require that.
	We have now made an application to Health Canada - in fact, it's going out today - an official package, which shows all the data that we have on our vaccine candidate and the regulators will review that data and then hopefully give us permission to start our clinical trials in the very near future.
	So we're ready to go and waiting now for the green light from Health Canada to start.
	It will be later next year at the earliest. I think for most of the vaccines that we're seeing right now, probably around May or June of next year, somewhere there, so ours will be a little bit later than that."

              'We need trust': How a COVID-19 vaccine came so quickly
          
","
              While some have expressed concern that COVID-19 vaccines have reached approval stage in record time, experts insist that the speed is a product of multitasking and co-ordinated effort, not shortcuts.

                ",https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/coronavirus/we-need-trust-how-a-covid-19-vaccine-came-so-quickly-1.5225872,"TORONTO -- 
	Months ago it seemed impossible a vaccine for COVID-19 would even reach final trial stages by December, let alone the arms of Canadians.
	But now the first of several potential coronavirus shots is likely days away after Health Canada approved the candidate by BioNTech and Pfizer Inc. on Wednesday.
	If most vaccines take years to develop and distribute, how is it that we got here so quickly? Is there any cause for concern that speed means danger?
	Experts say that the speed is not a product of hasty shortcuts, but instead a combination of multitasking, a co-ordinated global effort and the fruits of earlier research. Understanding this is a matter of public health concern, said Kerry Bowman, a bioethicist and environmentalist with the University of Toronto whose work on emerging zoonotic diseases involved him in research and health-care work during the Ebola and SARS outbreaks.
	âThe Canadian public are assuming that all of this happened at record speed and every conceivable corner was cut,â he told CTVNews.ca over the phone on Thursday.Â 
	But thatâs not so.
IT WASNâT âGROUND ZEROâ
	The SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes the COVID-19 disease isnât the first coronavirus. Human coronaviruses were first identified more than 50 years ago with the HCoV-229E, which infects humans and bats. Scientists have since discovered five others, including MERS-CoV, which causes Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, and SARS-CoV, the first strain of the SARS coronavirus species that led to the current pandemic of COVID-19. The groundwork was not for nothing, said Bowman.
	âBecause weâve got this pattern of emerging infectious diseasesâ¦ many good people have been on to this and developed a research platform that really, really was tremendously useful when this COVID-19 pandemic struck,â he said.
	âThey really werenât starting from ground zero at all. We really built on previous lessons tremendously and now weâre going to soon reap the benefits of that.â
	After COVID-19 broke out in China, scientists there were quickly able to produce the genetic code for the novel coronavirus and shared it with the global community on Jan. 11, before outbreaks took hold in many other countries. Despite the quick action of the scientific community, the pandemic continued on a grim course, which Bowman said points to social and political failures, not academic.
	âThis pandemic was an accident waiting to happen,â he said. âOur governments were very slow to respond to such a massive threat.â
	While labs quickly harnessed the new genetic code, other technologies had already been developed in years prior for other diseases, particularly the messenger RNA vaccine technology, which modifies the gene responsible for making the coronavirus protein and attaching the virus to cells in the body, thereby producing an immune response. The newly approved Pfizer vaccine is one of them.
MULTITASKING AND CO-ORDINATION
	Vaccine development and production requires a lot of money from partnerships between pharmaceutical companies, which has never been such a swift process, said Bowman, providing the resources required to ramp up development.
	âNormally, funding and partnerships really drag out with these types of things. Global emergency partnerships have happened very quickly,â he said.Â 
	Other steps of the process that normally would take several years and happen sequentially were sped up and done in unison instead.Â 
	âRather than wait till one step was completed, they did a lot of things in parallel, only if it was safe and made sense scientifically,â said Bowman.
	Normally, pharmaceutical companies would send fully completed data sets to Health Canada for approval, and analysis of that data would be under embargo. Instead, it has happened in âreal time,â said infectious disease expert and associate professor at McMaster University Zain Chagla, with health agencies reviewing incomplete data sets as they come in throughout the course of clinical trials.
	âThis is a global emergency thatâs shutting down society and relatively so, this is probably the biggest intervention to date that might actually reduce some of the burden in our communities,â he told CTVNews.ca last month.
	Another element that provided a push for vaccines was the second wave of COVID-19 infections. While the spread of the virus has been devastating, with known infections tripling worldwide since late August, the surge meant that clinical trials reached important markers earlier than anticipated, providing more robust data.
	The pandemic remains far from over, with more than 2,400 deaths in the last month and 6,000 new infections daily across the country. All the more reason why Canadians should trust that the potentially pandemic-ending COVID-19 vaccines that are beginning to circulate werenât made by cutting corners, experts say.Â 
	âThereâs very good reasons why this moved as quickly as it did,â said Bowman. âWe need trust because thereâs many Canadians that are vaccine hesitant.âÂ 
			Health Canada has authorized Pfizer-BioNTechâs #COVID19 vaccine. After a thorough and independent review of the evidence.

              Quebec government was not notified of COVID-19 early enough: Anglade

	A day after a meeting between the provinceâs public health director and opposition parties, Quebec Liberal Party Leader Dominique Anglade said Premier Francois Legault was not made aware of the gravity of COVID-19 before March 9.Â 
	Anglade commented on the chronology of events since January 2020, noting that on the 12th, Dr. Horacio Arruda said âif the virus leaves China, we are in trouble"" -- which happened the next day.Â 
	Arruda testified on Wednesday that he wrote a first âstate of the situationâ on Jan. 18, which must have made its way into the administration, he said.Â 
	On Jan. 24, a meeting with civil security took place, but Arruda said he did not attend.
	It wasnât until March 9 that Legault was informed of the situation and that a crisis unit was created, Anglade said.Â 
	âThere is a real problem,â she said at a news briefing on Thursday. âHow come the information wasnât transmitted before that? Itâs outrageous, honestly.âÂ 
	In the spring, the COVID-19 disease claimed nearly 6,000 lives in Quebec, which accounted for about 60 per cent of all deaths in Canada.
	The Liberal Party is convinced that the government could have acted sooner, in particular to ensure the supply of personal protective equipment like masks, in sufficient quantities.
	After all, by the end of January, British Columbia and Alberta were already placing orders for equipment, including masks.
	The opposition also touched on Arruda's statement that he never recommended closing restaurants during the second wave -- rather, the decision was political.Â 
	Arrudaâs statement made some restaurateurs react. They were quick to share their anger with the media and demand responses from the government.
	According to Quebec solidaire, Legault must apologize to the restaurateurs, whom he chose to âabandonâ contrary to what was recommended by public health.
	The parliamentary leader of the Parti QuÃ©bÃ©cois, Pascal Berube, urged the government to compensate restaurant owners directly, based on figures from last year.
	Reacting in turn to Arruda's statement, Minister of Health Christian Dube said he was convinced that the decision to close the dining rooms of restaurants was the right one.
	âIt was important for us to limit the number of contacts between people, and particularly (...) on the issue of restaurants, bars, places of gathering,â he explained at a news conference.Â 
	âThere are times when we decided (...) to be more careful and perhaps go beyond the recommendations that were made,â he added.Â

              Bisons revive, freshwater dolphins dwindle: Conservationists

              A leading conservation group uniting governments and civil society says all four known freshwater dolphin species are now threatened with extinction, after newly discovered information on the tucuxi in the Amazon river system showed it too is endangered.

	A leading conservation group uniting governments and civil society says all four known freshwater dolphin species are now threatened with extinction, after newly discovered information on the tucuxi in the Amazon river system showed it too is endangered.
The finding from the International Union for Conservation of Nature comes as its latest ""Red List"" of threatened species, released Thursday, also showed that populations of the European bison -- Europe's largest land mammal -- have improved, even as the list of extinct species overall has continued to expand.
	""The European bison and 25 other species recoveries documented in today's IUCN Red List update demonstrate the power of conservation,"" said Dr. Bruno Oberle, IUCN's director-general.
	Still, the conservation group said 31 species have been declared extinct in the latest of its regular updates of the list, including three Central American frog species and 15 freshwater fish species endemic to a single lake in the Philippines. A South China Sea shark, last seen in 1934 and only formally described last year, is thought to be ""possibly extinct.""
	Craig Hilton-Taylor, head of the IUCN red list, said the impact of human activity was a driver for many species nearing extinction.
	""All of these things are down to human activities, whether it's direct hunting or fishing or harvesting of the species, to introducing invasive species, changing habitats to agriculture, urbanization, climate change,"" he said in a video interview. ""The human footprint is everywhere.""
	The tucuxi, a small gray dolphin found in the Amazon River system, is now listed as ""endangered."" Its numbers have been severely depleted by human activity, including fishing gear, the damming of rivers and pollution. Previously there wasn't enough information to determine its status.
	The Gland, Switzerland-based group cites three other freshwater dolphin species -- the Amazon river dolphin, the South Asian river dolphin and the Yangtze River dolphin in China, though it may already be extinct -- as threatened, along with the Yangtze finless porpoise, IUCN spokesman Matthias Fiechter said.
	IUCN says nearly 129,000 species are on its list, including 35,765 threatened with extinction. The ""red list"" breaks down threatened species into vulnerable, endangered and critically endangered categories -- the last of these meaning those closest to extinction.
	The European bison is making gains -- more than tripling its population since 2003 to more than 6,200 last year -- because of conservation management, IUCN said.
	Once widespread across Europe several centuries ago, the continent's largest land mammal was hunted, and its numbers declined dramatically.
	After the First World War, the remaining population of the horned animals -- close cousins of the North American bison -- was hunted out, leaving the species extinct in the wild and only surviving in captivity. Reintroduction efforts began in the 1950s, and today 47 free-ranging herds now roam the continent.
	""There's a huge push across Europe, what they call re-wilding, trying to restore habitats that have been transformed by people back into wild habitat again and bring back a lot of these species that have been lost,"" Hilton-Taylor said.
	IUCN, which was founded in 1948, brings together more than 1,400 member organizations and 15,000 experts and bills itself as one of the world's largest environmental networks.

	As the coronavirus pandemic rages on, transportation officials around the world have been looking for ways to keep passengers and crew safe on board planes.
	On November 25, the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) released new guidelines for the country's airline industry, which it oversees.
The document, titled Technical Guidelines for Epidemic Prevention and Control for Airlines, Sixth Edition, contains advice about the best hygiene practices to carry out on aircraft and in airports.
	But one of those suggestions -- that personnel like flight attendants wear disposable diapers so they don't need to use the bathroom -- has raised some eyebrows.
	A section on PPE advises cabin crew on flights to and from high-risk countries to wear ""medical masks, double-layer disposable medical gloves, goggles, disposable hats, disposable protective clothing, and disposable shoe covers.""
	The next sentence reads: ""It is recommended that cabin crew members wear disposable diapers and avoid using the lavatories barring special circumstances to avoid infection risks.""
	While such advice may seem dramatic, it's no secret that lavatories can be the germiest place on an airplane. In August, a woman traveling from Italy to South Korea contracted coronavirus during her trip, and a visit to the bathroom -- the only place where she didn't wear an N95 mask -- was named as the possible source of her infection.
	Airplane bathroom design was already a hot topic before COVID-19, but the pandemic has focused efforts to come up with new solutions.
	Japanese airline ANA announced earlier this year that it was testing out a prototype of a new hands-free lavatory door. Meanwhile, Boeing successfully applied for a patent on a ""self-cleaning lavatory"" that would use UV light to clean 99.9% of bathroom germs after every use."

              Politicians urge people to buy Australian wine in defiance of China

	Politicians from various Western countries have asked consumers to buy Australian wine in order to fight back against China's punitive tariffs on the beverage.
	China is the most important export market for Australian wine, and winemakers are scrambling to find new markets following Beijing's decision to slap tariffs of up to 212% on Australian wine imports amid an escalating trade war between the two nations.
	Now a number of public figures associated with the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China (IPAC), which calls itself ""an international cross-party group of legislators working to reform the approach of democratic countries to China,"" have called on consumers to stand up to Beijing.
	""We are asking you all to join us in standing against Xi Jinping's authoritarian bullying,"" said Miriam Lexmann, a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) representing the Christian Democrats, in a video posted on Twitter on Tuesday.
	""By drinking a bottle or two of Australian wine and letting the Chinese Communist Party know that we will not be bullied,"" added Elisabet Lann, a municipal councilor from Sweden's Christian Democrats.
	Other politicians featured in the video include Australian MP Kimberley Kitching, US Senator Ted Yoho and Shiori Yamao, an independent member of Japan's House of Representatives.
	Tony Battaglene, CEO of Australian Grape and Wine, a national association, said Beijing's tariffs have endangered business with mainland China.
	Battaglene works with around 800 wine producers in Australia who have ""built their businesses"" around exporting to China and are now left with no backup plan, he added.
	""We were surprised, we were shocked,"" Battaglene told CNN Business. ""Having the extent of these interim tariffs, I mean essentially they will close the market to Australian bottled wine, to premium wine, in China. There's no way that we can compete at those levels.""
	China's Commerce Ministry announced Friday that its decision was made after finding preliminary evidence of dumping. Australian officials have bitterly protested the move, saying that China has been unable to provide proof.
	The wine war is taking place against the backdrop of a wider deterioration in relations. Australia has upset China this year by calling for an investigation into the origins of the coronavirus pandemic. Beijing later targeted Canberra over trade, namely by suspending some imports of beef and slapping heavy tariffs on barley."

	In his darkest moments, Michael Kovrig draws strength from knowing that his fellow Canadians and people around the world are working to free him and Michael Spavor from their respective Chinese prison cells.
	As much as that matters, Kovrig's wife Vina Nadjibulla says he is also subjecting himself to a strict regimen to strengthen his mind and body because he views that as the key to his survival.
	She says that not only is Kovrig determined to survive his ordeal, he wants to reclaim his freedom better and stronger than when he lost it.
	Kovrig and Spavor are marking two years in separate Chinese prisons, on what Canada and dozens of its Western allies say are trumped-up espionage charges in retaliation for the RCMP's December 2018 arrest of Chinese high-tech executive Meng Wanzhou on a U.S. extradition warrant.
	Canada's ambassador to China, Dominic Barton, one of the few outsiders to see them, said this week Kovrig and Spavor are anything but broken men, and that seeing how they've endured their captivity was inspiring.
	""Mr. Spavor and Mr. Kovrig, and their families, have shown truly remarkable perseverance in the face of an unimaginable situation,"" Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Thursday.
	Kovrig is ""marshalling every ounce of his willpower and strength"" to cope with his difficult situation, Nadjibulla said in an interview this week.
	""He says that knowing that Canadians care, knowing that the world cares, and people are fighting for his release, makes him feel stronger, and keeps hope alive,"" she said, drawing on letters that he has written in captivity.
	""He hopes that he will be able to come out from this experience not only having survived it, but with a commitment, with resolve to rebuild his life better, to contribute even more to society.""
	A statement from Global Affairs on Thursday to The Canadian Press said that Canadian Embassy officials in Beijing spoke directly with Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs officials to clarify a media report earlier in the morning that suggested the two Michaels had gone on trial in China.
	The statement said that ""contrary to what has been reported in the media this morning, there has been no development in the cases of Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor.""
	The statement also said that ""the confusion was caused by an inaccurate characterization of the process made by the Chinese MFA spokesperson.""
	The Canadian Press also reached out, through intermediaries, to request interviews with Spavor's friends and family but was unsuccessful. Spavor worked as an entrepreneur in the Chinese city of Dandong, where he is imprisoned near the North Korean border.
	Kovrig was most recently an analyst with the International Crisis Group in Washington and before that he was a member of Canada's diplomatic corps, a career-focused on preventing deadly conflicts.
	""He hopes that he can continue to do that, and he can rejoin the broader conversation in the world with life and not just continue to be isolated and cut off in the way that he is,"" said Nadjibulla.
	She said Kovrig is devouring books from the meditations of stoic philosopher Marcus Aurelius, to St. Paul's Letter to the Romans, to Tolstoy's ""War and Peace,"" to Nelson Mandela's ""Long Walk to Freedom."" He's reread one of his pre-prison favourites, ""Antifragile: Things That Gain From Disorder"" by Nassim Nicholas Taleb, because it contains a key message for him.
	""It essentially posits that it's important to cultivate an ability to not only survive traumas or disruptions but to become better and stronger as a result. So, this idea of building back better. I know it's very much on the minds of many of us as we recover from the pandemic,"" she said.
	Kovrig is also drawing on stoic philosophical teaching that, among other things, calls for the transformation of ""fear into prudence, pain into information,"" said Nadjibulla. Kovrig has added ""anger into determination and grievance into resolve"" to that philosophy.
	He has been drawn to St. Paul's Letter to the Romans, the sixth book of the New Testament, ""which says suffering produces endurance, endurance produces character, character produces hope. And Michael is doing everything possible to keep hope alive,"" said Nadjibulla.
	Kovrig is subjecting himself to a strict physical regimen, forever on the move in his small cell striving to walk the equivalent of five kilometres daily because he knows his mind cannot thrive if his body is not strong, said Nadjibulla.
	Robert Malley, Kovrig's boss at the International Crisis Group, says his imprisoned colleague can hold the plank, a core body exercise of endurance, for 18 minutes. In solidarity, Crisis Group colleagues recently had a plank competition but the closest anyone got was seven minutes. They're also walking 7,000 steps a day, the equivalent of five kilometres.
	Malley said he and his colleagues are in awe of Kovrig's discipline.
	""None of us can be prepared for that, unless you're in the military and you're told this could happen. But he seems to have had all of the reflexes, instincts that are necessary,"" said Malley.
	When Kovrig is released one day his colleagues hope stories of their attempts to replicate some of his exercises will help him heal and, perhaps, bridge the gap growing between them and him, said Malley.
	Kovrig only found out the scope of the global pandemic during Barton's on-site virtual visit in October -- his first contact with Canadian diplomats since January because Chinese authorities wouldn't allow any contact due to COVID-19, said Nadjibulla.
	He was shocked at the pandemic's scale and compared it to a zombie apocalypse and the movie ""Contagion.""
	Kovrig is also aware that he is one of ""two Michaels"" and understands that both he and Spavor ""are caught in this bigger situation,"" she said. It's not a topic that can be discussed during the now-resumed 30-minute consular visits.
	Nadjibulla said she was happy to hear that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau spoke to U.S. president-elect Joe Biden about the two Michaels in their recent conversation. Trudeau refused to discuss the content of that conversation last week, or whether Biden might revisit the Justice Department's attempted extradition and prosecution of Meng.
	If the U.S. withdrew its charges, Meng could go free, and that might give China reason to free the two Michaels.
	""Our Michael and Michael Spavor are caught in a bigger geopolitical struggle,"" Nadjibulla said. ""They're pawns in a bigger political game involving the U.S., China and Canada. And they have been in the situation for two long years, for no other reason than being Canadian citizens.""

	Lai faces a charge of collusion with foreign elements to endanger national security, apparently for tweets he made and interviews or commentaries he did with foreign media.
	The Apple Daily, a feisty pro-democracy tabloid owned by Lai, said he is accused of asking a foreign country, organization or individual to impose sanctions or engage in other hostile activities against Hong Kong or China.
	His case was adjourned to April 16 at the request of prosecutors, who said police needed time to review more than 1,000 tweets and comments made on his Twitter account, the Apple Daily reported.
	The newspaper said his charge sheet listed several foreign politicians who followed Lai on Twitter and cited commentaries he wrote and interviews he did with foreign media.
	Lai, who was already being held on other fraud charges after police raided his media company, could be seen handcuffed to a chain around his waist as guards led him to a van to go from prison to court. He wore a navy blazer and an open-neck shirt.
	Beijing imposed the national security law on Hong Kong earlier this year after stormy protests in 2019 that started over an extradition bill and expanded to include demands for greater democracy in the former British colony.
	The new law outlaws secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces to intervene in Hong Kong's affairs. It has constricted free speech in the city, and democracy activists see it as a way to suppress dissent.
	U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo tweeted Saturday morning Asia time that the security law ""makes a mockery of justice."" He called for Lai's release, saying his only crime is speaking the truth about China's authoritarian Communist Party government.
	Lai, the highest-profile person charged under the security law, has also been arrested for other alleged offences this year. He has been charged with taking part in unauthorized protests and with fraud over alleged violations of office lease terms.
	He has advocated for other countries to take a harsher stance on China, and met with Pompeo and Vice-President Mike Pence in the U.S. last year to discuss the extradition bill, which the Hong Kong government eventually withdrew.

	Relatives of a dozen Hong Kong residents who have been detained in mainland China for more than 3 1/2 months made a plea Saturday to be informed of the timing of any trials and whether they can attend.
	The request underscored the sharp contrast between the relatively open legal system in Hong Kong, a semi-autonomous Chinese territory, and that of the mainland, where often little information is divulged until a trial is over.
	""I miss my son so much,"" the mother of Wong Wai-yin, one of the detainees, said, choking up. ""I want to visit him so badly. I haven't seen my son in a very long time -- it's almost four months. Please tell me (about the trial). I'm just an ordinary mother.""
	The 12 were arrested at sea in August while they were apparently making a bid to flee to Taiwan after a tough national security law took effect in Hong Kong earlier this year.
	They were picked up after entering mainland waters for crossing the maritime border without permission. At least some took part in anti-government protests in 2019 and were facing charges in Hong Kong.
	Though Hong Kong is a part of China, travellers must still pass through immigration when going to and from the mainland.
	Two are being held on suspicion of organizing an illegal border crossing. The group has been locked up in Shenzhen, a southern Chinese city that borders Hong Kong.
	The relatives covered their faces with masks, and some wore sunglasses, caps or hoods to hide their identities as they spoke at a news conference. They did not give their names.
	Owen Chow, an activist who has been helping the families, said they wanted to know whether the trials would be open to the public and if family members could attend.
	He and some family members questioned the authenticity of letters some of the latter had received, purportedly from their detained relatives, saying they were being held in a good environment and not abused.
	""The only thing I can do is to have dissatisfaction and be angry,"" said a relative of Tang Kai-yin, another detainee. ""I don't know what else to do."""

	U.S. President-elect Joe Biden pledged Saturday to rejoin the Paris climate accord on the first day of his presidency, as world leaders staged a virtual gathering to celebrate the fifth anniversary of the international pact aimed at curbing global warming.
	Heads of state and government from over 70 countries took part in the event -- hosted by Britain, France, Italy, Chile and the United Nations -- to announce greater efforts in cutting the greenhouse gas emissions that fuel global warming.
	The outgoing administration of U.S. President Donald Trump, who pulled Washington out of the Paris accord, wasn't represented at the online gathering. But in a written statement sent shortly before it began, Biden made clear the U.S. was waiting on the sidelines to join again and noted that Washington was key to negotiating the 2015 agreement, which has since been ratified by almost all countries around the world.Â 
	""The United States will rejoin the Paris Agreement on day one of my presidency,"" he said. ""I'll immediately start working with my counterparts around the world to do all that we possibly can, including by convening the leaders of major economies for a climate summit within my first 100 days in office.""
	Biden reiterated his campaign pledge that his administration will set a target of cutting U.S. emissions to net zero ""no later than 2050.""
	Experts say commitments put forward by the international community in the past five years have already improved the long-term outlook on climate change, making the worst-case scenarios less likely by the end of the century. But wildfires in the Amazon, Australia and America, floods in Bangladesh and East Africa, and record temperatures in the Arctic have highlighted the impact an increase of 1.2 degrees Celsius (2.2 Fahrenheit) since pre-industrial times is already having on the planet.
	""If we don't change course, we may be headed for a catastrophic temperature rise of more than 3 degrees (Celsius) this century,"" UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said, urging world leaders to declare a ""climate emergency.""
	The Paris agreement aims to cap global warming at well under 2 C (3.6 F), ideally no more than 1.5 C (2.7 F), by the end of the century. Meeting the temperature target will require a phasing-out of fossil fuels and better protection for the world's carbon-soaking forests, wetlands and oceans.
	The UN chief called the announced U.S. return to the Paris accord ""a very important signal.""
	""We look forward for a very active U.S. leadership in climate action from now on,"" Guterres said. ""The United States is the largest economy in the world, it's absolutely essential for our goals to be reached.""
	Biden insisted that the dramatic economic shifts needed would be positive for American workers.
	""We have before us an enormous economic opportunity to create jobs and prosperity at home and export clean American-made products around the world, harnessing our climate ambition in a way that is good for American workers and the U.S. economy,"" he said.
	American representatives at the virtual meeting included Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, Gov. Charlie Baker of Massachusetts and U.S. business leaders, such as Apple chief executive Tim Cook.
	Also absent from the event were major economies such as Australia, Brazil, Indonesia, Mexico, Russia and Saudi Arabia. Most have offered no significant improvements on their existing emissions targets lately.
	Environmental campaigners singled out Brazil's recent announcement that it will stick to its target of cutting emissions by 43 per cent over the next decade compared with 2005 levels and aim for net zero by 2060 -- later than most other countries.
	By contrast, an agreement Friday by European Union members to beef up the continent's 2030 targets from 40 per cent to at least 55 per cent compared with 1990 levels was broadly welcomed, though activists said it could have aimed even higher.
	China, the world's biggest emitter, also surprised the world in September by announcing a net zero target of 2060, with emissions peaking by 2030. In his speech Saturday, Chinese President Xi Jinping provided further details on his country's medium-term goal for improving energy efficiency and ramping up electricity generated from renewable sources of power such as wind and solar.
	But Xi also cautioned that ""unilateralism will lead us nowhere"" -- a veiled reference to discussions in the EU to impose tariffs on goods imported from countries that have less stringent emissions standards than the 27-nation bloc. The issue is likely to dominate discussion between China, the EU and the U.S. in coming years.
	The Maldives, an Indian Ocean nation made up of low-lying islands that are particularly vulnerable to sea level rise, announced Saturday that it will now aim to achieve net zero by 2030, one of the most ambitious goals worldwide. Bhutan and Suriname claim to have already achieved that goal.
	The 189 countries that are party to the Paris agreement are required to submit their updated targets to the United Nations by the end of the year. This would normally have occurred at the annual UN climate summit, but the event was postponed for a year because of the pandemic.
	The gathering, now scheduled to take place in Glasgow, Scotland, in November 2021, will see haggling over financial support for poor countries to cope with climate change, and fine-tuning the rules for international markets in emissions trading. Britain, next year's host, announced this month that it's aiming to cut emissions by 68 per cent over the next decade and end state support for fossil fuel industry exports.
	Former UN climate chief Christiana Figueres, who was a key player at the Paris negotiations, said leaders had a duty to be optimistic about their ability to curb global warming.
	""Because if we don't, the alternative is unthinkable,"" she said. ""None of us adults alive today want to have on our shoulders the responsibility of turning over a world that is a world of misery for generations to come.""

              U.S. allows emergency COVID-19 vaccine in bid to end pandemic

	The U.S. gave the final go-ahead Friday to the nation's first COVID-19 vaccine, marking what could be the beginning of the end of an outbreak that has killed nearly 300,000 Americans, according to a person familiar with the decision but not authorized to discuss it publicly.
	Shots for health workers and nursing home residents are expected to begin in the coming days after the Food and Drug Administration authorized an emergency rollout of what promises to be a strongly protective vaccine from Pfizer Inc. and its German partner BioNTech.
	Initial doses are scarce and rationed as the U.S. joins Britain and several other countries in scrambling to vaccinate as many people as possible ahead of a long, grim winter. It will take months of work to tamp down the coronavirus that has surged to catastrophic levels in recent weeks and already claimed 1.5 million lives globally.
	While the FDA decision came only after public review of data from a huge ongoing study, it has also been dogged by intense political pressure from the Trump administration, which has accused the agency of being too slow and even threatened to remove FDA chief Stephen Hahn if a ruling did not come Friday.
	The move sets off what will be the largest vaccination campaign in U.S. history -- but it also has global ramifications because it's a role model to many other countries facing the same decision.
	The world desperately needs multiple vaccines for enough to go around, and the Pfizer-BioNTech shot is the first based on rigorous scientific testing to emerge from that worldwide race -- a record-setting scientific achievement that shaved years off the usual process.
	""I don't think you would have found a scientist on this planet that would have predicted this 11 months ago,"" said Dr. Paul Offit, a vaccine expert at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia who advises the FDA.
	The U.S. is considering a second vaccine, made by Moderna Inc., that could roll out in another week. In early January, Johnson & Johnson expects to learn if its vaccine is working in final testing.
	Europe is set to make its own decision on the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna shots later this month, an important step as some other candidates that multiple countries were anxiously awaiting have hit roadblocks. Friday, Sanofi and GSK announced a months-long delay after early tests showed their vaccine didn't work well enough in older adults.
	And China and Russia didn't wait for final-stage tests before beginning vaccinations with some homegrown shots.
	About 3 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine are expected in the first shipments around the country, according to officials with Operation Warp Speed, the Trump administration's vaccine development program. A similar amount is to be held in reserve for those recipients' second dose.
	A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advisory committee is poised to recommend who's first in line. Expected to follow health workers and nursing homes are other essential workers, older adults and people at high risk because of other health problems. U.S. authorities don't expect enough for the general population before spring, and that's assuming there are no manufacturing glitches.
	In a still unfinished study of nearly 44,000 people, the FDA found the vaccine was safe and more than 90% effective across recipients of different ages, including older adults, races and those with health problems that put them at high risk from the coronavirus.
	Emergency use means the vaccine still is experimental. Most important for would-be recipients to know:
	--Some protection begins after the first dose, but it takes a second dose three weeks later for full protection. It's unclear how long protection lasts.
	--The vaccine protects against COVID-19 illness, but no one yet knows if it can stop the silent, symptomless spread that accounts for roughly half of all cases. The ongoing study will attempt to answer that but for now, the vaccinated still will need to wear a mask and keep their distance.
	--Expect a sore arm and some flu-like symptoms such as fever, fatigue, headache and chills after the second dose. While uncomfortable, those reactions only last about a day. ""That's just your immune system working. It's a good thing,"" Offit said.
	--Authorities are investigating several allergic reactions reported in Britain by people with a history of severe allergies. Offit said it is routine in the U.S. for the vaccinated to stick around for a half-hour so they could get prompt treatment if such reactions appear.
	If emergency use of Moderna's vaccine also is authorized, the U.S. expects to vaccinate 20 million people by the end of December. They hope to have enough for another 30 million people in January and 50 million in February.
	Getting shots into arms is the big challenge, especially as a new poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found only half of Americans want the vaccine when it's their turn. About a quarter say they won't get it and the rest aren't sure.
	Political interference has complicated health authorities' message that the testing was rigorous and cut no corners.
	President Donald Trump bashed the FDA, again, Friday for taking too long, complaining that the agency ""is still a big, old slow turtle."" One of his deputies even pressed Hahn to clear the shots by the end of the day or face possible firing, two administration officials said.
	The FDA is unique in analyzing drugmakers' raw data, a process that takes longer than many other countries' regulatory reviews. In addition, the FDA insisted that large COVID-19 vaccine studies track at least half the participants for two months to look for side effects, a time period when historically any vaccine problems appear.

	Canada is no longer training with the Chinese military, the Minister of National Defence Harjit Sajjan told the House of Commons on Thursday, after Conservative defence critic James Bezan questioned why Prime Minister Justin Trudeau would maintain such relations with China.
	The issue came to a head following a report by the Globe and Mail that top officials at Global Affairs, concerned the Chinese government would view it as a retaliatory move over its detention of Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, was âalarmedâ that General Jonathan Vance cancelled winter military exercises with the Peopleâs Liberation Army in 2019 at CFB Petawawa.
	The news comes as Kovrig and Spavor marked their second anniversary in Chinese prison on what Canada and its Western allies say are unfounded espionage charges that followed Canadaâs arrest of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou on a U.S. extradition warrant in December 2018.
	âOur government always stands up for Canadians at home and abroad and this includes our relationship with China. But let me be very clear, we do not train with Chinese military,â said Minister Sajjan, adding that this initiative was originally put in place by the Conservative government under Stephen Harper.
	âIt was the previous government that actually signed a co-operation plan initiative in 2013 under Rob Nicholson, when he was the Minister of National Defence â¦ because of the agreement they had signed, this is one of the reasons why we actually changed our approach because of the concerns the member outlined,â Sajjan said.
	Bezan, who served as Parliamentary Secretary of National Defence under Nicholson at the time, said Canada was engaging in âhostage diplomacyâ and that the Chinese government back then âis completely different to the Chinese government today.â
	Conservative leader Erin OâToole called the joint training exercise a âdangerous path for the Trudeau government to take"" and called Canada's dealings with China a ""dangerously naive approach [that] has put Canada and our citizens at risk.â
	The Canadian Armed Forces have participated in various joint and regional military exercises for decades with some two dozen Pacific Rim countries. Specifically, Canada advanced its bilateral defence relationship with China through talks between senior military officials on both sides in March 2012 and June 2013. The Cooperation Plan Initiative, which would guide defence-related activities, was signed in Ottawa in August 2013.
	Chinaâs President Xi Jinping, who came into power in March 2013, has tightened his control over the country in recent years through mass detention and surveillance of its Muslim population in Xinjiang, a crackdown on activism, heavy Internet censorship, consolidation of power and removal of presidential term limits. He has also taken a more assertive and harder-line approach to foreign affairs and defending Chinaâs interests.
	Mengâs arrest, and the subsequent arrest of Kovrig and Spavor shortly after, soured relations between Canada and China. Trudeau has spoken to U.S. president-elect Joe Biden about the situation, but has not said whether Biden might revisit the Justice Departmentâs efforts to extradite Meng. Should the U.S. withdraw its charges against Meng, it could give China a reason to release Kovrig and Spavor.
	âWe will always stand up for Canadians who are arbitrarily detained. This is one of the reasons why we actually stopped our training with the Chinese,â Sajjan said.

              Olympics on tight timeline to chart new path on protest
          
","
              For generations, the IOC knew exactly where to look for key support of its ban against protests at the Olympics. This week, the American federation put the IOC on notice: It is no longer the IOC's partner when it comes to enforcing the contentious Rule 50.

                ",https://www.ctvnews.ca/sports/olympics-on-tight-timeline-to-chart-new-path-on-protest-1.5227276,"
	For generations, the IOC knew exactly where to look for key support of its ban against protests at the Olympics.
	In 1968, it was the U.S. Olympic Committee that sent home its own athletes, Tommie Smith and John Carlos, when they raised their fists while on the medals stand at the Mexico City Games.
	In 2019, it was the same organization that placed its own athlete, Gwen Berry, on probation for doing the same after her win at the Pan-Am Games.
	This week, the American federation put the IOC on notice: It is no longer the IOC's partner when it comes to enforcing the contentious Rule 50. The USOPC is now heeding the calls from many of its own athletes and will no longer punish them for kneeling or raising fists or any other kind of acceptable demonstration at the Olympics.
	âWhen you sit in my seat, you have to make decisions that you think are on the right side of history,â said CEO Sarah Hirshland. âAnd I believe we're on the right side of history.â
	But there are details to iron out, and they strike to the heart of how much change is truly possible between now and next July, when the Tokyo Olympics are scheduled to take place.
	High on the list: What can athletes demonstrate about, and what will an acceptable demonstration look like?
	âThat becomes a difficult situation,â said Harry Edwards, the activist who helped brainstorm the gestures by Smith and Carlos 52 years ago. âBecause you could very easily get into a thing of trying to outdo someone else and it ends up having nothing to do with the spirit of the issue.â
	That confusion helps explain the calculated response to the USOPC that came from the IOC in the form of a short release from the head of its athlete commission, swimmer Kirsty Coventry of Zimbabwe.
	Well aware that the protest rule can't stay as-is for the foreseeable future, Coventry and the IOC are in the process of surveying athletes across the globe for their thoughts about possible changes. She said the majority of the respondents believe in the right of free speech, which is ârespectedâ at the Olympic Games (but only in certain settings) and âexpress support for preserving the ceremonies, the podium and the field of play.â
	Though Coventry's committee is still accepting feedback, and won't make any final decisions until early next year, she's previewing a far less radical adjustment to Rule 50 than the U.S. contingent would like.
	American athletes have been reeling from a summer of unrest over police violence against Black people in the United States. Every major sports league has agreed to change policies to give their players a bigger platform to discuss race and social injustice.
	But U.S. sports leagues and the Olympics are very different creatures. The Olympics are a behemoth that counts America as only one of 206 countries who are members.
	Some of the biggest members are among the IOC's most important partners - China, for instance, hosted the 2008 Olympics and will do so again in 2022 - and they don't share the same concerns or values about free speech or racial injustice as do the United States and many of its closest allies.
	âMany have also recognized the practical question of how to choose between the opinions of hundreds of issues from different angles across the world,â Coventry said of her survey respondents. âWe can see that it would be very difficult to make such a judgment without dividing the athlete community across all 206 NOCs.â
	Moushaumi Robinson, who led the U.S. athletes group that pressed for the changes, said she understands the complexities. Her group continues to discuss them to try to come up with solutions.
	âA lot of us just want to be able to say `I may not agree with you but I respect that you have a voice,â' she said. âAnd we want to be able to express it without someone punishing you for it.â
	All of which leads Edwards to believe that Thursday's move by the USOPC and its athletes is a sign of progress - not necessarily a huge leap but another step.
	âThis is an ongoing struggle, and it's going to continue to be a struggle,â he said. âAnd what today reflects is that this generation of athletes is more than willing to do their part.â"

	Jimmy Lai, the 73-year-old Hong Kong media tycoon and advocate for democracy, was denied bail Saturday after being charged the previous day under the semi-autonomous Chinese territory's new national security law.
	Lai faces a charge of collusion with foreign elements to endanger national security, apparently for tweets he made and interviews or commentaries he did with foreign media.
	The Apple Daily, a feisty pro-democracy tabloid owned by Lai, said he is accused of asking a foreign country, organization or individual to impose sanctions or engage in other hostile activities against Hong Kong or China.
	His case was adjourned to April 16 at the request of prosecutors, who said police needed time to review more than 1,000 tweets and comments made on his Twitter account, the Apple Daily reported.
	The newspaper said his charge sheet listed several foreign politicians who followed Lai on Twitter and cited commentaries he wrote and interviews he did with foreign media.
	Lai, who was already being held on other fraud charges after police raided his media company, could be seen handcuffed to a chain around his waist as guards led him to a van to go from prison to court. He wore a navy blazer and an open-neck shirt.
	Beijing imposed the national security law on Hong Kong earlier this year after stormy protests in 2019 that started over an extradition bill and expanded to include demands for greater democracy in the former British colony.
	The new law outlaws secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces to intervene in Hong Kong's affairs. It has constricted free speech in the city, and democracy activists see it as a way to suppress dissent.
	U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo tweeted Saturday morning Asia time that the security law ""makes a mockery of justice."" He called for Lai's release, saying his only crime is speaking the truth about China's authoritarian Communist Party government.
	Lai, the highest-profile person charged under the security law, has also been arrested for other alleged offences this year. He has been charged with taking part in unauthorized protests and with fraud over alleged violations of office lease terms.
	He has advocated for other countries to take a harsher stance on China, and met with Pompeo and Vice-President Mike Pence in the U.S. last year to discuss the extradition bill, which the Hong Kong government eventually withdrew.

	U.S. President-elect Joe Biden pledged Saturday to rejoin the Paris climate accord on the first day of his presidency, as world leaders staged a virtual gathering to celebrate the fifth anniversary of the international pact aimed at curbing global warming.
	Heads of state and government from over 70 countries took part in the event -- hosted by Britain, France, Italy, Chile and the United Nations -- to announce greater efforts in cutting the greenhouse gas emissions that fuel global warming.
	The outgoing administration of U.S. President Donald Trump, who pulled Washington out of the Paris accord, wasn't represented at the online gathering. But in a written statement sent shortly before it began, Biden made clear the U.S. was waiting on the sidelines to join again and noted that Washington was key to negotiating the 2015 agreement, which has since been ratified by almost all countries around the world.Â 
	""The United States will rejoin the Paris Agreement on day one of my presidency,"" he said. ""I'll immediately start working with my counterparts around the world to do all that we possibly can, including by convening the leaders of major economies for a climate summit within my first 100 days in office.""
	Biden reiterated his campaign pledge that his administration will set a target of cutting U.S. emissions to net zero ""no later than 2050.""
	Experts say commitments put forward by the international community in the past five years have already improved the long-term outlook on climate change, making the worst-case scenarios less likely by the end of the century. But wildfires in the Amazon, Australia and America, floods in Bangladesh and East Africa, and record temperatures in the Arctic have highlighted the impact an increase of 1.2 degrees Celsius (2.2 Fahrenheit) since pre-industrial times is already having on the planet.
	""If we don't change course, we may be headed for a catastrophic temperature rise of more than 3 degrees (Celsius) this century,"" UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said, urging world leaders to declare a ""climate emergency.""
	The Paris agreement aims to cap global warming at well under 2 C (3.6 F), ideally no more than 1.5 C (2.7 F), by the end of the century. Meeting the temperature target will require a phasing-out of fossil fuels and better protection for the world's carbon-soaking forests, wetlands and oceans.
	The UN chief called the announced U.S. return to the Paris accord ""a very important signal.""
	""We look forward for a very active U.S. leadership in climate action from now on,"" Guterres said. ""The United States is the largest economy in the world, it's absolutely essential for our goals to be reached.""
	Biden insisted that the dramatic economic shifts needed would be positive for American workers.
	""We have before us an enormous economic opportunity to create jobs and prosperity at home and export clean American-made products around the world, harnessing our climate ambition in a way that is good for American workers and the U.S. economy,"" he said.
	American representatives at the virtual meeting included Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, Gov. Charlie Baker of Massachusetts and U.S. business leaders, such as Apple chief executive Tim Cook.
	Also absent from the event were major economies such as Australia, Brazil, Indonesia, Mexico, Russia and Saudi Arabia. Most have offered no significant improvements on their existing emissions targets lately.
	Environmental campaigners singled out Brazil's recent announcement that it will stick to its target of cutting emissions by 43 per cent over the next decade compared with 2005 levels and aim for net zero by 2060 -- later than most other countries.
	By contrast, an agreement Friday by European Union members to beef up the continent's 2030 targets from 40 per cent to at least 55 per cent compared with 1990 levels was broadly welcomed, though activists said it could have aimed even higher.
	China, the world's biggest emitter, also surprised the world in September by announcing a net zero target of 2060, with emissions peaking by 2030. In his speech Saturday, Chinese President Xi Jinping provided further details on his country's medium-term goal for improving energy efficiency and ramping up electricity generated from renewable sources of power such as wind and solar.
	But Xi also cautioned that ""unilateralism will lead us nowhere"" -- a veiled reference to discussions in the EU to impose tariffs on goods imported from countries that have less stringent emissions standards than the 27-nation bloc. The issue is likely to dominate discussion between China, the EU and the U.S. in coming years.
	The Maldives, an Indian Ocean nation made up of low-lying islands that are particularly vulnerable to sea level rise, announced Saturday that it will now aim to achieve net zero by 2030, one of the most ambitious goals worldwide. Bhutan and Suriname claim to have already achieved that goal.
	The 189 countries that are party to the Paris agreement are required to submit their updated targets to the United Nations by the end of the year. This would normally have occurred at the annual UN climate summit, but the event was postponed for a year because of the pandemic.
	The gathering, now scheduled to take place in Glasgow, Scotland, in November 2021, will see haggling over financial support for poor countries to cope with climate change, and fine-tuning the rules for international markets in emissions trading. Britain, next year's host, announced this month that it's aiming to cut emissions by 68 per cent over the next decade and end state support for fossil fuel industry exports.
	Former UN climate chief Christiana Figueres, who was a key player at the Paris negotiations, said leaders had a duty to be optimistic about their ability to curb global warming.
	""Because if we don't, the alternative is unthinkable,"" she said. ""None of us adults alive today want to have on our shoulders the responsibility of turning over a world that is a world of misery for generations to come.""

              U.S. allows emergency COVID-19 vaccine in bid to end pandemic

	The U.S. gave the final go-ahead Friday to the nation's first COVID-19 vaccine, marking what could be the beginning of the end of an outbreak that has killed nearly 300,000 Americans, according to a person familiar with the decision but not authorized to discuss it publicly.
	Shots for health workers and nursing home residents are expected to begin in the coming days after the Food and Drug Administration authorized an emergency rollout of what promises to be a strongly protective vaccine from Pfizer Inc. and its German partner BioNTech.
	Initial doses are scarce and rationed as the U.S. joins Britain and several other countries in scrambling to vaccinate as many people as possible ahead of a long, grim winter. It will take months of work to tamp down the coronavirus that has surged to catastrophic levels in recent weeks and already claimed 1.5 million lives globally.
	While the FDA decision came only after public review of data from a huge ongoing study, it has also been dogged by intense political pressure from the Trump administration, which has accused the agency of being too slow and even threatened to remove FDA chief Stephen Hahn if a ruling did not come Friday.
	The move sets off what will be the largest vaccination campaign in U.S. history -- but it also has global ramifications because it's a role model to many other countries facing the same decision.
	The world desperately needs multiple vaccines for enough to go around, and the Pfizer-BioNTech shot is the first based on rigorous scientific testing to emerge from that worldwide race -- a record-setting scientific achievement that shaved years off the usual process.
	""I don't think you would have found a scientist on this planet that would have predicted this 11 months ago,"" said Dr. Paul Offit, a vaccine expert at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia who advises the FDA.
	The U.S. is considering a second vaccine, made by Moderna Inc., that could roll out in another week. In early January, Johnson & Johnson expects to learn if its vaccine is working in final testing.
	Europe is set to make its own decision on the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna shots later this month, an important step as some other candidates that multiple countries were anxiously awaiting have hit roadblocks. Friday, Sanofi and GSK announced a months-long delay after early tests showed their vaccine didn't work well enough in older adults.
	And China and Russia didn't wait for final-stage tests before beginning vaccinations with some homegrown shots.
	About 3 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine are expected in the first shipments around the country, according to officials with Operation Warp Speed, the Trump administration's vaccine development program. A similar amount is to be held in reserve for those recipients' second dose.
	A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advisory committee is poised to recommend who's first in line. Expected to follow health workers and nursing homes are other essential workers, older adults and people at high risk because of other health problems. U.S. authorities don't expect enough for the general population before spring, and that's assuming there are no manufacturing glitches.
	In a still unfinished study of nearly 44,000 people, the FDA found the vaccine was safe and more than 90% effective across recipients of different ages, including older adults, races and those with health problems that put them at high risk from the coronavirus.
	Emergency use means the vaccine still is experimental. Most important for would-be recipients to know:
	--Some protection begins after the first dose, but it takes a second dose three weeks later for full protection. It's unclear how long protection lasts.
	--The vaccine protects against COVID-19 illness, but no one yet knows if it can stop the silent, symptomless spread that accounts for roughly half of all cases. The ongoing study will attempt to answer that but for now, the vaccinated still will need to wear a mask and keep their distance.
	--Expect a sore arm and some flu-like symptoms such as fever, fatigue, headache and chills after the second dose. While uncomfortable, those reactions only last about a day. ""That's just your immune system working. It's a good thing,"" Offit said.
	--Authorities are investigating several allergic reactions reported in Britain by people with a history of severe allergies. Offit said it is routine in the U.S. for the vaccinated to stick around for a half-hour so they could get prompt treatment if such reactions appear.
	If emergency use of Moderna's vaccine also is authorized, the U.S. expects to vaccinate 20 million people by the end of December. They hope to have enough for another 30 million people in January and 50 million in February.
	Getting shots into arms is the big challenge, especially as a new poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found only half of Americans want the vaccine when it's their turn. About a quarter say they won't get it and the rest aren't sure.
	Political interference has complicated health authorities' message that the testing was rigorous and cut no corners.
	President Donald Trump bashed the FDA, again, Friday for taking too long, complaining that the agency ""is still a big, old slow turtle."" One of his deputies even pressed Hahn to clear the shots by the end of the day or face possible firing, two administration officials said.
	The FDA is unique in analyzing drugmakers' raw data, a process that takes longer than many other countries' regulatory reviews. In addition, the FDA insisted that large COVID-19 vaccine studies track at least half the participants for two months to look for side effects, a time period when historically any vaccine problems appear.

	Relatives of a dozen Hong Kong residents who have been detained in mainland China for more than 3 1/2 months made a plea Saturday to be informed of the timing of any trials and whether they can attend.
	The request underscored the sharp contrast between the relatively open legal system in Hong Kong, a semi-autonomous Chinese territory, and that of the mainland, where often little information is divulged until a trial is over.
	""I miss my son so much,"" the mother of Wong Wai-yin, one of the detainees, said, choking up. ""I want to visit him so badly. I haven't seen my son in a very long time -- it's almost four months. Please tell me (about the trial). I'm just an ordinary mother.""
	The 12 were arrested at sea in August while they were apparently making a bid to flee to Taiwan after a tough national security law took effect in Hong Kong earlier this year.
	They were picked up after entering mainland waters for crossing the maritime border without permission. At least some took part in anti-government protests in 2019 and were facing charges in Hong Kong.
	Though Hong Kong is a part of China, travellers must still pass through immigration when going to and from the mainland.
	Two are being held on suspicion of organizing an illegal border crossing. The group has been locked up in Shenzhen, a southern Chinese city that borders Hong Kong.
	The relatives covered their faces with masks, and some wore sunglasses, caps or hoods to hide their identities as they spoke at a news conference. They did not give their names.
	Owen Chow, an activist who has been helping the families, said they wanted to know whether the trials would be open to the public and if family members could attend.
	He and some family members questioned the authenticity of letters some of the latter had received, purportedly from their detained relatives, saying they were being held in a good environment and not abused.
	""The only thing I can do is to have dissatisfaction and be angry,"" said a relative of Tang Kai-yin, another detainee. ""I don't know what else to do."""

	U.S. President-elect Joe Biden pledged Saturday to rejoin the Paris climate accord on the first day of his presidency, as world leaders staged a virtual gathering to celebrate the fifth anniversary of the international pact aimed at curbing global warming.
	Heads of state and government from over 70 countries took part in the event -- hosted by Britain, France, Italy, Chile and the United Nations -- to announce greater efforts in cutting the greenhouse gas emissions that fuel global warming.
	The outgoing administration of U.S. President Donald Trump, who pulled Washington out of the Paris accord, wasn't represented at the online gathering. But in a written statement sent shortly before it began, Biden made clear the U.S. was waiting on the sidelines to join again and noted that Washington was key to negotiating the 2015 agreement, which has since been ratified by almost all countries around the world.Â 
	""The United States will rejoin the Paris Agreement on day one of my presidency,"" he said. ""I'll immediately start working with my counterparts around the world to do all that we possibly can, including by convening the leaders of major economies for a climate summit within my first 100 days in office.""
	Biden reiterated his campaign pledge that his administration will set a target of cutting U.S. emissions to net zero ""no later than 2050.""
	Experts say commitments put forward by the international community in the past five years have already improved the long-term outlook on climate change, making the worst-case scenarios less likely by the end of the century. But wildfires in the Amazon, Australia and America, floods in Bangladesh and East Africa, and record temperatures in the Arctic have highlighted the impact an increase of 1.2 degrees Celsius (2.2 Fahrenheit) since pre-industrial times is already having on the planet.
	""If we don't change course, we may be headed for a catastrophic temperature rise of more than 3 degrees (Celsius) this century,"" UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said, urging world leaders to declare a ""climate emergency.""
	The Paris agreement aims to cap global warming at well under 2 C (3.6 F), ideally no more than 1.5 C (2.7 F), by the end of the century. Meeting the temperature target will require a phasing-out of fossil fuels and better protection for the world's carbon-soaking forests, wetlands and oceans.
	The UN chief called the announced U.S. return to the Paris accord ""a very important signal.""
	""We look forward for a very active U.S. leadership in climate action from now on,"" Guterres said. ""The United States is the largest economy in the world, it's absolutely essential for our goals to be reached.""
	Biden insisted that the dramatic economic shifts needed would be positive for American workers.
	""We have before us an enormous economic opportunity to create jobs and prosperity at home and export clean American-made products around the world, harnessing our climate ambition in a way that is good for American workers and the U.S. economy,"" he said.
	American representatives at the virtual meeting included Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, Gov. Charlie Baker of Massachusetts and U.S. business leaders, such as Apple chief executive Tim Cook.
	Also absent from the event were major economies such as Australia, Brazil, Indonesia, Mexico, Russia and Saudi Arabia. Most have offered no significant improvements on their existing emissions targets lately.
	Environmental campaigners singled out Brazil's recent announcement that it will stick to its target of cutting emissions by 43 per cent over the next decade compared with 2005 levels and aim for net zero by 2060 -- later than most other countries.
	By contrast, an agreement Friday by European Union members to beef up the continent's 2030 targets from 40 per cent to at least 55 per cent compared with 1990 levels was broadly welcomed, though activists said it could have aimed even higher.
	China, the world's biggest emitter, also surprised the world in September by announcing a net zero target of 2060, with emissions peaking by 2030. In his speech Saturday, Chinese President Xi Jinping provided further details on his country's medium-term goal for improving energy efficiency and ramping up electricity generated from renewable sources of power such as wind and solar.
	But Xi also cautioned that ""unilateralism will lead us nowhere"" -- a veiled reference to discussions in the EU to impose tariffs on goods imported from countries that have less stringent emissions standards than the 27-nation bloc. The issue is likely to dominate discussion between China, the EU and the U.S. in coming years.
	The Maldives, an Indian Ocean nation made up of low-lying islands that are particularly vulnerable to sea level rise, announced Saturday that it will now aim to achieve net zero by 2030, one of the most ambitious goals worldwide. Bhutan and Suriname claim to have already achieved that goal.
	The 189 countries that are party to the Paris agreement are required to submit their updated targets to the United Nations by the end of the year. This would normally have occurred at the annual UN climate summit, but the event was postponed for a year because of the pandemic.
	The gathering, now scheduled to take place in Glasgow, Scotland, in November 2021, will see haggling over financial support for poor countries to cope with climate change, and fine-tuning the rules for international markets in emissions trading. Britain, next year's host, announced this month that it's aiming to cut emissions by 68 per cent over the next decade and end state support for fossil fuel industry exports.
	Former UN climate chief Christiana Figueres, who was a key player at the Paris negotiations, said leaders had a duty to be optimistic about their ability to curb global warming.
	""Because if we don't, the alternative is unthinkable,"" she said. ""None of us adults alive today want to have on our shoulders the responsibility of turning over a world that is a world of misery for generations to come.""

              U.S. allows emergency COVID-19 vaccine in bid to end pandemic

	The U.S. gave the final go-ahead Friday to the nation's first COVID-19 vaccine, marking what could be the beginning of the end of an outbreak that has killed nearly 300,000 Americans, according to a person familiar with the decision but not authorized to discuss it publicly.
	Shots for health workers and nursing home residents are expected to begin in the coming days after the Food and Drug Administration authorized an emergency rollout of what promises to be a strongly protective vaccine from Pfizer Inc. and its German partner BioNTech.
	Initial doses are scarce and rationed as the U.S. joins Britain and several other countries in scrambling to vaccinate as many people as possible ahead of a long, grim winter. It will take months of work to tamp down the coronavirus that has surged to catastrophic levels in recent weeks and already claimed 1.5 million lives globally.
	While the FDA decision came only after public review of data from a huge ongoing study, it has also been dogged by intense political pressure from the Trump administration, which has accused the agency of being too slow and even threatened to remove FDA chief Stephen Hahn if a ruling did not come Friday.
	The move sets off what will be the largest vaccination campaign in U.S. history -- but it also has global ramifications because it's a role model to many other countries facing the same decision.
	The world desperately needs multiple vaccines for enough to go around, and the Pfizer-BioNTech shot is the first based on rigorous scientific testing to emerge from that worldwide race -- a record-setting scientific achievement that shaved years off the usual process.
	""I don't think you would have found a scientist on this planet that would have predicted this 11 months ago,"" said Dr. Paul Offit, a vaccine expert at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia who advises the FDA.
	The U.S. is considering a second vaccine, made by Moderna Inc., that could roll out in another week. In early January, Johnson & Johnson expects to learn if its vaccine is working in final testing.
	Europe is set to make its own decision on the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna shots later this month, an important step as some other candidates that multiple countries were anxiously awaiting have hit roadblocks. Friday, Sanofi and GSK announced a months-long delay after early tests showed their vaccine didn't work well enough in older adults.
	And China and Russia didn't wait for final-stage tests before beginning vaccinations with some homegrown shots.
	About 3 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine are expected in the first shipments around the country, according to officials with Operation Warp Speed, the Trump administration's vaccine development program. A similar amount is to be held in reserve for those recipients' second dose.
	A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advisory committee is poised to recommend who's first in line. Expected to follow health workers and nursing homes are other essential workers, older adults and people at high risk because of other health problems. U.S. authorities don't expect enough for the general population before spring, and that's assuming there are no manufacturing glitches.
	In a still unfinished study of nearly 44,000 people, the FDA found the vaccine was safe and more than 90% effective across recipients of different ages, including older adults, races and those with health problems that put them at high risk from the coronavirus.
	Emergency use means the vaccine still is experimental. Most important for would-be recipients to know:
	--Some protection begins after the first dose, but it takes a second dose three weeks later for full protection. It's unclear how long protection lasts.
	--The vaccine protects against COVID-19 illness, but no one yet knows if it can stop the silent, symptomless spread that accounts for roughly half of all cases. The ongoing study will attempt to answer that but for now, the vaccinated still will need to wear a mask and keep their distance.
	--Expect a sore arm and some flu-like symptoms such as fever, fatigue, headache and chills after the second dose. While uncomfortable, those reactions only last about a day. ""That's just your immune system working. It's a good thing,"" Offit said.
	--Authorities are investigating several allergic reactions reported in Britain by people with a history of severe allergies. Offit said it is routine in the U.S. for the vaccinated to stick around for a half-hour so they could get prompt treatment if such reactions appear.
	If emergency use of Moderna's vaccine also is authorized, the U.S. expects to vaccinate 20 million people by the end of December. They hope to have enough for another 30 million people in January and 50 million in February.
	Getting shots into arms is the big challenge, especially as a new poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found only half of Americans want the vaccine when it's their turn. About a quarter say they won't get it and the rest aren't sure.
	Political interference has complicated health authorities' message that the testing was rigorous and cut no corners.
	President Donald Trump bashed the FDA, again, Friday for taking too long, complaining that the agency ""is still a big, old slow turtle."" One of his deputies even pressed Hahn to clear the shots by the end of the day or face possible firing, two administration officials said.
	The FDA is unique in analyzing drugmakers' raw data, a process that takes longer than many other countries' regulatory reviews. In addition, the FDA insisted that large COVID-19 vaccine studies track at least half the participants for two months to look for side effects, a time period when historically any vaccine problems appear.

	Canada is no longer training with the Chinese military, the Minister of National Defence Harjit Sajjan told the House of Commons on Thursday, after Conservative defence critic James Bezan questioned why Prime Minister Justin Trudeau would maintain such relations with China.
	The issue came to a head following a report by the Globe and Mail that top officials at Global Affairs, concerned the Chinese government would view it as a retaliatory move over its detention of Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, was âalarmedâ that General Jonathan Vance cancelled winter military exercises with the Peopleâs Liberation Army in 2019 at CFB Petawawa.
	The news comes as Kovrig and Spavor marked their second anniversary in Chinese prison on what Canada and its Western allies say are unfounded espionage charges that followed Canadaâs arrest of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou on a U.S. extradition warrant in December 2018.
	âOur government always stands up for Canadians at home and abroad and this includes our relationship with China. But let me be very clear, we do not train with Chinese military,â said Minister Sajjan, adding that this initiative was originally put in place by the Conservative government under Stephen Harper.
	âIt was the previous government that actually signed a co-operation plan initiative in 2013 under Rob Nicholson, when he was the Minister of National Defence â¦ because of the agreement they had signed, this is one of the reasons why we actually changed our approach because of the concerns the member outlined,â Sajjan said.
	Bezan, who served as Parliamentary Secretary of National Defence under Nicholson at the time, said Canada was engaging in âhostage diplomacyâ and that the Chinese government back then âis completely different to the Chinese government today.â
	Conservative leader Erin OâToole called the joint training exercise a âdangerous path for the Trudeau government to take"" and called Canada's dealings with China a ""dangerously naive approach [that] has put Canada and our citizens at risk.â
	The Canadian Armed Forces have participated in various joint and regional military exercises for decades with some two dozen Pacific Rim countries. Specifically, Canada advanced its bilateral defence relationship with China through talks between senior military officials on both sides in March 2012 and June 2013. The Cooperation Plan Initiative, which would guide defence-related activities, was signed in Ottawa in August 2013.
	Chinaâs President Xi Jinping, who came into power in March 2013, has tightened his control over the country in recent years through mass detention and surveillance of its Muslim population in Xinjiang, a crackdown on activism, heavy Internet censorship, consolidation of power and removal of presidential term limits. He has also taken a more assertive and harder-line approach to foreign affairs and defending Chinaâs interests.
	Mengâs arrest, and the subsequent arrest of Kovrig and Spavor shortly after, soured relations between Canada and China. Trudeau has spoken to U.S. president-elect Joe Biden about the situation, but has not said whether Biden might revisit the Justice Departmentâs efforts to extradite Meng. Should the U.S. withdraw its charges against Meng, it could give China a reason to release Kovrig and Spavor.
	âWe will always stand up for Canadians who are arbitrarily detained. This is one of the reasons why we actually stopped our training with the Chinese,â Sajjan said.

              Olympics on tight timeline to chart new path on protest
          
","
              For generations, the IOC knew exactly where to look for key support of its ban against protests at the Olympics. This week, the American federation put the IOC on notice: It is no longer the IOC's partner when it comes to enforcing the contentious Rule 50.
        ","
                  Friday, Dec. 11, 2020
                ",https://www.ctvnews.ca/sports/olympics-on-tight-timeline-to-chart-new-path-on-protest-1.5227276,"
	For generations, the IOC knew exactly where to look for key support of its ban against protests at the Olympics.
	In 1968, it was the U.S. Olympic Committee that sent home its own athletes, Tommie Smith and John Carlos, when they raised their fists while on the medals stand at the Mexico City Games.
	In 2019, it was the same organization that placed its own athlete, Gwen Berry, on probation for doing the same after her win at the Pan-Am Games.
	This week, the American federation put the IOC on notice: It is no longer the IOC's partner when it comes to enforcing the contentious Rule 50. The USOPC is now heeding the calls from many of its own athletes and will no longer punish them for kneeling or raising fists or any other kind of acceptable demonstration at the Olympics.
	âWhen you sit in my seat, you have to make decisions that you think are on the right side of history,â said CEO Sarah Hirshland. âAnd I believe we're on the right side of history.â
	But there are details to iron out, and they strike to the heart of how much change is truly possible between now and next July, when the Tokyo Olympics are scheduled to take place.
	High on the list: What can athletes demonstrate about, and what will an acceptable demonstration look like?
	âThat becomes a difficult situation,â said Harry Edwards, the activist who helped brainstorm the gestures by Smith and Carlos 52 years ago. âBecause you could very easily get into a thing of trying to outdo someone else and it ends up having nothing to do with the spirit of the issue.â
	That confusion helps explain the calculated response to the USOPC that came from the IOC in the form of a short release from the head of its athlete commission, swimmer Kirsty Coventry of Zimbabwe.
	Well aware that the protest rule can't stay as-is for the foreseeable future, Coventry and the IOC are in the process of surveying athletes across the globe for their thoughts about possible changes. She said the majority of the respondents believe in the right of free speech, which is ârespectedâ at the Olympic Games (but only in certain settings) and âexpress support for preserving the ceremonies, the podium and the field of play.â
	Though Coventry's committee is still accepting feedback, and won't make any final decisions until early next year, she's previewing a far less radical adjustment to Rule 50 than the U.S. contingent would like.
	American athletes have been reeling from a summer of unrest over police violence against Black people in the United States. Every major sports league has agreed to change policies to give their players a bigger platform to discuss race and social injustice.
	But U.S. sports leagues and the Olympics are very different creatures. The Olympics are a behemoth that counts America as only one of 206 countries who are members.
	Some of the biggest members are among the IOC's most important partners - China, for instance, hosted the 2008 Olympics and will do so again in 2022 - and they don't share the same concerns or values about free speech or racial injustice as do the United States and many of its closest allies.
	âMany have also recognized the practical question of how to choose between the opinions of hundreds of issues from different angles across the world,â Coventry said of her survey respondents. âWe can see that it would be very difficult to make such a judgment without dividing the athlete community across all 206 NOCs.â
	Moushaumi Robinson, who led the U.S. athletes group that pressed for the changes, said she understands the complexities. Her group continues to discuss them to try to come up with solutions.
	âA lot of us just want to be able to say `I may not agree with you but I respect that you have a voice,â' she said. âAnd we want to be able to express it without someone punishing you for it.â
	All of which leads Edwards to believe that Thursday's move by the USOPC and its athletes is a sign of progress - not necessarily a huge leap but another step.
	âThis is an ongoing struggle, and it's going to continue to be a struggle,â he said. âAnd what today reflects is that this generation of athletes is more than willing to do their part.â"

              Diverse TV holiday season includes all-Asian Lifetime movie
          
","
              In one scene from the Lifetime TV movie, âA Sugar & Spice Holiday,â a co-worker says to Suzy, an Asian American architect in Los Angeles: âI didn't know if Christmas was a big deal where you're from.â

                  Friday, Dec. 11, 2020
                ",https://www.ctvnews.ca/entertainment/diverse-tv-holiday-season-includes-all-asian-lifetime-movie-1.5227204,"
	In one scene from the Lifetime TV movie, âA Sugar & Spice Holiday,â a co-worker says to Suzy, an Asian American architect in Los Angeles: âI didn't know if Christmas was a big deal where you're from.â
	Retorts Suzy: âI'm from Maine.â
	A lot of viewers of a cozy Christmas film might just shrug off the insinuation that Suzy is somehow not American. But for an Asian audience, that brief exchange is a knowing reminder that microaggressions don't take a holiday. They especially haven't in the wake of the pandemic, which has triggered anti-Asian racism and terms like âChinese virusâ and âkung flu.â
	âI think it's great timing for us for this movie to be coming out now during the pandemic with the perception of the Asian culture and the `flu' and all,â Canadian actor Jacky Lai, who plays Suzy, told The Associated Press. âI really do hope that this (movie) - with our faces - is able to hopefully be welcomed by people into their homes and see us as just your American/Canadian friends.â
	âA Sugar & Spice Holiday,â premiering Sunday, may be the first feel-good TV Christmas flick to feature a mostly Asian ensemble. It's one of several projects where cable channels are demonstrating a desire for inclusion this yuletide season. The shift comes a year after the Hallmark Channel dropped an ad that included a same-sex couple. The fallout pointed to an overall diversity problem in the genre with not just the LGBTQ community, but communities of colour. Recent months of racial unrest only added to the conversation within the entertainment industry about representation.
	Tia Maggini, vice-president of Lifetime Original Movies, says it was a coincidence that screenwriter Eirene Donohue, who is Asian American and had worked with the them before, came to them with the story pitch.
	âIt was exciting to be presented with this particular point of view that has been long overdue for the Christmas movie genre,â Maggini said in a statement. Most important: The movie itself was actually funny and âfull of Christmas heart.â
	Indeed, the rom-com has all the warm, familiar holiday movie tropes. Suzy returns to the small town where she grew up for Christmas, is persuaded to revive her baking skills for a local gingerbread house competition and is assisted by her former high school crush (Tony Giroux).
	Her father is played by veteran actor Tzi Ma. Despite a year filled with high profile film roles in âThe Farewellâ and âMulan,â Ma didn't hesitate to join a Lifetime movie.
	âIt was the first time a Chinese American family was featured on a Christmas story,â Ma said in an email. âLifetime has a tremendous Asian American following. It's a way to say thank you to them.â
	In Hollywood, it can often feel like studios only cast Asians in narratives where there's some kind of hardship or East-meets-West struggle. And with TV holiday movies, they're almost nonexistent. Meanwhile, there are white actors who have made a baker's dozen of them. Like any other group, Giroux says, Asians deserve to see themselves in lighthearted fare regularly.
	âI think it's so important to have all sorts of stories with any culture - for them to have exposure to the stories of struggle but it's such a delight to see something lighter, to see aspects of culture that aren't surrounded with times of difficulty,â Giroux says.
	Giroux, who is Canadian, is also looking forward to queuing up a movie where his grandparents can see themselves.
	âI'm really excited for them to see a story that covers part of their story. My grandparents immigrated here from China from in the `50s,â Giroux says. âThat's why being part of this project is telling a story that I'm really a part of.â
	Lai grew up loving romantic comedies. She remembers unexpectedly getting emotional watching âCrazy Rich Asians,â the first major Hollywood studio film with an all-Asian cast in 25 years.
	âYou hear people say there hasn't been a movie like this in 25 years. You hear those things. But it's not until I sat in the theatre and watched someone who looked like me on screen who wasn't a ninja or a nerd but someone just like me. I remember the way it felt,â Lai says. âI am so excited that there's another movie like that and hopefully we bring joy and open some minds with this movie and more opportunities.â
	The movie is lovingly sprinkled with Chinese American nuances on script and screen. These include a photo of Suzy's deceased grandma flanked by incense sticks and the entire family eating with chopsticks. And it is definitely the only Christmas movie to feature both gingerbread and stinky tofu, a beloved Chinese dish known for its pungent smell.
	âI love that we were able to kind of include a lot of nice details. ... It's really a romantic comedy where the characters happen to be Asian American,â says Jennifer Liao, the director. âIt's nice to make an Asian American movie that's not necessarily completely frontloaded with having to carry the weight of cultural identity issues and things like that.â
	âSugar & Spiceâ is not the only holiday movie expanding the definition of who can lead these kinds of flicks. A handful of networks, including Lifetime and Hallmark, have a Christmas-themed movie on their slate featuring a same-sex pairing. Tony winner Ali Stroker, who uses a wheelchair, stars in Lifetime's âChristmas Ever After.â
	Does Liao feel pressure as âthe firstâ even on such an innocuous project to bring in a sizeable audience? âI feel like the pressure is more to deliver something that I and everybody else worked on can be proud of. That was really no. 1,â Liao says.
	Lai doesn't see the point of getting caught up in things like ratings.
	âI think that it is really, really nice to hear when someone says `I got to see someone who looks like me on screen.' That will never get old,â Lai says. âWe get more responses like that - for me, the movie did its purpose.â

	India on Friday rejected a Chinese allegation that it is responsible for high tensions along their disputed border.
	Indian External Affairs Ministry spokesman Anurag Srivastava said the six-month standoff between the two countries' armies ""has been a result of the actions of the Chinese side, which has sought to effect a unilateral change in the status along the Line of Actual Control in Eastern Ladakh.""
	Srivastava was responding to a statement by Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying in Beijing on Thursday that ""the rights and wrongs of what has happened in the China-India border area are very clear and the responsibility lies squarely with the Indian side.""
	Hua also said that China is firmly committed to safeguarding its sovereignty. ""We hope that India will work with China in the same direction and do more things conducive to solidarity, co-operation and common development,"" she said.
	The standoff between the Asian giants erupted into a fierce brawl in May and worsened into hand-to-hand combat on June 15 with soldiers using clubs, stones and fists, leaving 20 Indian troops dead. China is believed to also have suffered casualties, but has not given any details.
	The countries have held a series of talks on ending the standoff without any breakthrough."

              Chinese authorities detain Bloomberg news assistant

              U.S. financial news service Bloomberg said Friday that Chinese authorities have detained one of its Beijing-based news assistants on what they said was suspicion of endangering national security.

	U.S. financial news service Bloomberg said Friday that Chinese authorities have detained one of its Beijing-based news assistants on what they said was suspicion of endangering national security.
	Bloomberg reported that Chinese citizen Haze Fan was seen being taken from her apartment building accompanied by security officers in plain clothes at about noon on Monday, shortly after her last contact with her editors.
	It quoted a Chinese government statement as saying Fan was detained by the Beijing branch of the National Security Bureau ""according to relevant Chinese law on suspicion of engaging in criminal activities that jeopardize national security.""
	China permits Chinese citizens to work only as translators, researchers and assistants for foreign news organizations, not as registered journalists able to report independently. China's own media are almost entirely state owned and tightly controlled, and the country has long been one of the leading jailers of journalists.
	Bloomberg said it has been seeking information about Fan's whereabouts from the Chinese government and from China's embassy in Washington, D.C.
	It said its parent company, Bloomberg LP, was informed Thursday that she was being held on suspicion of endangering national security, a vaguely defined charge that can lead to lengthy detention with little recourse to legal assistance.
	""We are very concerned for her, and have been actively speaking to Chinese authorities to better understand the situation. We are continuing to do everything we can to support her while we seek more information,"" a Bloomberg spokesperson was quoted as saying in the report.
	Fan began working for Bloomberg in 2017 after stints with a number of other foreign news organizations in China, the company said.
	China has detained news assistants in the past over reports that angered the ruling Communist Party, and authorities have also sought to punish foreign media more generally by limiting their operations, expelling journalists or issuing them only short-term visas.
	China this year expelled journalists from The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal and other American outlets amid complaints over content and moves by the U.S. to send home dozens of Chinese journalists working for state media.
	Bloomberg saw its business in financial information suffer in China several years ago in apparent retaliation for its reporting on the personal financial dealings of leading Chinese officials."

	Jimmy Lai, the 73-year-old Hong Kong media tycoon and advocate for democracy, was denied bail Saturday after being charged the previous day under the semi-autonomous Chinese territory's new national security law.
	Lai faces a charge of collusion with foreign elements to endanger national security, apparently for tweets he made and interviews or commentaries he did with foreign media.
	The Apple Daily, a feisty pro-democracy tabloid owned by Lai, said he is accused of asking a foreign country, organization or individual to impose sanctions or engage in other hostile activities against Hong Kong or China.
	His case was adjourned to April 16 at the request of prosecutors, who said police needed time to review more than 1,000 tweets and comments made on his Twitter account, the Apple Daily reported.
	The newspaper said his charge sheet listed several foreign politicians who followed Lai on Twitter and cited commentaries he wrote and interviews he did with foreign media.
	Lai, who was already being held on other fraud charges after police raided his media company, could be seen handcuffed to a chain around his waist as guards led him to a van to go from prison to court. He wore a navy blazer and an open-neck shirt.
	Beijing imposed the national security law on Hong Kong earlier this year after stormy protests in 2019 that started over an extradition bill and expanded to include demands for greater democracy in the former British colony.
	The new law outlaws secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces to intervene in Hong Kong's affairs. It has constricted free speech in the city, and democracy activists see it as a way to suppress dissent.
	U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo tweeted Saturday morning Asia time that the security law ""makes a mockery of justice."" He called for Lai's release, saying his only crime is speaking the truth about China's authoritarian Communist Party government.
	Lai, the highest-profile person charged under the security law, has also been arrested for other alleged offences this year. He has been charged with taking part in unauthorized protests and with fraud over alleged violations of office lease terms.
	He has advocated for other countries to take a harsher stance on China, and met with Pompeo and Vice-President Mike Pence in the U.S. last year to discuss the extradition bill, which the Hong Kong government eventually withdrew.
	Pence also tweeted about Lai, saying the charges against him are ""an affront to freedom loving people around everywhere."""

	Relatives of a dozen Hong Kong residents who have been detained in mainland China for more than 3 1/2 months made a plea Saturday to be informed of the timing of any trials and whether they can attend.
	The request underscored the sharp contrast between the relatively open legal system in Hong Kong, a semi-autonomous Chinese territory, and that of the mainland, where often little information is divulged until a trial is over.
	""I miss my son so much,"" the mother of Wong Wai-yin, one of the detainees, said, choking up. ""I want to visit him so badly. I haven't seen my son in a very long time -- it's almost four months. Please tell me (about the trial). I'm just an ordinary mother.""
	The 12 were arrested at sea in August while they were apparently making a bid to flee to Taiwan after a tough national security law took effect in Hong Kong earlier this year.
	They were picked up after entering mainland waters for crossing the maritime border without permission. At least some took part in anti-government protests in 2019 and were facing charges in Hong Kong.
	Though Hong Kong is a part of China, travellers must still pass through immigration when going to and from the mainland.
	Two are being held on suspicion of organizing an illegal border crossing. The group has been locked up in Shenzhen, a southern Chinese city that borders Hong Kong.
	The relatives covered their faces with masks, and some wore sunglasses, caps or hoods to hide their identities as they spoke at a news conference. They did not give their names.
	Owen Chow, an activist who has been helping the families, said they wanted to know whether the trials would be open to the public and if family members could attend.
	He and some family members questioned the authenticity of letters some of the latter had received, purportedly from their detained relatives, saying they were being held in a good environment and not abused.
	""The only thing I can do is to have dissatisfaction and be angry,"" said a relative of Tang Kai-yin, another detainee. ""I don't know what else to do."""

              As leaders set fresh climate goals, Biden pledges U.S. support

	U.S. President-elect Joe Biden pledged Saturday to rejoin the Paris climate accord on the first day of his presidency, as world leaders staged a virtual gathering to celebrate the fifth anniversary of the international pact aimed at curbing global warming.
	Heads of state and government from over 70 countries took part in the event -- hosted by Britain, France, Italy, Chile and the United Nations -- to announce greater efforts in cutting the greenhouse gas emissions that fuel global warming.
	The outgoing administration of U.S. President Donald Trump, who pulled Washington out of the Paris accord, wasn't represented at the online gathering. But in a written statement sent shortly before it began, Biden made clear the U.S. was waiting on the sidelines to join again and noted that Washington was key to negotiating the 2015 agreement, which has since been ratified by almost all countries around the world.Â 
	""The United States will rejoin the Paris Agreement on day one of my presidency,"" he said. ""I'll immediately start working with my counterparts around the world to do all that we possibly can, including by convening the leaders of major economies for a climate summit within my first 100 days in office.""
	Biden reiterated his campaign pledge that his administration will set a target of cutting U.S. emissions to net zero ""no later than 2050.""
	Experts say commitments put forward by the international community in the past five years have already improved the long-term outlook on climate change, making the worst-case scenarios less likely by the end of the century. But wildfires in the Amazon, Australia and America, floods in Bangladesh and East Africa, and record temperatures in the Arctic have highlighted the impact an increase of 1.2 degrees Celsius (2.2 Fahrenheit) since pre-industrial times is already having on the planet.
	""If we don't change course, we may be headed for a catastrophic temperature rise of more than 3 degrees (Celsius) this century,"" UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said, urging world leaders to declare a ""climate emergency.""
	The Paris agreement aims to cap global warming at well under 2 C (3.6 F), ideally no more than 1.5 C (2.7 F), by the end of the century. Meeting the temperature target will require a phasing-out of fossil fuels and better protection for the world's carbon-soaking forests, wetlands and oceans.
	The UN chief called the announced U.S. return to the Paris accord ""a very important signal.""
	""We look forward for a very active U.S. leadership in climate action from now on,"" Guterres said. ""The United States is the largest economy in the world, it's absolutely essential for our goals to be reached.""
	Biden insisted that the dramatic economic shifts needed would be positive for American workers.
	""We have before us an enormous economic opportunity to create jobs and prosperity at home and export clean American-made products around the world, harnessing our climate ambition in a way that is good for American workers and the U.S. economy,"" he said.
	American representatives at the virtual meeting included Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, Gov. Charlie Baker of Massachusetts and U.S. business leaders, such as Apple chief executive Tim Cook.
	Also absent from the event were major economies such as Australia, Brazil, Indonesia, Mexico, Russia and Saudi Arabia. Most have offered no significant improvements on their existing emissions targets lately.
	Environmental campaigners singled out Brazil's recent announcement that it will stick to its target of cutting emissions by 43 per cent over the next decade compared with 2005 levels and aim for net zero by 2060 -- later than most other countries.
	By contrast, an agreement Friday by European Union members to beef up the continent's 2030 targets from 40 per cent to at least 55 per cent compared with 1990 levels was broadly welcomed, though activists said it could have aimed even higher.
	China, the world's biggest emitter, also surprised the world in September by announcing a net zero target of 2060, with emissions peaking by 2030. In his speech Saturday, Chinese President Xi Jinping provided further details on his country's medium-term goal for improving energy efficiency and ramping up electricity generated from renewable sources of power such as wind and solar.
	But Xi also cautioned that ""unilateralism will lead us nowhere"" -- a veiled reference to discussions in the EU to impose tariffs on goods imported from countries that have less stringent emissions standards than the 27-nation bloc. The issue is likely to dominate discussion between China, the EU and the U.S. in coming years.
	The Maldives, an Indian Ocean nation made up of low-lying islands that are particularly vulnerable to sea level rise, announced Saturday that it will now aim to achieve net zero by 2030, one of the most ambitious goals worldwide. Bhutan and Suriname claim to have already achieved that goal.
	The 189 countries that are party to the Paris agreement are required to submit their updated targets to the United Nations by the end of the year. This would normally have occurred at the annual UN climate summit, but the event was postponed for a year because of the pandemic.
	The gathering, now scheduled to take place in Glasgow, Scotland, in November 2021, will see haggling over financial support for poor countries to cope with climate change, and fine-tuning the rules for international markets in emissions trading. Britain, next year's host, announced this month that it's aiming to cut emissions by 68 per cent over the next decade and end state support for fossil fuel industry exports.
	Former UN climate chief Christiana Figueres, who was a key player at the Paris negotiations, said leaders had a duty to be optimistic about their ability to curb global warming.
	""Because if we don't, the alternative is unthinkable,"" she said. ""None of us adults alive today want to have on our shoulders the responsibility of turning over a world that is a world of misery for generations to come.""

              U.S. allows emergency COVID-19 vaccine in bid to end pandemic

	The U.S. gave the final go-ahead Friday to the nation's first COVID-19 vaccine, marking what could be the beginning of the end of an outbreak that has killed nearly 300,000 Americans, according to a person familiar with the decision but not authorized to discuss it publicly.
	Shots for health workers and nursing home residents are expected to begin in the coming days after the Food and Drug Administration authorized an emergency rollout of what promises to be a strongly protective vaccine from Pfizer Inc. and its German partner BioNTech.
	Initial doses are scarce and rationed as the U.S. joins Britain and several other countries in scrambling to vaccinate as many people as possible ahead of a long, grim winter. It will take months of work to tamp down the coronavirus that has surged to catastrophic levels in recent weeks and already claimed 1.5 million lives globally.
	While the FDA decision came only after public review of data from a huge ongoing study, it has also been dogged by intense political pressure from the Trump administration, which has accused the agency of being too slow and even threatened to remove FDA chief Stephen Hahn if a ruling did not come Friday.
	The move sets off what will be the largest vaccination campaign in U.S. history -- but it also has global ramifications because it's a role model to many other countries facing the same decision.
	The world desperately needs multiple vaccines for enough to go around, and the Pfizer-BioNTech shot is the first based on rigorous scientific testing to emerge from that worldwide race -- a record-setting scientific achievement that shaved years off the usual process.
	""I don't think you would have found a scientist on this planet that would have predicted this 11 months ago,"" said Dr. Paul Offit, a vaccine expert at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia who advises the FDA.
	The U.S. is considering a second vaccine, made by Moderna Inc., that could roll out in another week. In early January, Johnson & Johnson expects to learn if its vaccine is working in final testing.
	Europe is set to make its own decision on the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna shots later this month, an important step as some other candidates that multiple countries were anxiously awaiting have hit roadblocks. Friday, Sanofi and GSK announced a months-long delay after early tests showed their vaccine didn't work well enough in older adults.
	And China and Russia didn't wait for final-stage tests before beginning vaccinations with some homegrown shots.
	About 3 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine are expected in the first shipments around the country, according to officials with Operation Warp Speed, the Trump administration's vaccine development program. A similar amount is to be held in reserve for those recipients' second dose.
	A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advisory committee is poised to recommend who's first in line. Expected to follow health workers and nursing homes are other essential workers, older adults and people at high risk because of other health problems. U.S. authorities don't expect enough for the general population before spring, and that's assuming there are no manufacturing glitches.
	In a still unfinished study of nearly 44,000 people, the FDA found the vaccine was safe and more than 90% effective across recipients of different ages, including older adults, races and those with health problems that put them at high risk from the coronavirus.
	Emergency use means the vaccine still is experimental. Most important for would-be recipients to know:
	--Some protection begins after the first dose, but it takes a second dose three weeks later for full protection. It's unclear how long protection lasts.
	--The vaccine protects against COVID-19 illness, but no one yet knows if it can stop the silent, symptomless spread that accounts for roughly half of all cases. The ongoing study will attempt to answer that but for now, the vaccinated still will need to wear a mask and keep their distance.
	--Expect a sore arm and some flu-like symptoms such as fever, fatigue, headache and chills after the second dose. While uncomfortable, those reactions only last about a day. ""That's just your immune system working. It's a good thing,"" Offit said.
	--Authorities are investigating several allergic reactions reported in Britain by people with a history of severe allergies. Offit said it is routine in the U.S. for the vaccinated to stick around for a half-hour so they could get prompt treatment if such reactions appear.
	If emergency use of Moderna's vaccine also is authorized, the U.S. expects to vaccinate 20 million people by the end of December. They hope to have enough for another 30 million people in January and 50 million in February.
	Getting shots into arms is the big challenge, especially as a new poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found only half of Americans want the vaccine when it's their turn. About a quarter say they won't get it and the rest aren't sure.
	Political interference has complicated health authorities' message that the testing was rigorous and cut no corners.
	President Donald Trump bashed the FDA, again, Friday for taking too long, complaining that the agency ""is still a big, old slow turtle."" One of his deputies even pressed Hahn to clear the shots by the end of the day or face possible firing, two administration officials said.
	The FDA is unique in analyzing drugmakers' raw data, a process that takes longer than many other countries' regulatory reviews. In addition, the FDA insisted that large COVID-19 vaccine studies track at least half the participants for two months to look for side effects, a time period when historically any vaccine problems appear.

	Relatives of a dozen Hong Kong residents who have been detained in mainland China for more than 3 1/2 months made a plea Saturday to be informed of the timing of any trials and whether they can attend.
	The request underscored the sharp contrast between the relatively open legal system in Hong Kong, a semi-autonomous Chinese territory, and that of the mainland, where often little information is divulged until a trial is over.
	""I miss my son so much,"" the mother of Wong Wai-yin, one of the detainees, said, choking up. ""I want to visit him so badly. I haven't seen my son in a very long time -- it's almost four months. Please tell me (about the trial). I'm just an ordinary mother.""
	The 12 were arrested at sea in August while they were apparently making a bid to flee to Taiwan after a tough national security law took effect in Hong Kong earlier this year.
	They were picked up after entering mainland waters for crossing the maritime border without permission. At least some took part in anti-government protests in 2019 and were facing charges in Hong Kong.
	Though Hong Kong is a part of China, travellers must still pass through immigration when going to and from the mainland.
	Two are being held on suspicion of organizing an illegal border crossing. The group has been locked up in Shenzhen, a southern Chinese city that borders Hong Kong.
	The relatives covered their faces with masks, and some wore sunglasses, caps or hoods to hide their identities as they spoke at a news conference. They did not give their names.
	Owen Chow, an activist who has been helping the families, said they wanted to know whether the trials would be open to the public and if family members could attend.
	He and some family members questioned the authenticity of letters some of the latter had received, purportedly from their detained relatives, saying they were being held in a good environment and not abused.
	""The only thing I can do is to have dissatisfaction and be angry,"" said a relative of Tang Kai-yin, another detainee. ""I don't know what else to do."""

	U.S. President-elect Joe Biden pledged Saturday to rejoin the Paris climate accord on the first day of his presidency, as world leaders staged a virtual gathering to celebrate the fifth anniversary of the international pact aimed at curbing global warming.
	Heads of state and government from over 70 countries took part in the event -- hosted by Britain, France, Italy, Chile and the United Nations -- to announce greater efforts in cutting the greenhouse gas emissions that fuel global warming.
	The outgoing administration of U.S. President Donald Trump, who pulled Washington out of the Paris accord, wasn't represented at the online gathering. But in a written statement sent shortly before it began, Biden made clear the U.S. was waiting on the sidelines to join again and noted that Washington was key to negotiating the 2015 agreement, which has since been ratified by almost all countries around the world.Â 
	""The United States will rejoin the Paris Agreement on day one of my presidency,"" he said. ""I'll immediately start working with my counterparts around the world to do all that we possibly can, including by convening the leaders of major economies for a climate summit within my first 100 days in office.""
	Biden reiterated his campaign pledge that his administration will set a target of cutting U.S. emissions to net zero ""no later than 2050.""
	Experts say commitments put forward by the international community in the past five years have already improved the long-term outlook on climate change, making the worst-case scenarios less likely by the end of the century. But wildfires in the Amazon, Australia and America, floods in Bangladesh and East Africa, and record temperatures in the Arctic have highlighted the impact an increase of 1.2 degrees Celsius (2.2 Fahrenheit) since pre-industrial times is already having on the planet.
	""If we don't change course, we may be headed for a catastrophic temperature rise of more than 3 degrees (Celsius) this century,"" UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said, urging world leaders to declare a ""climate emergency.""
	The Paris agreement aims to cap global warming at well under 2 C (3.6 F), ideally no more than 1.5 C (2.7 F), by the end of the century. Meeting the temperature target will require a phasing-out of fossil fuels and better protection for the world's carbon-soaking forests, wetlands and oceans.
	The UN chief called the announced U.S. return to the Paris accord ""a very important signal.""
	""We look forward for a very active U.S. leadership in climate action from now on,"" Guterres said. ""The United States is the largest economy in the world, it's absolutely essential for our goals to be reached.""
	Biden insisted that the dramatic economic shifts needed would be positive for American workers.
	""We have before us an enormous economic opportunity to create jobs and prosperity at home and export clean American-made products around the world, harnessing our climate ambition in a way that is good for American workers and the U.S. economy,"" he said.
	American representatives at the virtual meeting included Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, Gov. Charlie Baker of Massachusetts and U.S. business leaders, such as Apple chief executive Tim Cook.
	Also absent from the event were major economies such as Australia, Brazil, Indonesia, Mexico, Russia and Saudi Arabia. Most have offered no significant improvements on their existing emissions targets lately.
	Environmental campaigners singled out Brazil's recent announcement that it will stick to its target of cutting emissions by 43 per cent over the next decade compared with 2005 levels and aim for net zero by 2060 -- later than most other countries.
	By contrast, an agreement Friday by European Union members to beef up the continent's 2030 targets from 40 per cent to at least 55 per cent compared with 1990 levels was broadly welcomed, though activists said it could have aimed even higher.
	China, the world's biggest emitter, also surprised the world in September by announcing a net zero target of 2060, with emissions peaking by 2030. In his speech Saturday, Chinese President Xi Jinping provided further details on his country's medium-term goal for improving energy efficiency and ramping up electricity generated from renewable sources of power such as wind and solar.
	But Xi also cautioned that ""unilateralism will lead us nowhere"" -- a veiled reference to discussions in the EU to impose tariffs on goods imported from countries that have less stringent emissions standards than the 27-nation bloc. The issue is likely to dominate discussion between China, the EU and the U.S. in coming years.
	The Maldives, an Indian Ocean nation made up of low-lying islands that are particularly vulnerable to sea level rise, announced Saturday that it will now aim to achieve net zero by 2030, one of the most ambitious goals worldwide. Bhutan and Suriname claim to have already achieved that goal.
	The 189 countries that are party to the Paris agreement are required to submit their updated targets to the United Nations by the end of the year. This would normally have occurred at the annual UN climate summit, but the event was postponed for a year because of the pandemic.
	The gathering, now scheduled to take place in Glasgow, Scotland, in November 2021, will see haggling over financial support for poor countries to cope with climate change, and fine-tuning the rules for international markets in emissions trading. Britain, next year's host, announced this month that it's aiming to cut emissions by 68 per cent over the next decade and end state support for fossil fuel industry exports.
	Former UN climate chief Christiana Figueres, who was a key player at the Paris negotiations, said leaders had a duty to be optimistic about their ability to curb global warming.
	""Because if we don't, the alternative is unthinkable,"" she said. ""None of us adults alive today want to have on our shoulders the responsibility of turning over a world that is a world of misery for generations to come.""

              U.S. allows emergency COVID-19 vaccine in bid to end pandemic

              The U.S. gave the final go-ahead Friday to the nation's first COVID-19 vaccine, marking what could be the beginning of the end of an outbreak that has killed nearly 300,000 Americans, according to a person familiar with the decision but not authorized to d...

	The U.S. gave the final go-ahead Friday to the nation's first COVID-19 vaccine, marking what could be the beginning of the end of an outbreak that has killed nearly 300,000 Americans, according to a person familiar with the decision but not authorized to discuss it publicly.
	Shots for health workers and nursing home residents are expected to begin in the coming days after the Food and Drug Administration authorized an emergency rollout of what promises to be a strongly protective vaccine from Pfizer Inc. and its German partner BioNTech.
	Initial doses are scarce and rationed as the U.S. joins Britain and several other countries in scrambling to vaccinate as many people as possible ahead of a long, grim winter. It will take months of work to tamp down the coronavirus that has surged to catastrophic levels in recent weeks and already claimed 1.5 million lives globally.
	While the FDA decision came only after public review of data from a huge ongoing study, it has also been dogged by intense political pressure from the Trump administration, which has accused the agency of being too slow and even threatened to remove FDA chief Stephen Hahn if a ruling did not come Friday.
	The move sets off what will be the largest vaccination campaign in U.S. history -- but it also has global ramifications because it's a role model to many other countries facing the same decision.
	The world desperately needs multiple vaccines for enough to go around, and the Pfizer-BioNTech shot is the first based on rigorous scientific testing to emerge from that worldwide race -- a record-setting scientific achievement that shaved years off the usual process.
	""I don't think you would have found a scientist on this planet that would have predicted this 11 months ago,"" said Dr. Paul Offit, a vaccine expert at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia who advises the FDA.
	The U.S. is considering a second vaccine, made by Moderna Inc., that could roll out in another week. In early January, Johnson & Johnson expects to learn if its vaccine is working in final testing.
	Europe is set to make its own decision on the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna shots later this month, an important step as some other candidates that multiple countries were anxiously awaiting have hit roadblocks. Friday, Sanofi and GSK announced a months-long delay after early tests showed their vaccine didn't work well enough in older adults.
	And China and Russia didn't wait for final-stage tests before beginning vaccinations with some homegrown shots.
	About 3 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine are expected in the first shipments around the country, according to officials with Operation Warp Speed, the Trump administration's vaccine development program. A similar amount is to be held in reserve for those recipients' second dose.
	A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advisory committee is poised to recommend who's first in line. Expected to follow health workers and nursing homes are other essential workers, older adults and people at high risk because of other health problems. U.S. authorities don't expect enough for the general population before spring, and that's assuming there are no manufacturing glitches.
	In a still unfinished study of nearly 44,000 people, the FDA found the vaccine was safe and more than 90% effective across recipients of different ages, including older adults, races and those with health problems that put them at high risk from the coronavirus.
	Emergency use means the vaccine still is experimental. Most important for would-be recipients to know:
	--Some protection begins after the first dose, but it takes a second dose three weeks later for full protection. It's unclear how long protection lasts.
	--The vaccine protects against COVID-19 illness, but no one yet knows if it can stop the silent, symptomless spread that accounts for roughly half of all cases. The ongoing study will attempt to answer that but for now, the vaccinated still will need to wear a mask and keep their distance.
	--Expect a sore arm and some flu-like symptoms such as fever, fatigue, headache and chills after the second dose. While uncomfortable, those reactions only last about a day. ""That's just your immune system working. It's a good thing,"" Offit said.
	--Authorities are investigating several allergic reactions reported in Britain by people with a history of severe allergies. Offit said it is routine in the U.S. for the vaccinated to stick around for a half-hour so they could get prompt treatment if such reactions appear.
	If emergency use of Moderna's vaccine also is authorized, the U.S. expects to vaccinate 20 million people by the end of December. They hope to have enough for another 30 million people in January and 50 million in February.
	Getting shots into arms is the big challenge, especially as a new poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found only half of Americans want the vaccine when it's their turn. About a quarter say they won't get it and the rest aren't sure.
	Political interference has complicated health authorities' message that the testing was rigorous and cut no corners.
	President Donald Trump bashed the FDA, again, Friday for taking too long, complaining that the agency ""is still a big, old slow turtle."" One of his deputies even pressed Hahn to clear the shots by the end of the day or face possible firing, two administration officials said.
	The FDA is unique in analyzing drugmakers' raw data, a process that takes longer than many other countries' regulatory reviews. In addition, the FDA insisted that large COVID-19 vaccine studies track at least half the participants for two months to look for side effects, a time period when historically any vaccine problems appear.

	Canada is no longer training with the Chinese military, the Minister of National Defence Harjit Sajjan told the House of Commons on Thursday, after Conservative defence critic James Bezan questioned why Prime Minister Justin Trudeau would maintain such relations with China.
	The issue came to a head following a report by the Globe and Mail that top officials at Global Affairs, concerned the Chinese government would view it as a retaliatory move over its detention of Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, was âalarmedâ that General Jonathan Vance cancelled winter military exercises with the Peopleâs Liberation Army in 2019 at CFB Petawawa.
	The news comes as Kovrig and Spavor marked their second anniversary in Chinese prison on what Canada and its Western allies say are unfounded espionage charges that followed Canadaâs arrest of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou on a U.S. extradition warrant in December 2018.
	âOur government always stands up for Canadians at home and abroad and this includes our relationship with China. But let me be very clear, we do not train with Chinese military,â said Minister Sajjan, adding that this initiative was originally put in place by the Conservative government under Stephen Harper.
	âIt was the previous government that actually signed a co-operation plan initiative in 2013 under Rob Nicholson, when he was the Minister of National Defence â¦ because of the agreement they had signed, this is one of the reasons why we actually changed our approach because of the concerns the member outlined,â Sajjan said.
	Bezan, who served as Parliamentary Secretary of National Defence under Nicholson at the time, said Canada was engaging in âhostage diplomacyâ and that the Chinese government back then âis completely different to the Chinese government today.â
	Conservative leader Erin OâToole called the joint training exercise a âdangerous path for the Trudeau government to take"" and called Canada's dealings with China a ""dangerously naive approach [that] has put Canada and our citizens at risk.â
	The Canadian Armed Forces have participated in various joint and regional military exercises for decades with some two dozen Pacific Rim countries. Specifically, Canada advanced its bilateral defence relationship with China through talks between senior military officials on both sides in March 2012 and June 2013. The Cooperation Plan Initiative, which would guide defence-related activities, was signed in Ottawa in August 2013.
	Chinaâs President Xi Jinping, who came into power in March 2013, has tightened his control over the country in recent years through mass detention and surveillance of its Muslim population in Xinjiang, a crackdown on activism, heavy Internet censorship, consolidation of power and removal of presidential term limits. He has also taken a more assertive and harder-line approach to foreign affairs and defending Chinaâs interests.
	Mengâs arrest, and the subsequent arrest of Kovrig and Spavor shortly after, soured relations between Canada and China. Trudeau has spoken to U.S. president-elect Joe Biden about the situation, but has not said whether Biden might revisit the Justice Departmentâs efforts to extradite Meng. Should the U.S. withdraw its charges against Meng, it could give China a reason to release Kovrig and Spavor.
	âWe will always stand up for Canadians who are arbitrarily detained. This is one of the reasons why we actually stopped our training with the Chinese,â Sajjan said.

              Olympics on tight timeline to chart new path on protest
          
","
              For generations, the IOC knew exactly where to look for key support of its ban against protests at the Olympics. This week, the American federation put the IOC on notice: It is no longer the IOC's partner when it comes to enforcing the contentious Rule 50.
        ","
                  Friday, Dec. 11, 2020
                ",https://www.ctvnews.ca/sports/olympics-on-tight-timeline-to-chart-new-path-on-protest-1.5227276,"
	For generations, the IOC knew exactly where to look for key support of its ban against protests at the Olympics.
	In 1968, it was the U.S. Olympic Committee that sent home its own athletes, Tommie Smith and John Carlos, when they raised their fists while on the medals stand at the Mexico City Games.
	In 2019, it was the same organization that placed its own athlete, Gwen Berry, on probation for doing the same after her win at the Pan-Am Games.
	This week, the American federation put the IOC on notice: It is no longer the IOC's partner when it comes to enforcing the contentious Rule 50. The USOPC is now heeding the calls from many of its own athletes and will no longer punish them for kneeling or raising fists or any other kind of acceptable demonstration at the Olympics.
	âWhen you sit in my seat, you have to make decisions that you think are on the right side of history,â said CEO Sarah Hirshland. âAnd I believe we're on the right side of history.â
	But there are details to iron out, and they strike to the heart of how much change is truly possible between now and next July, when the Tokyo Olympics are scheduled to take place.
	High on the list: What can athletes demonstrate about, and what will an acceptable demonstration look like?
	âThat becomes a difficult situation,â said Harry Edwards, the activist who helped brainstorm the gestures by Smith and Carlos 52 years ago. âBecause you could very easily get into a thing of trying to outdo someone else and it ends up having nothing to do with the spirit of the issue.â
	That confusion helps explain the calculated response to the USOPC that came from the IOC in the form of a short release from the head of its athlete commission, swimmer Kirsty Coventry of Zimbabwe.
	Well aware that the protest rule can't stay as-is for the foreseeable future, Coventry and the IOC are in the process of surveying athletes across the globe for their thoughts about possible changes. She said the majority of the respondents believe in the right of free speech, which is ârespectedâ at the Olympic Games (but only in certain settings) and âexpress support for preserving the ceremonies, the podium and the field of play.â
	Though Coventry's committee is still accepting feedback, and won't make any final decisions until early next year, she's previewing a far less radical adjustment to Rule 50 than the U.S. contingent would like.
	American athletes have been reeling from a summer of unrest over police violence against Black people in the United States. Every major sports league has agreed to change policies to give their players a bigger platform to discuss race and social injustice.
	But U.S. sports leagues and the Olympics are very different creatures. The Olympics are a behemoth that counts America as only one of 206 countries who are members.
	Some of the biggest members are among the IOC's most important partners - China, for instance, hosted the 2008 Olympics and will do so again in 2022 - and they don't share the same concerns or values about free speech or racial injustice as do the United States and many of its closest allies.
	âMany have also recognized the practical question of how to choose between the opinions of hundreds of issues from different angles across the world,â Coventry said of her survey respondents. âWe can see that it would be very difficult to make such a judgment without dividing the athlete community across all 206 NOCs.â
	Moushaumi Robinson, who led the U.S. athletes group that pressed for the changes, said she understands the complexities. Her group continues to discuss them to try to come up with solutions.
	âA lot of us just want to be able to say `I may not agree with you but I respect that you have a voice,â' she said. âAnd we want to be able to express it without someone punishing you for it.â
	All of which leads Edwards to believe that Thursday's move by the USOPC and its athletes is a sign of progress - not necessarily a huge leap but another step.
	âThis is an ongoing struggle, and it's going to continue to be a struggle,â he said. âAnd what today reflects is that this generation of athletes is more than willing to do their part.â"

              Diverse TV holiday season includes all-Asian Lifetime movie
          
","
              In one scene from the Lifetime TV movie, âA Sugar & Spice Holiday,â a co-worker says to Suzy, an Asian American architect in Los Angeles: âI didn't know if Christmas was a big deal where you're from.â

                  Friday, Dec. 11, 2020
                ",https://www.ctvnews.ca/entertainment/diverse-tv-holiday-season-includes-all-asian-lifetime-movie-1.5227204,"
	In one scene from the Lifetime TV movie, âA Sugar & Spice Holiday,â a co-worker says to Suzy, an Asian American architect in Los Angeles: âI didn't know if Christmas was a big deal where you're from.â
	Retorts Suzy: âI'm from Maine.â
	A lot of viewers of a cozy Christmas film might just shrug off the insinuation that Suzy is somehow not American. But for an Asian audience, that brief exchange is a knowing reminder that microaggressions don't take a holiday. They especially haven't in the wake of the pandemic, which has triggered anti-Asian racism and terms like âChinese virusâ and âkung flu.â
	âI think it's great timing for us for this movie to be coming out now during the pandemic with the perception of the Asian culture and the `flu' and all,â Canadian actor Jacky Lai, who plays Suzy, told The Associated Press. âI really do hope that this (movie) - with our faces - is able to hopefully be welcomed by people into their homes and see us as just your American/Canadian friends.â
	âA Sugar & Spice Holiday,â premiering Sunday, may be the first feel-good TV Christmas flick to feature a mostly Asian ensemble. It's one of several projects where cable channels are demonstrating a desire for inclusion this yuletide season. The shift comes a year after the Hallmark Channel dropped an ad that included a same-sex couple. The fallout pointed to an overall diversity problem in the genre with not just the LGBTQ community, but communities of colour. Recent months of racial unrest only added to the conversation within the entertainment industry about representation.
	Tia Maggini, vice-president of Lifetime Original Movies, says it was a coincidence that screenwriter Eirene Donohue, who is Asian American and had worked with the them before, came to them with the story pitch.
	âIt was exciting to be presented with this particular point of view that has been long overdue for the Christmas movie genre,â Maggini said in a statement. Most important: The movie itself was actually funny and âfull of Christmas heart.â
	Indeed, the rom-com has all the warm, familiar holiday movie tropes. Suzy returns to the small town where she grew up for Christmas, is persuaded to revive her baking skills for a local gingerbread house competition and is assisted by her former high school crush (Tony Giroux).
	Her father is played by veteran actor Tzi Ma. Despite a year filled with high profile film roles in âThe Farewellâ and âMulan,â Ma didn't hesitate to join a Lifetime movie.
	âIt was the first time a Chinese American family was featured on a Christmas story,â Ma said in an email. âLifetime has a tremendous Asian American following. It's a way to say thank you to them.â
	In Hollywood, it can often feel like studios only cast Asians in narratives where there's some kind of hardship or East-meets-West struggle. And with TV holiday movies, they're almost nonexistent. Meanwhile, there are white actors who have made a baker's dozen of them. Like any other group, Giroux says, Asians deserve to see themselves in lighthearted fare regularly.
	âI think it's so important to have all sorts of stories with any culture - for them to have exposure to the stories of struggle but it's such a delight to see something lighter, to see aspects of culture that aren't surrounded with times of difficulty,â Giroux says.
	Giroux, who is Canadian, is also looking forward to queuing up a movie where his grandparents can see themselves.
	âI'm really excited for them to see a story that covers part of their story. My grandparents immigrated here from China from in the `50s,â Giroux says. âThat's why being part of this project is telling a story that I'm really a part of.â
	Lai grew up loving romantic comedies. She remembers unexpectedly getting emotional watching âCrazy Rich Asians,â the first major Hollywood studio film with an all-Asian cast in 25 years.
	âYou hear people say there hasn't been a movie like this in 25 years. You hear those things. But it's not until I sat in the theatre and watched someone who looked like me on screen who wasn't a ninja or a nerd but someone just like me. I remember the way it felt,â Lai says. âI am so excited that there's another movie like that and hopefully we bring joy and open some minds with this movie and more opportunities.â
	The movie is lovingly sprinkled with Chinese American nuances on script and screen. These include a photo of Suzy's deceased grandma flanked by incense sticks and the entire family eating with chopsticks. And it is definitely the only Christmas movie to feature both gingerbread and stinky tofu, a beloved Chinese dish known for its pungent smell.
	âI love that we were able to kind of include a lot of nice details. ... It's really a romantic comedy where the characters happen to be Asian American,â says Jennifer Liao, the director. âIt's nice to make an Asian American movie that's not necessarily completely frontloaded with having to carry the weight of cultural identity issues and things like that.â
	âSugar & Spiceâ is not the only holiday movie expanding the definition of who can lead these kinds of flicks. A handful of networks, including Lifetime and Hallmark, have a Christmas-themed movie on their slate featuring a same-sex pairing. Tony winner Ali Stroker, who uses a wheelchair, stars in Lifetime's âChristmas Ever After.â
	Does Liao feel pressure as âthe firstâ even on such an innocuous project to bring in a sizeable audience? âI feel like the pressure is more to deliver something that I and everybody else worked on can be proud of. That was really no. 1,â Liao says.
	Lai doesn't see the point of getting caught up in things like ratings.
	âI think that it is really, really nice to hear when someone says `I got to see someone who looks like me on screen.' That will never get old,â Lai says. âWe get more responses like that - for me, the movie did its purpose.â

	India on Friday rejected a Chinese allegation that it is responsible for high tensions along their disputed border.
	Indian External Affairs Ministry spokesman Anurag Srivastava said the six-month standoff between the two countries' armies ""has been a result of the actions of the Chinese side, which has sought to effect a unilateral change in the status along the Line of Actual Control in Eastern Ladakh.""
	Srivastava was responding to a statement by Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying in Beijing on Thursday that ""the rights and wrongs of what has happened in the China-India border area are very clear and the responsibility lies squarely with the Indian side.""
	Hua also said that China is firmly committed to safeguarding its sovereignty. ""We hope that India will work with China in the same direction and do more things conducive to solidarity, co-operation and common development,"" she said.
	The standoff between the Asian giants erupted into a fierce brawl in May and worsened into hand-to-hand combat on June 15 with soldiers using clubs, stones and fists, leaving 20 Indian troops dead. China is believed to also have suffered casualties, but has not given any details.
	The countries have held a series of talks on ending the standoff without any breakthrough."
