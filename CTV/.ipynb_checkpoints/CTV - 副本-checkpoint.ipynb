      "              In one scene from the Lifetime TV movie, “A Sugar & Spice Holiday,” a co-worker says to Suzy, an Asian American architect in Los Angeles: “I didn't know if Christmas was a big deal where you're from.”\n",

      "CONTENT : \n",
      "\tIn one scene from the Lifetime TV movie, “A Sugar & Spice Holiday,” a co-worker says to Suzy, an Asian American architect in Los Angeles: “I didn't know if Christmas was a big deal where you're from.”\n",
      "\tRetorts Suzy: “I'm from Maine.”\n",
      "\tA lot of viewers of a cozy Christmas film might just shrug off the insinuation that Suzy is somehow not American. But for an Asian audience, that brief exchange is a knowing reminder that microaggressions don't take a holiday. They especially haven't in the wake of the pandemic, which has triggered anti-Asian racism and terms like “Chinese virus” and “kung flu.”\n",
      "\t“I think it's great timing for us for this movie to be coming out now during the pandemic with the perception of the Asian culture and the `flu' and all,” Canadian actor Jacky Lai, who plays Suzy, told The Associated Press. “I really do hope that this (movie) - with our faces - is able to hopefully be welcomed by people into their homes and see us as just your American/Canadian friends.”\n",
      "\t“A Sugar & Spice Holiday,” premiering Sunday, may be the first feel-good TV Christmas flick to feature a mostly Asian ensemble. It's one of several projects where cable channels are demonstrating a desire for inclusion this yuletide season. The shift comes a year after the Hallmark Channel dropped an ad that included a same-sex couple. The fallout pointed to an overall diversity problem in the genre with not just the LGBTQ community, but communities of colour. Recent months of racial unrest only added to the conversation within the entertainment industry about representation.\n",
      "\tTia Maggini, vice-president of Lifetime Original Movies, says it was a coincidence that screenwriter Eirene Donohue, who is Asian American and had worked with the them before, came to them with the story pitch.\n",
      "\t“It was exciting to be presented with this particular point of view that has been long overdue for the Christmas movie genre,” Maggini said in a statement. Most important: The movie itself was actually funny and “full of Christmas heart.”\n",
      "\tIndeed, the rom-com has all the warm, familiar holiday movie tropes. Suzy returns to the small town where she grew up for Christmas, is persuaded to revive her baking skills for a local gingerbread house competition and is assisted by her former high school crush (Tony Giroux).\n",
      "\tHer father is played by veteran actor Tzi Ma. Despite a year filled with high profile film roles in “The Farewell” and “Mulan,” Ma didn't hesitate to join a Lifetime movie.\n",
      "\t“It was the first time a Chinese American family was featured on a Christmas story,” Ma said in an email. “Lifetime has a tremendous Asian American following. It's a way to say thank you to them.”\n",
      "\tIn Hollywood, it can often feel like studios only cast Asians in narratives where there's some kind of hardship or East-meets-West struggle. And with TV holiday movies, they're almost nonexistent. Meanwhile, there are white actors who have made a baker's dozen of them. Like any other group, Giroux says, Asians deserve to see themselves in lighthearted fare regularly.\n",
      "\t“I think it's so important to have all sorts of stories with any culture - for them to have exposure to the stories of struggle but it's such a delight to see something lighter, to see aspects of culture that aren't surrounded with times of difficulty,” Giroux says.\n",
      "\tGiroux, who is Canadian, is also looking forward to queuing up a movie where his grandparents can see themselves.\n",
      "\t“I'm really excited for them to see a story that covers part of their story. My grandparents immigrated here from China from in the `50s,” Giroux says. “That's why being part of this project is telling a story that I'm really a part of.”\n",
      "\tLai grew up loving romantic comedies. She remembers unexpectedly getting emotional watching “Crazy Rich Asians,” the first major Hollywood studio film with an all-Asian cast in 25 years.\n",
      "\t“You hear people say there hasn't been a movie like this in 25 years. You hear those things. But it's not until I sat in the theatre and watched someone who looked like me on screen who wasn't a ninja or a nerd but someone just like me. I remember the way it felt,” Lai says. ”I am so excited that there's another movie like that and hopefully we bring joy and open some minds with this movie and more opportunities.“\n",
      "\tThe movie is lovingly sprinkled with Chinese American nuances on script and screen. These include a photo of Suzy's deceased grandma flanked by incense sticks and the entire family eating with chopsticks. And it is definitely the only Christmas movie to feature both gingerbread and stinky tofu, a beloved Chinese dish known for its pungent smell.\n",
      "\t“I love that we were able to kind of include a lot of nice details. ... It's really a romantic comedy where the characters happen to be Asian American,” says Jennifer Liao, the director. “It's nice to make an Asian American movie that's not necessarily completely frontloaded with having to carry the weight of cultural identity issues and things like that.”\n",
      "\t“Sugar & Spice” is not the only holiday movie expanding the definition of who can lead these kinds of flicks. A handful of networks, including Lifetime and Hallmark, have a Christmas-themed movie on their slate featuring a same-sex pairing. Tony winner Ali Stroker, who uses a wheelchair, stars in Lifetime's “Christmas Ever After.”\n",
      "\tDoes Liao feel pressure as “the first” even on such an innocuous project to bring in a sizeable audience? “I feel like the pressure is more to deliver something that I and everybody else worked on can be proud of. That was really no. 1,” Liao says.\n",
      "\tLai doesn't see the point of getting caught up in things like ratings.\n",
      "\t“I think that it is really, really nice to hear when someone says `I got to see someone who looks like me on screen.' That will never get old,” Lai says. “We get more responses like that - for me, the movie did its purpose.”\n",

      "\tHua also said that China is firmly committed to safeguarding its sovereignty. \"We hope that India will work with China in the same direction and do more things conducive to solidarity, co-operation and common development,\" she said.\n",
      "\tThe standoff between the Asian giants erupted into a fierce brawl in May and worsened into hand-to-hand combat on June 15 with soldiers using clubs, stones and fists, leaving 20 Indian troops dead. China is believed to also have suffered casualties, but has not given any details.\n",

      "\tBloomberg reported that Chinese citizen Haze Fan was seen being taken from her apartment building accompanied by security officers in plain clothes at about noon on Monday, shortly after her last contact with her editors.\n",
      "\tIt quoted a Chinese government statement as saying Fan was detained by the Beijing branch of the National Security Bureau \"according to relevant Chinese law on suspicion of engaging in criminal activities that jeopardize national security.\"\n",
      "\tChina permits Chinese citizens to work only as translators, researchers and assistants for foreign news organizations, not as registered journalists able to report independently. China's own media are almost entirely state owned and tightly controlled, and the country has long been one of the leading jailers of journalists.\n",
      "\tBloomberg said it has been seeking information about Fan's whereabouts from the Chinese government and from China's embassy in Washington, D.C.\n",
      "\tIt said its parent company, Bloomberg LP, was informed Thursday that she was being held on suspicion of endangering national security, a vaguely defined charge that can lead to lengthy detention with little recourse to legal assistance.\n",
      "\t\"We are very concerned for her, and have been actively speaking to Chinese authorities to better understand the situation. We are continuing to do everything we can to support her while we seek more information,\" a Bloomberg spokesperson was quoted as saying in the report.\n",
      "\tFan began working for Bloomberg in 2017 after stints with a number of other foreign news organizations in China, the company said.\n",
      "\tChina has detained news assistants in the past over reports that angered the ruling Communist Party, and authorities have also sought to punish foreign media more generally by limiting their operations, expelling journalists or issuing them only short-term visas.\n",
      "\tChina this year expelled journalists from The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal and other American outlets amid complaints over content and moves by the U.S. to send home dozens of Chinese journalists working for state media.\n",

Between June 2017 and December 2018, he allegedly financed a nationwide ring of people who purchased turtles in the U.S. belonging to five protected species, and arranged for them to be illegally shipped to Hong Kong.\n",
      "\t\"The turtles were inhumanely bound with duct tape and placed in socks so as not to alert customs authorities,\" the DOJ statement said.\n",

      "\tThese sellers allegedly shipped the turtles to \"middlemen\" who were \"typically Chinese citizens who entered the country on student visas,\" according to the DOJ. Kang allegedly paid and instructed them to repackage the turtles, and use false labels for shipment to Hong Kong.\n",
      "\tOnce in Hong Kong, the turtles were allegedly sold on the black market for thousands of dollars each.\n",
      "\tKang allegedly did not declare the turtles to U.S. or Chinese customs, or obtain required permits from the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES).\n",

      "\tThe island nation of Bahrain, off the coast of Saudi Arabia, made the vaccine pledge in an announcement published late Thursday by its state-run Bahrain News Agency.\n",
      "\t\"A safe vaccine will be provided free of charge to all citizens and residents within the kingdom,\" the statement said, without elaborating on which vaccine it would offer.\n",
      "\tBahrain plans to inoculate everyone 18 years and older in the kingdom at 27 different medical facilities, hoping to be able to vaccinate 10,000 people a day. Bahrain, an island in the Persian Gulf home to the U.S. Navy's 5th Fleet, has a population of around 1.5 million people.\n",
      "\tA week ago, Bahrain said it had become the second nation in the world to grant an emergency-use authorization to the Pfizer vaccine after the United Kingdom.\n",
      "\tThe Pfizer shots, a so-called \"mRNA vaccine,\" contain a piece of genetic code that trains the immune system to recognize the spiked protein on the surface of the virus. To be vaccinated, a person receives two shots over 21 days.\n",
      "\tIn the time since, Bahrain has not responded to questions from The Associated Press, including on Friday. Pfizer told the AP that the details of its sales agreement with Bahrain, including the \"timing of delivery and the volume of doses,\" were confidential and declined to comment.\n",
      "\tBahrain had already granted emergency-use authorization for a Chinese vaccine made by Sinopharm and has inoculated some 6,000 people with it. That vaccine is an \"inactivated\" shot made by growing the whole virus in a lab and then killing it.\n",
      "\tThe United Arab Emirates on Wednesday described the Sinopharm vaccine as 86 per cent effective, but provided few details and answered no questions. It marked the first public release of information on the efficacy of that shot.\n",
      "\tEarlier Thursday, Saudi Arabia's Food and Drug Authority said it had registered the Pfizer vaccine \"so that health authorities in the kingdom can then import and use the vaccine.\"\n",
      "\tThe kingdom said it based its decision on information given by Pfizer on Nov. 24, without elaborating. Pfizer on Nov. 18 said its vaccine is 95 per cent effective.\n",
      "\tA major challenge for the Pfizer shot in the Mideast remains the weather, however. The vaccines must be stored and shipped at ultra-cold temperatures of around minus 70 degrees Celsius (minus 94 degrees Fahrenheit).\n",
      "\tSaudi Arabia said its Health Ministry later would announce plans on how it would distribute the vaccine in the kingdom, the biggest Gulf Arab state, with a population of 34 million people.\n",
      "\tEgypt received its first shipment of the Sinopharm vaccine on Thursday via the United Arab Emirates.\n",

      "CONTENT : WILMINGTON, DEL. -- \n",
      "\tU.S. President-elect Joe Biden's historically challenging transition to power is suddenly becoming even more complicated.\n",
      "\tA federal investigation into the finances of Biden's son Hunter threatens to embolden congressional Republicans, who have already shown little willingness to work with the incoming president or even acknowledge his clear victory in last month's election. For sure, it will complicate Senate confirmation hearings for Biden's yet-to-be-named attorney general, who could ultimately have oversight of the investigation into the new president's son.\n",
      "\tIt all raises the prospect of even deeper dysfunction in a capital that is already struggling to address the nation's most pressing crises, including a surging pandemic whose daily death tolls are beginning to surpass the devastation of the Sept. 11 attacks. Republicans, particularly those eyeing presidential runs in 2024, are making clear they will press Biden on the issue.\n",
      "\t\"Joe Biden needs to pledge today that he will co-operate with the federal investigation and answer any questions under oath,\" Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., said Thursday, \"and that if he is sworn in as president, no federal investigator or attorney working on the Hunter Biden criminal case will be removed.\"\n",
      "\tHunter Biden has long been a source of worry for his father's campaign and was the subject of repeated unsupported accusations by President Donald Trump and his allies. But news of the probe, which was revealed on Wednesday and scrutinizes some of Hunter Biden's Chinese business dealings and other transactions, caught most of his father's staffers by surprise.\n",
      "\tThe president-elect had no public appearance Thursday as he moved forward with filling out his administration. But the investigation threatens to destabilize a transition that has prioritized a methodical rollout of Cabinet selections, White House hires and policy goals -- all meant to guarantee momentum when Biden takes office and immediately has to grapple with a surging pandemic and shaky economy.\n",
      "\tMost notably, the probe casts a spotlight on one of Biden's most important choices: his attorney general.\n",
      "\tAlabama Sen. Doug Jones and federal appeals court judge Merrick Garland have emerged as the leading contenders, three people familiar with the matter told The Associated Press this week. But dynamics could shift, as any Biden choice now will be scrutinized for any perceived loyalty to the president-elect and bias in any probe of his son.\n",
      "\tBoth Garland and especially Jones have longtime ties to Biden.\n",
      "\tThe president-elect himself is not a subject of the investigation. And Biden aides believe that because other Hunter Biden stories have blown over, this will, too. They note that a tax fraud investigation pales in comparison to Trump's refusal to concede the election or to the pandemic that has killed more than 290,000 Americans.\n",
      "\tBiden is expected to announce more Cabinet picks, but not attorney general, on Friday.\n",
      "\tTrump's initial public response was surprisingly muted, just a pair of tweets about a Fox News segment on the story Wednesday night. But privately, he demanded to know why the investigation was not revealed ahead of Election Day, accusing officials of deliberately stalling in order to help Biden's chances, according to two Republicans familiar with the conversations but not authorized to discuss them publicly.\n",
      "\tOther Republicans, including possible presidential contenders, were anything but shy in piling on.\n",
      "\t\"If there were ever circumstances that created a conflict of interest and called for a special counsel, I think those circumstances are present here,\" Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas said Thursday. \"The Biden family has been trading on Joe Biden's public office for 50 years. Do we really think that that will change if Joe Biden becomes president, the highest office in the land?\"\n",
      "\tSome of Trump's children have also faced some legal questions.\n",
      "\tDonald Trump Jr. was scrutinized in special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia probe for the 2016 meeting he had with a Kremlin-connected lawyer. And Ivanka Trump was recently deposed by investigators from the District of Columbia attorney general's office as part of its lawsuit alleging the misuse of inaugural funds.\n",
      "\tThe Hunter Biden investigation is the latest in a series of politically charged inquiries that the Justice Department has grappled with in the past five years, following probes into Hillary Clinton's email use and the Trump campaign's ties to Russia.\n",
      "\tRegardless of the facts of the investigation, a new Justice Department will likely feel compelled to assert its independence from the White House following allegations that its actions were overly politicized during the Trump administration. Biden has said he will play no role in department investigative decisions.\n",
      "\t\"There are plenty of people that are going to have their hands in this one, but I think it's really going to be driven by the new administration's push to have total independence on any investigation,\" said former Justice Department prosecutor Michael Weinstein, a New Jersey defence lawyer.\n",
      "\t\"I think that's going to be paramount,\" he added. \"They are going to bend over backwards to make sure that they do the contrary to the current administration -- which is independence, let the investigation takes its course.\"\n",
      "\tIn this case, though, there is no perfect outcome for Biden.\n",
      "\tA protracted criminal investigation that results in an indictment would be a major distraction and then some as the new president tries to implement his agenda. But if the Justice Department decides against bringing charges, officials will feel pressure to explain their steps and reassure the American public the inquiry was done in a competent and thorough way.\n",
      "\tFederal investigators served a round of subpoenas on Tuesday, including to Hunter Biden, according to a person familiar with the investigation who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss an ongoing probe.\n",
      "\tThe federal investigation, centring on potential tax crimes, had been going on at least a year before Biden announced his candidacy. Investigators did not reach out in the weeks prior to voting because of a department policy surrounding elections that prohibits overt investigative acts.\n",
      "\tBiden, fiercely protective of his own family, was said to be, in a statement released by his transition, \"deeply proud of his son, who has fought through difficult challenges, including the vicious personal attacks of recent months, only to emerge stronger.\"\n",
      "\tBiden struck a similarly defiant tone throughout the campaign whenever questions emerged about his son, which they frequently did. When Trump assailed Hunter Biden as a drug user during the first presidential debate in Cleveland, his father acknowledged that Hunter had had past substance abuse issues but added, \"He's worked on it. I'm proud of him. I'm proud of my son.\"\n",
      "\tThe spotlight on Hunter Biden intensified in the election's final weeks, after Trump and his attorney Rudy Giuliani pushed unsubstantiated claims about his foreign business dealings. Those were based in part on New York Post reporting on a laptop that supposedly once belonged to Hunter Biden and was abandoned at a Delaware repair shop.\n",
      "\tHunter Biden had joined the board of Ukrainian gas company Burisma in 2014, around the time his father, then the vice-president, was helping conduct Obama administration foreign policy with Ukraine. But, in a subsequent report, Senate Republicans did not produce any evidence that the hiring influenced U.S. policies.\n",
      "\tJoe Biden largely refused to even acknowledge the laptop controversy. His son, meanwhile, kept almost completely out of the public eye during the nearly 18 months his father was running for president.\n",
      "\tOne of the few times he was seen was on stage outside the convention centre in Wilmington, Delaware, as his father was surrounded by joyous family members following his speech declaring victory in the presidential election. Hunter Biden, and his baby son, were right in the middle.\n",

      "\tOn the grim two-year anniversary of Michael Kovrig’s imprisonment in China, his wife says she worries most about the state of his mental health heading into yet another holiday season alone.\n",
      "\t\"Here we are, two years later, still speaking about him being in detention. None of us would have imagined this was going to be the case,\" said Vina Nadjibulla in an interview on CTV’s Power Play on Thursday.\n",
      "\t\"I hoped sincerely that Michael would be home by now and instead he’s facing a prospect of his third Christmas alone, in isolation, in detention.\"\n",
      "\tKovrig, a former diplomat, and fellow Canadian Michael Spavor were arrested in China on Dec. 10, 2018, and charged with allegations of state spying for Canada. The Canadian government calls their detention arbitrary, while most in the diplomatic community view it as retaliation for the arrest of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou days prior in Vancouver on a U.S. extradition request.\n",
      "\tConsular access has been limited throughout the pandemic; the two men went 10 months without communication with Canadian representatives.\n",
      "\t\"Our contact has been very limited between January and October. There were no consular visits, there were very few letters from Michael. Finally, in October we were able to get a consular visit and at least confirmation and a reassurance that he is still healthy and is doing well,\" said Nadjibulla, who is married to Kovrig but separated.\n",
      "\tCanada’s Ambassador to China Dominic Barton who is leading the effort to secure Kovrig and Spavor’s release, told a House of Commons committee this week that the two men looked \"robust\" and that one \"would be very impressed by seeing both of them.\"\n",
      "\tNadjibulla called that long-awaited visit this fall a \"huge relief\" but notes she remains deeply concerned about his mental health.\n",
      "\t\"Michael is doing everything he possibly can to keep his mind occupied with positive thoughts, with virtuous thoughts, with prayers of gratitude, with philosophical passages. Reading really provides him solace day-to-day, he essentially says that is what gets him through moment-to-moment, is being able to read and have access to books, which we’ve been advocating for quite a bit,\" said Nadjibulla.\n",
      "\tThe Liberal government remains adamant it’s doing all it can to free the men, despite opposition criticism that Ottawa has been \"kowtowing\" to China over the last several years.\n",
      "\t\"Today is the sad anniversary of the illegal abduction and imprisonment of two innocent Canadians in China,\" said Conservative Leader Erin O’Toole during a press conference on Thursday.\n",
      "\t\"For months China has unfairly targeted our farming exports. For years, the Chinese Communist Party has been carrying out mass internment of the Uighurs in concentration camps and still the Liberals keep pushing for more involvement and more engagement with China.\"\n",
      "\tOptimism sparked last week when the Wall Street Journal reported the U.S. Justice Department was in talks with Meng’s legal team to resolve her fraud charges and allow her to return home should she admit to criminal wrongdoing. It led to speculation that the arrangement could pave a way for Kovrig and Spavor’s freedom.\n",
      "\tNadjibulla says, more broadly, she was left hopeful after hearing that during the first call between Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and U.S. President-Elect Joe Biden the leaders discussed the fate of the two men.\n",
      "\t\"I pray that we will be seeing the light at the end of the tunnel,\" she said.\n",

      "\tPoliticians from various Western countries have asked consumers to buy Australian wine in order to fight back against China's punitive tariffs on the beverage.\n",
      "\tChina is the most important export market for Australian wine, and winemakers are scrambling to find new markets following Beijing's decision to slap tariffs of up to 212% on Australian wine imports amid an escalating trade war between the two nations.\n",
      "\tNow a number of public figures associated with the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China (IPAC), which calls itself \"an international cross-party group of legislators working to reform the approach of democratic countries to China,\" have called on consumers to stand up to Beijing.\n",
      "\t\"We are asking you all to join us in standing against Xi Jinping's authoritarian bullying,\" said Miriam Lexmann, a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) representing the Christian Democrats, in a video posted on Twitter on Tuesday.\n",
      "\t\"By drinking a bottle or two of Australian wine and letting the Chinese Communist Party know that we will not be bullied,\" added Elisabet Lann, a municipal councilor from Sweden's Christian Democrats.\n",
      "\tOther politicians featured in the video include Australian MP Kimberley Kitching, US Senator Ted Yoho and Shiori Yamao, an independent member of Japan's House of Representatives.\n",
      "\tTony Battaglene, CEO of Australian Grape and Wine, a national association, said Beijing's tariffs have endangered business with mainland China.\n",

      "\t\"We were surprised, we were shocked,\" Battaglene told CNN Business. \"Having the extent of these interim tariffs, I mean essentially they will close the market to Australian bottled wine, to premium wine, in China. There's no way that we can compete at those levels.\"\n",

      "\tThe wine war is taking place against the backdrop of a wider deterioration in relations. Australia has upset China this year by calling for an investigation into the origins of the coronavirus pandemic. Beijing later targeted Canberra over trade, namely by suspending some imports of beef and slapping heavy tariffs on barley.\n",

      "\tIn his darkest moments, Michael Kovrig draws strength from knowing that his fellow Canadians and people around the world are working to free him and Michael Spavor from their respective Chinese prison cells.\n",
      "\tAs much as that matters, Kovrig's wife Vina Nadjibulla says he is also subjecting himself to a strict regimen to strengthen his mind and body because he views that as the key to his survival.\n",
      "\tShe says that not only is Kovrig determined to survive his ordeal, he wants to reclaim his freedom better and stronger than when he lost it.\n",
      "\tKovrig and Spavor are marking two years in separate Chinese prisons, on what Canada and dozens of its Western allies say are trumped-up espionage charges in retaliation for the RCMP's December 2018 arrest of Chinese high-tech executive Meng Wanzhou on a U.S. extradition warrant.\n",
      "\tCanada's ambassador to China, Dominic Barton, one of the few outsiders to see them, said this week Kovrig and Spavor are anything but broken men, and that seeing how they've endured their captivity was inspiring.\n",
      "\t\"Mr. Spavor and Mr. Kovrig, and their families, have shown truly remarkable perseverance in the face of an unimaginable situation,\" Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Thursday.\n",
      "\tKovrig is \"marshalling every ounce of his willpower and strength\" to cope with his difficult situation, Nadjibulla said in an interview this week.\n",
      "\t\"He says that knowing that Canadians care, knowing that the world cares, and people are fighting for his release, makes him feel stronger, and keeps hope alive,\" she said, drawing on letters that he has written in captivity.\n",
      "\t\"He hopes that he will be able to come out from this experience not only having survived it, but with a commitment, with resolve to rebuild his life better, to contribute even more to society.\"\n",
      "\tA statement from Global Affairs on Thursday to The Canadian Press said that Canadian Embassy officials in Beijing spoke directly with Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs officials to clarify a media report earlier in the morning that suggested the two Michaels had gone on trial in China.\n",
      "\tThe statement said that \"contrary to what has been reported in the media this morning, there has been no development in the cases of Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor.\"\n",
      "\tThe statement also said that \"the confusion was caused by an inaccurate characterization of the process made by the Chinese MFA spokesperson.\"\n",
      "\tThe Canadian Press also reached out, through intermediaries, to request interviews with Spavor's friends and family but was unsuccessful. Spavor worked as an entrepreneur in the Chinese city of Dandong, where he is imprisoned near the North Korean border.\n",
      "\tKovrig was most recently an analyst with the International Crisis Group in Washington and before that he was a member of Canada's diplomatic corps, a career-focused on preventing deadly conflicts.\n",
      "\t\"He hopes that he can continue to do that, and he can rejoin the broader conversation in the world with life and not just continue to be isolated and cut off in the way that he is,\" said Nadjibulla.\n",
      "\tShe said Kovrig is devouring books from the meditations of stoic philosopher Marcus Aurelius, to St. Paul's Letter to the Romans, to Tolstoy's \"War and Peace,\" to Nelson Mandela's \"Long Walk to Freedom.\" He's reread one of his pre-prison favourites, \"Antifragile: Things That Gain From Disorder\" by Nassim Nicholas Taleb, because it contains a key message for him.\n",
      "\t\"It essentially posits that it's important to cultivate an ability to not only survive traumas or disruptions but to become better and stronger as a result. So, this idea of building back better. I know it's very much on the minds of many of us as we recover from the pandemic,\" she said.\n",
      "\tKovrig is also drawing on stoic philosophical teaching that, among other things, calls for the transformation of \"fear into prudence, pain into information,\" said Nadjibulla. Kovrig has added \"anger into determination and grievance into resolve\" to that philosophy.\n",
      "\tHe has been drawn to St. Paul's Letter to the Romans, the sixth book of the New Testament, \"which says suffering produces endurance, endurance produces character, character produces hope. And Michael is doing everything possible to keep hope alive,\" said Nadjibulla.\n",
      "\tKovrig is subjecting himself to a strict physical regimen, forever on the move in his small cell striving to walk the equivalent of five kilometres daily because he knows his mind cannot thrive if his body is not strong, said Nadjibulla.\n",
      "\tRobert Malley, Kovrig's boss at the International Crisis Group, says his imprisoned colleague can hold the plank, a core body exercise of endurance, for 18 minutes. In solidarity, Crisis Group colleagues recently had a plank competition but the closest anyone got was seven minutes. They're also walking 7,000 steps a day, the equivalent of five kilometres.\n",
      "\tMalley said he and his colleagues are in awe of Kovrig's discipline.\n",
      "\t\"None of us can be prepared for that, unless you're in the military and you're told this could happen. But he seems to have had all of the reflexes, instincts that are necessary,\" said Malley.\n",
      "\tWhen Kovrig is released one day his colleagues hope stories of their attempts to replicate some of his exercises will help him heal and, perhaps, bridge the gap growing between them and him, said Malley.\n",
      "\tKovrig only found out the scope of the global pandemic during Barton's on-site virtual visit in October -- his first contact with Canadian diplomats since January because Chinese authorities wouldn't allow any contact due to COVID-19, said Nadjibulla.\n",
      "\tHe was shocked at the pandemic's scale and compared it to a zombie apocalypse and the movie \"Contagion.\"\n",
      "\tKovrig is also aware that he is one of \"two Michaels\" and understands that both he and Spavor \"are caught in this bigger situation,\" she said. It's not a topic that can be discussed during the now-resumed 30-minute consular visits.\n",
      "\tNadjibulla said she was happy to hear that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau spoke to U.S. president-elect Joe Biden about the two Michaels in their recent conversation. Trudeau refused to discuss the content of that conversation last week, or whether Biden might revisit the Justice Department's attempted extradition and prosecution of Meng.\n",
      "\tIf the U.S. withdrew its charges, Meng could go free, and that might give China reason to free the two Michaels.\n",
      "\t\"Our Michael and Michael Spavor are caught in a bigger geopolitical struggle,\" Nadjibulla said. \"They're pawns in a bigger political game involving the U.S., China and Canada. And they have been in the situation for two long years, for no other reason than being Canadian citizens.\"\n",

      "CONTENT : BEIJING -- \n",
      "\tChina is imposing restrictions on travel to Hong Kong by some U.S. officials and others in retaliation for similar measures imposed on Chinese individuals by Washington, the Foreign Ministry said Thursday.\n",
      "\tU.S. diplomatic passport holders visiting Hong Kong and nearby Macao will temporarily no longer receive visa-free entry privileges, spokesperson Hua Chunying said.\n",
      "\tU.S. administration officials, congressional staffers, employees of non-governmental organizations and their immediate family members will face \"reciprocal sanctions,\" Hua said.\n",
      "\tShe was apparently referring to U.S. sanctions that bar certain Chinese and Hong Kong officials from travelling to the U.S. or having dealings with the U.S. financial system over their roles in imposing a sweeping National Security Law passed this summer that ushered in a crackdown on free speech and opposition political activity in Hong Kong.\n",
      "\tHua said the move was taken \"given that the U.S. side is using the Hong Kong issue to seriously interfere in China's internal affairs and undermine China's core interests.\"\n",
      "\tThose sanctioned \"have performed egregiously and are primarily responsible on the Hong Kong issue,\" she said at a daily briefing.\n",
      "\t\"China once again urges the U.S. side to immediately stop meddling in Hong Kong affairs, stop interfering in China's internal affairs, and not go further down the wrong and dangerous path,\" Hua said.\n",
      "\tChina had long threatened to retaliate against the U.S. sanctions and other actions seen as hostile.\n",
      "\tEarlier, China's official Xinhua News Agency said Trump administration officials are \"digging a hole\" for the next U.S. administration's relationship with China through actions targeting the country and its officials.\n",
      "\tSteps such as restricting visas for the 92 million members of the ruling Communist Party and their families have \"again exposed the sinister intentions of extreme anti-China forces in Washington to hijack China-U.S. relations for their own political gain,\" Xinhua said in an editorial.\n",
      "\tThe U.S. State Department last week cut the duration of such visas from 10 years to one month, another example of the increasingly hard-line stance adopted by the administration in its waning days. That came in addition to the sanctions targeting specific Chinese and Hong Kong officials over their actions in Hong Kong, the northwestern region of Xinjiang and elsewhere.\n",
      "\tWhile President-elect Joe Biden has signalled he intends to keep pressure on China, he's also expected to seek a return to more conventional, less confrontational style of diplomacy. Rolling back Trump-era measures could be difficult however, while giving Republicans the chance to renew accusations that Biden is softening Washington's stance toward Beijing.\n",
      "\t\"By relentlessly challenging the bottom line of China-U.S. relations on issues concerning China's core interests, anti-China politicians are not only digging a hole for the next administration's relationship with China, but also eying their own personal political gains,\" Xinhua said.\n",
      "\tU.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has castigated China on almost a daily basis over its policies toward Taiwan, Tibet, Hong Kong, Xinjiang and the South China Sea.\n",
      "\tDozens of officials from mainland China and Hong Kong have been hit with visa bans and other sanctions and new restrictions have been imposed on Chinese diplomats, journalists and academics. Chinese tech giant Huawei has been shut out of the U.S. market and the U.S. has lobbied other countries to follow suit, often successfully.\n",
      "\tOn Wednesday, Pompeo accused U.S. universities of caving to Chinese pressure to blunt or bar criticism of the the Chinese communist party, which he said was \"poisoning the well of our higher education for its own ends.\"\n",
      "\tChinese responded by vowing to impose countervailing measures against American officials, saying U.S. accusations and punitive measures only solidified the Chinese people behind their leaders.\n",
      "\tPerhaps with an eye toward Biden, who takes office Jan. 20, Xinhua held open the possibility of better relations if Washington changed its approach.\n",
      "\t\"Today, China and the United States should also uphold the spirit of non-conflict, non-confrontation, mutual respect and win-win co-operation,\" Xinhua said. \"The two must focus on managing their differences, with the top priority being a smooth transition toward stronger China-U.S. relations.\"\n",

      "\tThe Justice Department's investigation scrutinizing Hunter Biden's taxes has been examining some of his Chinese business dealings, among other financial transactions, a person familiar with the matter told The Associated Press on Wednesday.\n",
      "\tThe investigation was launched in 2018, a year before his father, Joe Biden, announced his candidacy for president, but it isn't clear which entities might be tied up in the probe, and the inquiry was not disclosed to Hunter Biden until Tuesday.\n",
      "\tThe younger Biden has a history of international affairs and business dealings in a number of countries, and the revelation of a federal investigation puts a renewed spotlight on the questions about his financial dealings that dogged his father's successful White House campaign.\n",
      "\tFederal investigators served a round of subpoenas on Tuesday, including one for Hunter Biden, according to another person familiar with the investigation who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss an ongoing probe. The tax investigation centres on his business dealings, the person said.\n",
      "\tInvestigators did not reach out in the weeks prior to the election because of a Justice Department policy surrounding elections that prohibits overt investigative acts, one of the people said.\n",
      "\tIn a statement released by the president-elect's transition office, Hunter Biden said he learned about the investigation on Tuesday, but he did not disclose specifics about what was being scrutinized.\n",
      "\t\"I take this matter very seriously but I am confident that a professional and objective review of these matters will demonstrate that I handled my affairs legally and appropriately, including with the benefit of professional tax advisors,\" he said in a statement.\n",
      "\tHe has long been a target of President Donald Trump and his allies, who have accused him of profiting off his political connections. Trump and his supporters also raised unsubstantiated charges of corruption related to Hunter Biden's work in Ukraine at the time his father was vice-president and leading the Obama administration's dealings with the Eastern European nation.\n",
      "\tLate Wednesday, Trump tweeted a quote from New York Post columnist Miranda Devine claiming, \"10% of voters would have changed their vote if they knew about Hunter Biden.\"\n",
      "\t\t\t“10% of voters would have changed their vote if they knew about Hunter Biden.” Miranda Devine @nypost @TuckerCarlson But I won anyway!\n",
      "\tThe disclosure of the federal investigation, led by the U.S. attorney's office in Delaware, comes at an awkward moment for the incoming president, who is assembling his Cabinet. His pick for attorney general could have oversight of the investigation into the new president's son if it is still ongoing when Biden is sworn in on Jan. 20.\n",
      "\tThe transition team said in a statement, \"President-elect Biden is deeply proud of his son, who has fought through difficult challenges, including the vicious personal attacks of recent months, only to emerge stronger.\"\n",
      "\tIt could also add weight to Trump's broad accusations that Biden was weak on China. Trump took a tough line on China during the campaign as he tried to deflect blame for the coronavirus. Biden has rejected the characterization that he was weak and said, that unlike Trump, he would rebuild global coalitions to check China's power.\n",
      "\tA New Yorker profile on Hunter Biden last year detailed some of his business work in China, including how he accompanied his father on a 2013 trip to Beijing, where he met with a business associate. He also acknowledged having received a diamond from a Chinese energy tycoon involved in liquified natural gas projects. He downplayed the idea that the gift could have been intended to affect his father's policy. He told the magazine that he gave the diamond to an associate.\n",
      "\t\"What would they be bribing me for? My dad wasn't in office,\" he said.\n",
      "\tHunter Biden has been caught up in controversies before. While his father was vice-president, Hunter joined the Naval Reserve and was discharged after testing positive for cocaine in his system, later revealing a yearslong struggle with addiction.\n",
      "\tHe also joined the board of Ukrainian energy company Burisma in 2014, sparking concerns about the perceptions of a conflict of interest given the elder Biden was deeply involved in U.S. policy toward Ukraine. An investigation by the Republican-led Senate did not identify any policies that were directly affected by Hunter Biden's work.\n",
      "\tIn the weeks before the election, Trump supporters used the existence of a laptop they said was connected to Hunter Biden -- and the emergence of someone who maintains he had business discussions with him -- to raise questions about Joe Biden's knowledge of his son's activities in Ukraine and China. The president-elect has said he did not discuss his son's international business dealings with him and has denied having ever taken money from a foreign country.\n",
      "\tThe laptop surfaced publicly in October when The New York Post reported on emails that it said had come from Hunter Biden's laptop and that it said it received from Rudy Giuliani, Trump's personal lawyer.\n",
      "\tA third person familiar with the matter said the tax investigation does not have anything to do with the laptop. Like the other people who spoke to the AP, the person was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.\n",
      "\tIn a CNN interview last week, President-elect Biden addressed the business dealings of his son Hunter and his brothers, pledging that they would avoid any perceived conflicts of interest during his time in office.\n",
      "\t\"My son, my family will not be involved in any business, any enterprise that is in conflict with or appears to be in conflict, where there's appropriate distance from the presidency and government,\" Biden said.\n",

      "\tThe world's highest mountain is now officially a little higher, and that might not be the end of the story.\n",
      "\tChina and Nepal agreed this week on a new standard height for Mount Everest, the rugged Himalayan peak that straddles their border.\n",
      "\tAs definitive as that sounds, geological changes, the complicated business of measuring a mountain and varying criteria for determining the world's highest peak will likely ensure the question isn't settled for good.\n",
      "\tThe mountain's height changes. The movement of tectonic plates can lift it up ever so gradually, while earthquakes can bring it down.\n",
      "\tThe countervailing forces may help maintain a degree of stability over time, said Dang Yamin, a member of a Chinese team that surveyed Everest's height earlier this year.\n",
      "\t\"Nature tends to strike a balance,\" he told the official Xinhua News Agency. As an example, Dang cited a massive 1934 earthquake that wiped out 150 years of steady height increase in a few moments.\n",
      "\tThere's more than one way to measure a mountain.\n",
      "\tLast year, a Nepalese team set up a satellite navigation marker on Everest's peak to gauge its exact position via GPS satellites. A Chinese team undertook a similar mission this spring, though it used the Chinese-made Beidou constellation of navigation satellites, along with other equipment.\n",
      "\tAt the same time, Nepalese crews took measurements with modern, laser-equipped versions of instruments called theodolites, first used to gauge the mountain's height in 1856 by measuring angles using trigonometry.\n",
      "\tThe Nepalese team also used ground penetrating radar to measure the amount of snow and ice that sits on top of its highest rock.\n",
      "\tChina and Nepal jointly presented a new official figure of 8,848.86 metres (29,031.69 feet) above sea level. The two had diverged for years over the mountain's actual height.\n",
      "\tThe new height is 0.86 metres (more than 2 feet) above the higher of the countries' two previous figures, that given by Nepal. The agreement announced Tuesday was heralded as a sign of the growing political, economic and cultural ties between them.\n",
      "\tMeasuring the height above sea level has always been tricky because ocean levels vary considerably depending on tides, magnetism and other factors. Rising sea levels are creating another factor for future measurements.\n",
      "\tHow high above sea level is just one way of measuring a mountain's height. One reason Everest wins the prize is that its base sits high up on already lofty foothills.\n",
      "\tAs measured from the Earth's core, Ecuador's Mount Chimborazo is the world's highest, standing more than 2,072 metres (6,800 feet) above Everest. Because the Earth bulges in the middle, mountains along the equator are farther from the core.\n",
      "\tMeasuring from the foot of the mountain to the peak, Hawaii's Mauna Kea is the tallest. Most of it, however, is under the sea.\n",
      "\tThis story has been corrected to say that the agreement was announced Tuesday, not Wednesday.\n",

      "\tThe United Arab Emirates said Wednesday a Chinese coronavirus vaccine tested in the federation of sheikhdoms is 86 per cent effective, in a statement that provided few details but marked the first public release of information on the efficacy of the shot.\n",
      "\tThe announcement brought yet another shot into the worldwide race for a vaccine to end the pandemic, a scientific effort that has seen China and Russia compete with Western firms for an effective inoculation. While questions remain about the Sinopharm shot, already at least one country outside China plans to roll it out in a mass-vaccination campaign.\n",
      "\tThe UAE, home to Dubai and Abu Dhabi, conducted a trial beginning in September of the vaccine by Chinese state-owned pharmaceutical giant Sinopharm involving 31,000 volunteers from 125 nations. Volunteers between 18 and 60 years old received two doses of the vaccine over 28 days.\n",
      "\tThe UAE's Health and Prevention Ministry announced the results via a statement on the state-run WAM news agency, saying they \"have reviewed Sinopharm CNBG's interim analysis of the Phase III trials.\"\n",
      "\t\"The analysis shows no serious safety concerns,\" the statement said, without detailing whether any participant suffered side effects.\n",
      "\tIt wasn't immediately clear if the announced results included only those taking part in the testing in the UAE or if they also include results from China and elsewhere. The statement described the vaccine as receiving \"official registration\" without elaborating on what that meant.\n",
      "\tEmirati officials and Sinopharm did not respond to questions from The Associated Press.\n",
      "\tHowever, calls Wednesday to SEHA, the Abu Dhabi health authority, included an option for individuals to schedule an appointment to receive a \"COVID-19 vaccine.\" The centre was swamped with calls following the announcement on the vaccine's efficacy.\n",
      "\tThe Sinopharm vaccine has been approved for emergency use in a few countries and the company is still conducting late-stage clinical trials in 10 countries. Morocco is gearing up for an ambitious COVID-19 vaccination program, aiming to vaccinate 80 per cent of its adults in an operation starting this month that's relying initially on the Sinopharm vaccine.\n",
      "\tSinopharm's shot relies on a tested technology, using a killed virus to deliver the vaccine, similar to how polio immunizations are made. Leading Western competitors, like the shot made by Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech, use newer, less-proven technology to target the coronavirus' spike protein using RNA. The United Kingdom already has begun vaccinating people with the Pfizer shot.\n",
      "\tTop officials in the UAE, including Dubai's ruler, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, have publicly receive the shots as part of the vaccine testing.\n",
      "\tAlready, Pfizer reports its shot as being 95 per cent effective, while another RNA candidate from Moderna appears to be 94.5 per cent effective. Results suggest a third vaccine from Oxford University and AstraZeneca is safe and about 70 per cent effective, but questions remain about how well it may help protect those over 55.\n",
      "\tIn transport, the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines must remain at cold temperatures -- negative 70 degrees Celsius (negative 94 degree Fahrenheit) and negative 20 degrees Celsius (negative 4 degrees Fahrenheit), respectively.\n",
      "\tThe Sinopharm vaccine is believed to be able to travel at a temperature of 2 to 8 degrees Celsius (35 to 46 degrees Fahrenheit), a major draw for areas of the world where nearly 3 billion people live without stable electricity and refrigeration. In November, the Communist Party secretary for Sinopharm said almost 1 million people in China had received its vaccine.\n",
      "\tMeanwhile Wednesday, Abu Dhabi announced it would resume \"all economic, tourism, cultural and entertainment activities in the emirate within two weeks.\" It attributed the decision to \"successes\" in halting the spread of the coronavirus.\n",
      "\tAbu Dhabi has required those travelling into the emirate from the UAE's other six sheikhdoms to take a coronavirus test within 48 hours prior to arrival.\n",
      "\tSince the pandemic began, the UAE has detected over 178,000 cases of the virus, with 160,000 recoveries and nearly 600 deaths. Its aggressive testing policy has seen over 17 million tests conducted in a country home to just over 9 million people.\n",
      "\tIn Iran, meanwhile, President Hassan Rouhani angrily blamed U.S. sanctions for making it difficult for Tehran to purchase medicine and health supplies amid the pandemic.\n",
      "\tAnd in Israel, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu welcomed the first shipment of doses of the Pfizer vaccine, calling it a \"big day of celebration\" for the country.\n",
      "\t\"I believe in this vaccine. I expect it will receive the appropriate approval in the coming days,\" Netanyahu said, adding that he intended to be the first to receive it. \"We see the end of the pandemic.\"\n",

      "\tDominic Barton also says Chinese authorities were paranoid about containing the spread of COVID-19 as they denied consular access to the two men from January to October.\n",
      "\t\"Our understanding of why it was the case is that the Chinese are completely paranoid about the virus,\" Barton said in testimony Tuesday night before the House of Commons special committee on Canada-China relations.\n",
      "\tBarton is leading Canada's efforts in China to win the release of Kovrig and Spavor, who were arrested and imprisoned on Dec. 10, 2018, in what is widely seen as retaliation for Canada's arrest of Chinese high-tech executive Meng Wanzhou.\n",
      "\tAfter months of delay, Barton was most recently granted on-site virtual consular access to Kovrig and Spavor in November, following similar virtual visits with the two Canadians a month earlier.\n",
      "\t\"We were obviously very frustrated at not being able to get access even virtually because as far as we know . . . the virus doesn't go through televisions,\" said Barton.\n",
      "\tThe Chinese government has charged Kovrig and Spavor with espionage but the Canadian government says their detention is arbitrary and has called repeatedly for their release.\n",
      "\tBarton said it wasn't just Canada that was blocked by the Chinese from visiting prisoners charged in national security cases; the U.S. and Britain faced similar restrictions.\n",
      "\tWhen Barton was able to see them, he said he was able to verify they were in good physical and mental condition.\n",
      "\t\"They are robust,\" said Barton, who was testifying from Beijing via video link. \"You would be very impressed by seeing both of them.\"\n",
      "\tSpavor is being held in a prison in the city of Dandong near the North Korean border while Kovrig is in a Beijing area prison.\n",
      "\t\"It's a strange thing. We fly to these places, or drive to them in the case of Beijing. And I know that the Michaels (are) literally sort of on the other side of the wall, but you've got, you know, two big TVs,\" he said. \"It's like this.\"\n",
      "\tBarton's main purpose for testifying was to describe the three-day Chinese government-controlled visit to Tibet that he and nine other Western diplomats undertook in October. He said he remains concerned about the human rights situation there and that they only saw what the Chinese wanted them to see.\n",
      "\tEven though the area is filled with security cameras, as is the capital of Beijing, Barton said he wandered off a couple of times to visit with locals without his Chinese government minders in tow.\n",
      "\tHe said Canada is not reluctant to raise human rights concerns with China even though some people think Canada is in the Chinese \"doghouse\" these days. He also said that even though he knew the visit to Tibet would be controlled, it sent a signal to local people that the outside world still cared about their plight.\n",
      "\tThursday marked Barton's second appearance before the committee this year, following testimony in February in which he declared \"the chill is real\" in Canadian relations with China.\n",
      "\tIn February, Barton described an angry, emotional meeting during his first diplomatic contact with his Chinese counterparts after being appointed to the post in 2019 after a long career in business, which included being the global managing director of the consulting giant McKinsey & Co.\n",
      "\tHis position in the company gave Barton high level access in China and across Asia, something the Trudeau government is hoping to leverage to win freedom for Kovrig and Spavor while maintaining economic relations with its second largest trading partner.\n",

      "\tA federal judge has blocked U.S. President Donald Trump's attempts to ban TikTok, the latest legal defeat for the administration as it tries to wrest the popular app from its Chinese owners.\n",
      "\tThe Trump administration had tried to ban the short-form video app from smartphone app stores in the U.S. and cut it off from vital technical services. TikTok sued, arguing such actions would violate free speech and due process rights.\n",
      "\tJudge Carl Nichols of the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., said in a ruling Monday that the Commerce Department \"likely overstepped\" its use of presidential emergency powers \"and acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner by failing to consider obvious alternatives.\"\n",
      "\tNichols is the second federal judge to fully block the Trump administration's economic sanctions against the app as the court cases proceed.\n",
      "\tThe Trump administration has alleged that TikTok is a security threat because the Chinese government could spy on app users' personal data. TikTok has denied it's a security threat but said it's still trying to work with the administration to resolve its concerns.\n",
      "\tTrump in September gave his tentative blessing to a proposal by ByteDance, the Chinese company that owns TikTok, meant to resolve U.S. national security concerns by having the U.S. companies Oracle and Walmart invest in TikTok. Oracle would manage U.S. user data under the arrangement. But a federal agency still has to review and finalize an arrangement.\n",

      "\tThe Treasury Department, which chairs the agency reviewing the deal, said Friday that the agency \"is engaging with ByteDance to complete the divestment and other steps necessary to resolve the national security risks arising from the transaction.\"\n",
      "\tThe Trump administration's aggressive tactics are part of its latest attempt to counter the influence of China. Since taking office in 2017, Trump has waged a trade war with China, blocked mergers involving Chinese companies and stifled the business of Chinese firms like Huawei, a maker of phones and telecom equipment.\n",
      "\tWhile President-elect Joe Biden has said TikTok is a concern, it's not clear what his administration will carry on the Trump administration's ongoing attempts to secure a ban, or increase the involvement of U.S. companies.\n",

      "\tThe incident trended on the Twitter-like Weibo, angering many people, and comes after the men's national team were ordered to cover up their tattoos.\n",
      "\tThe latest high-profile example of the shrinking space for individualism in communist-ruled China came when the women's sides of Fuzhou and Jimei universities met in a college league match in the southeastern province of Fujian.\n",

      "\tHundreds of shoppers pack a wet market on a December weekday morning in the Chinese city of Wuhan, jostling to buy fresh vegetables and live fish, frogs and turtles.\n",
      "\tAlmost a year since the city reported the world's first cases of COVID-19 in one of its handful of vast wet markets, and even as several other countries remain firmly in the grip of the subsequent pandemic, life in Wuhan has largely returned to normal.\n",
      "\t\"I'm not afraid, what is there to be afraid of?\" said Nie Guangzhen, a fish and vegetable vendor.\n",
      "\tNie and other shop owners along a narrow street, part of the larger wet market, were busily gutting fish for streams of buyers - some not wearing masks - as city cleaners sprayed down the pavements.\n",
      "\tFew hints remain of Wuhan's early role in the coronavirus pandemic, which has since infected more than 67 million people globally, killing around 1.5 million people.\n",
      "\tChina first alerted the World Health Organization to 27 cases of \"viral pneumonia\" in Wuhan on Dec. 31. Authorities shut down a wet market in the city the next day, after discovering some patients were vendors or dealers.\n",
      "\tThat marked the start of a dark period for the city of 11 million in central China. Infections spiraled quickly to 50,000 cases, including almost 4,000 deaths. Officials responded by swiftly imposing a tough 76-day lockdown, erecting kilometers of thick yellow barricades through the city's deserted streets to keep people at home and businesses closed.\n",
      "\tThe measures paid off. Wuhan has not recorded a new locally transmitted case in several months and is now indistinguishable from other Chinese cities with crowded shopping streets, traffic jams and tightly packed restaurants.\n",
      "\t\"I really missed these more fun and exciting times, like going out shopping and eating with my friends,\" said 27-year-old shopper Hu Hang on Monday at a packed Wuhan night market selling Christmas sweaters among other goods.\n",
      "\tIn the busy street, hawkers sell flowers and balloons, street performers including dancers and a clown perform while music blares from shops lining the road.\n",
      "\tThe city's recovery is a sharp contrast to other major economies heading into the Christmas and New year holiday season.\n",
      "\tIn the United States, the health system is under severe pressure as cases mount and health officials warn the worst is yet to come. The country recorded 15,000 deaths over the past week, the deadliest seven days of the pandemic since April.\n",
      "\tSeveral European countries have rolled out tight restrictions on gatherings ahead of Christmas, fearing a return to peak levels of cases because of festive celebrations.\n",
      "\tChina's relative success in controlling the virus has become a key talking point in Chinese state media.\n",
      "\t\"I haven't been overseas, so I don't understand it well, but looking at the TV it seems like foreign countries don't put human life first,\" said Mr Li, a 54-year old Wuhan street food vendor, who reopened his shop in June. \"The ideology of foreign countries is not as good as that of China.\"\n",
      "\tChina has taken steps, including mass testing millions of residents following small-scale outbreaks, to prevent a second wave of infections seen in many other cities and countries.\n",
      "\tAt the gates of residential compounds, staff in blue tents monitor residents' smartphone health codes. In a public park, slogans on red propaganda banners urge people to remain vigilant.\n",
      "\tWearing face masks is not mandatory, but most people do so in public.\n",
      "\tAnd while shoppers have returned to Wuhan's streets, Li and others say business is yet to return fully to normal.\n",
      "\t\"The whole situation is not great, it's still a lot worse compared to the last few years,\" Li said, referring to a slump in sales during the time after lockdown when people were too afraid to return to the streets.\n",
      "\tStill, for many residents, lockdown memories have been superseded by the city's swift reopening - alongside new precautions.\n",
      "\t\"I don't worry, because I'm doing a good job of protection,\" said wet market vendor Nie, who said she will continue to disinfect and boil her clothes. \"Even if there is a second wave, I will just stick to it.”\n",

      "\tChina and Nepal jointly announced a new official height for Mount Everest on Tuesday, ending a discrepancy between the two nations.\n",
      "\tThe new height of the world's highest peak is 8,848.86 metres (29,031.7 feet), which is slightly more than Nepal's previous measurement and about four meters (13 feet) higher than China's.\n",
      "\tChinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi and his Nepalese counterpart, Pradeep Gyawali, simultaneously pressed buttons during a virtual conference and the new height flashed on the screen.\n",
      "\tThe height of Everest, which is on the border between China and Nepal, was agreed on after surveyors from Nepal scaled the peak in 2019 and a Chinese team did the same in 2020.\n",
      "\tThere had been debate over the actual height of the peak and concern that it might have shrunk after a major earthquake in 2015. The quake killed 9,000 people, damaged about 1 million structures in Nepal and triggered an avalanche on Everest that killed 19 people at the base camp.\n",
      "\tThere was no doubt that Everest would remain the highest peak because the second highest, Mount K2, is only 8,611 metres (28,244 feet) tall.\n",
      "\tEverest's height was first determined by a British team around 1856 as 8,842 metres (29,002) feet.\n",
      "\tBut the most accepted height has been 8,848 metres (29,028 feet), which was determined by the Survey of India in 1954.\n",
      "\tIn 1999, a National Geographic Society team using GPS technology came up with a height of 8,850 (29,035 feet). A Chinese team in 2005 said it was 8,844.43 metres (29,009 feet) because it did not include the snow cap.\n",
      "\tA Nepal government team of climbers and surveyors scaled Everest in May 2019 and installed GPS and satellite equipment to measure the peak and snow depth on the summit.\n",
      "\tChinese President Xi Jinping visited Nepal later that year and the leaders of the two countries decided that they should agree on a height.\n",
      "\tA survey team from China then conducted measurements in the spring of 2020 while all other expeditions were cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic.\n",
      "\tNepal's climbing community welcomed the end of confusion over the mountain's height.\n",
      "\t\"This is a milestone in mountaineering history which will finally end the debate over the height and now the world will have one number,\" said Santa Bir Lama, president of the Nepal Mountaineering Association.\n",
      "\tChina's official Xinhua New Agency quoted Xi as saying the two sides are committed to jointly protecting the environment around Everest and co-operating in scientific research.\n",
      "\tFor China, the announcement appeared to be as much about politics as geography. China has drawn Nepal ever closer into its orbit with investments in its economy and the building of highways, dams, airports and other infrastructure in the impoverished nation.\n",
      "\tThat appears to serve China's interests in reducing the influence of rival India, with which it shares a disputed border, and Nepal's role as a destination for refugee Tibetans.\n",
      "\tThe Xinhua report said nothing about the technical aspects but heavily emphasized the joint announcement's geopolitical weight.\n",
      "\tChina and Nepal will establish an \"even closer community of a shared future to enrich the countries and their peoples,\" Xinhua quoted Xi as saying.\n",

      "\tExports to the United States rose 46% despite lingering tariff hikes in a trade war with Washington, customs data showed Monday.\n",
      "\tTotal exports rose to $268 billion, accelerating from October's 11.4% growth. Imports gained 5% to $192.6 billion, up from the previous month's 4.7%.\n",
      "\tChinese exporters have benefited from the economy's relatively early reopening after the Communist Party declared the coronavirus pandemic under control in March while foreign competitors still are hampered by anti-disease controls.\n",
      "\t“Exports were much stronger than expected in November,” said Julian Evans-Pritchard of Capital Economics in a report.\n",
      "\tForecasters say that surge is unlikely to last into 2021 once coronavirus vaccines are rolled out.\n",
      "\t“We expect export performance to be less impressive,” said Louis Kuijs of Oxford Economics in a report.\n",
      "\tChina's global trade surplus for the first 11 months of 2020 is $460 billion, up 21.4% from this time last year, already one of the highest ever recorded.\n",
      "\tExports to the United States rose to $51.9 billion while imports of American goods gained 33% to $14.6 billion. The trade surplus with the United States swelled 52% over a year earlier to $37.3 billion.\n",
      "\tBeijing promised to buy more American soybeans, natural gas and other exports as part of the “Phase 1” agreement signed in January and aimed at ending a costly tariff battle over Chinese technology ambitions. China fell behind on meeting those commitments earlier in the year but is catching up as demand rebounds.\n",
      "\tThe two governments agreed to postpone further planned tariff hikes on each other's goods but most penalties already imposed on billions of dollars of imports stayed in place.\n",
      "\tChinese imports are growing faster by volume than by value because demand has been chilled by the shutdown of travel and industry, driving prices lower.\n",
      "\tChina is on track to become the only major economy to grow this year while activity in the United States, Europe and Japan falls.\n",
      "\tChina's economy shrank by 6.8% from a year earlier in the first three months of 2020 after factories, shops and offices were shut down to fight the virus. Growth rebounded to 3.2% in the second quarter and accelerated to 4.9% in the three months ending in September.\n",
      "\tAutomakers and other large manufacturers are back to normal activity, helping to drive demand for imported iron ore, copper and other raw materials. Retail sales are back above pre-virus levels and rose 4.3% over a year earlier in October.\n",
      "\tAlso in November, exports to the 27-nation European Union rose 8.6% over a year ago to $37.5 billion while imports of European goods gained 4.5% to $26.2 billion. China's trade surplus with Europe widened by 20% to $11.3 billion.\n",

      "\tThe improved performance of Canada's technology sector and the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite in the U.S. were attributable to worsening coronavirus trends and lockdowns on both sides of the border, Kourkafas said.\n",
      "\t\"The focus and the market's attention ... is looking forward for the vaccine potential distribution. And that continues to be the main driver of sentiment,\" he said in an interview.\n",
      "\tCanadian and U.S health regulators are expected to soon grant emergency authorization for at least two vaccines presented by Pfizer and Moderna. A third vaccine has also been developed by AstraZeneca.\n",

      "\tLower prices pushed the energy sector down 0.9 per cent with Tourmaline Oil Corp. off 5.1 per cent. The price fall is attributable to concerns about demand as new restrictions in movement translates into lower demand for travel and a pullback after last week's strong oil price gains.\n",
      "\t\"So we're seeing kind of that effect of the renewed restrictions show up in a little bit of a loss of momentum in the economic data. And we expect that to likely persist for the remainder of the year and likely the first quarter of next year,\" said Kourkafas.\n",

      "\tA Chinese probe was orbiting the moon on Monday in preparation for the returning of samples of the lunar surface to Earth for the first time in almost 45 years.\n",
      "\tThe ascent module of the Chang'e 5 spacecraft transferred a container with 2 kilograms (4.4 pounds) of samples after docking with the robot spacecraft on Sunday and was then cut free.\n",
      "\tThe orbiter and reentry vehicle will circle the moon for another week awaiting a narrow time window to make the roughly three-day, 383,000-kilometre (238,000-mile) journey back to Earth. It will first \"bounce\" off the Earth's atmosphere to slow its speed before the reentry vehicle separates and floats down on parachutes to land on the vast steppes of Inner Mongolia, where China's Shenzhou crewed spaceships have also made their landings.\n",
      "\tIf the mission succeeds, it will make China the third country after the United States and former Soviet Union to bring moon rocks to Earth. They will be the first fresh samples of the lunar surface obtained by scientists since the Soviet Union's Luna 24 probe in 1976.\n",
      "\tThe Chang'e 5 ascent stage blasted off from the moon's surface on Friday, leaving behind the lander module flying the Chinese flag, according to the China National Space Agency, which also released a photo taken by the orbiter showing it approaching for its rendezvous with the ascender, a sliver of the Earth seen in the background.\n",
      "\tThat marked the first time China had succeeded in lifting off a spacecraft from a celestial body, while no country had previously achieved the tricky feat of executing a robotic docking in lunar orbit. Controllers on Earth had to deal with distance and time lag while precisely manoeuvring a clamp into position with almost no room for error.\n",
      "\tThe 23-day mission has been front page news in state media for days, paired with reports that China has officially lifted all of its citizens out of the most grinding form of poverty. Along with being a propaganda coup for the ruling Communist Party, the dual stories illustrate the vast economic and technological advances China has made since it became just the third country in history to launch a person into space in 2003.\n",
      "\tChinese foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying praised the \"courage to explore, overcome difficulties and pay hard efforts\" of those who made the mission possible.\n",
      "\t\"The entirety of the Chinese people are proud of the efforts and wisdom of the Chinese lunar exploration researchers,\" Hua told reporters Monday at a daily briefing.\n",
      "\tBy way of cautious incremental steps, China is now in the midst of a series of ambitious missions that include a probe en route to Mars and the development of a reusable space plane about which little information has been provided.\n",

      "\tFuture plans call for returning a human to the moon five decades after American astronauts, along with a possible permanent moon base, although no timeline has been offered. China is also building a permanent space station to begin operating as early as 2022.\n",

      "\tProvincial governments across China are placing orders for experimental, domestically made coronavirus vaccines, though health officials have yet to say how well they work or how they may reach the country's 1.4 billion people.\n",
      "\tDevelopers are speeding up final testing, the Chinese foreign minister said during a UN meeting last week, as Britain approved emergency use of Pfizer Inc.'s vaccine candidate and providers scrambled to set up distribution.\n",
      "\tEven without final approval, more than 1 million health care workers and others in China who are deemed at high risk of infection have received experimental vaccines under emergency use permission. Developers have yet to disclose how effective their vaccines are and possible side effects.\n",
      "\tChina's fledgling pharmaceutical industry has at least five vaccines from four producers being tested in more than a dozen countries including Russia, Egypt and Mexico. Health experts say even if they are successful, the certification process for the United States, Europe, Japan and other developed countries might be too complex for them to be used there. However, China said it will ensure the products are affordable for developing countries and has been actively pursuing deals across the world.\n",
      "\tOn Sunday, 1.2 million doses of the Chinese company Sinovac's vaccine arrived in Indonesia, the government said.\n",
      "\t\"We are very grateful, thank God, the vaccine is now available so that we can immediately curb the spread of the COVID-19 disease,\" President Joko Widodo said.\n",
      "\tWithin China, so far only one developer, China National Pharmaceutical Group, known as Sinopharm, said in November it applied for final market approval for use of its vaccine. Others have been approved for emergency use on people deemed at high risk of infection.\n",
      "\t\"We must be prepared for large-scale production,\" Vice Premier Sun Chunlan said during a visit Wednesday to developers, according to the official Xinhua News Agency.\n",
      "\tSun, who has as overseen much of the country's response, visited one of Sinopharm's Beijing subsidiary companies, Sinovac and a research lab under the National Medical Products Administration, a regulatory agency that approves medical products for public use.\n",
      "\tThe government has yet to say how many people it plans to vaccinate. Sun said plans call for vaccinating border personnel and other high-risk populations this month.\n",
      "\tThe companies are using more traditional techniques than Western developers.\n",
      "\tThey say unlike Pfizer's vaccine, which must be kept frozen at temperatures as low as minus 70 degrees Celsius (minus 94 Fahrenheit), theirs can be stored at 2 to 8 C (36 to 46 F). The Chinese producers have yet to say how they might be distributed.\n",
      "\tHealth experts question why China is using experimental vaccines on such a vast scale now that the outbreak is largely under control within its borders.\n",
      "\tHealth officials previously said China will be able to manufacture 610 million doses by the end of this year and ramp up to 1 billion doses next year.\n",
      "\tThe government of Jiangsu province, where the major city of Nanjing is located, issued a procurement notice for vaccines from Sinovac and Sinopharm on Wednesday for emergency use.\n",
      "\tAuthorities in Sichuan province in the west, which has about 85 million people, announced Monday they were already buying vaccines. An official newspaper in Anhui province, southeast of Beijing, said a local residential committee issued a notice asking whether residents want a vaccine.\n",
      "\tThe Sichuan and Anhui announcements said the vaccine, given in two shots, would cost a total of 400 yuan ($60).\n",
      "\tVaccines from Sinovac and Sinopharm were approved for emergency use in July.\n",
      "\tIn October, Zhejiang province south of Shanghai offered the public vaccination under emergency use authorization. It said people considered high-risk would get priority.\n",
      "\tIn November, the Communist Party secretary for Sinopharm said almost 1 million people had received its vaccine.\n",
      "\tIn September, Sinovac's CEO said about 3,000 of its employees had taken their vaccine. He said the company provided tens of thousands of doses to the Beijing city government.\n",
      "\tSinopharm has clinical trials under way in 10 countries including the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Jordan, Peru and Argentina with nearly 60,000 volunteers. It has built two facilities in China capable of producing 200 million doses per year.\n",
      "\tSinovac has trials in Brazil, Turkey and Indonesia. Its most recent publicized data, a study in the science journal the Lancet, showed its candidate produced lower levels of antibodies in people than those who had recovered from COVID-19. The company projects it will be able to produce a few hundred million doses of the vaccine by February or March of next year.\n",
      "\tAnother producer, CanSino, is testing in Russia, Pakistan and Mexico and pursuing partnerships in Latin American countries. Its vaccine, which has been used on an emergency basis with the Chinese military, uses a harmless adenovirus to carry genes into human cells to generate an immune response.\n",

      "CONTENT : OTTAWA -- \n",
      "\tAlmost two years after Meng Wanzhou’s arrest in Vancouver's airport, the Huawei executive could be heading home soon.\n",
      "\tAccording to reports from the Wall Street Journal, the United States Department of Justice is ready to make a deal with the telecom giant, offering Meng a deferred prosecution agreement and allow her to return to China in exchange for an admission of wrongdoing in her ongoing criminal case.\n",
      "\tThis could be welcome news for Canada, as Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor have been detained in China since Meng’s arrest, in what has widely been seen as retaliation from the Chinese government. Canada has also been subject to trade sanctions on canola, soybean, beef, and pork exports, leading to a 16 per cent decline of exports to China in 2019.\n",
      "\t\"If she is returned, it opens the door for releasing the two Canadians, and I think that Ottawa is probably busy speaking with Washington and Beijing to try and make sure the solution will be a triangular one,\" said former Canadian ambassador to China Guy Saint-Jacques.\n",
      "\tHowever, experts are divided on how soon the Michaels will come home, or if they’ll be released in exchange at all.\n",
      "\t\"The idealist in me says perhaps, but the realist says no,\" former diplomat Colin Robertson told CTV News.\n",
      "\tRobertson said this potential deal is only the first step as negotiations with China are always a long process.\n",
      "\t\"We look at negotiations through different ends of the telescope and that can lead to misunderstandings,\" he said. \"It can also lead to false optimism, which is I'm afraid we might be encouraging right now.\"\n",
      "\tOne issue complicating the return of the Michaels is the consistent denial from the Chinese that their detentions were related to Meng's arrest, said Robertson.\n",
      "\tIn June, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said at a press conference: \"The Meng Wanzhou incident is in essence difference from the cases of the Canadians.\"\n",
      "\tAccording to Zhao, \"the United States aims to oppress Huawei and other Chinese high-tech companies, and Canada is its accomplice.\"\n",
      "\t\"This is really between the United States and Ms. Meng,\" said Charles Burton, associate professor at Brock University and MacDonald-Laurier Institute senior fellow.\n",
      "\t\"Would the Chinese authorities release Kovrig and Spavor, or would they continue to hold them to continue to exert pressure over Canada with regard to other political matters?\"\n",
      "\tThough China has said in the past Meng's release \"could open up space\" to resolve Kovrig and Spavor's detention, the reports of the potential deal so far do not include any guarantees for the Canadians' return.\n",
      "\t\"That's why we have to try and get as much undertakings from the Americans if they do decide to proceed down this road…that the Michaels are part of it,\" said Robertson.\n",
      "\tWhile it was U.S. President Donald Trump who issued Meng's extradition request, the incoming Biden administration is expected to remain tough on China. Robertson said the Canadian government needs to continue to press the Americans to make sure Kovrig and Spavor aren't forgotten once the Meng affair is resolved.\n",
      "\t\"We've been left holding the bag,\" said Robertson.\n",
      "\t\"We've been used by the Americans and we've certainly been abused by the Chinese, and the two Michaels are the real victims in this whole tragedy.\"\n",

      "\tProcurement Minister Anita Anand says that as soon as she knows when the first dose of COVID-19 vaccine will arrive in Canada, she will share that information with Canadians.\n",
      "\tBut Anand told The Canadian Press in an interview this week that the original contracts to buy COVID-19 vaccines had to be vague about delivery dates because nobody knew at the time if the vaccines would be successful.\n",
      "\tIt's only in the last few weeks, when the leading candidates from Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca reported such positive results from their large clinical trials, that the way forward became clear enough for Anand's department to start asking the companies to be more specific about when they can make good on their contracts with Canada.\n",
      "\t\"We put these contracts in place in order to place Canadians in the best stead possible, of any country in the world, recognizing that we would need to negotiate additional terms such as precise delivery dates, once a vaccine was discovered, and regulatory approval was obtained,\" she said. \"And that is what's happening now.\"\n",
      "\tAs Canadians face a pandemic-plagued holiday season and dream that 2021 will not be the anxiety-laden and often tragic disaster that 2020 has proven to be, there is one gleaming hope dangling still just out of reach: a vaccine for COVID-19.\n",
      "\tStill, the federal government has yet to answer one big question: When will it get here?\n",
      "\tIt is not that she doesn't want to tell Canadians when, said Anand. But the complexities of figuring out a specific date are linked to when Health Canada approves the vaccine, and when the vaccine makers can see that Canada is ready to receive and safely distribute the precious doses, some of which have to be stored at temperatures below -70 C.\n",
      "\tThose pieces are starting to converge now.\n",
      "\tHealth Canada officials are days, maybe even hours, away from approving the COVID-19 vaccine from Pfizer and BioNTech for use in Canada.\n",
      "\tCanadians got some more information on the logistics from a briefing of federal officials this week, including that Pfizer will ship its vaccine directly to 14 identified receiving sites in provinces. FedEx and Innomar Strategies were contracted Friday to oversee the delivery of other vaccines from a national receiving site to provinces.\n",
      "\tThe National Advisory Committee on Immunization issued refined guidance Friday for who should get the vaccine first, including long-term care residents and workers, and people over the age of 80.\n",
      "\tThe materials like syringes, gauze pads and bandages needed to vaccinate millions of people are in place. Ultralow temperature freezers have been purchased and nine new ones have already arrived. Provincial governments are lining up their own task forces.\n",
      "\t\"We are going to have vaccines in this country, as expeditiously as possible,\" Anand said.\n",
      "\tConservative Leader Erin O'Toole has been decrying the lack of clarity from the Liberals about the vaccine plan. A week ago he accused the Liberals of only starting to buy vaccines in a panic this summer after a collaboration with China on a vaccine fell apart.\n",
      "\tThe partnership between the National Research Council and China's CanSino Biologics was announced in May to great fanfare. But the doses to be used in a Canadian clinical trial failed to arrive, when the Chinese government -- in the midst of political tensions with Canada -- refused to issue an export permit for them.\n",
      "\t\"I would not have put all our eggs in the basket of China,\" O'Toole said Nov. 29, adding the timeline shows it wasn't until that deal fell apart that Canada \"started getting serious with Pfizer, Moderna, the other options.\"\n",
      "\tAnand said that is not the case.\n",
      "\tShe said the CanSino deal fell within Innovation Minister Navdeep Bains' portfolio, not her own, and nothing about the project prevented her from negotiating with other companies.\n",
      "\tHer marching orders to negotiate deals with other vaccine makers came weeks earlier. A team of procurement officials in her department was assigned to the file in March, at the same time as those negotiating contracts for medical supplies, personal protective equipment and rapid tests.\n",
      "\tIn June, the COVID-19 vaccine task force provided a list of vaccines for Canada to pursue. Anand said talks with manufacturers began in early July. The first deal, with Massachusetts biotech firm Moderna, was struck July 24.\n",
      "\tCanada was first to sign with Moderna. It signed a contract with Pfizer and BioNTech a week later, on Aug. 1. It was the fourth country to do so, after the United Kingdom, the United States and Japan.\n",
      "\tNews of trouble on the CanSino deal first appeared in early July when the doses still hadn't been approved for export by China. Canada walked away from the deal at the end of August when it became clear it would not happen.\n",
      "\tBy then, Canada had deals with four other vaccine companies, including Moderna, Pfizer/BioNTech, Johnson & Johnson, and NovaVax. It added deals with Sanofi/GlaxoSmithKline and AstraZeneca in September and then with Canada's own Medicago the next month.\n",
      "\tAnand said Canada approached every contract with a similar goal -- to get 20 million doses guaranteed, and options to potentially buy more later on. In all, Canada is paying more than $1 billion to the seven vaccine makers for 194 million doses, even if those vaccines never get beyond the experimental stage.\n",
      "\tAnother 220 million doses are available if Canada asks for them, a decision that will be made for the vaccines that are proving to be the best. Anand announced Friday another 20 million doses will come to Canada in 2021 from Moderna, for a total of 40 million.\n",
      "\tThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Dec. 5, 2020.\n",

      "\t\"The confirmation of approval by the National Health Regulatory Authority of the kingdom of Bahrain followed thorough analysis and review undertaken by the authority of all available data,\" the kingdom said on its state-run Bahrain News Agency.\n",

      "\t\"We have developed detailed logistical plans and tools to support effective vaccine transport, storage and continuous temperature monitoring, Pfizer said. \"Our distribution is built on a flexible just in time system which will ship the frozen vials to the point of vaccination.\"\n",
      "\tThe immediate challenge for Bahrain would be the conditions in which the vaccine must be kept. They must be stored and shipped at ultra-cold temperatures of around minus 70 degrees Celsius (minus 94 degrees Fahrenheit). Bahrain is a Mideast nation that regularly sees temperatures in the summer of around 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) with high humidity.\n",
      "\tBahrain does have a state-owned carrier, Gulf Air, that it could use to transport the vaccines. In the nearby United Arab Emirates, the Dubai-based long-haul carrier Emirates has already said it is preparing its facilities to distribute vaccines at ultra-cold temperatures.\n",
      "\tThe vaccine also requires two doses be given three weeks apart.\n",
      "\tBahrain had already granted emergency-use authorization for a Chinese vaccine made by Sinopharm and has inoculate some 6,000 people with it. That vaccine, an \"inactivated\" shot made by growing the whole virus in a lab and then killing it, also is in use in the UAE.\n",
      "\t\"The approval of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine will add a further important layer to the kingdom's national COVID-19 response, which has strongly prioritized protecting the health of all citizens and residents during the pandemic,\" said Dr. Mariam al-Jalahma, the CEO of Bahrain's National Health Regulatory Authority.\n",
      "\tBioNTech, which owns the vaccine, said it has so far signed deals to supply 570 million doses worldwide in 2021, with options to deliver 600 million more. It hopes to supply at least 1.3 billion in 2021.\n",

      "CONTENT : WASHINGTON, D.C. -- \n",
      "\tThe top U.S. intelligence official stepped up the Trump administration's harsh attacks on Beijing on Thursday, labelling China the biggest threat to democracy and freedom worldwide since the Second World War and saying it was bent on global domination.\n",
      "\t\"The intelligence is clear: Beijing intends to dominate the U.S. and the rest of the planet economically, militarily and technologically,\" Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe said in an opinion article on the Wall Street Journal website.\n",
      "\tRatcliffe, a former Republican congressman appointed by U.S. President Donald Trump to the top U.S. spy job last spring, said China posed \"the greatest threat to America today, and the greatest threat to democracy and freedom world-wide since World War Two.\"\n",
      "\tHe said he had shifted resources within the US$85 billion annual federal budget allocated to intelligence to increase the focus on China.\n",
      "\tRatcliffe said China's economic espionage approach was threefold: \"Rob, Replicate and Replace.\"\n",
      "\tHe said the strategy was for Chinese entities to steal American companies' intellectual property, copy it and then supplant U.S. companies in the global market place.\n",
      "\tA spokesperson for the Chinese embassy rejected Ratcliffe's comments as \"fact-distorting\" and hypocritical and said they showed \"the entrenched Cold-War mindset and ideological prejudices of some people on the U.S. side.\"\n",
      "\tBeijing has frequently called on U.S. leaders to dial back their rhetoric on China, which it blames on fear of China's growing role in the world.\n",
      "\tRatcliffe's essay was the latest broadside against China from Trump's administration as it seeks to cement the outgoing president's tough-on-China legacy following his Nov. 3 election defeat.\n",
      "\tTrump's approach has taken relations between the world's two largest economies to their lowest point in decades and analysts say it could limit the incoming Biden administration's room for manoeuvre in dealing with Beijing.\n",
      "\tRatcliffe alluded to reports collected by U.S. intelligence agencies that Chinese representatives have sought to interfere in U.S. domestic politics.\n",
      "\tHe also charged that China had stolen U.S. defense technology to fuel President Xi Jinping's aggressive military modernization plans.\n",
      "\t\"The election is over. Now let’s all be honest about China,\" Ratcliffe told Reuters after the article was published.\n",
      "\tAmong other issues, Washington and Beijing have clashed over China's handling of the coronavirus outbreak, its tightening grip on Hong Kong, its disputed claims in the South China Sea, trade and accusations of human rights crimes in Xinjiang.\n",
      "\tRatcliffe, who served only briefly on the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee before Trump appointed him to his role, has been accused by Democrats and current and former intelligence officials of politicizing intelligence.\n",
      "\tIn his essay, Ratcliffe said Chinese authorities had \"conducted human testing\" on members of the Chinese army \"in hopes of developing soldiers with biologically enhanced capabilities.\" He did not elaborate.\n",
      "\tU.S.-based think tanks have reported that China is giving increasing importance to biotechnology in its military strategy but they have not released detailed reports about the kind of testing alleged by Ratcliffe.\n",
      "\tOn Thursday, the Trump administration restricted travel to the United States by members of China's ruling Communist Party and their families.\n",
      "\tOn Wednesday, it banned cotton imports from a quasi-military organization in Xinjiang it says uses forced labor of detained Muslims, while the House passed a law to kick Chinese firms off U.S. stock exchanges if they do not comply with auditing rules.\n",
      "\tChina accused U.S. politicians of fabricating news of detained Muslims being forced into labor in Xinjiang.\n",
      "\tIn an emailed statement, the embassy spokesperson said \"no one deserves the title of Empire of Hacking and Spying better than the U.S.\" and charged that both the U.S. government and U.S. firms had long carried out \"large-scale, organized and indiscriminate cyber theft, surveillance and attack.\"\n",
      "\tBonnie Glaser, an Asia expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank, said Ratcliffe's comments appeared aimed at locking in a tough approach before President-elect Joe Biden takes office on Jan. 20.\n",
      "\t\"It does appear to part of a broader effort to tie Biden's hands and limit his room to maneuver on China policy,\" she said.\n",
      "\t\"In prior administrations, the norm has been to avoid taking such actions during a presidential transition, but the Trump administration has long set a pattern of bucking the norm.\" \n",

      "\tAstronauts are harvesting fresh radishes grown in space, a delicious prospect that also could help seed food production efforts for longer-term missions to the moon and Mars.\n",
      "\tOn Monday, NASA flight engineer Kate Rubins pulled out 20 radish plants grown in the space station's Advanced Plant Habitat, wrapping them in foil for cold storage until they can make the voyage back to Earth next year.\n",
      "\tRadishes are the latest type of fresh produce to be successfully grown and harvested in zero gravity, joining \"Outredgeous\" red romaine lettuce, green lettuce, Chinese cabbage, lentils and mustard, according to a NASA fact sheet.\n",
      "\t\"I've worked on APH since the beginning, and each new crop that we're able to grow brings me great joy because what we learn from them will help NASA send astronauts to Mars and bring them back safely,\" said Nicole Dufour, the Advanced Plant Habitat program manager at NASA's Kennedy Space Center, in a news release.\n",
      "\tBack on the ground, scientists at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida are growing radishes in a control group set for harvest on December 15. The researchers will compare the space-grown radishes to the veggies grown on Earth, checking on how space produce measures up on providing the minerals and nutrients astronauts need as they prepare for longer trips.\n",
      "\tMeanwhile, astronauts will repeat the radish experiment in the heavens, planting and harvesting another round of radish crop to give scientists more data to draw from.\n",
      "\tWith their short cultivation time, radishes present potential advantages as a food source for future astronauts embarking on deep space missions in years to come. The radishes grow quickly, and they can reach full maturity in 27 days.\n",
      "\tThe root vegetables also don't require much maintenance from the crew as they grow.\n",
      "\t\"Radishes provide great research possibilities by virtue of their sensitive bulb formation,\" said Karl Hasenstein, a professor of biology at the University of Louisiana and the principal investigator on the project, in a news release.\n",
      "\tResearchers will analyze the effects of carbon dioxide on the radishes as well as how the vegetables acquire and distribute minerals, according to Hasenstein, who has run plant experiments with NASA since 1995.\n",
      "\tAstronauts have grown 15 different types of plants on the station, including eight different types of leafy greens. And NASA has already tested more than 100 crops on Earth, identifying which candidates to try out next in space.\n",
      "\t\"Growing a range of crops helps us determine which plants thrive in microgravity and offer the best variety and nutritional balance for astronauts on long-duration missions,\" Dufour said.\n",
      "\tThe latest experiments build upon ongoing research growing and harvesting plants in space.\n",
      "\tResearchers at NASA began experiments using its Vegetable Production Systems growth chambers back in 2014 shortly after they were delivered to the space station.\n",
      "\tSome of the early experiments with red romaine lettuce resulted in a paper, published this March in the journal Frontiers in Plant Science, showing that space lettuce was safe to eat.\n",
      "\tIn August 2015, NASA shared a video that features American astronauts Dr. Kjell Lindgren and Scott Kelly floating aboard the station, saying \"Cheers\" and eating the space-grown treat.\n",
      "\t\"Tastes good,\" Kelly said.\n",
      "\tLindgren tweeted about how he put his lettuce into a space cheeseburger for dinner.\n",
      "\tGetting space agriculture right matters because the nutrients in the prepackaged food that astronauts currently eat in space degrade over a period of time, NASA said.\n",
      "\tGetting humans to Mars and back safely over a two- or three-year mission requires growing food along the way. That not only gives astronauts more of a vibrant supply of fresh nutrients on the voyage; it also serves an emotional need as they tend to crops that are both a figurative and literal taste of home, according to the agency.\n",
      "\tThe NASA Artemis program aims to land the first woman and next man on the moon in 2024, and to establish a sustained presence on the moon by 2028. From there, the agency will be poised to begin staging its next big leap, to Mars.\n",
      "\tBut before we make it to the red planet, we've first got to make a tasty green space salad.\n",

      "\tChina's senior diplomat in Australia said Prime Minister Scott Morrison overreacted to a social media post about alleged war crimes by Australian soldiers in Afghanistan, adding that his actions drew more attention to the report.\n",
      "\tEarlier this week, Morrison said that a Chinese official's tweet showing the fake image of an Australian soldier appearing to slit a child's throat was \"truly repugnant\" and merits an apology, which has not come from China.\n",
      "\t\"I think it's unfortunate that this issue evolved in such a way that has gone astray and now there is a much larger visibility of the Brereton report in China,\" China's deputy ambassador, Wang Xining, said Friday. \"More people are attentive to what happened in Afghanistan. People wonder why a national leader would have such a strong opinion to an artwork done by a normal young artist in China.\"\n",
      "\tHe was referring to a disturbing report by Australia's military earlier this month that found evidence that elite Australian troops unlawfully killed 39 Afghan prisoners, farmers and civilians during the conflict in Afghanistan. It recommended that 19 soldiers be referred to federal police for criminal investigation.\n",
      "\tIt followed a four-year investigation by Maj. Gen. Paul Brereton, a judge and army reservist who was asked to look into the allegations and interviewed more than 400 witnesses and reviewed thousands of pages of documents.\n",
      "\tZhao Lijian, a spokesman for China's Foreign Ministry, posted the graphic image that shows a grinning soldier holding a bloodied knife to the throat of a veiled child, who is holding a lamb.\n",
      "\tZhao wrote a caption with the tweet saying: \"Shocked by murder of Afghan civilians & prisoners by Australian soldiers. We strongly condemn such acts, & call for holding them accountable.\"\n",
      "\tMany of Australia's allies have been critical of the tweet, with the European Union calling it \"irresponsible.\"\n",
      "\t\"We consider the deliberate dissemination of a fabricated image via social media accounts affiliated with China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs to be irresponsible, insensitive, and not at all constructive, particularly given the subject in question,\" said an EU spokesman.\n",
      "\t\"Such behaviour and use of information tools to disseminate fabricated images or information cannot be justified.\"\n",
      "\tOfficials from the United States, New Zealand and Canada have also criticized the Chinese tweet.\n",
      "\tThe rift between the two nations has grown since the Australian government called for an independent inquiry into the origins of the coronavirus pandemic. China has since imposed tariffs and other restrictions on a number of Australian exports, most recently to its lucrative wine industry.\n",

      "\tA Chinese spacecraft lifted off from the moon Thursday night with a load of lunar rocks, the first stage of its return to Earth, the government space agency reported.\n",
      "\tChang'e 5, the third Chinese spacecraft to land on the moon and the first to take off from it again, is the latest in a series of increasingly ambitious missions for Beijing's space program, which also has a orbiter and rover headed to Mars.\n",
      "\tThe Chang'e 5 touched down Tuesday on the Sea of Storms on the moon's near side. Its mission: collect about 2 kilograms (4 pounds) of lunar rocks and bring them back to Earth, the first return of samples since Soviet spacecraft did so in the 1970s. Earlier, the U.S. Apollo astronauts brought back hundreds of pounds of moon rocks.\n",
      "\tThe landing site is near a formation called the Mons Rumker and may contain rocks billions of years younger than those retrieved earlier.\n",
      "\tThe ascent vehicle lifted off from the moon shortly after 11 p.m. Beijing time Thursday (1500 GMT) and was due to rendezvous with a return vehicle in lunar orbit, then transfer the samples to a capsule, according to the China National Space Administration. The moon rocks and debris were sealed inside a special canister to avoid contamination.\n",
      "\tIt wasn't clear when the linkup would occur. After the transfer, the ascent module would be ejected and the capsule would remain in lunar orbit for about a week, awaiting the optimal time to make the trip back to Earth.\n",
      "\tChinese officials have said the capsule with the samples is due to land on Earth around the middle of the month. Touchdown is planned for the grasslands of Inner Mongolia, where China's astronauts have made their return in Shenzhou spacecraft.\n",
      "\tChang'e 5's lander, which remained on the moon, was capable of scooping samples from the surface and drilling 2 metres (about 6 feet).\n",
      "\tWhile retrieving samples was its main task, the lander also was equipped to extensively photograph the area, map conditions below the surface with ground penetrating radar and analyze the lunar soil for minerals and water content.\n",
      "\tRight before the ascent vehicle lifted off, the lander unfurled what the space administration called the first free-standing Chinese flag on the moon. The agency posted an image -- apparently taken from the lander -- of the ascend vehicle firing its engines as it took off.\n",
      "\tChang'e 5 has revived talk of China one day sending astronauts to the moon and possibly building a scientific base there, although no timeline has been proposed for such projects.\n",
      "\tChina launched its first temporary orbiting laboratory in 2011 and a second in 2016. Plans call for a permanent space station after 2022, possibly to be serviced by a reusable space plane.\n",
      "\tWhile China is boosting co-operation with the European Space Agency and others, interactions with NASA are severely limited by U.S. concerns over the secretive nature and close military links of the Chinese program.\n",

      "\tJamie Romak, of London Ont. has won the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum’s 2020 Tip O’Neill Award.\n",
      "\tThe award goes to the Canadian player “judged to have excelled in individual achievement and team contribution while adhering to baseball’s highest ideals.”\n",
      "\tWhile the win is certainly an honour it is also rare.\n",
      "\tThat is because Romak is not a current Major League Baseball player, instead he plays for the SK Wyverns of the Korean Baseball Organization (KBO).\n",
      "\tRomak was up against MLB players such as Tyler O’Neill, Joey Votto, Vladimir Guerrero Jr., Jordan Romano, Cal Quantrill, and Rowan Wick.\n",
      "\tAlso in the running was Brock Dykxhoorn who pitches in the Chinese Professional Baseball League.\n",
      "\tRomak played a full season in 2020 hitting 32 home runs with 91 RBIs and finished with a .399 on-base percentage.\n",
      "\tThose numbers are the best by any Canadian professional player for 2020.\n",

      "CONTENT : GUADALAJARA -- \n",
      "\tEarly next year, a Chinese businessman named Gan Xianbing will be sentenced in a Chicago courtroom for laundering just over US$530,000 in Mexican cartel drug money.\n",
      "\tGan, 50, was convicted in February of money laundering and operating an unlicensed money-transfer business that whisked cartel cash from U.S. drug sales offshore. Gan has maintained his innocence; his lawyers say he was entrapped by U.S. authorities. The trial garnered few headlines and little of the public fascination reserved for kingpins of powerful narcotics syndicates that U.S. federal prosecutors said Gan served.\n",
      "\tStill, U.S. law enforcement officials told Reuters that Chinese \"money brokers\" such as Gan represent one of the most worrisome new threats in their war on drugs. They say small cells of Chinese criminals have upended the way narcotics cash is laundered and are displacing the Mexican and Colombian money men that have long dominated the trade.\n",
      "\tVirtually unheard of a decade ago, these Chinese players are moving vast sums quickly and quietly, authorities said. Their expertise: routing cartel drug profits from the United States to China then on to Mexico with a few clicks of a burner phone and Chinese banking apps – and without the bulky cash ever crossing borders. The launderers pay small Chinese-owned businesses in the United States and Mexico to help them move the funds. Most contact with the banking system happens in China, a veritable black hole for U.S. and Mexican authorities.\n",
      "\tChinese money brokers based in Mexico \"have come to dominate international money laundering markets,\" U.S. prosecutors said in a Sept. 24 sentencing memorandum for Gan's case.\n",
      "\tReuters spoke to more than a dozen law enforcement officials, diplomats, lawyers and sources familiar with the Gan case or Chinese money laundering techniques. The news organization also examined more than 1,500 pages of documents from the trial. The material included previously unreported details about how the ring operated compiled by prosecutors and agents of Homeland Security Investigations, the investigative arm of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security that led the probe.\n",
      "\tWhat emerged was a blueprint showing how some groups of Chinese money brokers have become key cogs in the multi-billion-dollar drug empires run by Latin American cartels. The Chinese role presents a formidable challenge for U.S. anti-narcotics efforts at a time of rising tensions between Beijing and Washington.\n",
      "\tGan, who U.S. prosecutors said operated a tight ring with another Chinese money broker, was apprehended in November 2018 by Homeland Security Investigations agents at Los Angeles International Airport on his way to Mexico from Hong Kong. The U.S. government said that Gan had moved anywhere from $25 million to $65 million in illicit drug proceeds from 2016 to the time of his arrest, according to a September court filing by Gan's attorneys.\n",
      "\tBased in Guadalajara, the ring is believed to have worked with multiple syndicates, including the famed Sinaloa Cartel that was previously led by jailed Mexican drug lord Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman, according to two U.S.-based sources familiar with the investigation.\n",
      "\tThe U.S. Department of the Treasury and Europol, the European Union's law enforcement arm, have warned about the expanding web of Chinese crime groups laundering drug money. Europol in November 2019 said these groups present a \"growing threat to Europe,\" while the U.S. Treasury in February placed Chinese professional money laundering networks on its list of \"key threats\" and vulnerabilities within the U.S. financial system.\n",
      "\tU.S. law enforcement has stepped up operations against these groups. In addition to the Gan case in Illinois, federal prosecutors have brought charges in Virginia and Oregon against alleged members of at least two other Chinese money laundering rings since October of last year. Those cases are pending.\n",
      "\tStill, a senior U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agent said U.S. efforts to nail Latin American drug capos by following the money have gotten much more difficult.\n",
      "\t\"I can't emphasize this enough, the involvement of the Chinese has really complicated all of these schemes,\" the DEA official said.\n",
      "\tGan, who declined to testify in court, pleaded not guilty to three counts of money laundering, one count of conspiracy to launder money and one count of operating an unlicensed money transmitting business. He was acquitted on the conspiracy charge. Reuters did not receive a reply to requests for comment from Gan sent to his legal team.\n",
      "\tHis lawyers, in a September sentencing plea document, said Gan was not the mastermind of the operation, rather a seafood exporter who was duped into letting his bank account in China be used to launder money by another Mexico-based Chinese national named Pan Haiping. Glenn Seiden, Gan's lawyer, declined to speak with Reuters or answer questions about Gan's case.\n",
      "\tAttorney Aaron Schwartz, who was part of the defense team, said he wanted to make it clear that Gan did not cooperate with the U.S. government because his client feared for the safety of his family in Guadalajara, where the powerful Jalisco New Generation cartel holds sway. Gan's lawyers also allege Gan was entrapped in a sting operation by Homeland Security Investigations agents working with an informant who helped arrange the transactions that resulted in their client's conviction. The agency said it does not comment on ongoing investigations.\n",
      "\tPan Haiping, Gan's alleged associate, was detained earlier this year in Mexico on accusations of money laundering and is awaiting extradition to the United States, according to the two U.S. sources familiar with the investigation and a senior Mexican federal police source. Pan Haiping could not be reached for comment. The Mexican prosecutor's office declined to comment on Pan Haiping's case or provide the name of his legal counsel in Mexico, saying it cannot comment on ongoing cases.\n",
      "\tIn a March 2019 U.S. indictment unsealed a few weeks ago, Pan Haiping was charged with laundering almost $500,000 for Mexican cartels; running an illegal money transmitting business in Illinois; and conspiring to launder money using bank accounts in China, including an account belonging to Gan.\n",
      "\tAnother alleged conspirator, Long Huanxin, was arrested in February at Vancouver International Airport by Canadian law enforcement acting on a warrant from U.S. authorities, according to Canadian court transcripts from Long's detention hearing. Long was extradited to the United States, and last month he pleaded not guilty in Chicago to charges of money laundering for Mexican cartels, U.S. court documents show. Long's lawyer did not respond to a request for comment.\n",
      "\tU.S officials informally sought assistance from China in the Gan case but received no support in their investigation, according to the two U.S. sources familiar with the probe.\n",
      "\tChina's Foreign Ministry disputed their account. The ministry told Reuters in late October that it did not receive a request from U.S. authorities for help on that case. China stands ready to cooperate with the United States to \"destroy drug cartels and drug-related money-laundering networks,\" the ministry said in a statement. But it stressed the need for the two countries to work on the \"principle of respecting each other's laws, equality and mutual benefit,\" the statement said.\n",
      "\tThe ministry said most Chinese bank-account holders about whom Washington has inquired as part of its money laundering investigations in recent years were \"legitimate enterprises and individuals\" in China. \"After we asked the U.S. side to provide drug-related clues or evidence of enterprises and individuals, the U.S. side has not responded,\" China's Foreign Ministry said in the statement.\n",
      "\tWithout help from Beijing to track money flows in China and to infiltrate the laundering networks, U.S. agents say they face an uphill struggle to catch culprits.\n",
      "\t\"It's the most sophisticated form of money laundering that's ever existed,\" one of the U.S. sources familiar with the investigation said.\n",
      "\tKey to cracking the case was Lim Seok Pheng, a New York-based member of the ring who became a cooperating witness for the U.S. government following her May 2018 arrest on suspicion of money laundering.\n",
      "\tA Singapore national, Lim said at Gan's trial that she once peddled footwear and had first met Gan in China where he ran a shoe factory before he relocated to Guadalajara in 2011. Lim testified that Gan recruited her to join the illicit operation in 2016 and that she became lovers with the other alleged ringleader, Pan Haiping.\n",
      "\tFollowing her arrest at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport, Lim agreed to wear a recording device to help authorities gather evidence against Gan and the other alleged conspirators. She also brought undercover Homeland Security Investigations agents into the operation as money couriers on three separate cash pick-ups in Chicago that led to Gan's conviction, according to the trial testimony of Lim and the agents.\n",
      "\tLim pleaded guilty to money laundering charges in November 2019 and is out on bail, awaiting sentencing.\n",
      "\tShe and her attorney declined to comment.\n",
      "\tThe only thing tougher than moving illegal drugs across borders is getting the profits back to Mexico's cartels, U.S. officials said. Cash is heavy, and transporting it exposes traffickers to lots of risk. Putting it into the banking system is perilous, too. The U.S. and Mexican financial systems have been geared to detect dirty money.\n",
      "\tProsecutors told the court that Gan and his accomplices sidestepped these obstacles by first moving the U.S. cash offshore to China, then on to Mexico. Lim was a linchpin connecting both sides of the Pacific. In her November 2019 plea agreement, Lim admitted to laundering, with Gan and Pan Haiping, about $48 million in drug cash between 2016 and September 2017. She took a 0.5% commission, the agreement said.\n",
      "\tLim testified at Gan's trial that she had two jobs. The first was collecting drug money in U.S. cities such as Chicago and New York from cartel contacts, typically anywhere from $150,000 to $1 million at a time. She would wait in a public place, armed with a burner phone, a code name and the serial number of an authentic $1 bill. Mexican cartels would pass on her details to their dealer contacts, who would call Lim's burner phone and use the code name to identify themselves. At the rendezvous point, Lim would give them the $1 bill with the corresponding serial number as a \"receipt\" to verify the handoff had taken place, Lim said at trial.\n",
      "\tLim's other job was recruiting businesses in the Chinese diaspora to help them make that cash disappear, Lim and prosecutors said.\n",
      "\tSome U.S.-based Chinese merchants have long engaged in off-the-books currency \"swaps\" to avoid hefty bank fees. Such transactions are illegal in the United States, American authorities said, if they are used by companies routinely to skirt the formal banking system or to operate an unauthorized money transfer business. In some cases these informal, hawala-style transactions are used to help wealthy Chinese move money clandestinely out of China, in violation of that nation's currency controls.\n",
      "\tThe operation run by Gan and Pan Haiping grew to include at least three Chinese merchants in New York, who were paid commissions to participate, Lim told the court. The names of the Chinese merchants were not revealed at Gan's trial, and it's unclear if they knew of Lim's links to drug trafficking.\n",
      "\tProsecutors at trial presented testimony, evidence and graphics showing how the transactions worked. At their simplest, authorities said, that process worked as follows: Lim would arrive at one of the merchants with, say, $150,000 in cartel cash. With the businessperson observing, she would open a currency converter app on her smartphone to obtain the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Chinese yuan. She would also hand over the details of a bank account in China given to her by Gan. In what's known as a \"mirror transaction,\" the Chinese businessperson would take possession of the $150,000 in U.S. currency while simultaneously transferring the equivalent in Chinese yuan from their own account in China to the bank account number provided by Gan.\n",
      "\tThe result was that a foreign transfer of funds had been made without involving a U.S financial institution - or the accompanying digital fingerprints. The Chinese business had effectively used yuan from its China-based bank account to purchase cash dollars now on hand in the United States; it earned a commission for its trouble while avoiding bank fees and U.S. government scrutiny.\n",
      "\tMeanwhile, Gan had converted U.S. drug dollars into Chinese currency now sitting in a Chinese bank. The only contact with the financial system – a domestic transfer between two accounts in China – would be unlikely to raise red flags with Chinese banking authorities unaware of the money's provenance.\n",
      "\tThe crime ring used various Chinese banks for the operations, including the Bank of China, according to WhatsApp messages exchanged between Gan and Pan Haiping. The messages were extracted from Gan's iPhone by Homeland Security Investigations agents after his arrest, and key excerpts were read out aloud by prosecutors at trial, according to court transcripts.\n",
      "\tBank of China did not respond to requests for comment.\n",
      "\tTo get the money from China to Mexico, Gan performed the same sort of mirror transactions, only this time with the help of Chinese businesses who had access to pesos in Mexico. This leg of the journey was described by the two U.S. sources familiar with the investigation and is outlined in court documents, including the U.S. government's September 2020 sentencing memorandum for Gan and the June 2019 superseding indictment detailing charges against him.\n",
      "\tU.S. prosecutors said the laundered money was delivered to Pan Haiping's Mexican drug cartel clients, according to the superseding indictment. No Mexican banks were named in any of the court documents reviewed by Reuters.\n",
      "\tIn October, Reuters traveled to Guadalajara and found Gan's wife, Pan Emi (no relation to Pan Haiping), working in a busy store she owns in the city's Chinese quarter selling wigs, plastic jewelry, sunglasses and other low-cost merchandise imported from China.\n",
      "\tManning the cash register, Pan Emi said her husband was innocent of wrongdoing and being unfairly portrayed by authorities as a criminal when he was nothing more than a plucky businessman. She said no Mexican or U.S. law enforcement agents had contacted her about the case.\n",
      "\tShe said Gan, fed up with high Chinese taxes, had left his shoe factory in the Chinese city of Wenzhou nearly a decade ago seeking a better life in Mexico. In Guadalajara, she said, Gan co-founded a business exporting jellyfish, which are considered a delicacy and an aphrodisiac in China. Pan Emi said her \"super friendly\" husband built a large network of friends and contacts in Mexico and was always on the phone.\n",
      "\tPan Emi confirmed some details of the case. She said her husband knew Pan Haiping and Lim and had participated in currency swaps with other Chinese merchants. But she denied Gan was involved with traffickers or knew anything about drug money.\n",
      "\tShe said currency swaps were common in the expatriate Chinese business community to avoid pricey fees and lousy exchange rates offered by banks.\n",
      "\t\"These swaps that we do with each other are easy. It's no big problem,\" Pan Emi said. \"I don't think it's illegal.\"\n",
      "\tMoney brokers like Gan and Pan Haiping are growing in number among the large Chinese diasporas in the United States, Europe and Latin America, according to three DEA officials.\n",
      "\tDemand for their services is being driven by affluent Chinese looking to evade China's currency controls and move wealth abroad, the DEA officials told Reuters. Beijing limits the amount of money its citizens can transfer out of China to the equivalent of $50,000 U.S. dollars annually.\n",
      "\tLatin American cartels, flush with dollars and euros from drug sales, are uniquely placed to satisfy the Chinese appetite for hard currencies. Some Chinese expatriates located in drug-producing countries such as Mexico, Colombia and Peru are the intermediaries bridging these disparate sets of people, said Donald Im, a senior DEA agent and anti-money laundering specialist.\n",
      "\t\"When there is need by the cartels for cash to be laundered, and there is demand for cash from the Chinese, you have a perfect marriage made in heaven,\" Im told Reuters. \"The Chinese brokers are very important to the Mexican and Colombian cartels.\"\n",
      "\tIn the case of Gan, it was a lucrative business, according to conversations between his alleged associates taped by Homeland Security Investigations agents. \"He has made $1 million already because of us, for real,\" Pan Haiping told Lim in August 2017, according to transcripts of intercepted phone communications presented at Gan's trial.\n",
      "\tChinese money launderers are squeezing out Mexican and Colombian rivals by undercutting them on price by as much as half, U.S. officials said. The Chinese operators have been able to do that because they levy fees on both sides of each transaction. They impose fat commissions as high as 10% on Chinese citizens eager to get money out of China. That allows the Chinese money brokers, in turn, to charge traffickers nominal fees of just a few percentage points. The money launderers still turn a handsome profit while locking in a steady supply of coveted dollars and euros from cartel customers.\n",
      "\tDEA agent Im said the Chinese expats had the \"systems and the infrastructure\" in place not only to launder the drug proceeds but to do it so cheaply that drug cartels receive back \"almost 100%\" of their dirty money.\n",
      "\tChinese money brokers have also managed to avoid choosing sides in Mexico's cartel wars, even coordinating money contracts with both the Sinaloa and Jalisco New Generation cartels on the same day, according to a second senior DEA agent, who spoke on condition of anonymity.\n",
      "\tTraffickers use other so-called trade-based money laundering schemes to move drug money from China to Mexico, according to the DEA and Mexican government officials who spoke with Reuters. In July, Mexico's Financial Intelligence Unit, an investigative agency, said publicly that Chinese nationals laundering money for the Jalisco New Generation cartel were using drug proceeds to buy shoes in bulk from China, then reselling them in Mexico to get the gang their cash.\n",
      "\tChinese exports to Mexico, including electronics, clothing and other consumer goods, have nearly doubled over the past decade to $83 billion in 2019. The surge has allowed drug cartels and their money launderers to piggyback on this burgeoning trade relationship, authorities said.\n",
      "\tIn Guadalajara, Pan Emi said e-mail exchanges with her husband's U.S. lawyers left her optimistic ahead of Gan's looming sentencing. Prosecutors have asked for a 20-year jail term; Gan's defense attorneys have argued for no more than two years.\n",
      "\tPan Emi said business was going well in Mexico and she had no desire to return to China. \"I hope my husband comes back,\" she said.\n",

      "\tChina on Thursday accused critics in the U.S. government of \"an escalation of political suppression\" against Beijing following new visa restrictions on members of China's ruling Communist Party and their immediate family members.\n",
      "\tForeign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said China would \"make representations\" to the U.S. over its decision to limit such people to one-month, single-entry visas.\n",
      "\tHua called Washington's approach \"totally inconsistent with the U.S.'s own interests,\" and said it would damage America's global image.\n",
      "\t\"I think it is obvious to all that this is an escalation of political suppression by some extreme anti-China forces in the U.S. out of strong ideological prejudice and deep-rooted Cold War mentality against China,\" Hua said at a daily briefing.\n",
      "\tThe State Department said in a statement Thursday that the new restrictions are intended to protect the U.S. from the Chinese Communist Party's \"malign influence.\"\n",
      "\t\"For decades we allowed the CCP free and unfettered access to U.S. institutions and businesses while these same privileges were never extended freely to U.S. citizens in China,\" it said.\n",
      "\tIt wasn't clear how the restrictions would be enforced since many of the party's 92 million members do not play active public roles in its institutions.\n",
      "\tThe restrictions are the latest punitive measure taken against China's leadership and economy amid sharpening disputes over human rights, the coronavirus pandemic, trade, technology, Taiwan and a host of other issues.\n",
      "\tOn Wednesday, the U.S. said it would block imports from a major Chinese producer of cotton goods because of its reliance on workers detained as part of a crackdown on ethnic minorities in China's northwest.\n",
      "\tWashington has already slapped travel bans and financial sanctions on officials connected to the crackdown on Uighurs and other Chinese Muslim groups in Xinjiang, as well as on Chinese and Hong Kong officials it accuses of restricting social and political rights in the semi-autonomous Chinese city through the implementation of a harsh new national security law.\n",
      "\tDiplomatic ties hit a low point over the summer when the U.S. ordered the closure of the Chinese consulate in Houston and China responded by demanding the U.S. vacate its consulate in the southwestern city of Chengdu.\n",
      "\tWashington had been loosening restrictions on travel by Chinese to the U.S., seeking to take advantage of the lavish spending habits of China's newly wealthy. Beginning in 2014, Chinese travellers -- whether party members or not -- became eligible for multiple-entry visas valid for 10 years, with stays of 180 days allowed for each entry, while students were permitted visas good for five years. China reciprocated with similar treatment for U.S. citizens.\n",
      "\tChinese who make up the single largest group of foreign students at American universities have already complained of tougher conditions for obtaining or extending visas. Chinese academics have also faced greater scrutiny, while dozens of journalists with state media have been forced to return home and visa restrictions placed on those remaining, prompting retaliation from Beijing.\n",
      "\tAnalysts have long speculated that President Donald Trump will impose harsher measures on China before leaving office on Jan. 20, placing President-elect Joe Biden in a bind in managing the increasingly fractious relationship.\n",

      "\tIBM security researchers say they have detected a cyberespionage effort using targeted phishing emails to try to collect vital information on the World Health Organization's initiative for distributing COVID-19 vaccine to developing countries.\n",
      "\tThe researchers said they could not be sure who was behind the campaign, which began in September, or if it was successful. But the precision targeting and careful efforts to leave no tracks bore \"the potential hallmarks of nation-state tradecraft,\" they said in a blog post Thursday.\n",
      "\tThe campaign's targets, in countries including Germany, Italy, South Korea and Taiwan, are likely associated with the development of the \"cold chain\" needed to ensure coronavirus vaccines get the nonstop sterile refrigeration they need to be effective for the nearly 3 billion people who live where temperature-controlled storage is insufficient, IBM said.\n",
      "\t\"Think of it as the bloodline that will be supplying the most vital vaccines globally,\" said Claire Zaboeva, an IBM analyst involved in the detection.\n",
      "\tWhoever is behind the operation could be motivated by a desire to learn how the vaccines are best able to be shipped and stored -- the entire refrigeration process -- in order to copy it, said Nick Rossmann, the IBM team's global threat intelligence lead. Or they might want to be able to undermine a vaccine's legitimacy or launch a disruptive or destructive attack, he added.\n",
      "\tIn the ploy, executives with groups likely associated with the initiative known as Covax -- created by the Gavi Vaccine Alliance, the World Health Organization and other UN agencies -- were sent spoofed emails appearing to come from an executive of Haier Biomedical, a Chinese company considered the world's main cold-chain supplier, the analyst said.\n",
      "\tThe phishing emails had malicious attachments that prompted recipients to enter credentials that could have been used to harvest sensitive information about partners vital to the vaccine-delivery platform.\n",
      "\tTargets included the European Commission's Directorate-General for Taxation and Customs Union and companies that make solar panels for powering portable vaccine refrigerators. Other targets were petrochemical companies, likely because they produce dry ice, which is used in the cold chain, Zaboeva said.\n",
      "\tThe EU agency has been busy revising new import and export regimes for coronavirus vaccines and would be a gold mine for hackers seeking stepping stones into partnering organizations, she said.\n",
      "\tCovax has struggled to raise enough money to compete for vaccine contracts against the world's wealthiest nations in the race to secure doses as fast as they can be produced. But the UN and Gavi have invested millions in cold-chain equipment across Africa and Asia. The investment, in the works well before the pandemic, was accelerated to prepare for an eventual global rollout of coronavirus vaccines.\n",
      "\tWhoever was behind the phishing operation likely sought \"advanced insight into the purchase and movement of a vaccine that can impact life and the global economy,\" the blog post said. Coronavirus vaccines will be one of the world's most sought-after products as they are distributed, so theft may also be a danger.\n",
      "\tLast month, Microsoft said it had detected mostly unsuccessful attempts by state-backed Russian and North Korean hackers to steal data from leading pharmaceutical companies and vaccine researchers. It gave no information on how many succeeded or how serious those breaches were. Chinese state-backed hackers have also targeted vaccine makers, the U.S. government said in announcing criminal charges in July.\n",
      "\tMicrosoft said most of the targets -- located in Canada, France, India, South Korea and the United States -- were researching vaccines and COVID-19 treatments. It did not name the targets.\n",
      "\tOn Wednesday, Britain became the first to country to authorize a rigorously tested COVID-19 vaccine, the one developed by American drugmaker Pfizer and Germany's BioNTech.\n",
      "\tOther countries aren't far behind: Regulators not only in the U.S. but in the European Union and Canada also are vetting the Pfizer vaccine along with a shot made by Moderna Inc. British and Canadian regulators are also considering a vaccine made by AstraZeneca and Oxford University.\n",
      "\tThe logistical challenges of distributing vaccines globally are huge. The Pfizer-BioNTech one must be stored and shipped at ultra-cold temperatures of around minus 70 degrees Celsius (minus 94 degrees Fahrenheit).\n",

      "CONTENT : WUHAN, CHINA -- \n",
      "\tSecrecy and cronyism at China's top disease control agency led to widespread test shortages and flaws that hampered the early response to the coronavirus outbreak, an Associated Press investigation has found.\n",
      "\tChina's Center for Disease Control and Prevention gave test kit designs and distribution rights exclusively to three then-obscure Shanghai companies with which officials had personal ties, according to the investigation. It was based on interviews with more than 40 doctors, CDC employees, health experts, and industry insiders, as well as hundreds of internal documents, contracts, messages and emails.\n",
      "\tThe Shanghai companies -- GeneoDx Biotech, Huirui Biotechnology, and BioGerm Medical Technology -- paid the China CDC for the information and the distribution rights, according to two sources with knowledge of the transaction who asked to remain anonymous to avoid retribution. The price: One million RMB (US$146,600) each, the sources said. It's unclear whether the money went to specific individuals.\n",
      "\tIn the meantime, the CDC and its parent agency, the National Health Commission, tried to prevent other scientists and organizations from testing for the virus with their own homemade kits. They took control of patient samples and made testing requirements to confirm coronavirus cases much more complicated.\n",
      "\tThe flawed testing system -- at a time when the virus could have been slowed -- stopped scientists and officials from seeing how fast it was spreading. Chinese authorities failed to report a single new case between Jan. 5 and 17, even as hundreds were infected in Wuhan, the city where the virus was first detected.\n",
      "\tThe apparent lull in cases meant officials were slow to take early actions such as warning the public or barring large gatherings. It also caused critical shortages of testing kits, barring access to care for many who were infected.\n",
      "\tThe testing problems, along with other mistakes and delays, allowed the virus to rip through Wuhan undetected and spread across the world in a pandemic that has now sickened 64 million people and killed almost 1.5 million.\n",
      "\tChina was hardly the only country to grapple with testing. In in the U.S., the CDC declined to use a WHO design and insisted on developing its own kits, which turned out to be faulty and led to even longer delays than in China. Still, the hiccups in China were especially consequential because it was the first country to detect the virus.\n",
      "\t\"Because you have only three companies providing testing kits, it kept the capacity of testing very limited,\" said Yanzhong Huang, a senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations. \"It was a major problem that led to the rapid increase in cases and deaths.\"\n",
      "\tChina's foreign ministry and China's top medical agency, the National Health Commission, did not respond to requests for comment.\n",
      "\tBut interviews and documents suggest that a culture of backdoor connections quietly flourished in a top-down, underfunded public health system. Though none of the first three diagnostics companies tapped to make test kits were well-known in the industry, there were extensive ties between the companies and top China CDC researchers.\n",
      "\tThe founder of BioGerm, Zhao Baihui, was the former chief technician of the Shanghai CDC's microbiology lab. Emails and financial records obtained by the AP show that Zhao first started BioGerm's predecessor through an intermediary in 2012, while she was still at the Shanghai CDC. In the next five years, she sold thousands of dollars' worth of test kits to her own workplace through the intermediary. After quitting the CDC in 2017, Zhao went on to spearhead lucrative contracts with Shanghai officials.\n",
      "\tZhao did not respond to requests for comment from the AP.\n",
      "\tAnother of the three companies, GeneoDx, enjoyed special access because it is a subsidiary of the state-run firm SinoPharm, which is managed directly by China's cabinet. In October 2019, GeneoDx co-organized an internal CDC training conference on emerging respiratory diseases in Shanghai. Tan Wenjie, the CDC official who ran the training, was later put in charge of developing test kits.\n",
      "\tGeneoDx did not respond to requests for comment or interviews. The National Health Commission did not respond to a request for a comment or an interview with Tan.\n",
      "\tThe last company, Huirui, is a longtime partner with Tan, the CDC official in charge of test kits. In an interview, CEO Li Hui said the CDC routinely contracted his company to make emergency testing chemicals. He denied any personal relationship with Tan or any payments to the CDC.\n",
      "\t\"We've been working with the CDC to respond to emerging new diseases for about ten years, not just for a day or two, it's normal,\" Li said.\n",
      "\tIt's unclear whether the agreements between the China CDC and the three test kit companies violated Chinese law.\n",
      "\tThey raise questions around potential violations of bribery laws, along with rules against abuse of authority, self-dealing and conflicts of interest, said James Zimmerman, a Beijing-based corporate attorney and former chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China.\n",
      "\tBut other experts caution that the state may have designated the three companies to make test kits under special laws on the procurement of emergency goods during natural disasters.\n",
      "\t\"Things will be different in the middle of a crisis,\" said Lesli Ligorner, a Beijing-based attorney specializing in anti-corruption law. \"I wouldn't be so quick to rush to judgement.\"\n",
      "\tThe first step in making test kits is to get samples of the virus and decode its genetic sequence. This leads to test designs, essentially a recipe for the tests.\n",
      "\tIn past outbreaks, the China CDC sent test designs and testing compounds to laboratories across the country just days after identifying the pathogen. But this time, they held back the genome and test designs. Instead, they finalized \"technology transfer\" agreements to give the test designs to the Shanghai companies, according to three people familiar with the matter. The selection process was kept secret.\n",
      "\tAt the same time, central CDC authorities stymied others from testing. Provincial CDC staff were told that instead of testing and reporting cases themselves, they had to send patient samples to designated labs in Beijing for full sequencing, a complicated and time-consuming procedure. As a result, for weeks, local CDC staff were unable to confirm new cases.\n",
      "\tAfter a Jan. 14 internal teleconference to order secret preparations for a pandemic, China's health authorities relaxed the requirements to confirm cases and started distributing the CDC-sanctioned test kits. A day after the first test kits finally arrived in Wuhan on Jan. 16, the case count began to rise again.\n",
      "\tBut the test kits from GeneoDx and Huirui had quality issues, turning out inconclusive results or false negatives. And technicians were hesitant to use test kits that would later prove more accurate from more established companies, because the CDC did not endorse them.\n",
      "\tAs a result, in the early days, getting a COVID test was so difficult that Wuhan residents compared it to winning the lottery.\n",
      "\tAmong the victims was Peng Yi, a 39-year-old schoolteacher who started coughing on Jan. 23. When he went to the hospital, he waited for eight hours, only to be turned away for a lack of test kits. Then, when he finally got tested on Jan. 30, it turned out negative, even as the virus ravaged his lungs.\n",
      "\tHis second test, on Feb. 4, turned out positive. It was too late. Weeks later, Peng passed away.\n",
      "\t\"There were very, very few tests, basically none -- if you couldn't prove you were positive, you couldn't get admitted to a hospital,\" his mother, Zhong Hanneng, said in a tearful interview in October. \"The doctor said there was nothing that could be done.\"\n",

      "\tA diplomatic war of words between Australia and China over a graphic tweet seemed to finally cool on Thursday as Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison struck a much more conciliatory tone.\n",
      "\tMorrison's change in approach came even after he was thwarted in getting his views out directly to Chinese people over the messaging app WeChat, after the Chinese company deleted his post on the grounds it could distort historical events and confuse the public.\n",
      "\tEarlier this week, Morrison expressed indignation and anger at the tweet posted by a Chinese official that showed a fake image of a grinning Australian soldier holding a bloodied knife to a child's throat.\n",
      "\tThe post took aim at alleged unlawful killings and abuses by Australian soldiers during the conflict in Afghanistan.\n",
      "\tEarlier this week, Morrison called the tweet \"truly repugnant\" and \"deeply offensive\" and demanded an apology from China. But China had not backed down, saying that Australia should be the one examining its actions.\n",
      "\tOn Thursday, Morrison took a much different approach, telling reporters in Canberra that his aim was for the two countries to have a \"happy coexistence.\"\n",
      "\t\"My position and my government's position is to seek constructive engagement,\" Morrison said. \"The relationship with China is a mutually beneficial one. It supports both our countries, it is good for both of our countries.\"\n",
      "\tChina is Australia's largest trading partner.\n",
      "\tMorrison said Australia had made its views very clear on both the tweet and the WeChat message.\n",
      "\tWeChat is ubiquitous in China and is used for everything from getting news to making electronic payments. The company is held responsible for ensuring content doesn't attract negative attention, and censorship is relatively common.\n",
      "\tTreasurer Josh Frydenberg said he was disappointed about both the tweet and the deleted post.\n",
      "\t\"What the prime minister did in his WeChat message before it was disappointingly deleted was he made it very clear Australia is proud of its service men and women who wear the uniform,\" Frydenberg said.\n",
      "\tThe rift between the two nations has grown since the Australian government called for an independent inquiry into the origins of the coronavirus pandemic. China has since imposed tariffs and other restrictions on a number of Australian exports.\n",

      "\t\"Australia's recession may be over, but Australia's economic recovery is not,\" he said.\n",

      "\tThe small German biotech firm BioNTech, started by a husband and wife team with Turkish roots, had never brought a vaccine to market before. \n",
      "\tBut its experimental technology has now become the first authorized for use in the Western world to help end the coronavirus pandemic.\n",
      "\tAlong with its U.S. partner Pfizer, BioNTech on Wednesday said its COVID-19 vaccine has been granted approval by Britain, with a rollout planned for as early as next week.\n",
      "\tMainz-based BioNTech was co-founded in 2008 by Ugur Sahin and his wife Ozlem Tureci, both scientists and the children of Turkish immigrants to Germany, as well as Austrian cancer expert Christoph Huber.\n",
      "\tIn normal times, BioNTech and its roughly 1,500 employees are focused on developing specialised immunotherapies for cancer patients based on \"messenger RNA\" (mRNA) molecules that trigger the building of proteins in cells, to stimulate the immune system.\n",
      "\tIt's this same technology, which has the benefit that it can be developed more quickly than traditional vaccines, that lies at the heart of its COVID-19 shot.\n",
      "\tThe vaccine will introduce synthetic mRNA into the human body to trick the immune system into producing the viral proteins needed to provoke a safe but robust offensive against the coronavirus.\n",
      "\tSahin, 54, jumped into action in January shortly after reading about the emergence of a new and deadly coronavirus in the Chinese city of Wuhan. \n",
      "\tBy the time much of the planet was in lockdown in March, BioNTech had developed 20 vaccine candidates based on mRNA technology, he told Der Spiegel weekly.\n",
      "\tThose were eventually whittled down to a handful of the most promising options, with vaccine BNT162b2 now the frontrunner.\n",
      "\tHaving struck a deal with U.S. pharma giant Pfizer to work together to develop mRNA-based flu vaccines in 2018, teaming up on a potential coronavirus vaccine was an obvious next move for BioNTech.\n",
      "\tThe two companies announced in March that they aimed to jointly develop a COVID-19 jab, \"pairing Pfizer's development, regulatory and commercial capabilities with BioNTech's mRNA vaccine technology and expertise\", they said at the time.\n",
      "\tWhile global headlines tend to lead with Pfizer's involvement, Sahin insisted to Spiegel: \"It is our technology.\"\n",
      "\tThe co-operation is a good fit because it allows BioNTech \"to develop and distribute a possible vaccine in the shortest time possible\", he added.\n",
      "\tThe BNT162b2 vaccine will require two jabs to be effective.\n",
      "\tBioNTech and Pfizer have said they expect to supply up to 50 million vaccine doses globally in 2020, and up to 1.3 billion in 2021.\n",
      "\tIn a clear sign that they were gearing up for mass production, BioNTech in September bought a manufacturing site in Marburg in western Germany from Swiss pharma group Novartis, along with its 300 employees, allowing it to produce millions of additional doses each year.\n",
      "\tBioNTech already has two other production sites in Germany, while at least four Pfizer sites in the United States and Europe will join in the unprecedented effort to roll out a vaccine at record speed.\n",
      "\tSahin had told AFP in an interview in November that if all the players involved -- governments, pharma companies and vaccine logistics firms -- \"do a really good job\", then \"we can succeed in vaccinating 60 to 70 percent of the population by the autumn of 2021.\"\n",
      "\t\"And when we've accomplished that then we could have a normal winter. Without another shutdown.\"\n",
      "\tBesides Britain, the European Union and a slew of countries including the US and Japan have already placed orders for millions of doses of the BioNTech-Pfizer vaccine as nations eagerly await the regulatory nods.\n",
      "\tBioNTech has also struck a deal with Shanghai-based Fosun Pharmaceutical Group, which will have the exclusive rights to bring the vaccine to China.\n",

      "\tHong Kong pro-democracy activist Joshua Wong has been sentenced to 13.5 months in prison after pleading guilty to inciting and organizing an unauthorized protest outside the city's police headquarters last year, during months of unrest over a proposed extradition bill with China.\n",
      "\tTwo other activists, Agnes Chow and Ivan Lam, were sentenced to 10 months and seven months in prison respectively over the protest on June 21, 2019. Chow faced charges relating to inciting and taking part in the protest, while Lam was charged with inciting the protest.\n",
      "\tThe trio -- all former members of the disbanded political party Demosisto -- had been remanded in custody since Nov. 23, and were transferred from prison to court to hear their sentences. Hundreds of supporters turned out at the West Kowloon Magistrates Court Wednesday, as well as a small number of pro-China demonstrators.\n",
      "\tIn a letter he wrote in prison, published on his social media accounts prior to sentencing, Wong -- who faced up to three years in jail -- described how he had been placed in solitary confinement after an X-ray allegedly revealed \"foreign objects\" in his stomach. A prison service representative did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Wong's claims. \n",
      "\tWong's lawyer, Jonathan Man, said his client \"was suffering during the period of solitary confinement,\" which he said ended last Thursday. Man added that while Lam was \"okay,\" 23-year-old Chow was struggling in prison, as \"it is the first time she was remanded and (she) was not used to the environment.\"\n",
      "\tIn a letter posted to Chow's social media accounts prior to Wednesday's sentencing, she wrote that she was having trouble sleeping and was feeling \"under the weather.\" Chow added that she was \"very worried\" about the \"high possibility\" of her receiving a jail term. \"I hope that everyone outside the prison walls are doing well,\" she said.\n",
      "\tWednesday's sentence marks the fourth time Wong has been jailed, and the longest sentence he has received, with previous stints in prison all lasting less than six months.\n",
      "\tIn the sentencing document, the court said that \"deterrent sentences are warranted to safeguard public interests.\"\n",
      "\t\"Once again, the government has used the politically motivated charge of 'inciting others to protest' to prosecute people who have merely spoken out and protested peacefully,\" Amnesty International's Asia-Pacific regional director Yamini Mishra said in a statement.\n",
      "\t\"By targeting well-known activists from Hong Kong's largely leaderless protest movement, authorities are sending a warning to anyone who dares openly criticize the government that they could be next.\"\n",
      "\tMishra added that \"even in protests where isolated acts of violence took place and public property was damaged, these should not be attributed to others or the organizers, or to the assembly in general.\"\n",
      "\tWednesday's sentencing was the latest related to the 2019 protests. About 2,000 people have faced charges such as rioting, illegal assembly and possession of weapons.\n",
      "\tWong himself faces other charges over a rally in October last year, and police have said investigations into the unrest are continuing.\n",
      "\tLast month, a number of former pro-democracy lawmakers were arrested over protests staged in the city's legislature, while a reporter for public broadcaster RTHK was also detained.\n",
      "\tThe protests have largely stopped this year, due to COVID-19 social distancing restrictions and the national security law imposed on the city by Beijing in the summer. The law criminalizes secession, subversion and collusion with foreign forces, and carries with it strict prison terms.\n",
      "\tIt was used to bar Wong and a number of other candidates from standing for elections that were due to be held in September, but were postponed because of the coronavirus. Several of those disqualified were sitting lawmakers, who were subsequently ejected from the parliament by Beijing -- overruling constitutional precedent and bypassing Hong Kong's courts -- on November 11, sparking the mass resignation of the entire pro-democratic camp.\n",
      "\tThe move came the same week as the U.S. State Department sanctioned a number of top Chinese officials in Hong Kong for \"threatening the peace, security, and autonomy\" of the city, a move the local government described as \"barbaric interference.\"\n",
      "\tOther countries have also criticized China over the ongoing crackdown, with the European Council saying the move to disqualify opposition lawmakers constituted a \"further severe blow\" to freedom of opinion in the city and \"significantly undermines Hong Kong's autonomy.\"\n",
      "\tSome in Hong Kong have reacted to the worsening political system by emigrating -- or in the case of those facing prosecution, fleeing abroad.\n",
      "\tThis summer, a dozen Hong Kongers were arrested by the Chinese coast guard en route to Taiwan. All are now detained on the mainland and facing a raft of charges. A former independence activist, Tony Chung, was also arrested after allegedly attempting to claim asylum at the US consulate to Hong Kong, along with several others.\n",
      "\tIn his letter from prison, Wong urged the public to \"continue to pay attention\" to the 12 detained in China. Separately Tuesday, parliamentarians from 18 countries wrote to Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam to urge her to intervene on their behalf.\n",
      "\t\"In your role as Chief Executive, it is incumbent on you to intercede on behalf of these young people to ensure that they are guaranteed justice,\" the lawmakers wrote, expressing concern about a justice system \"where imprisonment is essentially guaranteed, torture is common and forced confessions are frequently demanded of suspects.\"\n",
      "\t\"To continue to fail to do so would be a gross abdication of your responsibility to serve the people of Hong Kong and ensure their wellbeing and safety,\" the letter added.\n",

      "\tZhou Xiaoxuan spoke ahead of a trial in her lawsuit, which was delayed for two years and reflects the challenges Chinese women face in pursuing sexual misconduct complaints despite the spread of the global #MeToo movement.\n",
      "\tZhou, 27, has accused Zhu Jun, a popular state TV host, of forcibly kissing her in 2014. She is asking for a public apology as well as 50,000 yuan (US$7,600) in damages.\n",

      "\tA verdict was not expected on Wednesday.\n",
      "\tThe movement took off in 2018 in China when a college student in Beijing publicly accused her professor of sexual misconduct.\n",
      "\tThe #MeToo global movement helped encourage activism in China, but came at a time when President Xi Jinping's government is tightening controls and stamping out dissent.\n",
      "\tWomen who complain face censorship and official resistance. The movement has seen few victories, and it was only in 2019 that sexual misconduct was added to court regulations as grounds for a suit.\n",

      "CONTENT : NEW YORK -- \n",
      "\t\"Papa!\" screams a hospital worker, covered from head to toe in a Hazmat suit and PPE, in the opening moments of the documentary \"76 Days.\"\n",
      "\tThis is in the early days of the pandemic in Wuhan, back in January and February when the city of 11 million went into a 2 1/2-month lockdown and hospitals were overrun. The health worker's father has just died, and her agony at not being able to sit by his side is overwhelming. Her colleagues restrain her as she sobs, moaning, \"Papa, you'll stay forever in my heart.\"\n",
      "\t\"76 Days,\" shot in four Wuhan hospitals, captures a local horror before it became a global nightmare. Given the constraints at the time on footage and information from Wuhan, it's a rare window into the infancy of the pandemic. The film is directed by the New York-based filmmaker Hao Wu, who worked with two Chinese journalists -- one named Weixi Chen, the other is remaining anonymous -- to create of a portrait of the virus epicenter.\n",
      "\tSome of the images document the fear and confusion of those early days: A group of patients mill outside the hospital doors, pleading to be let in. Others are by now more familiar: Solitary deaths followed by phone calls to family members.\n",
      "\t\"There has been so much news coverage and commentary about the pandemic but most of that has primarily been about statistics and our political divide,\" Wu said in an interview. \"What I think is missing is the human stories, the human faces of the pandemic.\"\n",
      "\tThat may be especially true for stories of the pandemic from China, which President Donald Trump and his supporters have been highly critical of, blaming it for the \"Wuhan virus.\" Wu's film, though, consciously avoids politics to concentrate on the humanity inside the hospitals -- even if the workers are so obscured by their Hazmat suits that they're only identifiable by the names penned in sharpie on their backs.\n",
      "\t\"I feel like right now there is such a toxic background to a lot of the discussions around the virus,\" Wu says. \"The virus is an enemy that doesn't care about your nationality.\"\n",
      "\t\"76 Days,\" which premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival in September, is being released Friday by MTV Documentary Films is more than 50 virtual cinemas. Last month, it was nominated for best documentary by the IFP Gotham Awards.\n",
      "\tIt's among the first in a coming surge of coronavirus documentaries. A handful have already arrived, some -- snapshots in an ongoing drama -- hurriedly edited even as the scope of the pandemic has continued to expand. In October, Alex Gibney released \"Totally Under Control,\" a two-part indictment of the federal U.S. response to the virus. In August, the artist-activist Ai Weiwei debuted \"Coronation,\" a documentary he directed remotely with dozens of volunteers to capture the lockdown experience for ordinary Chinese people.\n",
      "\tFor some, the films are too harsh a reminder of an all-consuming reality. But \"76 Days\" feels like a vital early draft of history. Wu's first instinct had been to create a more straightforwardly journalistic film examining what happened in Wuhan. But Wu -- a Chinese native who lives in New York with his partner and two children (he depicted his journey as a gay man in a traditional Chinese family in the 2019 Netflix documentary \"All in My Family\" ) -- soon recognized the difficulty of access and the rapidly changing situation would make such a film either very difficult or potentially stale by the time it was finished.\n",
      "\t\"The images coming out of Wuhan were so harrowing. Everyone was scouring social media, trying to find out what happened in Wuhan, how it got so bad. A lot of us were so angry,\" he says. \"I started getting away from wanting to assign blame.\"\n",
      "\tThe journalists, working with press passes, would have typically been closely watched by Communist party minders but in the chaos were given more free rein. Wu leaned into a more observational approach without talking heads, and urged his collaborators to focus on the people and the details. One poignant shot shows the ziplocked cellphone of a deceased person quietly ringing.\n",
      "\tWu's last trip to China was in January and February. Right after he came back, his grandfather was diagnosed with late stage liver cancer. He would die a month later. Wu, unable to visit because of travel restrictions and busy on the film, wasn't able to say goodbye in person.\n",
      "\t\"For me, I was compelled to tell the story. It's almost like a tribute to my grandfather,\" says Wu. \"The shots that attracted me were those that showed the details of people willing to be nice to each other. I guess it was guilty about not being able to say goodbye to my grandfather, to hold his hand.\"\n",

      "CONTENT : TORONTO -- \n",
      "\tThe Liberal government says it will take steps over the next year to tax foreign homeowners who live outside of Canada as part of a plan to lower housing prices.\n",
      "\tIt's an idea that has been growing in popularity over the last few years in provinces such as British Columbia, Ontario and Prince Edward Island, but some experts question how effective such a plan would be.\n",
      "\tIn this week's fiscal update, the government says the plan will benefit first-time homebuyers and put more homes on the market by taxing homeowners who use Canada to passively store wealth in housing.\n",
      "\tPrime Minister Justin Trudeau said last year his government would introduce such a tax, praising a similar measure in British Columbia during his most recent election campaign.\n",
      "\tThe B.C. government said last year its speculation and vacancy tax raised $115 million, paid mostly by owners based abroad, with Finance Minister Carole James crediting the tax as a factor behind the 5.6 per cent fall in home prices in the first part of 2019.\n",
      "\tTsur Somerville, an associate professor at the Sauder School of Business at the University of British Columbia, said that while prices did fall in the Vancouver area after the introduction of foreign buyers' taxes, the policy is not a silver bullet for affordability.\n",
      "\t\"If you're looking to address affordability, that on its own is never going to get you to affordability. But it can certainly be part of the package of both demand- and supply-side policies,\" he said.\n",
      "\tIn addition to the speculation and vacancy tax -- on those who own local residences but do not pay provincial income taxes -- B.C. has also tried a property transfer tax on home purchases made by foreign nationals in Vancouver, according to the Chartered Professional Accountants regulator of British Columbia.\n",
      "\tIn 2017, Ontario passed a speculation and vacancy tax on homebuyers in the Greater Golden Horseshoe who were neither citizens nor permanent residents. And in Prince Edward Island, non-residents must apply to a special commission to buy more than five acres of land.\n",
      "\tRenewed talk of taxing non-Canadian homebuyers comes as several housing markets across the country set sales records during the COVID-19 pandemic, pushing up prices amid low interest rates and a rush on telecommuter-friendly houses with yards.\n",
      "\tWhile the housing market has been hot, the government is looking for ways to finance $25 billion in new spending to support those hit hard by the pandemic.\n",
      "\tIn practice, some markets with lots of demand from foreign buyers could see house prices decline but remain \"crazy unaffordable,\" even with the proposed tax, said Somerville. Other locales, such as tourist spots, could actually benefit from travellers owning vacation homes there, Somerville said, while still other cities may already have landlords who are struggling to find tenants as it is.\n",
      "\tFor example, the supply of housing may be flexible enough in cities like Calgary or Edmonton where foreign-based buyers don't have that much impact on overall home prices, he said. Also, when it comes to building a giant apartment building, foreign investment from a European pension fund is unlikely to be an affordability problem, he noted.\n",
      "\t\"I can't understand why you would introduce it at a national level,\" Sommerville said. \"That doesn't make any sense to me as a policy because it is not as if we are in a national crisis of foreigners buying up housing in every market and creating challenges on affordability. That's a stretch.\"\n",
      "\tSomerville also noted that the policy has raised objections for targeting Chinese people in Vancouver, although different populations would be affected in different areas of the country.\n",
      "\tAndrey Pavlov, professor of finance at the Beedie School of Business at Simon Fraser University, said it was a \"terrible\" idea to nationalize British Columbia's policies, saying the tax would discourage foreign investments without improving affordability.\n",
      "\tPavlov said that the share of first-time homebuyers has actually gone down since the tax was put in place in B.C. Other than Toronto and Vancouver, most Canadian cities can be built out to accommodate and even benefit from second homes for people like business travellers, said Pavlov.\n",
      "\tThe problem with further taxing homeownership, Pavlov said, is that it could actually reduce the supply of housing by discouraging builders and investors. Pavlov also questioned whether the policy would help the government pay for its fiscal stimulus plans.\n",
      "\t\"Our chance to repay the debts we are incurring now is to grow our economy as fast as we can,\" Pavlov said.\n",

      "\tThe Chang'e 5 probe touched down shortly after 11 p.m. (1500 GMT) on Tuesday after descending from an orbiter, the China National Space Administration said. It released images of the barren scene at the landing site showing the lander's shadow.\n",
      "\t\"Chang'e has collected moon samples,\" the agency said in a statement carried by the official Xinhua News Agency. It said the probe also had successfully unfolded solar panels that will power it.\n",
      "\tThe probe, launched Nov. 24 from the tropical southern island of Hainan, is the latest venture by a Chinese space program that sent its first astronaut into orbit in 2003, has a spacecraft en route to Mars and aims eventually to land a human on the moon.\n",
      "\tPlans call for the lander to spend about two days drilling into the lunar surface and collecting 2 kilograms (4.4 pounds) of rocks and debris. The top stage of the probe will be launched back into lunar orbit to transfer the samples to a capsule for return to Earth, where it is to land in China's northern grasslands in mid-December.\n",
      "\tIf it succeeds, it will be the first time scientists have obtained fresh samples of lunar rocks since a Soviet probe in the 1970s. Those samples are expected to be made available to scientists from other nations, although its unclear how much access NASA will have, given tight U.S. government restrictions on space co-operation with China.\n",
      "\tFrom the rocks and debris, scientists hope to learn more about the moon, including its precise age, as well as increased knowledge about other bodies in our solar system. Collecting samples, including from asteroids, is an increasing focus of many space programs and China's mastery of the technology once again places it among the leading nations operating in space.\n",
      "\tAmerican and Russian space officials congratulated the Chinese program.\n",
      "\t\"Congratulations to China on the successful landing of Chang'e 5. This is no easy task,\" wrote NASA's science mission chief, Thomas Zurbuchen, on Twitter.\n",
      "\t\"When the samples collected on the Moon are returned to Earth, we hope everyone will benefit from being able to study this precious cargo that could advance the international science community.\"\n",
      "\tThe most recent return of lunar rocks to Earth was carried out in 1976 by Luna 24, a Soviet robot probe.\n",
      "\tU.S. astronauts brought back 842 pounds (382 kilograms) of lunar samples from 1969 to 1972, some of which is still being analyzed and experimented on.\n",
      "\tThe Chang'e 5 flight is China's third successful lunar landing. Its predecessor, Chang'e 4, was the first probe to land on the moon's little-explored far side.\n",
      "\tChinese space program officials have said they envision future crewed missions along with robotic ones, including possibly a permanent research base. No timeline or other details have been announced.\n",
      "\tThe latest flight includes collaboration with the European Space Agency, which is helping to monitor the mission.\n",
      "\tChina's space program has proceeded more cautiously than the U.S.-Soviet space race of the 1960s, which was marked by fatalities and launch failures.\n",
      "\tIn 2003, China became the third country to send an astronaut into orbit on its own after the Soviet Union and the United States. It also launched a crewed space station.\n",
      "\tChina, along with neighbours Japan and India, also has joined the growing race to explore Mars. The Tianwen 1 probe launched in July is on its way to the red planet carrying a lander and a rover to search for water.\n",

      "\tWhile many scientists are racing to find vaccines to tame the spread of the coronavirus pandemic, other researchers are probing the past, trying to unravel one of the greatest mysteries of the virus: exactly where it came from.\n",
      "\tThe World Health Organization has assembled an international team of 10 scientists to trace the origins of the virus.\n",
      "\tThey will have to investigate both the suspect animals and how the first patients may have been infected.\n",
      "\t\"We want to know the origin and we will do everything to know the origin,\" WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told reporters on Monday.\n",
      "\tBut success is by no means assured.\n",
      "\tThe first cases were reported in the Chinese city of Wuhan a year ago, before countries across the world began to record growing infections.\n",
      "\tThe WHO said the first cases in Wuhan are believed to date from the beginning of December.\n",
      "\tBut \"where an epidemic is first detected does not necessarily reflect where it started\", it added in a November report.\n",
      "\tIn recent months, researchers in various countries have suggested that cases may have gone unnoticed long before December 2019, based on analysis of wastewater or blood samples.\n",
      "\tBut there is a lack of \"clear evidence\" to back up these claims, said Etienne Simon-Loriere, of the virology department at the Institut Pasteur in Paris.\n",
      "\tTo establish a virus family tree, researchers rely on genetic analysis.\n",
      "\tThis can help \"better understand transmission dynamics, particularly how the virus may have evolved over time and how clusters might be related in time and place\", the WHO said.\n",
      "\tScientists agree that the disease has an animal origin.\n",
      "\t\"The big question is what led it to jump into humans,\" Etienne Simon-Loriere told AFP.\n",
      "\tSuspicions have fallen on bats, which are \"a major reservoir for coronaviruses\", he adds.\n",
      "\tBut there would likely have been an intermediary animal to shepherd SARS-CoV-2 into people.\n",
      "\tThe pangolin -- a mammal subject to rampant regional wildlife smuggling -- was identified as a likely carrier early on based on genetic analysis. But the case is not settled.\n",
      "\tWHO investigators will need to clarify this point by probing the wet market in Wuhan, which sold live and wild animals and has been linked to many of the early cases.\n",
      "\tThe team will be armed with clues we did not have at the start of the pandemic.\n",
      "\tSimon-Loriere said they could look out for an animal with a virus receptor, a protein called ACE2, similar to the one found in humans.\n",
      "\tIt is through this receptor that the virus latches onto cells.\n",
      "\tSome animals such as mink and ferrets have been found to have a very similar receptor to humans, while others are quite different.\n",
      "\tAnother origin theory that swirled in conspiracy rumours for months was that the Wuhan Institute of Virology was involved in the outbreak.\n",
      "\tAgainst the backdrop of diplomatic tensions, U.S. President Donald Trump touted the idea, claiming the virus could have leaked from the biosafety lab.\n",
      "\tChina has rejected the accusations.\n",
      "\tWhile Simon-Loriere said it was not yet possible to completely rule out the idea that the virus escaped accidentally, he stressed that there was \"no indication it was manmade\".\n",

      "CONTENT : WELLINGTON, NEW ZEALAND -- \n",
      "\tNew Zealand has joined Australia in denouncing a graphic tweet posted by a Chinese official that shows a fake image of a grinning Australian soldier holding a bloodied knife to a child's throat.\n",
      "\tPrime Minister Jacinda Ardern said Tuesday that New Zealand has voiced its concerns directly with Chinese authorities.\n",
      "\t\"This is an image that wasn't factual. It wasn't correct. And so in keeping with our principled position where images like that are used, we will raise those concerns and we'll do it directly,\" Ardern told reporters.\n",
      "\tChina has not backed down from the tweet and said there will be no apology.\n",
      "\tArdern's criticism was more muted than Australia's. She faced an awkward choice of how far to get involved in a conflict between New Zealand's closest ally, Australia, and its biggest trading partner, China.\n",
      "\tAustralian Prime Minister Scott Morrison on Monday called the image \"repugnant\" and demanded an apology from the Chinese government. The post took aim at alleged abuses by Australian soldiers during the conflict in Afghanistan.\n",
      "\tThe incident is further souring already tense relations between Australia and China.\n",
      "\tThe image, which appeared to show the soldier slitting the child's throat, was posted by Zhao Lijian, a spokesman for China's foreign ministry. He wrote a caption with his tweet: \"Shocked by murder of Afghan civilians & prisoners by Australian soldiers. We strongly condemn such acts, & call for holding them accountable.\"\n",
      "\tHe was referring to a disturbing report by Australia's military earlier this month which found evidence that elite Australian troops unlawfully killed 39 Afghan prisoners, farmers and civilians during the Afghanistan conflict. The report recommended that 19 soldiers be referred to federal police for criminal investigation.\n",
      "\tAsked about the issue at a daily briefing, foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying cast blame on the Australian side.\n",
      "\t\"What Australia should do is to reflect deeply, bring the perpetrators to justice, make a formal apology to the Afghan people, and solemnly promise to the international community that they will never commit such terrible crimes again,\" Hua said.\n",
      "\tMorrison said Zhao's tweet was \"utterly outrageous\" and a terrible slur against Australia's military.\n",
      "\tIt \"is truly repugnant. It is deeply offensive to every Australian, every Australian who has served in that uniform,\" he told reporters in Canberra. \"The Chinese government should be totally ashamed of this post. It diminishes them in the world's eyes.\"\n",
      "\tMorrison said his government contacted Twitter asking it to take the post down. The post had a warning tag on it on Tuesday but could still be viewed. Zhao's account comes with a Twitter label stating that it's a Chinese government account.\n",
      "\tDespite China blocking Twitter and other U.S. social media platforms within the county, Chinese diplomats and state media have established a strong presence on them.\n",
      "\tZhao was criticized by the U.S. in March after tweeting a conspiracy theory that U.S. soldiers may have brought the coronavirus to China. He is considered a leading representative of China's high-pitched new strain of assertive foreign relations.\n",
      "\tMorrison acknowledged there were tensions between China and Australia.\n",
      "\t\"But this is not how you deal with them,\" he said. \"Australia has patiently sought to address the tensions that exist in our relationship in a mature way, in a responsible way, by seeking engagement at both leader and ministerial level.\"\n",
      "\tThe rift between the two nations has grown since the Australian government called for an independent inquiry into the origins of the coronavirus pandemic. China has since imposed tariffs and other restrictions on a number of Australian exports.\n",

      "\tZhou Xiaoxuan's says her prestigious internship with Chinese state TV soured after a popular host forcibly kissed her.\n",
      "\tOutraged, Zhou took the previously taboo step of filing a lawsuit in 2018, joining the global #MeToo movement against sexual harassment. But the ruling Communist Party dislikes such grassroots activism and offers few ways to pursue complaints. Zhou waited two years for a hearing, while the host fought back by filing a defamation lawsuit.\n",
      "\tOn Wednesday, Zhou's case goes to trial in Beijing, highlighting the growing willingness of Chinese women to speak up about sexual harassment despite official resistance and censorship that eroded #MeToo's impact.\n",
      "\t\"There are very few sexual harassment cases who have a court hearing,\" Zhou said. \"We hope each individual case can be a type of push forward.\"\n",
      "\tThe ruling party, whose late leader Mao Zedong famously declared, \"women hold up half the sky,\" has improved their legal and social status but is far from delivering on its promise of equality. In some areas, conditions are deteriorating: Women have disappeared from leadership roles over the past three decades.\n",
      "\t#MeToo's global spread helped to encourage activism in China. But that came at a time when President Xi Jinping's government is tightening controls and stamping out dissent.\n",
      "\tWomen who complain face censorship and official resistance. It was only in 2019 that sexual harassment was added to court regulations as grounds for a suit.\n",
      "\tZhou accuses CCTV host Zhu Jun of groping and forcibly kissing her in 2014. She is asking for a public apology as well as 50,000 yuan (US$7,600) in damages.\n",
      "\tIn a series of social media posts, she said she was alone with Zhu in his dressing room for a few minutes. She said he tried to reach into her dress and drag her onto himself, and then forcibly kissed her. The posts were shared widely and reposted by many on the Chinese internet and prompted a great amount of media coverage.\n",
      "\tWhen Zhou filed suit in 2018, such complaints were treated as labour disputes or under other laws that didn't relate directly to sexual harassment. Zhou's was termed a \"personality rights dispute.\"\n",
      "\tHer lawyers have asked for it to be heard under the new legal provision that explicitly cites sexual harassment.\n",
      "\tZhu, the CCTV host, has denied the allegations. A call to his phone wasn't answered. A person who answered at the number in public records for the law firm that represents him said the firm had moved and had no new number.\n",
      "\tZhu has a countersuit pending against Zhou asking for damages of 650,000 yuan (US$100,000).\n",
      "\tZhou expressed hope her case will show \"there are problems in the legal process.\"\n",
      "\tThe movement took off in 2018 in China when a college student in Beijing publicly accused her professor of sexual harassment.\n",
      "\tIn a rare victory, a woman who used the alias Liu Li won a sexual harassment suit against her former boss in July. The boss, a social worker in the western city of Chengdu, was required to issue a public apology but no damages were awarded.\n",
      "\tActivists want more legislative changes and legal tools.\n",
      "\t\"No matter what the result is, we feel that doing this has meaning,\" Zhou said.\n",

      "\tNorth American stock markets got a boost to start December from additional signs that vaccines could spur a return to economic normalcy in 2021.\n",
      "\tThe predominant driver of market activity Tuesday was Pfizer seeking regulatory approval for its COVID-19 vaccine in the European Union, after doing so in the United States, said Candice Bangsund, portfolio manager for Fiera Capital.\n",
      "\t“This has extended the optimism on the vaccine front that will inevitably allow for that rapid recovery in 2021,” she said in an interview.\n",
      "\tAs a result, investors are largely looking past uncertainties, growing infections and some negative economic implications from new lockdowns as they anticipate a very strong revival in global growth by the end of next year.\n",
      "\tIn addition, a bipartisan U.S. Senate proposal for US$900 billion in fiscal stimulus and president-elect Joe Biden's call for a package supported the market rally. However, Bangsund warned that past efforts show that these expectations can prove fleeting and short-lived.\n",
      "\tThe S&P/TSX composite index closed up 106.68 points to 17,296.93 after posting an intraday high of 17,471.20 that's less than three per cent off February's record high.\n",
      "\tIn New York, the Dow Jones industrial average was up 185.28 points at 29,823.92. The S&P 500 index was up 40.82 points at 3,662.45, while the Nasdaq composite was up 156.37 points at 12,355.11 after both markets set new record highs in earlier trading.\n",
      "\tMarkets started the day in positive territory, with Chinese factory results coming in strong.\n",
      "\tThey moved up after posting a phenomenal month in which the S&P 500, for example, experienced its strongest November in decades.\n",
      "\tBangsund expects December could also be strong, albeit not as good as November given the impact of pandemic-related restrictions.\n",
      "\t“Any setback in the near-term would almost inevitably prove short-lived given that brighter outlook for 2021,” she said.\n",
      "\tBangsund added that investors are underestimating the magnitude of the eventual recovery because there's a lot of pent-up savings ready to be put to work once there's a return to some sense of normalcy.\n",
      "\t“And when you combine that with a very supportive policy backdrop, it's really going to be a nice year for growth and for equity prices.”\n",
      "\tThe Canadian dollar traded for 77.21 cents US, its highest level of the year and compared with 77.13 cents US on Monday.\n",
      "\tThe increase came as a result of weakness in the U.S. dollar. Bangsund said it wasn't helped by Canada's economy growing by a record 40.5 per cent on an annualized basis in the third quarter, that was below expectations.\n",
      "\tThe TSX was pushed higher by the strength of the materials and heavyweight financials sectors.\n",
      "\tHigher gold and copper prices pushed materials up 2.6 per cent, with shares of Torex Gold Resources Inc. and Eldorado Gold leading with gains of 12.1 and 10.5 per cent, respectively.\n",
      "\tThe February gold contract was up US$38.00 at US$1,818.90 an ounce and the March copper contract was up 4.7 cents at more than US$3.48 a pound.\n",
      "\tFinancials rose 1.3 per cent with Bank of Montreal shares rising 3.4 per cent and Scotiabank shares up 2.8 per cent after each posted strong quarterly results. The sector was also helped by higher treasury bond yields.\n",
      "\tTechnology moved slightly higher as shares in BlackBerry Ltd. gained as much as 63.9 per cent in intraday trading following news of a deal with Amazon Web Services to develop and market BlackBerry's intelligent vehicle data platform, called IVY.\n",
      "\tThe stock traded as high as $12.54, up from Monday's close of $7.65, before drifting lower and closing at a new 52-week high of $9.08, up 18.7 per cent.\n",
      "\tEnergy inched higher even though the January crude contract was down 79 cents at US$44.55 per barrel and the January natural gas contract was down 0.2 of a cent at US$2.88 per mmBTU.\n",
      "\tHealth care plunged 5.6 per cent with Aurora Cannabis Inc. losing 17.2 per cent.\n",

      "\tJoe Biden has had his first look as president-elect at the President's Daily Brief, a top secret summary of U.S. intelligence and world events -- a document former first lady Michelle Obama has called \"The Death, Destruction, and Horrible Things Book.\"\n",
      "\tBiden has already had eyes on different iterations of the so-called PDB, which is tailored to the way each president likes to absorb information.\n",
      "\tMore than a decade ago, Biden read President George W. Bush's PDB during Biden's transition into the vice presidency. After that, he read President Barack Obama's PDB for eight years. Beginning Monday, after a four-year break, he's reading U.S. President Donald Trump's PDB.\n",
      "\t\"The briefers almost certainly will be asking Biden what he prefers in terms of format and style,\" said David Priess, author of \"The President's Book of Secrets,\" a history of the PDB. \"At a minimum, they're seeing what seems to resonate most with him so that when they make the book his book, they can tailor it to him.\"\n",
      "\tObama's PDB was a 10- to 15-page document tucked in a leather binder, which he found waiting for him on the breakfast table. Later in his presidency, he liked reading the ultra-secret intelligence brief on a secured iPad.\n",
      "\t\"Michelle called it \"The Death, Destruction, and Horrible Things Book,\" Obama wrote in his recently released book, \"A Promised Land.\"\n",
      "\t\"On a given day, I might read about terrorist cells in Somalia or unrest in Iraq or the fact that the Chinese or Russians were developing new weapons systems,\" Obama wrote. \"Nearly always, there was mention of potential terrorist plots, no matter how vague, thinly sourced, or unactionable -- a form of due diligence on the part of the intelligence community, meant to avoid the kind of second-guessing that had transpired after 9-11.\"\n",
      "\tFrom now until Inauguration Day, Biden and Vice-President-elect Kamala Harris will be reading the PDB crafted for Trump, who had delayed giving Biden and Harris access to it as he contests the outcome of the election.\n",
      "\tTrump, who prefers absorbing information in visual ways, likes short texts and graphics.\n",
      "\t\"Trump himself said during his campaign and during the transition in 2016 that he did not like reading long documents -- that he preferred bullet points,\" said Priess, who has not seen any of Trump's PDBs. \"It probably has charts, tables, graphs -- things like that. Not the parody that people make that it's like a cartoon book ... but something that is more visual. But we don't know for sure.\"\n",
      "\tThe written brief, which Trump doesn't always read, often is followed by a verbal briefing with an intelligence official, although those oral briefings stopped at least for a time in October. Priess said he didn't know why they stopped or if they had resumed, but that they stopped at a time when Trump was spending much of his time on the campaign trail.\n",
      "\tBefore Trump authorized Biden to get the PDB as president-elect, Biden was given some intelligence background briefings as a candidate. But they were more general and did not include the nation's top secrets.\n",
      "\tThe other thing that a president-elect gets is a briefing \"on CIA's covert actions,\" former acting CIA director Mike Morell said at an event hosted by the Center for Presidential Transition based in Washington. \"It's important for the president-elect to get this briefing ... because on Inauguration Day, these covert actions will become the new president's.\"\n",
      "\tIn 1961, President John F. Kennedy read his first brief while sitting on the diving board of a swimming pool at his retreat in the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia. President Lyndon Johnson liked to read his brief in the afternoon. President Richard Nixon relied on his national security adviser Henry Kissinger to peruse the briefs and tell him what he thought the president should know.\n",
      "\tAs the laborious recount of ballots dragged on in 2000, President Bill Clinton decided that then-Gov. George W. Bush should get access to his PDB just in case he was the winner. Bush became was the first incoming president to read it before he was president-elect.\n",
      "\tBiden is getting the PDB later than usual because of Trump's ongoing protest of the election results. Trump approved the briefings for Biden last Tuesday, a day after his administration approved the formal transition process to his successor.\n",
      "\tWhen Biden walks into the Oval Office, he'll be inheriting nuclear threats from North Korea and Iran, changing political dynamics in the Middle East, the winding down of America's presence in Afghanistan and rising competition from China.\n",
      "\tBiden had access to the PDB in Wilmington, Delaware. Harris received it in a secure room at the Commerce Department, where the presidential transition offices are located.\n",
      "\tEven Biden, who has decades of experience in foreign policy, could be the victim of an old political adage that no matter how informed he thinks he is, he could learn otherwise from the PDB.\n",
      "\tFormer CIA Director Michael Hayden wrote in his book that revelations and new insight found in the PDB are known as \"aw s---\" moments. As in: \"Aw s---,\" he wrote, \"wish we hadn't said that during that campaign stop in Buffalo.\"\n",

      "CONTENT : MONTREAL -- \n",
      "\tRecently, when president-elect Joe Biden introduced the team that will handle foreign and security policy issues in his new administration, he used the slogan \"America is back”.\n",
      "\tEasier to say than achieve, I suspect.\n",
      "\tFirstly, Biden will have a lot of work to do domestically: a pandemic that continues to wreak havoc in the U.S., an economy to rebuild, and above all, trying to bring back unity after a Trump period that divided the United States in unimaginable ways.\n",
      "\tStill, the United States remains a great power, it will have no choice but to play its role on the international scene. The future secretary of state Antony Blinken is well acquainted with international affairs. The next ambassador to the United Nations, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, a career diplomat, and John Kerry, former secretary of state under Obama, appointed as special envoy on climate change are both experienced and competent.\n",
      "\tBiden has confirmed a return to multilateralism. Washington is expected to rejoin the Paris Accord on climate change and will reintegrate some international organizations such as the World Health Organization. It is to be expected that the American voice will be heard again at the United Nations in a more cooperative mode. This is good news.\n",
      "\tBiden will also need to repair the damage done by his predecessor by re-establishing normal relations with traditional allies in Europe, Canada and elsewhere.\n",
      "\tIt is expected the U.S. will reclaim its usual place in leading NATO. Trump denigrated this organization and worked to weaken it for reasons that escaped observers.\n",
      "\tHowever, the world has greatly changed during Trump's four years.\n",
      "\tFrench President Macron, German Chancellor Merkel and European Union leaders are most probably relieved that common sense will return to the White House but, having been burned, they will want to give themselves some time to see how the Americans will behave on a number of trade and other issues.\n",
      "\tBiden said that the U.S. is ready to lead the world again. Not sure it is a universally shared objective. An increased involvement perhaps, but returning to a pre-Trump era may not be possible.\n",
      "\tPrime Minister Trudeau and his team have already begun bilateral contacts, promoting the importance of Canada in the American economy. Relations with our southern neighbour will not necessarily be more favourable to our interests, but at least there will be dialogue and not insults from the president. Nevertheless, there may be a few differences, notably because of Joe Biden's (Buy America) protectionist agenda and his opposition to the Keystone XL oil pipeline project.\n",
      "\tThe big challenges for the next administration will of course be China and probably issues in the Middle East, particularly Iran. It is expected that the confrontational approach with Beijing will be abandoned in favour of an alliance with Europeans and others to make the Chinese understand that it is in their interest to better respect the rule of law and improve the human rights situation. Will this work? Beijing is becoming more and more self-confident. It took advantage of the American withdrawal from the world stage to advance its pawns. It has just signed a free-trade agreement with its Asian neighbours that corresponds to 30 per cent of world trade.\n",
      "\tBiden said the U.S. wants to join the multilateral nuclear agreement with Iran abandoned by Trump. This may not be easy to achieve because his government has adopted a long list of economic sanctions that the Iranians will want to see abandoned before making their own concessions. Negotiations are likely to be long and complicated, and Republican politicians in the Senate, if they remain the majority, will not help. The recent assassination of an Iranian nuclear scientist may not be the last attempt by opponents of the agreement to create additional difficulties before the departure of Trump from the White House.\n",
      "\tElsewhere in the region, relations between Biden and Netanyahu will not be as warm as with Trump, but the link between Israel and the United States should remain strong. Moreover, Biden said that the U.S. Embassy will stay in Jerusalem. The Palestinians hope that their situation will improve with Biden. To a certain extent, it may be the case. The Israelis will not always have the green light in the context of the settlements on the West Bank, for instance, and the U.S. financial assistance for the Palestinians will probably return. But will the US try to revive the peace process? This is doubtful. Israel has strengthened its ties with several Gulf countries recently and the momentum seems to be changing in the region. Not in the direction of a two-state solution.\n",
      "\tThe United States will likely show more interest in defending human rights. Some countries like Saudi Arabia or Egypt will not appreciate it.\n",
      "\tOther issues will attract attention, such as migrants from Central America, a region that has suffered greatly from COVID-19, but also climate change. Migration should be managed in a more humane way than under Trump.\n",
      "\tIt will also be interesting to see how relations with Trump's great friends the Turkish, Russian and North Korean despots will be. What about Cuba? Trump had scrapped Obama’s openness towards Havana.\n",
      "\tThe Americans have lost ground because of Trump's chaotic and uncoordinated policy. It is not clear that the damage is temporary. Let's hope for Biden that \"America is back\" will be a more successful theme than Trudeau's \"Canada is back”.  \n",

      "\tOntario Premier Doug Ford says he wants to know exactly when COVID-19 vaccines will be going into Ontarians' arms.\n",
      "\tSpeaking to reporters at an event in Vaughan, Ont. on Monday, the premier said he is no more comfortable about the timeline for immunizations in the province now than he was last week.\n",
      "\t\"I have to get answers. I've been asking the federal government. We need to know when we're getting it, how much we're getting and what we're getting,\" Ford said. \"There's different vaccines out there so, to be perfectly frank, I'm not any more comfortable than I was last week.\"\n",
      "\tFord said he would be speaking to vaccine makers, and added that he had a call with Pfizer line up for Monday afternoon.\n",
      "\t\"The clock is ticking,\" he said. \"We need answers, and we've worked very collaboratively with the federal government, but, you know, we need the answers. There's three simple answers that we need. We can't find out at the last minute that we're getting vaccines tomorrow.\"\n",
      "\tCanada has paid to secure access to as many as 414 million doses of potential COVID-19 vaccines, as of late November, with an estimated six million doses expected to arrive in the country by March 31, 2021. The federal government has said that it has a $1-billion fund available to use for purchasing vaccines and the first Health Canada approvals could come before Christmas.\n",
      "\tPrime Minister Trudeau created a firestorm last week when he said Canadians would have to wait to be vaccinated for COVID-19 because the first doses off the production lines will be used in the countries where they are made.\n",
      "\tOn Sunday, federal Conservative leader Erin O'Toole accused the Trudeau Liberals of waiting until a deal with a Chinese company had fallen through before making deals with Pfizer and Moderna, creating delays for Canadians.\n",
      "\tHowever, over the weekend, the head of U.S.-based Moderna told the CBC that Canada is \"not at the back of the line\" when it comes to receiving doses of its vaccine candidate. \n",
      "\tFord said he's going to be asking the Pfizer CEO when Ontario will be getting its share of vaccines.\n",
      "\t\"I'm sure their answer is, well, it's going to go through the federal government. I need a date. I've been asking and asking,\" Ford said. \n",
      "\tFord then compared the securing of vaccines to any other major business transaction.\n",
      "\t\"When you place an order for hundreds of millions of dollars and you aren't getting answers, either—and I'm not accusing anyone of this—but either something's going on, someone's not being honest, or there's incompetence, or maybe both. I'm not sure. And that's not accusing anyone, the federal government or the pharmaceutical companies, but the clock is ticking,\" the premier said.\n",
      "\t\"Everyone's spending hundreds of millions of dollars and you can't give me a delivery date? Unacceptable.\"\n",
      "\tIn a tweet on Monday, Ford said he also spoke with staff from British drugmaker AstraZeneca. \n",
      "\t\t\tDelivering the COVID-19 vaccines will be one of the biggest logistical challenges our province has ever faced.\n",

      "\tU.S. president-elect Joe Biden and vice-president-elect Kamala Harris will begin receiving the nation's most sensitive secrets Monday as they prepare to assume office on Jan 20.\n",
      "\tThe pair are to receive the highly classified Presidential Daily Brief, a summary of the most important information collected across the U.S. intelligence community that is prepared and delivered by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. Outgoing President Donald Trump approved the briefings for Biden last Tuesday, a day after his administration approved the formal transition process to his successor.\n",
      "\tIt was not immediately clear how Biden and Harris would receive the briefing, which is tailored to the needs and interests of its top recipient. For Trump, that has meant a focus on visuals and a preference for paper. His predecessor, Barack Obama, came to embrace the briefing being presented on a modified secure tablet. Given its sensitivity, the leather-bound briefing is usually delivered in person by a career member of the intelligence community, though Trump has increasingly let that process lapse.\n",
      "\t\"On a given day, I might read about terrorist cells in Somalia or unrest in Iraq or the fact that the Chinese or Russians were developing new weapons systems,\" Obama wrote in his memoir. \"Nearly always, there was mention of potential terrorist plots, no matter how vague, thinly sourced, or unactionable--a form of due diligence on the part of the intelligence community, meant to avoid the kind of second-guessing that had transpired after 9-11.\"\n",
      "\tHe added that his wife, Michelle, called it \"The Death, Destruction, and Horrible Things Book.\"\n",
      "\tMuch of the information in the PDB requires no immediate response, Obama wrote, \"The goal was to have a continuously up-to-date sense of all that was roiling in the world, the large, small, and sometimes barely perceptible shifts that threatened to upset whatever equilibrium we were trying to maintain.\"\n",
      "\tThe PDB, as it is known, is just one component of the intelligence briefings presented to an incoming administration. Biden and Harris will also be able to receive in-depth subject matter briefings from intelligence experts, as well as a run-down of extremely classified covert operations underway during the Trump administration, the latter necessary to determine if they want to maintain or modify those operations once they assume office.\n",

      "\tThe deadline is part of a roadmap the British government is laying down to remove \"high risk\" equipment suppliers with draft legislation that aims to tighten telecommunications security requirements.\n",
      "\tThe government of Prime Minister Boris Johnson in July banned Huawei from having a role in building Britain's next-generation mobile phone networks over security concerns triggered by U.S. sanctions. Britain and other European countries have started to fall in line after the U.S. lobbied allies to shun Huawei over fears its equipment could be used by China's communist rulers to facilitate electronic espionage.\n",
      "\tTelecom operators were ordered to stop buying Huawei 5G equipment by the end of the year and have until 2027 to rip any of the company's existing gear out of their systems.\n",
      "\tWhile the ban implied operators would have to stop installing Huawei gear, the latest announcement spells out the deadline clearly - making it harder for them to stockpile equipment.\n",
      "\tHuawei declined to comment. It has previously denied the U.S. allegations and said Britain's ban was politically motivated.\n",
      "\t\"Today I am setting out a clear path for the complete removal of high risk vendors from our 5G networks,\" Digital Secretary Oliver Dowden said. \"This will be done through new and unprecedented powers to identify and ban telecoms equipment which poses a threat to our national security.\"\n",
      "\tThe Telecommunications (Security) Bill, which is set to be debated in Parliament on Tuesday, requires tougher security standards for 5G wireless and fiber optic networks and threatens heavy fines for companies that don't comply with the rules.\n",
      "\tThe government is also setting out a strategy to diversify its telecom equipment suppliers, including a research lab and investment in open radio standards technology. Huawei has just a handful of rivals including Finland's Nokia and Sweden's Ericsson, raising fears that relying on so few companies to supply critical infrastructure leaves networks open to vulnerabilities.\n",

      "\tModerna Inc. said it would ask U.S. and European regulators Monday to allow emergency use of its COVID-19 vaccine as new study results confirm the shots offer strong protection -- ramping up the race to begin limited vaccinations as the coronavirus rampage worsens.\n",
      "\tMultiple vaccine candidates must succeed for the world to stamp out the pandemic, which has been on the upswing in the U.S. and Europe. U.S. hospitals have been stretched to the limit as the nation has seen more than 160,000 new cases per day and more than 1,400 daily deaths. Since first emerging nearly a year ago in China, the virus has killed more than 1.4 million people worldwide.\n",
      "\tModerna is one of several companies to have already submitted partial data to a \"rolling review\" process offered by Health Canada. Rather than presenting regulators with a complete package of trial results, the would-be vaccine-makers file data and findings as they become available. Canada has been looking at Moderna's first results since mid-October.\n",
      "\tCanada has a different approval process than the United States and European countries, meaning that Moderna and Pfizer do not have to apply or reapply at each step. Instead, they have to submit their newest data and findings.\n",
      "\tModerna created its shots with the U.S. National Institutes of Health and already had a hint they were working, but said it got the final needed results over the weekend that suggest the vaccine is more than 94% effective.\n",
      "\tOf 196 COVID-19 cases so far in its huge U.S. study, 185 were trial participants who received the placebo and 11 who got the real vaccine. The only people who got severely ill -- 30 participants, including one who died -- had received dummy shots, said Dr. Tal Zaks, the Cambridge, Massachusetts, company's chief medical officer.\n",
      "\tWhen he learned the results, \"I allowed myself to cry for the first time,\" Zaks told The Associated Press. \"We have already, just in the trial, have already saved lives. Just imagine the impact then multiplied to the people who can get this vaccine.\"\n",
      "\tModerna said the shots' effectiveness and a good safety record so far -- with only temporary, flu-like side effects -- mean they meet requirements set by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for emergency use before the final-stage testing is complete. The European Medicines Agency, Europe's version of FDA, has signalled it also is open to faster, emergency clearance.\n",
      "\tThe FDA has pledged that before it decides to roll out any COVID-19 vaccines, its scientific advisers will publicly debate whether there's enough evidence behind each candidate.\n",
      "\tFirst up on Dec. 10, Pfizer and BioNTech will present data suggesting their vaccine candidate is 95% effective. Moderna said its turn at this \"science court\" is expected exactly a week later, on Dec. 17.\n",
      "\tIf the FDA allows emergency use, Moderna expects to have 20 million doses ready for the U.S. by year's end. Recipients will need two doses, so that's enough for 10 million people.\n",
      "\tPfizer expects to have 50 million doses globally in December. Half of them -- or enough for 12.5 million people -- are earmarked for the U.S.\n",
      "\tThis week, a different panel of U.S. experts, established by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, will meet to decide how initial supplies will be given out. They're expected to reserve scarce first doses for health care workers and, if the shots work well enough in the frail elderly, for residents of long-term care facilities. As more vaccine gradually becomes available in coming months, other essential workers and people at highest risk from the coronavirus would get in line. But enough for the general population isn't expected until at least spring.\n",
      "\tOutside the U.S., Zaks said significant supplies from Moderna would be available later, \"in the first quarter\" of next year.\n",
      "\t\"Obviously we are doing everything in our power to increase the capacity and accelerate the timelines,\" he said.\n",
      "\tBoth Moderna's and Pfizer's vaccines are made with the same technology, using a piece of genetic code for the \"spike\" protein that studs the virus. That messenger RNA, or mRNA, instructs the body to make some harmless spike protein, training immune cells to recognize it if the real virus eventually comes along.\n",
      "\tAstraZeneca last week announced confusing early results of its vaccine candidate from research in Britain and Brazil\n",
      "\tThat vaccine appears 62% effective when tested as originally intended, with recipients given two full doses. But because of a manufacturing error, a small number of volunteers got a lower first dose -- and AstraZeneca said in that group, the vaccine appeared to be 90% effective.\n",
      "\tExperts say it's unclear why the lower-dose approach would work better and that it may just be a statistical quirk.\n",
      "\tA larger U.S. study of the AstraZeneca candidate still is underway that should eventually give the FDA a better picture of how well it works. The FDA has said any COVID-19 vaccine would have to be at least 50% effective.\n",
      "\tMeanwhile Britain's government will have to decide whether its U.K. data is sufficient for an early rollout there.\n",
      "\tJohnson & Johnson also is in final-stage testing in the U.S. and several other countries to see if its vaccine candidate could work with just one dose.\n",
      "\tBoth the J&J and AstraZeneca vaccines work by using harmless cold viruses to carry the spike protein gene into the body and prime the immune system.\n",
      "\tThe different technologies have ramifications for how easily different vaccines could be distributed globally. The AstraZeneca shots won't require freezer storage like the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines.\n",
      "\tCandidates made with still other technologies are in late-stage testing, too. Another U.S. company, Novavax Inc., announced Monday that it has finished enrolling 15,000 people in a late-stage study in Britain and plans to begin recruiting even more volunteers for final testing in the U.S. and Mexico \"in the coming weeks.\"\n",
      "\tVaccines made by three Chinese companies and a Russian candidate also are being tested in thousands of people in countries around the world.\n",

      "\tChina said there would be no apology.\n",
      "\tThe incident is further souring already tense relations between the two nations. Prime Minister Scott Morrison said he was seeking an apology from the Chinese government after Zhao Lijian, a spokesman for China's Foreign Ministry, posted the graphic image that shows a grinning soldier holding a bloodied knife to the throat of a veiled child, who is holding a lamb.\n",
      "\tZhao wrote a caption with the tweet saying: \"Shocked by murder of Afghan civilians & prisoners by Australian soldiers. We strongly condemn such acts, & call for holding them accountable.\"\n",
      "\tHe was referring to a disturbing report by Australia's military earlier this month which found evidence that elite Australian troops unlawfully killed 39 Afghan prisoners, farmers and civilians during the conflict in Afghanistan. It recommended that 19 soldiers be referred to federal police for criminal investigation.\n",
      "\tAsked about the issue at a daily briefing, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying cast blame on the Australian side.\n",
      "\t\"What Australia should do is to reflect deeply, bring the perpetrators to justice, make a formal apology to the Afghan people, and solemnly promise to the international community that they will never commit such terrible crimes again,\" Hua said.\n",
      "\tMorrison said Zhao's tweet was \"utterly outrageous\" and a terrible slur against Australia's military.\n",
      "\tIt \"is truly repugnant. It is deeply offensive to every Australian, every Australian who has served in that uniform,\" he told reporters in Canberra. \"The Chinese government should be totally ashamed of this post. It diminishes them in the world's eyes.\"\n",
      "\tMorrison said his government had contacted Twitter asking it to take the post down. The post had a warning tag on it by Monday afternoon but could still be viewed. Zhao's account comes with a Twitter label stating that it's a Chinese government account.\n",
      "\tDespite China blocking Twitter and other U.S. social media platforms within the county, Chinese diplomats and state media have established a strong presence on them.\n",
      "\tZhao was criticized by the U.S. in March after tweeting a conspiracy theory that U.S. soldiers may have brought the coronavirus to China. He is considered a leading representative of China's high-pitched new strain of assertive foreign relations.\n",
      "\tMorrison acknowledged there were tensions between China and Australia.\n",
      "\t\"But this is not how you deal with them,\" he said. \"Australia has patiently sought to address the tensions that exist in our relationship in a mature way, in a responsible way, by seeking engagement at both leader and ministerial level.\"\n",
      "\tThe rift between the two nations has grown since the Australian government called for an independent inquiry into the origins of the coronavirus pandemic. China has since imposed tariffs and other restrictions on a number of Australian exports.\n",

      "\t\"I would not have put all our eggs in the basket of China,\" O'Toole said at a morning news conference.\n",
      "\t\"If you look at the timeline, that's when Canada started getting serious with Pfizer, Moderna, the other options,\" he added, saying he was concerned that \"the Trudeau government was willing to almost double down on partnering with China\" earlier in the pandemic.\n",
      "\tThe government announced its major vaccine purchases in August after it confirmed the CanSino partnership had fallen through. At the time, it said its decision had come after careful consultations with its vaccine task force of health experts.\n",
      "\tThe CanSino partnership with Dalhousie predated the deep freeze in Canada-China relations that occurred after the People's Republic imprisoned two Canadian men, Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, in apparent retaliation for the RCMP's arrest of Chinese high-tech executive Meng Wanzhou nearly two years ago on an American extradition warrant.\n",
      "\tThis past week, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau created a firestorm when he said Canadians will have to wait a bit to get vaccinated for COVID-19 because the first doses off the production lines will be used in the countries where they are made.\n",
      "\tAs questions grew about the CanSino deal, Trudeau continued to defend his government's vaccine procurement policy, which he says has secured multiple options for the country. Trudeau also appointed a Canadian Forces general to lead the logistics of an eventual vaccine rollout with the Public Health Agency of Canada.\n",
      "\tThe chairman of American vaccine maker Moderna told the CBC on Sunday that Canada is near the front of the line to receive 20 million doses of the COVID-19 vaccine it pre-ordered.\n",
      "\tNoubar Afeyan was asked on CBC's Rosemary Barton Live whether the fact that Canada committed to pre-purchase its doses before other jurisdictions means it will get its supply first. Afeyan confirmed that was the case.\n",
      "\t\"The people who are willing to move early on with even less proof of the efficacy have assured the amount of supply they were willing to sign up to,\" he said.\n",
      "\tO'Toole said with Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland poised to deliver the government's long-awaited fiscal update on Monday, the Liberals need to do two things to spur economic recovery: offer a better plan on how it will rollout vaccines for Canadians and step up the distribution of rapid tests.\n",
      "\t\"There can't be a full economy, a growing economy, people working, people being productive without the tools to keep that happening in a pandemic. Those two tools are rapid tests, and a vaccine.\"\n",
      "\tFreeland's fall economic statement is expected to give a full accounting of the government's record spending on programs to combat the pandemic. In July, the deficit was forecast to be at a record $343.2 billion but some estimates say it could easily top $400 billion.\n",
      "\tThe government could announce new spending such as taking steps towards a national child-care system, and relief for battered industries such as travel and restaurants that will face an uphill struggle to recover from the pandemic.\n",
      "\tNDP finance critic Peter Julian sent Freeland a three-page letter urging her to take action on a variety of fronts to help struggling Canadian families during the pandemic.\n",
      "\tThey included taking concrete action on establishing a national pharmacare plan to help Canadians pay for soaring prescription drug costs, and establish a national day-care strategy to help women who have been disproportionately hindered by the pandemic. Julien also urged Freeland to help Indigenous communities and abandon the government's plans to pay for the Trans-Mountain Pipeline and ramp up its fight against climate change.\n",
      "\tGreen party Leader Annamie Paul called on Freeland to deliver \"a positive vision for a green recovery\" to accelerate Canada's transition to a carbon-neutral economy.\n",
      "\t\"We are optimistic that a vaccine for COVID-19 will be widely available next year and so we must be prepared for what comes next,\" Paul said in a statement.\n",

      "CONTENT : ANKARA, TURKEY -- \n",
      "\tWhen Turkey changed the way it reports daily COVID-19 infections, it confirmed what medical groups and opposition parties have long suspected -- that the country is faced with an alarming surge of cases that is fast exhausting the Turkish health system.\n",
      "\tIn an about-face, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's government this week resumed reporting all positive coronavirus tests -- not just the number of patients being treated for symptoms -- pushing the number of daily cases to above 30,000. With the new data, the country jumped from being one of the least-affected countries in Europe to one of the worst-hit.\n",
      "\tThat came as no surprise to the Turkish Medical Association, which has been warning for months that the government's previous figures were concealing the graveness of the spread and that the lack of transparency was contributing to the surge. The group maintains, however, that the ministry's figures are still low compared with its estimate of at least 50,000 new infections per day.\n",
      "\tNo country can report exact numbers on the spread of the disease since many asymptomatic cases go undetected, but the previous way of counting made Turkey look relatively well-off in international comparisons, with daily new cases far below those reported in European countries including Italy, Britain and France.\n",
      "\tThat changed Wednesday as Turkey's daily caseload almost quadrupled from about 7,400 to 28,300.\n",
      "\tThe country's hospitals are overstretched, medical staff are burned out and contact tracers, who were once credited for keeping the outbreak under check, are struggling to track transmissions, Sebnem Korur Fincanci, who heads the association, told The Associated Press.\n",
      "\t\"It's the perfect storm,\" said Fincanci, whose group has come under attack from Erdogan and his nationalist allies for questioning the government's figures and its response to the outbreak.\n",
      "\tEven though the health minister has put the ICU bed occupancy rate at 70%, Ebru Kiraner, who heads the Istanbul-based Intensive Care Nurses' Association, says intensive care unit beds in Istanbul's hospitals are almost full, with doctors scrambling to find room for critically ill patients.\n",
      "\tThere is a shortage of nurses and the existing nursing staff is exhausted, she added.\n",
      "\t\"ICU nurses have not been able to return to their normal lives since March,\" she told the AP. \"Their children have not seen their mask-less faces in months.\"\n",
      "\tErdogan said, however, there was \"no problem\" concerning the hospitals' capacities. He blamed the surge on the public's failure to wear masks, which is mandatory, and to abide by social distancing rules.\n",
      "\tDemonstrating the seriousness of the outbreak, Turkey last month suspended leave for health care workers and temporarily banned resignations and early retirements during the pandemic. Similar bans were also put in place for three months in March.\n",
      "\tThe official daily COVID-19 deaths have also steadily risen to record numbers, reaching 13,373 on Saturday with 182 new deaths, in a reversal of fortune for the country that had been praised for managing to keep fatalities low. But those record numbers remain disputed too.\n",
      "\tIstanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu said 186 people had died of infectious diseases in the city on Nov. 22 -- a day on which the government announced just 139 COVID-19 deaths for the whole of the country. The mayor also said around 450 burials are taking place daily in the city of 15 million compared with the average 180-200 recorded in November the previous year.\n",
      "\t\"We can only beat the outbreak through a process that is transparent,\" said Imamoglu, who is from Turkey's main opposition party. \"Russia and Germany have announced a high death toll. Did Germany lose its shine? Did Russia collapse?\"\n",
      "\tHealth Minister Fahrettin Koca has rejected Imamoglu's claims, saying: \"I want to underline that all of the figures I am providing are accurate.\"\n",
      "\tLast week, Erdogan announced a series of restrictions in a bid to contain the contagion without impacting the already weakened economy or business activity. Opposition parties denounced them as \"half-baked.\" He introduced curfews for the first time since June, but limited them to weekend evenings, closed down restaurants and cafes except for takeout services and restricted the opening hours of malls, shops and hairdressers.\n",
      "\tBoth Fincanci and Kiraner said the measures don't go far enough to contain transmissions.\n",
      "\t\"We need a total lockdown of at least two weeks, if not four weeks which science considers to be the most ideal amount,\" Fincanci said.\n",
      "\tKoca has said that the number of seriously ill patients and fatalities is on the rise and said some cities including Istanbul and Izmir are experiencing their \"third peak.\" Turkey would wait, however, for two weeks to see the results of the weekend curfews and other restrictions before considering stricter lockdowns, he said.\n",
      "\tMeanwhile, the country has reached an agreement to receive 50 million doses of the vaccine developed by Chinese pharmaceutical company SinoVac and hopes to begin administering it to medical staff and the chronically ill next month. It is also in talks to purchase the vaccine developed by Pfizer in co-operation with the BioNTech pharmaceutical company. A Turkish-developed vaccine is scheduled to be ready to use in April.\n",
      "\tErdogan said he had also spoken with Russia's president, Vladimir Putin, over the possibility of procuring a vaccine developed by that country.\n",

      "\tThe Chinese journalist targeted by an ongoing protest in a Surrey cul-de-sac that turned violent this week says he wants the city and the police to step in before more people get hurt.\n",
      "\tBenson Gao says he warned Surrey officials multiple times about the dozen or so people that have gathered constantly outside his house, claiming to be part of a group with ties to a Chinese tycoon on the lam and a former advisor to U.S. President Donald Trump.\n",
      "\tAnd he’s hoping they’ll do something — now that home surveillance video shows a brutal attack on his friend, Louis Huang, who was sucker-punched, tackled, and kicked multiple times in the head.\n",
      "\t“First I was really angry, and then I was depressed,” Gao told CTV News through a translator. “We told the police again and again that such violence would happen.”\n",
      "\tHe says his family has had to stay inside, and he has had to keep his 10-year-old daughter from the people involved in the protest, where people in matching blue rain covers march along the street in front of his house, and stream video from their devices constantly.\n",
      "\t“I thought I lived in a democracy, but I am living in terror,” Gao said.\n",
      "\tThe protesters themselves didn’t respond to questions in person in the cul-de-sac Wednesday. They have leafletted homes claiming to be part of the New Federal State of China, a group founded by former Donald Trump advisor Steve Bannon, and Chinese tycoon Miles Guo, who is living in exile in New York.\n",
      "\tThe aims of the protesters, and Gao, sound similar: they’re both criticizing the Chinese Communist Party. Guo’s group has claimed that Gao is in league with the CCP. But documents filed in an American court allege it’s actually Guo who is working with the Chinese government to target critics abroad. Guo has denied this.\n",
      "\tThe Surrey RCMP has arrested two people for the assault, said spokesperson Cpl. Elenore Sturko. But it has so far held off any action against the protest in general.\n",
      "\t“We have lawful assembly and we can peacefully protest,” she said. “The difference is whether or not lawful activity is taking place.”\n",
      "\tThe City of Surrey said its bylaw officers had attended but found that there were no obstructions of traffic or bylaw violations.\n",
      "\tLawyer Martin Peters said authorities have a fact pattern that could point them to a Criminal Code offence of harassment.\n",
      "\t“It’s classic language of the Criminal Code, watching and besetting a dwelling house,” he said, adding that if the evidence shows this is an organized attempt to harass Gao, anyone involved, including the people at the top, could be liable.\n",
      "\tHe said Gao or the City of Surrey could also apply to get a civil injunction, which could require a buffer zone between the protesters and Gao’s home. That was part of the order during the protests of the TransMountain pipeline, where the City of Burnaby was represented in court.\n",
      "\tPolice have protected the protesters’ Charter freedoms so far, Peters said, but it seems that the protest is infringing on Gao’s own Charter freedoms.\n",
      "\t“This is probably designed to have a chilling effect on this journalist,” Peter said.\n",
      "\tSeveral city councillors didn’t respond to inquires by CTV News.\n",
      "\tIf there's no further action, Gao said he plans to sue the city and the RCMP for failing to keep the peace.\n",

      "\tOn the morning of Dec. 1, 2018, Meng Wanzhou, the Chief Financial Officer of Chinese telecom giant Huawei and the daughter of its founder, touched down in Vancouver.\n",
      "\tMeng planned to visit one of her two Vancouver homes to drop off some boxes, then catch an evening flight to Mexico City.\n",
      "\tEventually, she planned to continue on a trip that would take her to Costa Rica and the G20 in Argentina, with a stop in Paris on the way home.\n",
      "\tInstead, as she stood up from her business class seat onboard the Cathay Pacific 777, and stepped into the glass jetway, she was approached by two Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) officers.\n",
      "\tOne of them checked her Hong Kong passport to confirm her identity, then asked for her phones: one white iPhone 7 Plus, and one red Huawei 20 RS Porsche Design, which Meng handed over to him.\n",
      "\tThe other officer placed the phones in mylar bags provided by the RCMP, who had made the request to the CBSA on behalf of the FBI, then put them in his cargo pants pocket.\n",
      "\tThree RCMP officers stood watching out of view nearby.\n",
      "\t \n",
      "\tThe CBSA officers escorted Meng to the main international arrivals hall, where a kiosk spit out a receipt directing the executive to what's known as \"secondary inspection.\"\n",

      "\tThose officers have since testified they had concerns related to national security and serious criminality.\n",
      "\tDuring that exam, Mounties waited in a supervisors' office that was within view of Meng, they have testified, but out of earshot.\n",

Meng's defence team plans to use any gaps, doubts, and discrepancies from the witness testimony as they make their abuse of process arguments before Associate Chief Justice Heather Holmes in early 2021. They also plan to make arguments that Meng is a political pawn in a trade war between Beijing and Washington, and that the U.S. cherry-picked evidence, while excluding potentially exculpatory facts, in order to mislead Canadian courts.\n",

      "\tConst. Yep, who worked for an RCMP unit at B.C. headquarters that handles requests from outside jurisdictions, testified he first learned about the U.S. extradition request the afternoon before Meng arrived. He swore an affidavit in order to obtain a Provisional Arrest Warrant, which said Meng appeared to have no ties to Canada. Yep later learned Meng had two homes in Vancouver, but admitted in his testimony he never made any effort to correct the affidavit.\n",
      "\tThe evening of Nov. 30, Yep testified, he and a colleague, Const. Gurvinder Dhaliwal met with CBSA personnel at YVR. Yep testified that the purpose of the meeting was to confirm if Meng was on the flight from Hong Kong, not to discuss the plan for the arrest. That evening, he testified, he became aware an RCMP higher-up had suggested Yep arrest Meng onboard the plane. \"It was just a suggestion,\" Yep testified.\n",
      "\tOn the morning of Dec. 1, Yep, Dhaliwal and other Mounties joined members of the CBSA at YVR in a meeting in a supervisors' office. Yep testified he had \"safety concerns\" about arresting Meng on the plane. Defence lawyer Richard Peck pushed back and suggested Yep was lying: \"My view is that is not an honest answer. Safety was never an issue,\" Peck alleged. Yep disputed Peck's allegation, in part, by responding that safety, when it comes to arrests, is always an issue.\n",
      "\tDuring the morning meeting, Yep testified, it was decided CBSA would meet Meng at the plane. Two CBSA officers would conduct an admissibility exam for immigration and customs purposes in the secondary inspection area, before handing Meng over to the RCMP who would arrest her.

      "\tConst. Dhaliwal testified while his colleague, Const. Yep, was the arresting officer, he took on more of a communications role, as well as responsibility for Meng's electronic devices.\n",
      "\tHe attended the Nov. 30 meeting with Yep at YVR, which he called a \"brainstorming session\" and testified he recalled a CBSA supervisor suggesting that the RCMP could arrest Meng Wanzhou in the jetway.\n",
      "\tDhaliwal testified that at the Dec. 1 morning meeting, he could not recall who decided CBSA would take the lead and complete its exam before RCMP could arrest Meng. He indicated that he did not read the arrest warrant until days later. Dhaliwal also testified that he, Yep, and their direct supervisor, Sgt. Janice Vander Graaf were within view of the gate when two CBSA officers identified Meng, asked her for her phones, and placed them in the bags, he testified.\n",
      "\tDuring the CBSA exam, Dhaliwal testified he was charged with making regular updates to his unit as well as to a Canada Department of Justice lawyer.\n",
      "\tDhaliwal testified that he did not direct the CBSA in its exam or pose any suggestions about what questions its officers should ask.\n",
      "\tAfter Yep arrested Meng, Dhaliwal took custody of Meng's two phones, laptop, tablet, and a USB flash drive. He testified that CBSA Officer Scott Kirkland also handed him a loose sheet of paper with the passcodes for Meng's phones.

      "\tSgt. Vander Graaf, who testified she started as a patrol officer in Surrey and has two decades of policing experience, is one of the senior Mounties ultimately responsible for Meng's arrest. She testified she first learned about the extradition request the afternoon of Nov. 30, and was in touch with constables Yep & Dhaliwal throughout the afternoon and evening.\n",
      "\tVander Graaf testified that during a phone call with her supervisor, Acting Insp. Peter Lea, Lea made a \"strong suggestion\" that RCMP arrest Meng onboard the plane. Vander Graaf conveyed that message to Dhaliwal Friday night, but also testified she told him it would be fine to alter that plan if there was a reason.\n",
      "\tOn Dec. 1, Vander Graaf was on a scheduled day off. But that morning, she testified, she received a call from Sgt. Ross Lundie, a Richmond Mountie stationed at YVR, who told her he wanted another senior officer onsite.\n",
      "\tVander Graaf's notes show she arrived late to the meeting with CBSA. By the time she joined, she testified, the decision for CBSA to conduct its admissibility exam first, had already been made. Defence lawyer Scott Fenton asked if she expressed concerns, or called her boss to make him aware of the change in plan. Vander Graaf testified she did not object and did not think she called her supervisor. She also told Fenton that she had safety concerns about arresting Meng on the plane. When Fenton accused her of \"making this up into a much bigger thing (than it was),\" Vander Graaf denied the accusation, and testified her concerns surrounding safety were genuine.\n",
      "\tIn revealing testimony that verged on combative, Vander Graaf also admitted she didn't read the arrest warrant, which called for Meng's \"immediate arrest,\" until 15 or 20 minutes before the flight landed from Hong Kong. Fenton pointedly suggested that because she hadn't read the warrant, Vander Graaf never took what he called a \"commandment for immediate arrest\" into consideration.\n",
      "\tVander Graaf also testified she did not know how long CBSA's exam of Meng would take because it was \"their process.\" When Fenton asked her if, hypothetically, the CBSA exam had taken two days, if the RCMP arrest would still be considered \"immediate,\" she replied: \"That could be, yes.\"\n",
      "\tDefence also established that there had been some sort of \"chit-chat\" between CBSA and RCMP during the exam because Vander Graaf had written in her notes at the time Meng was carrying household goods, and the only place that detail could have come from, defence pointed out, was the CBSA.\n",
      "\tWhen it came to Meng's phones and the paper with her passcodes, Vander Graaf testified she told Dhaliwal to log them, because \"he couldn't unseize something that he'd already seized,\" and that giving them back to Meng would be \"less transparent.\"\n",
      "\tRegarding her notes that Dhaliwal told her on Dec, 12 that RCMP Staff Sgt. Ben Chang had illegally provided identifying information about Meng's devices to the FBI, Vander Graaf stuck by her notes, then testified her concerns were later assuaged after she reviewed emails between Dhaliwal and Chang. Vander Graaf said she didn't take any further action because the emails, she said, provided more context and did not specifically indicate the evidence had been illegally shared. She also testified that she would have \"left it alone regardless\" because it was Chang's responsibility.\n",
      "\tIn a fiery exchange, Fenton accused Vander Graaf of lying on the stand, and \"developing a memory,\" because he said her testimony about some of those emails was inconsistent with an affidavit she filed in 2019, where she wrote she had no independent recollection about those same emails.\n",

      "\tLundie, who joined the RCMP in the late 1990s, testified he did not learn the name of the arriving traveler until the evening of Nov. 30, when he was asked to provide assistance to the RCMP’s Foreign Domestic Liaison Unit, as well as provide a Mandarin-speaking constable the next day.\n",
      "\tLundie testified that he talked to constables Dhaliwal and Yep that evening on the phone, who raised the idea of arresting Meng on the plane. He testified that he “had concerns with that right off the bat.” He had years of experience working alongside CBSA officers, Lundie said, and “it’s not something that we do,” he testified, unless there is an “immediate public safety risk.”\n",
      "\tThat evening, Lundie testified, he exchanged emails with higher-ups about Meng, telling some of them to “Google the name,” realizing she was “extremely high profile.”\n",
      "\tOn Dec. 1, Lundie woke up to emails from FBI legal attaché Sherri Onks, who he had previously met, and who asked him to keep her posted on Meng’s arrest. Lundie testified the request seemed “reasonable” but also that he was not the lead on the case, instead indicating the RCMP’s Foreign Domestic Liaison Unit under Sgt. Janice Vander Graaf.\n",
      "\tLundie attended the morning meeting at YVR with constables Yep and Dhaliwal and members of the CBSA. He testified that he suggested that CBSA conduct their examination of Meng first, and RCMP would arrest her after. Lundie said CBSA left the room to discuss, then returned and agreed, saying “that made sense.”\n",
      "\tHe also testified that he told CBSA that RCMP would not direct them in their exam, and said he was fully aware the two processes needed to be kept separate and any information sharing should only happen through formal channels.\n",
      "\tLundie said he didn't recall if \"sanctions\" or \"Iran\" came up at the morning meeting.\n",
      "\tUnder cross-examination, Lundie told defence lawyer Richard Peck that while the RCMP requested CBSA to bag Meng's cellphones, at the request of the FBI, he viewed that as a “reasonable” request because it was \"just to secure them.\"\n",
      "\tLundie also told Peck that that during Meng's CBSA exam, he recalled hearing a conversation in the doorway of the CBSA superintendent's office, where he and Mounties were waiting, between either Const. Yep or Const. Dhaliwal and a CBSA officer that mentioned \"passwords\" or \"passcodes.\"\n",
      "\tHe testified that he didn't speak up because he didn't understand the relevance, and didn't realize CBSA had obtained Meng's passcodes\n",
      "\t\"I had no idea why there would be passwords to phones obtained by anybody,\" Lundie said, before admitting in retrospect, as a senior officer concerned about blurred lines between CBSA and RCMP roles, he should have spoken up.\n",
      "\tWhile Lundie testified he was tasked by RCMP higher-ups with acting as the contact at YVR for the FBI legal attaché the day of Meng's arrest, he testified he did not pass any information to the FBI \"that he shouldn't have.\"\n",
      "\tHe also told Peck that given his experience and position, he found being designated the FBI point-of-contact onsite put him in a \"very uncomfortable position.\"\n",

      "\tBrazilian President Jair Bolsonaro says he won't take any working COVID-19 vaccine himself and calls the use of masks to limit the spread of the disease \"the last taboo to fall.\"\n",
      "\tBolsonaro's comments, broadcast on his social media channels Thursday night, alarmed health experts who said they could undermine efforts to achieve vaccination levels essential to halting the pandemic and might scare off vaccine makers negotiating with local authorities.\n",
      "\tBolsonaro also said, however, that any shot that is certified by Brazil's health agency will be available for free to the public.\n",
      "\tThe Brazilian president, who contracted the virus in July, has long resisted the advice of most scientists and health experts to restrict social and economic activity, arguing that damage from a lockdown would be worse than the pandemic.\n",
      "\tHe also repeatedly promoted an anti-malarial drug as the cure for the disease despite scientific studies finding it ineffective and possibly dangerous, and criticized state governors testing a Chinese shot at home.\n",
      "\t\"I tell you; I will not take (any vaccine). It is my right and I am sure that Congress will not create difficulties for whoever doesn't want to take a vaccine,\" he said.\n",
      "\t\"If it is effective, lasting, reliable, whoever doesn't take it will be doing harm only to himself, and who takes the vaccine will not be infected. There's nothing to worry about,\" Bolsonaro said.\n",
      "\tA study published July 15 in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine found that social distancing measures can safely be halted if at least 75% of the population gets a vaccine that is more than 70% effective. Tests have shown some vaccine candidates have a potential efficacy higher than that.\n",
      "\t\"Bolsonaro's statements are a horrible sign,\" said Miguel Lago, executive director of Brazil's Institute for Health Policy Studies, which advises public health officials.\n",
      "\t\"If he were a less popular president, this might have little effect, but he is the hero of a lot of people,\" Lago told The Associated Press.\n",
      "\t\"His hardcore supporters might not get a shot and that will generate more political dispute on the right not to get vaccinated. That will make it harder for Brazil to get above that minimum level of 70, 75% of the population vaccinated, which is key for life to go back to some kind of normal.\"\n",
      "\tSome sensitive groups, such as cancer patients and pregnant women, may not be able to take COVID-19 vaccines and will still be susceptible to the virus.\n",
      "\tMore than 171,000 people have died of COVID-19 in Brazil, second only to the United States.\n",
      "\t\"Forcing people to take the vaccine or say that who doesn't take it cannot get a passport, have a public job, that's dictatorship,\" the Brazilian president said. \"Whoever defends that is a dictator. Or a false dictator that is willing to do business with the lives of others.\"\n",

      "\tTikTok's deadline to finalize a U.S. buyer has been extended for the second time in less than a month.\n",
      "\tThe Trump administration on Wednesday gave the short-form video app's Chinese owner, ByteDance, until December 4 to conclude a proposed takeover deal by Oracle and Walmart, according to a spokesperson for the Treasury department.\n",
      "\t\"The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) has granted ByteDance a one-week extension...to allow time to review a revised submission that the Committee recently received,\" the spokesperson said.\n",
      "\tIn an executive order this summer, Trump set November 12 as the hard deadline for ByteDance to divest TikTok, which has more than 100 million users in the United States. But as the deadline came and went, confusion reigned over what consequences might be in store for TikTok. Trump's executive order did not say that TikTok would be banned if it missed the deadline; in fact, it outlines no consequences at all.\n",
      "\tEarlier this month, the U.S. government quietly extended that deadline by two weeks to this Friday, November 27, and has now kicked the can further down the road.\n",
      "\tTikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n",
      "\tTrump has labelled TikTok a danger to national security — a claim the company has denied and cybersecurity experts doubt — he issued another executive order in August that would have made it illegal to have any business dealings with the company.\n",
      "\tThe U.S. Commerce Department tried to enforce that order by attempting to ban downloads of the app in September. The agency also said that by mid-November, internet companies would be banned from carrying TikTok's traffic.\n",
      "\tBoth of those measures have been temporarily blocked by federal judges after TikTok and TikTok content creators sued in separate cases to prevent them from going into effect.\n",
      "\tByteDance's proposed solution to the order, the deal with Walmart and Oracle, would see TikTok reorganized as a new, global company headquartered in the United States, with US investors accounting for a majority of the new company's ownership.\n",
      "\tTrump tentatively approved that deal in September when it was announced. But the arrangement has yet to be finalized by the U.S. government. (It would also still need to be greenlit by Chinese regulators.)\n",
      "\tFor now, until next Friday, TikTok users will still be able to access the app while the Trump administration's ban remains suspended due to litigation.\n",

      "\tThere's an ongoing pandemic, Montreal is in the red zone and gatherings are not permitted, but that hasn't stopped shoppers from lining up overnight to get a deal on some sneakers on Black Friday.\n",
      "\tLured perhaps by a pair of Air Jordan Max 1s for $40 or the Adidas x Pharrell \"Chinese New Year\" size 11s for $7, around people were camped on Ste. Catherine St. in front of Centrall MTL's flagship shoe store overnight.\n",
      "\tThe queue formed Thursday night around 11 p.m. and grew to dozens by 4 a.m. Friday morning, the line up was around the block. Those in line were not spaced two metres apart though they were wearing masks.\n",
      "\tJulian Grau-brown was second in line after his friend showed up Thursday at 1 p.m. to get in line. His reason for braving the weather and pandemic is clear: he loves sneakers.\n",

It's just a really evolving business in Montreal.\"\n",

      "\tRetail analysts say the majority of this year's Black Friday purchases will likely be made online, but some, like the crowd in Montreal, will still hit up brick-and-mortar shops.\n",
      "\tWalmart, a typical target of the deal-hungry masses, has an extensive online sale that ends Sunday night, and Apple has combined its Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals into one weekend-long online shop-fest.\n",

We're not going to give tickets, we're just going to advise them.\"\n",

      "CONTENT : OTTAWA -- \n",
      "\tNewly released documents have shed light on the secret government talks and debate that took place ahead of a Canadian warship's passage through a sensitive waterway near China last year.\n",
      "\tThose discussions included a private meeting between the top bureaucrats at the Department of National Defence and Global Affairs Canada, weeks before HMCS Ottawa sailed through the Taiwan Strait.\n",
      "\tDefence officials were also told to keep quiet about the frigate's trip in September 2019, three months after Chinese fighter jets buzzed two other Canadian ships making the same voyage.\n",
      "\tAnd they were ordered to keep the Privy Council Office, the department that supports the prime minister, in the loop as the Ottawa was making its way through the waterway.\n",
      "\tThe unusual level of attention from the highest levels of government laid out in the documents, obtained by The Canadian Press through access to information, underscores the sensitivities surrounding the trip.\n",
      "\tThat is because while much of the world considers the 180-kilometre strait to be international waters, Beijing claims ownership of the strait separating mainland China from Taiwan.\n",
      "\tBeijing, which regards the self-ruled island of Taiwan as a rogue province, has repeatedly condemned such passages by foreign warships from the U.S., Canada and elsewhere as illegal.\n",
      "\tHMCS Ottawa ended up sailing through the Taiwan Strait twice in early September. Media reports at the time said the frigate was shadowed by the Chinese navy.\n",
      "\tThe heavily redacted memo to Global Affairs deputy minister Marta Morgan dated Aug. 7, 2019 starts by saying the Defence Department was looking for a risk assessment for the Ottawa's planned transit.\n",
      "\tDefence Department deputy minister Jody Thomas \"has also requested a meeting with you on Aug. 12 to discuss this deployment,\" the memo adds.\n",
      "\tWhile HMCS Ottawa was in the region at the time helping enforce United Nations sanctions against North Korea, the memo noted that the frigate was due to make a port visit in Bangkok in mid-September.\n",
      "\tDefence officials have publicly stated that the decision to have the Ottawa sail through the strait was because the route was the fastest way for the frigate to reach Bangkok from its position near North Korea.\n",
      "\tThe memo backs that assertion, noting that going around Taiwan would add one or two days to the trip each way.\n",
      "\tYet it also says the navy's presence in the South China Sea, of which the Taiwan Strait is a part, \"has demonstrated Canadian support for our closest partners and allies, regional security and the rules-based international order.\"\n",
      "\tGlobal Affairs ultimately agreed to the Ottawa's sailing through the strait, but called on defence officials to keep the trip quiet, in large part because of fears the trip would coincide with the federal election campaign.\n",
      "\t\"Finally, GAC will ask DND to ensure that it keeps PCO informed as this naval deployment progresses,\" the memo adds.\n",
      "\tFormer Canadian ambassador to China David Mulroney described the discussions leading up to the Ottawa's transit of the Taiwan Strait as \"an illustration of smart and effective consultation producing the right decision.\"\n",
      "\t\"It is tremendously important that China sees that, in addition to the United States, other serious countries like Canada will not be intimidated into surrendering the Taiwan Strait and Taiwan itself to China's complete control,\" he said.\n",
      "\t\"The RCN, working closely with Global Affairs, is promoting the national interest and asserting our sovereignty from the far side of the world.\"\n",

      "\tThe Ministry of Commerce imposed import taxes of up to 212.1%, effective Saturday, which Australia's trade minister said make Australian wine unsellable in China, his country's biggest export market.\n",
      "\tChina increasingly is using its populous market as leverage to extract political concessions and increase its strategic influence.\n",

      "\t\"Some people in Australia adhering to the Cold War mentality and ideological prejudice have repeatedly taken wrong words and deeds on issues concerning China's core interests,\" said the spokesman, Zhao Lijian.\n",
      "\tAustralia should \"take China's concerns seriously, instead of harming China's national interests under the banner of safeguarding their own national interests,\" Zhao said.\n",
      "\tAustralia's main stock market index fell 0.5% on Friday following the news.\n",
      "\t\"To a certain extent, this is Australia's fault for allowing itself to become a one-trick pony export-wise to China,\" market analyst Jeffrey Halley of Oanda said in a report.\n",
      "\tThe Chinese market is especially important at a time when China is recovering from the coronavirus while the United States, Europe and other major economies are struggling with anti-disease controls that depress demand.\n",
      "\tThe Ministry of Commerce said the wine tariffs are in response to complaints Chinese producers were damaged by improperly low-priced Australian imports.\n",
      "\tAustralia's government denied subsidizing wine exports.\n",
      "\tTrade Minister Simon Birmingham said the accumulation of Chinese sanctions suggested they were due to \"other factors\" but gave no details.\n",
      "\t\"The Australian government categorically rejects any allegation that our wine producers are dumping product into China,\" Agriculture Minister David Littleproud said.\n",
      "\tAustralia has imposed restrictions meant to block foreign influence in its politics following complaints Beijing might be trying to manipulate its government.\n",
      "\tAustralia also has joined the United States in imposing curbs on use of technology from Chinese telecom equipment giant Huawei Technologies Ltd. on security grounds.\n",

      "\tHuang is a member of Vancouver Chinese Human Rights Watch, which has been critical of the Chinese government. He was visiting his friend Bing Chen Gao Wednesday morning, whose writing has targeted several prominent Chinese businessmen.\n",
      "\tThe Surrey RCMP confirmed police were called about 10:45 a.m. to the Surrey cul-de-sac. They arrested two people and released them with orders to stay out of the neighbourhood.\n",
      "\tSo far, the Mounties have allowed the protest to continue on the grounds that the protesters have a Charter right to freedom of expression.\n",
      "\tBut Cpl. Elenore Sturko hinted that after the arrests, more action could be coming.\n",
      "\t“We have people working with us to translate some of the videos that were provided to us and we’re aware of a lot of allegations that have been made,” she said.\n",

      "\tBut neighbours said they had introduced themselves months ago as being connected to billionaire Miles Guo. The group could be seen live-streaming to GTV, which is a group launched by Guo and Steve Bannon, a former key advisor to U.S. President Donald Trump. That site also has several messages critical of the Chinese Communist Party.\n",
      "\tGao, the journalist, has been critical of Guo in his writings, Huang said.\n",
      "\tIt’s long past time for the protesters to leave Gao’s home, and their cul-de-sac, in peace, said resident Bob Petersen.\n",
      "\t“To see them run over and actually attack my neighbour’s friend, punch him and kick him down on the ground, that’s just scary,” Petersen said.\n",
      "\tIt’s time for the City of Surrey to ask a court for an injunction to keep these protesters away, he said.\n",
      "\tHuang believes the group is no longer a protest — but a co-ordinated intimidation effort over Gao exercising his freedom of speech. And he’s says, despite his injuries, he’s not intimidated.\n",

      "\tAfter burying his wife after the passenger jet she was aboard was shot down by the Iranian military, Javad Soleimani returned to Canada and began speaking out about the tragedy of Ukrainian International Airlines Flight PS752.\n",
      "\tSoleimani's wife, fellow Edmonton PhD student Elnaz Nabiy, was among the 176 people -- including 55 Canadian citizens and 30 permanent residents -- killed Jan. 8 when the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps fired two missiles at the Boeing jet shortly after it took off from Tehran's airport.\n",
      "\tThen the Guard came calling on him, Soleimani said Thursday, after he assumed -- falsely -- that he was safe back in Canada.\n",
      "\t\"Someone, probably a permanent resident, or perhaps a citizen of Canada, kept sending me messages telling me that IRGC is able to do anything in Canada and that I better be careful about myself,\" Soleimani said.\n",
      "\tHe's reported incidents like that to the Canadian government, which has appointed former public safety minister Ralph Goodale to deal with the loved ones of PS752 victims, but not enough has been done to assuage the growing fears of Iranian Canadians, said Soleimani.\n",
      "\t\"One day Canada was the safest place for all of us to live, but currently it's not at all safe.\"\n",
      "\tSoleimani joined three other people via video link to a Parliament Hill press conference on Thursday, where they gave harrowing accounts of harassment by foreign agents operating on Canadian soil.\n",
      "\tThey detailed how they had been victims of threats and intimidation by Iranian, Chinese and Russian foreign agents, and they said Canadian domestic police forces have proven ill-equipped to deal with their concerns.\n",
      "\tThey were supporting a private member's bill from Conservative MP Garnett Genuis calling on the federal government to take stronger action against foreign interference, including creating a new single point of contact to report it.\n",
      "\tGenuis was following up on his party's successful motion in the House of Commons last week to call on the Liberal government to take a harder line against national security threats from China.\n",
      "\t\"If a Canadian faces foreign-backed threats and intimidation, who do they go to? Many have reported getting the runaround,\" said the Alberta MP, who also serves on the special Commons committee on Canada-China relations.\n",
      "\tSoleimani was joined by members of Canada's Tibetan and Uighur communities, and a Canadian filmmaker and journalist who specializes in Russia, to put a human face on the growing accounts of foreign intimidation in Canada.\n",
      "\tIn March, the National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians singled out China and Russia for their \"significant and sustained\" foreign interference in Canadian affairs, for trying to exploit the openness of Canadian society and for penetrating key institutions.\n",
      "\tThe reconstituted Canada-China Commons committee intensified its examination of the topic this week, and was told by John McCallum, a former ambassador to China, that he rejected numerous visa applications from dubious Chinese travellers who had been flagged by security agencies.\n",
      "\tChemi Lhamo, a University of Toronto student, recalled the harassment she endured because of her Tibetan heritage when she ran for student government in 2019. Her mobile phone exploded with 16,000 threatening comments on social media, including \"rape threats, death threats, not just against me, but my whole family.\"\n",
      "\tOne said, \"The blade that will go through you is made in China.\" Another said. \"your mom is dead.\" She had to call her mother \"just to check in on her, without frightening her.\"\n",
      "\tLhamo said she was followed by Chinese students on campus who took photos of her and those she spoke with. She got nowhere, she said, when she tried to get help.\n",
      "\t\"I jumped from Toronto police, to my campus police, to RCMP, to dealing with CSIS, getting different levels of security or heads of security across the country,\" she said.\n",
      "\t\"Ultimately, I still do not have a physical piece of paper that says, here's a report that we did, or here is the information on the people that have been threatening to kill you on Canadian soil.\"\n",
      "\tMarcus Kolga, a filmmaker and freelance journalist who has devoted a critical eye to Russia, said he has been getting the \"runaround\" from his local police, the RCMP, and CSIS after being threatened multiple times by Kremlin-backed trolls between 2008 and 2019.\n",
      "\tKolga, who is a member of the Macdonald-Laurier Institute think-tank, said he eventually received a message from the same Moscow IP address he'd heard from in the past \"asking whether I was dead yet.\"\n",
      "\tEventually, he said, a York Region police detective \"took a meaningful interest in the case\" and tracked down the malicious messenger.\n",
      "\tRukiye Turdush, a Canadian-Uighur activist, said complaining to any Canadian authorities about Chinese harassment is complicated by the fact that many people like her have relatives back home in China's Xinjiang province. Chinese police make videos of their visits to play for their Canadian relatives.\n",
      "\t\"They threaten them: `If you tell the Canadian police, if you do something, your mother's going to die, your father's going to be arrested.\"'\n",

      "\tChina's top diplomat on Thursday stressed the importance of bilateral relations while meeting senior officials in South Korea, where there is growing concern the country is becoming squeezed between China, its biggest trading partner, and military ally the United States.\n",
      "\tMoon's ambitions for inter-Korean engagement have faltered amid stalled nuclear negotiations between the U.S. and North Korea, which have disagreed over the release of crippling U.S.-led sanctions against North Korea in exchange for disarmament steps by the North.\n",
      "\tChina, as North Korea's only major ally and economic lifeline, is seen as having unique leverage over the government in Pyongyang.\n",
      "\tWang arrived in Seoul following a visit to Japan, where he met Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga.\n",
      "\tIn Tokyo on Wednesday, Wang told Suga that he wants the two Asian powers to have good relations and co-operate in fighting the coronavirus and reviving their pandemic-hit economies. But the two sides remain at odds over an island dispute.\n",
      "\tSouth Korea has been eager to repair its relations with China, its biggest trading partner, which reacted furiously to Seoul's decision to deploy an advanced U.S. anti-missile system on its soil in 2016 to better cope with North Korean threats. There is also concern in South Korea over a deepening row between Washington and Beijing over trade, security, human rights and other issues, which could force Seoul into a difficult balancing act.\n",
      "\tChina, which says the U.S. anti-missile system in South Korea could be reconfigured to peer into its territory, had been accused by Seoul of retaliating by limiting visits by Chinese tour groups to South Korea. Beijing also destroyed South Korean supermarket giant Lotte's business in China after the company sold a plot of land to the South Korean government where the anti-missile system was later installed.\n",
      "\tSouth Korea had hoped to secure a visit by Chinese leader Xi Jinping this year in what Seoul officials describe as a key step in repairing relations, but the pandemic has complicated such plans.\n",
      "\tWhen asked about a possible Xi visit, Wang pointed to the face masks worn by reporters, saying that the coronavirus must first be contained.\n",
      "\tSouth Korea on Thursday reported 583 new cases of the coronavirus, its biggest daily increase in about eight months, as a resurgence in the capital region threatens to erase hard-won gains.\n",

      "\tChinese President Xi Jinping congratulated U.S. President-elect Joe Biden on Wednesday and expressed hope for \"win-win co-operation\" amid conflicts over trade, technology and security that have plunged Sino-American relations to their lowest level in decades.\n",
      "\tBiden is widely expected to try to resume co-operation with China on North Korea, climate change and the coronavirus following the confrontational approach of President Donald Trump, who launched a tariff war and sanctioned Chinese companies. But analysts expect few major U.S. policy changes due to widespread frustration with Beijing over trade, human rights and technology theft.\n",
      "\tChina became one of the last major governments to congratulate Biden two weeks ago. There was no explanation for the delay but some commentators suggested Beijing wanted to avoid straining relations with Trump, who had yet to concede and is in office for another two months until Jan. 20.\n",
      "\tIn a message to Biden, Xi said \"healthy and stable\" relations are \"the common expectation of the international community,\" according to the official Xinhua News Agency.\n",
      "\t\"We hope the two sides will uphold the spirit of non-conflict and non-confrontation, mutual respect and win-win co-operation, will focus on co-operation, control differences and promote healthy and stable development of Chinese-U.S. relations,\" the statement said.\n",
      "\tIt said Chinese Vice-President Wang Qishan also sent a message to Kamala Harris to congratulate her on being elected vice-president.\n",
      "\tThe United States and China have one of the world's biggest trading relationships but official ties have been roiled by spying accusations, the coronavirus pandemic, Beijing's crackdown on Hong Kong and disputes over control of the South China Sea.\n",
      "\tTrump has blocked access to U.S. technology for Chinese telecom equipment maker Huawei Technologies Ltd. on security grounds. He is trying to limit access to the United States for Chinese social media services, which the White House says might gather too much personal information about Americans.\n",
      "\tTrump has stepped up pressure on Beijing since the election by issuing an order that bars Americans from investing in securities issued by companies U.S. officials say are owned or controlled by the Chinese military.\n",
      "\tSome forecasters suggest the change from Trump, who rejected multilateral alliances, to Biden might increase pressure on China if Washington forms a coalition with other developed countries to push for policy changes.\n",
      "\tChina tried to recruit Germany, France, South Korea and other governments as allies against Washington but all have refused. They criticized Trump's trade tactics of surprise tariff hikes, which also were used against allies, but echoed U.S. complaints that China is violating its free-trade commitments.\n",
      "\tTrump shook China's leaders by hiking tariffs on Chinese products in 2018 over complaints Beijing steals or pressures companies to hand over technology.\n",
      "\tThe White House has lobbied allies to exclude Huawei, China's first global tech brand, from next-generation telecom networks on security grounds.\n",
      "\tOn Tuesday, the British government proposed a law that would tighten security controls on next-generation networks and exclude companies such as Huawei that are deemed high risk. That would formalize a ban announced in July by Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Huawei taking part in a planned next-generation mobile network.\n",
      "\tTrump is pressing Chinese-owned video service TikTok to sell its U.S. operation and is trying to block companies from dealing with WeChat, the popular Chinese messaging service.\n",

      "\tHong Kong leader Carrie Lam lauded the city's new national security law on Wednesday as \"remarkably effective in restoring stability,\" despite criticism that it is severely narrowing the space for free speech and political opposition in the semi-autonomous Chinese territory.\n",
      "\tLam said in her annual policy address that the law had prevented a return of political unrest and that bringing normalcy back to the political system is an urgent priority.\n",
      "\tBeijing imposed the security law on Hong Kong in June, aiming to crack down on dissent following months of anti-government protests in the city that at times descended into violence. Last year's protests were triggered by a proposed extradition law that would have allowed suspects in Hong Kong to be sent to the mainland. The proposal was eventually scrapped.\n",
      "\t\"Advocacies of Hong Kong independence and collusions with external forces have progressively subsided, some of the prominent figures have kept a low profile, radical organizations have ceased operations or dissolved,\" Lam said in her address.\n",
      "\t\"After a year of social unrest with fear for personal safety, Hong Kong people can once again enjoy their basic rights and freedoms, according to the law,\" she added.\n",
      "\tLam also criticized foreign governments for interfering in Hong Kong's affairs, saying it had jeopardized national security.\n",
      "\tThe security law's passage has drawn strong criticism among rights groups and foreign governments, who say it betrays China's promise under the \"one country, two systems\" framework to allow Hong Kong to maintain its own legal system and civil liberties for 50 years following the handover from British to Chinese control in 1997.\n",
      "\tThey point to the curtailing of free speech through the outlawing of statements advocating Hong Kong's independence and criticism of China, the pulling of books from public libraries with suspect political views and a new emphasis on \"patriotic education\" in schools.\n",
      "\tThe U.S. responded to the new law by targeting a number of Chinese and Hong Kong officials responsible for implementing the legislation with travel bans and financial sanctions, Lam among them, and by moving to reduce Hong Kong's special status with the imposition of higher tariffs and visa restrictions.\n",
      "\tThe U.S. and a number of other countries also suspended their extradition treaties with Hong Kong, while Britain said it would allow holders of British National (Overseas) passports extended stays and a path to citizenship. Taiwan opened an office to help Hong Kongers interested in moving to the island.\n",
      "\tBeijing has rejected all such actions and criticisms as brazen political interference and taken an ever-tougher stance on dissent in Hong Kong.\n",
      "\tEarlier this month, China passed a resolution disqualifying four pro-democracy Hong Kong lawmakers after they were accused of violating their oaths of office. The move prompted all of Hong Kong's pro-democracy legislators to resign en masse as a show of solidarity.\n",
      "\tLam said Wednesday that Hong Kong has experienced one of its most severe political challenges over the past year.\n",
      "\t\"One of our urgent priorities is to restore Hong Kong's constitutional order and political system from chaos,\" she said.\n",
      "\tShe said the government would introduce a bill by the end of this year to amend local laws related to oath-taking, to \"deal with those who have engaged in conduct that breaches the oath of the swearing-in.\"\n",
      "\tLam's address had been postponed for more than a month so she could seek Beijing's support for various economic measures aimed at reviving Hong Kong's economy.\n",
      "\tA leader of pro-democracy legislators in Hong Kong, Wu Chi-wai, criticized Lam's policy address, saying it was \"taking Hong Kong people to a wrong direction\" with policies including greater co-operation with China in areas such as finance, aviation and technology.\n",
      "\t\"She bet the future of Hong Kong on the Greater Bay Area and the mainland economy. It will ruin the international city of Hong Kong,\" Wu said. \"We cannot and should not ... put all our eggs on one particular economic territory.\"\n",
      "\tWu and other remaining pro-democracy legislators are expected to officially step down from their positions by Dec. 1.\n",

      "\tOne of Canada's most controversial ex-ambassadors to China says he repeatedly tried to improve the living conditions of Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor after their imprisonment in the People's Republic almost two years ago.\n",
      "\tJohn McCallum also said Tuesday he regrets speaking about the October 2019 Canadian election in a meeting with Chinese officials in the months leading up to it.\n",
      "\tMcCallum, the former Liberal cabinet minister who was fired as Canada's envoy to China in January 2019, was testifying at the special House of Commons committee on Canada-China relations.\n",
      "\tPrime Minister Justin Trudeau fired McCallum after he made a series of public comments that broke with the government's line following the arrests of Kovrig and Spavor.\n",
      "\tThe two men were arrested nine days after Canada's arrest of Chinese high-tech scion Meng Wanzhou in December 2018 on a U.S. extradition warrant in what is widely viewed as retaliation by China.\n",

      "\t\"From that moment onwards, the top priority of the government and of myself as ambassador was to secure the release of the two Michaels,\" said McCallum, noting that he has been one of the few people to visit them in prison.\n",
      "\t\"On more than one occasion, I tried to convince the Chinese that if they were unable to release Kovrig and Spavor they should at least improve their living conditions. Sadly, as you all know, Canadian efforts in this area have so far been unsuccessful.\"\n",
      "\tThe committee has been examining Canada's relations with China, which have plummeted to an all-time low since December 2018.\n",
      "\tEarlier Tuesday, Conservative MP Michael Chong urged Foreign Affairs Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne to adopt a more consistent approach to getting tough with China.\n",
      "\tThe Conservative foreign affairs critic told Champagne during a House of Commons committee meeting Tuesday that the government needs to show Canadians how it will deal with growing Chinese intimidation of Canadians within Canada.\n",
      "\tChong said it is inconsistent for the government to be talking tougher on China, while Canada's current ambassador, Dominic Barton, is making speeches about the need to broaden trade with the People's Republic.\n",
      "\t\"I think it needs to be a lot clearer, a lot more consistent if Canada is going to have a clear, consistent voice with respect to China on the world stage,\" said Chong.\n",
      "\tChong sponsored a motion that won approval in the Commons last week that calls on the government to decide within 30 days whether to allow China's Huawei Technologies to supply equipment for its next generation 5G internet network. Meng is a chief executive of Huawei.\n",
      "\tChampagne replied that Canada has taken a smart and firm approach with China lately that includes speaking out against its ill treatment of pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong and of ethnic Muslim Uighurs.\n",
      "\t\"Whether it comes to the Uighurs or whether it comes to Hong Kong, I've outlined places where we're going to challenge China, places where we're going to, for example, coexist with China,\" Champagne said.\n",

      "\tThe Cirque du Soleil has successfully finished refinancing and plans to relaunch, the company announced Monday.\n",

      "\tThey also announced they would be seeking legal protection from creditors while they looked for new investment.\n",

      "\tAfter initial negotiations with creditors and a bid backed by the Quebec government, the Cirque finalized its deal with another group of its creditors that includes Toronto-based Catalyst Capital Group Inc.

      "\tTwo new co-chairmen will join the Board of Directors: Managing Director of CCG Gabriel de Alba and former CEO of MGM Resorts International Jim Murren.\n",

      "\tChina on Tuesday reported two new coronavirus cases in the cities of Shanghai and Tianjin as it seeks to prevent small outbreaks from becoming larger ones.\n",
      "\tThe National Health Commission said there were two new locally spread cases in the previous 24-hour period, one in each city. It also reported 20 cases among people who had arrived from overseas.\n",
      "\tIn Shanghai, the mass testing of 17,719 workers at the city's Pudong aiport found one infection, a Fedex employee. Everyone else tested negative.\n",
      "\tThree UPS workers at the airport have also tested positive in recent days, along with the wife of one of them. In all, Shanghai has reported eight non-imported cases since Friday.\n",
      "\tIn Tianjin, where 2.3 million people had been tested as of Monday, the city reported one case in a person who developed symptoms after testing positive earlier. China does not include people without symptoms in its confirmed case count.\n",
      "\tTo date, the health commission has recorded 86,464 confirmed cases and 4,634 deaths.\n",
      "\tIn other developments in the Asia-Pacific region:\n",
      "\tAuthorities in Hong Kong have ordered bars and nightclubs to close as the city grapples with new local infections. From midnight on Thursday, entertainment venues such as bars, nightclubs and saunas must shut temporarily as part of tightened social distancing measures.\n",
      "\tThe city on Tuesday reported 80 new infections, its highest daily increase since the first week of August. Of the new cases, 54 were linked to an outbreak in dancing studios which so far has led to 187 infections.\n",
      "\tHealth minister Sophia Chan said Tuesday that there are “multiple transmission chains” in the city as well as infections with untraceable sources, and that social distancing measures must be tightened. She urged people to avoid large gatherings and stay at home.\n",
      "\tAuthorities are also making it compulsory for hotels, restaurants and fitness centres to display a QR code linked to the government's “Leave Home Safe” mobile app to facilitate contact tracing.\n",
      "\tHealth officials are also making it compulsory for high-risk groups to be tested for the virus, including taxi drivers and staff working at homes for the disabled or elderly. Hong Kong has recorded 5,782 infections, including 108 deaths.\n",
      "\tPhilippine officials say about 60 million Filipinos are being targeted for vaccination against the coronavirus next year at a cost of more than 73 billion pesos (US$1.4 billion) to develop considerable immunity among a majority of Filipinos.\n",
      "\tCarlito Galvez Jr., who oversees government efforts to secure the vaccines, said negotiations were underway with four Western and Chinese pharmaceutical companies, including U.S.-based Pfizer Inc. and China's Sinovac Biotech Ltd., to secure the vaccines early next year. He said that one company based in the U.K., AstraZeneca, can commit to supply up to 20 million vaccines.\n",
      "\tThe Philippines has had more than 420,000 confirmed cases, the second-most in Southeast Asia behind Indonesia, and 8,173 deaths.\n",
      "\tIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has urged states that are experiencing a surge in coronavirus cases to establish cold storage facilities for the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines and asked them to review the situation.\n",
      "\tModi's meeting Tuesday with heads of the states comes at a time when India's cases have soared past 9.18 million. More than 134,000 people have died from COVID-19.\n",
      "\tModi said his government is in touch with vaccine developers around the world. “Our priority is to make the vaccine available for all,” he said. “This mission of coronavirus vaccination of each citizen is like a national commitment.”\n",
      "\tIndia has some of the world's biggest vaccine makers and there are five vaccine candidates under different trial stages in the country. But state-run cold storage facilities used to keep vaccines refrigerated are inadequate for the enormous challenge of distributing a COVID-19 vaccine.\n",
      "\tTo address the issue, the government is augmenting cold storage facilities and transport systems for vaccines. It is also readying a database of healthcare and frontline workers who will be inoculated first.\n",
      "\tEven though the number of new daily cases nationwide has remained below 50,000 for several weeks after peaking in September, the situation in some states, including Delhi, has given rise to concern. Several cities are seeing a jump in cases and are implementing stricter restrictions like night curfews. On Tuesday, the country reported 37,975 new confirmed cases and 480 more deaths.\n",

      "CONTENT : \n",
      "\tAustralia's national carrier Qantas will require future international travellers to prove they have been vaccinated against COVID-19 before flying.\n",
      "\tThe airline's CEO Alan Joyce said in an interview with CNN affiliate Nine News on Monday that the move would be a \"necessity\" when coronavirus vaccines are readily available.\n",
      "\tJoyce said the airline was looking at changing its terms and conditions to \"ask people to have a vaccination before they get on the aircraft.\"\n",
      "\t\"Whether you need that domestically, we will have to see what happens with COVID-19 in the market. But certainly, for international visitors coming out and people leaving the country, we think that's a necessity,\" the Qantas chief said.\n",
      "\tWhile Qantas is the first airline to indicate that COVID-19 vaccinations would be a must before travel, others could soon follow suit.\n",
      "\t\"I think it will be a common theme, talking to my colleagues in other airlines across the world,\" Joyce said.\n",
      "\tA spokesperson for AirAsia told CNN Travel on Tuesday that once a vaccine is available the airline \"will review the requirement for guests to be vaccinated against COVID-19 for international travel.\"\n",
      "\tAir New Zealand said it was \"really encouraged by the news around vaccines\" and said in a statement that \"ultimately, it's up to governments to determine when and how it is safe to reopen borders and we continue to work closely with authorities on this.\"\n",
      "\tWhether a vaccine requirement for travel becomes the international standard is at this stage far from certain. There are also questions about whether governments would mandate such a move -- and the legalities of doing so -- before allowing international travelers into their countries.\n",
      "\tThe debate comes as three drugmakers unveiled promising results in the fight against coronavirus this month. AstraZeneca announced on Monday that its experimental coronavirus vaccine has shown an average efficacy of 70% in large-scale trials, with Moderna announcing earlier in November that its vaccine was 94.5% effective against coronavirus, and Pfizer/BioNTech revealing that its vaccine was 95% effective.\n",
      "\tBut the issue of how to safely kick start travel during the pandemic is something airlines and countries are grappling with. Airlines around the world have been hit hard by the decline in travel and countries have missed out on much needed tourist revenue.\n",
      "\t \n",
      "\t \n",
      "\tJoyce said Qantas was looking at the potential for passengers to have a \"vaccination passport\" that \"certifies what the vaccine is and whether it's acceptable to the country you're traveling to.\"\n",
      "\tIt's something the airline industry is thinking seriously about.\n",
      "\tThe International Air Transport Association (IATA) -- the body representing airlines globally -- said Monday that a digital health pass, which could include vaccine information, is the key to opening borders.\n",
      "\tThe IATA Travel Pass is now in its final phase of development. The airline body is planning to conduct a cross-border pilot test run later this year, with the aim of launching in the first quarter of 2021.\n",
      "\t\"Today borders are double locked. Testing is the first key to enable international travel without quarantine measures,\" said Alexandre de Juniac, IATA's director general and CEO in a statement.\n",
      "\t\"The second key is the global information infrastructure needed to securely manage, share and verify test data matched with traveller identities in compliance with border control requirements. That's the job of IATA Travel Pass. We are bringing this to market in the coming months to also meet the needs of the various travel bubbles and public health corridors that are starting operation.\"\n",
      "\tSpeaking at the virtual G20 leaders' meeting on Saturday, Chinese President Xi Jinping pushed for a global Covid-19 tracking system using QR codes, to help fast-track international travel and business.\n",
      "\tThe Australian government has also indicated that vaccinations could be mandatory when entering the country. Its COVID-19 vaccination policy, announced last week, states that while immunization will be voluntary, \"there may however, be circumstances where the Australian government and other governments may introduce border entry or re-entry requirements that are conditional on proof of vaccination.\"\n",
      "\t \n",
      "\t \n",
      "\tAustralia enacted some of the world's strictest lockdown measures and travel restrictions to curb the spread of the virus, including a 14-day quarantine for arrivals, and states closing their internal borders to domestic travelers.\n",
      "\tOn Monday, the border between New South Wales and the former virus hotspot of Victoria reopened after four months. Flights between Sydney and Melbourne, once the busiest flight route in the country and second busiest domestic route in the world, also resumed after dropping to as low as one per day during lockdown.\n",
      "\tQantas and Jetstar -- which once operated a flight every 15 minutes in peak periods along this route -- launched 17 flights between Sydney and Melbourne on Monday, according to Qantas. The airline said that the reopened route would help boost the Qantas Group's overall domestic capacity.\n",
      "\tOn Tuesday, the airline said that Qantas and Jetstar will operate more than 1,200 extra return flights into Queensland from New South Wales and Victoria in the lead up to Christmas, following the decision by the Queensland government to lift border restrictions.\n",
      "\tCapitalizing on pent up demand to travel, Qantas also launched a \"flight to nowhere\" in September, where passengers spend seven hours flying in a loop across the continent, passing over sites like the Great Barrier Reef and Uluru. The airline said tickets sold out within 10 minutes.\n",
      "\tHowever, the airline's international fleet remains grounded. In August, Qantas said it's \"unlikely\" to resume international flights before July 2021, as it suffers heavy losses due to the pandemic.\n",
      "\tQantas reported a loss of 2.7 billion Australian dollars (US$1.9 billion) for the financial year that ended in June, and a 91% drop in profit from the prior year. The airline also announced at least 6,000 job cuts as it fought with what Joyce called \"the biggest crisis our industry has ever faced.\"\n",

      "CONTENT : WENCHANG, CHINA -- \n",
      "\tChina's latest trip to the moon is another milestone in the Asian powerhouse's slow but steady ascent to the stars.\n",
      "\tChina became the third country to put a person into orbit 17 years ago and the first to land on the far side of the moon in 2019. Future ambitions include a permanent space station and putting people back on the moon more than 50 years after the U.S. did.\n",
      "\tBut even before the latest lunar mission lifted off before dawn Tuesday, a top program official maintained that China isn't competing with anyone.\n",
      "\t\"China will set its development goals in the space industry based on its own considerations of science and engineering technology,\" Pei Zhaoyu, deputy director of the Lunar Exploration and Space Engineering Center at the China National Space Administration, told reporters hours before the Chang'e 5 mission was launched.\n",
      "\t\"We do not place rivals (before us) when setting those goals,\" Pei said.\n",
      "\tWhether that is true or not is debatable. China has a national plan aimed at joining the United States, Europe and Japan in the top ranks of technology producers, and the space program has been a major component of that. It also is a source of national pride to lift the reputation of the ruling Communist Party.\n",
      "\tWhat's clear is that China's cautious, incremental approach has racked up success after success since it first put a person in space in 2003, joining the former Soviet Union and the United States. That has been followed by more crewed missions, the launch of a space lab, the placing of a rover on the moon's relatively unexplored far side and, this year, an operation to land on Mars.\n",
      "\tThe Chang'e 5 mission, if successful, would be the first time moon rocks and debris are brought to Earth since a 1976 Soviet mission. The four modules of the spacecraft blasted off atop a massive Long March-5Y rocket from the Wenchang launch centre on Hainan island.\n",
      "\tThe mission's main task is to drill 2 metres (about 7 feet) into the moon's surface and scoop up about 2 kilograms (4.4 pounds) of rocks and other debris. The lander will deposit them in an ascender. A return capsule will deliver them back to Earth, landing on the grasslands of the Inner Mongolia region in mid-December.\n",
      "\t\"Pulling off the Chang'e 5 mission would be an impressive feat for any nation,\" said Florida-based expert Stephen Clark of the publication Spaceflight Now.\n",
      "\tChina prides itself on arriving at this point largely through its own efforts, although Russia helped early on with astronaut training and China's crewed Shenzhou space capsule is based on Russia's Soyuz.\n",
      "\tWhile there has been collaboration with some other nations, notably those belonging to the European Space Agency, which has provided tracking support for Chinese missions, the United States isn't one of them.\n",
      "\tU.S. law requires Congressional approval for co-operation between NASA and China's military-linked program. Ongoing political and economic disputes, notably accusations that China steals or compels the transfer of sensitive trade secrets, appear to dim the prospects for closer ties.\n",
      "\tChina's space program has at times been seen as recreating achievements attained years ago by others, primarily the U.S. and the former Soviet Union. Even China's permanent space station, now under construction, is partly a response to its exclusion from the International Space Station, mainly at the insistence of the U.S.\n",
      "\tOther countries are also forging ahead, underscored by the dramatic landing of America's Curiosity Mars rover in 2012 and the return to Earth next month of Japan's explorer Hayabusa2 with samples collected from the asteroid Ryugu.\n",
      "\tStill, China can boast an \"increasingly sophisticated and demonstrated space expertise,\" said Henry Hertzfeld, director of the Space Policy Institute at George Washington University's Elliot School of International Affairs.\n",
      "\tLunar exploration remains a priority for China, something that in the future will likely take the form of \"a human-machine combination,\" Pei told reporters.\n",
      "\tNo target date for a crewed moon mission has been announced, but Pei said a goal down the line is to build an international lunar research station that can provide long-term support for scientific exploration activities on the lunar surface.\n",
      "\t\"We will determine when to implement a manned lunar landing based on scientific needs and technical and economic conditions,\" he said.\n",

      "\tCode red restrictions in response to COVID-19 are in effect across Manitoba, which outlines which health-related therapies people can access - acupuncture is not one of them.\n",
      "\tOn Monday, Acupuncture patient Michele Kotak felt good enough to get outside and have a snowball fight with her daughter. She said not every day is like this.\n",
      "\t“I get joint swelling that I can’t get up in the morning,” Kotak told CTV News. “I will have such bad back pain where I just can't get up. I can’t go play with my girl. I can’t pick her up. I am crawling on the floor even just to get out of bed.”\n",
      "\tKotak has been using acupuncture to manage chronic pain related to an autoimmune disease. She told CTV News it is the only therapy that has helped in the long term.\n",
      "\t“They were about to increase my pain medicine a lot and really quickly,” she explained. “Acupuncture was able to keep me at the same pain level, so I haven't had to increase my medication in a year and a half.\"\n",
      "\tHer last appointment was right before the code red shutdown took effect. She said she usually goes once every two weeks, but more often if she’s dealing with serious pain.\n",
      "\tA provincial spokesperson told CTV News the public health orders state that regulated professions and massage therapists can continue to provide services, but because acupuncture is not a regulated profession, the treatment cannot be provided right now.\n",
      "\tManitoba’s chief provincial public health officer Dr. Brent Roussin said public health orders need to balance what is considered essential and keeping Manitobans at home. He said he hopes the order is in place for a relatively short period of time.\n",
      "\t\"When you write these lists you're going to have some people on one side, some people on the other side,” he said. “We continually review those types of things.”\n",
      "\tWinnipeg acupuncturist Priscilla Kerr said she was shocked that acupuncture was not allowed to continue to operate under critical code red.\n",
      "\t“There was a little bit of denial to honest, I couldn’t believe that was the case,” she told CTV News.\n",
      "\tShe sent a letter to public health officials, Manitoba’s health minister and Premier Brian Pallister asking why licenced acupuncturists cannot continue practicing. She is also in contact with her local MLA.\n",
      "\tKerr, who is also a spokesperson for The Chinese Medicine and Acupuncture Association of Canada, said there is very low risk of transmission during an acupuncture appointment because PPE and physical distancing requirements are followed.\n",
      "\tShe said practitioners typically have only five to eight minutes of contact with each patient.\n",
      "\t“The saddest thing is, I work at Manitoba clinic right outside health sciences centre, and 40 per cent of my clients are health care workers,” she said.\n",
      "\tOther regulated healthcare professionals trained in needling can perform acupuncture during the lockdown, but Kotak said it’s not the same.\n",
      "\t‘I don’t agree with this. I think it’s not fair and I think a lot of people who are benefitting and need constant treatment need their acupuncture,” she said. \n",

      "\tForeign Affairs Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne warned Monday that tough talk about China could hurt efforts to gain the release of two arbitrarily detained Canadians.\n",
      "\tTestifying before the House of Commons Canada-China relations committee, Champagne urged MPs to keep the fate of Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig in mind when they spout off about the perils and perfidy of China's Communist regime.\n",
      "\t\"I know, Mr. Chair, that some like to talk tough on China,\" Champagne told the committee.\n",
      "\t\"To those who are seduced by this one-dimensional view, I say this: while it is easy to be tough, let's continue to be smart. Let's not fall into the temptation of tough and irresponsible rhetoric that will generate no tangible result for Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, our farmers and entrepreneurs, and human rights victims and advocates.\"\n",
      "\tThe two Michaels, as they've come to be known, have been imprisoned in China for almost two years in retaliation for Canada's arrest of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou on an extradition request from the United States.\n",
      "\tCanadian farmers, fishers and exporters have also been hurt by retaliatory measures taken by China in the wake of Meng's arrest.\n",
      "\tChampagne's plea came a week after the House of Commons passed a Conservative motion calling on the government to decide by Dec. 18 whether to allow Huawei to be involved in development of Canada's next generation 5G wireless network.\n",
      "\tThe motion, passed with the support of all opposition parties over the objections of the government, also called on the government to unveil within 30 days a robust plan to deal with growing intimidation by China of Canadians within Canada's borders.\n",
      "\tThe motion is not binding and Champagne told the committee that government action on both fronts will be guided by national security requirements, not by arbitrary deadlines.\n",
      "\tSince taking over the helm of the Conservatives last August, Erin O'Toole has made standing up to China a central pillar of his pitch to Canadian voters.\n",
      "\tThe Conservative leader has accused Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's Liberal government of being \"willing to look past the Chinese government's numerous human rights abuses, flagrant trade abuses and security issues because the potential to sell into the massive Chinese market was so lucrative.\"\n",
      "\t\"Trudeau's approach to China has failed, and it's weakened our standing in the world. We must stand up for our citizens who have been detained as bargaining chips in an extradition case, even if it leads to more reprisals from Beijing,\" O'Toole argued in an op-ed in the National Post in September.\n",
      "\tO'Toole has called for an \"eyes wide open\" approach to relations with China. But Champagne contended that's precisely the approach his government is taking.\n",
      "\tHe argued that Canada's policy towards China has evolved as China itself has evolved, increasingly flouting the international rules-based order, violating the human rights of Uighurs in Xinjiang province and democracy protesters in Hong Kong, and engaging in \"coercive diplomacy\" to get its way.\n",
      "\t\"The China of 2020 is not the China of 2015 or even the China of 2018,\" Champagne said.\n",
      "\t\"We see a country and a leadership increasingly prepared to throw its weight around to advance its interests.\"\n",
      "\tChampagne said the government has adopted a new framework for dealing with China. He described it as a three-pronged approach in which there will be areas, such as human rights abuses, where Canada needs to challenge China.\n",
      "\tIn other areas, such as trade matters, he said Canada needs to compete with China, and still other areas where Canada needs to co-operate with China, such as the fight against climate change.\n",
      "\tChina's more aggressive posture is not just a challenge for Canada, he argued. Countries around the world are grappling with it.\n",
      "\tChampagne said the best antidote is for all liberal democracies to band together to speak with one voice to pressure China to change its ways -- just as Canada has rallied other countries to speak out against the detention of Kovrig and Spavor.\n",

      "\tConcerned residents gathered in Stratford on Monday to speak out against a Chinese company planning to build a glass plant in the city.\n",
      "\tAround 100 people rallied outside of city hall, calling on council to not allow Xinyi to build its factory.\n",
      "\tThe company has proposed building its first Canadian facility in south Stratford. The 1 million-square-foot building would cost $400 million.\n",
      "\tA local group, called Get Concerned Stratford, raised concerns over the plant's environment impact on the city. The facility will use more than 1 million litres of water per day.\n",
      "\t\"There are tons of concerns pertaining to air contamination and water contamination and water use in general,\" said Melissa Verspeeten.\n",
      "\tStratford officials said the city is only using 31 per cent of its total water supply right now, and the facility would increase that use by eight per cent. Xinyi officials have also said the water will be recycled.\n",
      "\tHowever, residents are worried the facility will affect the lives of everyone in the city.\n",
      "\tThe project will see an investment of $400 million into the plant, and will bring an estimated 380 jobs to the city.\n",
      "\tCouncil is currently debating how much of the infrastructure spending on roads and sewers the city will pay for.\n",
      "\tThe agreement on the table is for Xinyi to pay for 55 per cent, or $7 million of the $13 million. The city will pay for the other $6 million.\n",
      "\tThe mayor said the infrastructure spending isn't just for Xinyi and will also be used for other projects as they move in.\n",
      "\tGet Concerned Stratford wants council to have more public consultation before a final decision.\n",
      "\tStratford is the second city where the company has proposed building the factory. Last year, Guelph decided against the factory after residents raised similar environmental concerns.\n",

      "CONTENT : \n",
      "\tShanghai's biggest international airport momentarily descended into chaos Sunday night, after authorities ordered a mass testing drive-in response to a small outbreak of COVID-19 linked to several cargo handlers.\n",
      "\tSince the beginning of November, seven cargo workers and their close contacts at the Shanghai Pudong International Airport have been diagnosed as confirmed coronavirus cases, including two reported on Sunday.\n",
      "\tIn a bid to contain the cluster, authorities ordered all cargo staff at the airport to undergo coronavirus tests overnight and set up a temporary testing site on the second floor of a parking garage, according to a statement from the Shanghai government.\n",
      "\tPhotos and videos circulating on Chinese social media show hundreds of people packed closely together inside the garage -- the opposite of social distancing -- with a line of people in hazmat suits trying to hold back crowds pushing forward.\n",
      "\tBut the chaos appeared to have calmed before midnight, when the airport police posted photos on Weibo showing workers lining up orderly for the tests.\n",
      "\tAs of Monday morning, 17,719 samples had been collected. Of the 11,544 samples that have been tested, all received negative results, officials said at a news conference.\n",
      "\tWhile the initial chaos has drawn criticism on Chinese social media, the swift, drastic response over just a few cases highlights the length the Chinese government is willing to go to in order to stamp out any resurgence of the virus.\n",
      "\tChina's zero-tolerance approach is in stark contrast to the United States, which is struggling to cope with its largest wave of infections since the pandemic began. Contact tracing seems almost impossible, with daily new cases above 100,000 for three straight weeks.\n",
      "\tOn Saturday, the US caseload surpassed 12 million -- an increase of more than 1 million cases in less than a week. On the same day, U.S. President Donald Trump skipped a special side-conference focused on the pandemic during his final Group of 20 summit.\n",
      "\tTrump was spotted at his golf course outside of Washington, DC, while world leaders including French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, and South Korean President Moon Jae-in discussed global responses to the virus and how to improve pandemic preparedness.\n",
      "\tIn China, several cities have reported new coronavirus cases over the past week -- and all have been met with immediate action from authorities, from extensive testing and contact tracing to partial lockdowns.\n",
      "\tIn the port city of Tianjin, some 600 miles (965 kilometers) from Shanghai, authorities are testing 2.6 million residents in one district after reporting five locally transmitted cases on Friday, the Tianjin Health Commission said in a statement.\n",
      "\tThe mass testing, which started on Saturday, will cover all residents living in the Binhai New Area district, and is expected to be completed in three days.\n",
      "\tAs of Sunday evening, Tianjin has received more than 2.25 million test samples, of which over 1 million have come back negative, the health commission said.\n",
      "\tThe more targeted approach -- focusing on one district instead of the entire city of 15 million people -- differs from the city-wide testing drives adopted by large cities such as Wuhan and Qingdao during earlier local outbreaks.\n",
      "\tSmaller cities, however, appear intent on testing every resident. Manzhouli, a major land port on the Chinese border with Russia, announced plans to test the whole city in three days after two local infections were reported Saturday. According to the Global Times, a state-run tabloid, a total of 300,000 residents will be tested.\n",
      "\tManzhouli's main train station has suspended operations, while its airport has halted all transfer flights to the regional capital of Hohhot. Schools are suspended, mass gatherings are banned, and non-essential businesses are closed, according to the city government.\n",
      "\tWhile these measures have become a standard response to new outbreaks in China, other governments have so far appeared reluctant to introduce similar measures.\n",
      "\tIn Hong Kong, the local government tried to roll out city-wide testing for its 7 million residents during its third wave of infections in September. In the end, only 1.7 million people showed up for the two-week testing drive.\n",
      "\tAs the city faces another surge in coronavirus cases, Health Secretary Sophia Chan said on Sunday the government will give a HK$5,000 ($645) handout to anyone in the city who tests positive to encourage people to undergo testing.\n",
      "\tAs the winter approaches, countries in Asia have also faced a second wave of coronavirus. While most will be unlikely to adopt China's zero-tolerance approach, many have tightened restrictions to slow its spread.\n",
      "\tIn Japan, daily coronavirus cases have surpassed 2,000 for five days in a row. Amid surging cases, the country's Prime Minster Yoshihide Suga announced last week that the government's travel and dining promotion program will be halted in coronavirus hotspots to curb further infections.\n",
      "\tOn Monday, South Korea declared an \"emergency period\" in the capital city of Seoul until the end of the year, due to a spike in Covid-19 cases, according to the city's acting mayor Seo Jung-hyup.\n",
      "\tUnder the announcement, public transportation will reduce capacity by 20% after 10 p.m. and gatherings of more than 10 people will be banned. The city will also conduct regular coronavirus tests on some 40,000 workers and users of nursing hospitals and daycare centers.\n",
      "\tThe measures come after a series of new restrictions were announced for Seoul on Sunday, including mandatory mask wearing indoors and closures of entertainment facilities such as clubs. Restaurants are only allowed to do deliveries and takeout after 9 p.m., gatherings will be limited to 100 people, and schools must operate at one-third capacity.\n",

      "\tSnapchat on Monday unveiled a new curated short-form video feed in a stepped up challenge to social media rivals like TikTok.\n",
      "\tThe new format called Spotlight will allow Snapchatters to see content from influencers and other members of the network popular with young smartphone users.\n",
      "\tSpotlight is aimed at broadening the connections among Snapchat users by enabling anyone to create a video that gets distributed on the platform.\n",
      "\tIt aims to encourage more users to create short-form video \"snaps\" which can be embellished with filters and augmented reality effects.\n",
      "\t\"We designed Spotlight to entertain our community while living up to Snapchat values, with our community's well being as a top priority,\" said a statement from Snapchat parent firm Snap Inc. announcing the new service.\n",
      "\tSpotlight is being launched in the U.S., Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Britain, Ireland, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Germany, and France, and in other markets later.\n",
      "\tIt marks the latest challenge to the wildly successful TikTok, which is facing pressure from the Trump administration, which wants to ban the app or forces its sale to American investors due to alleged national security concerns about its Chinese connections.\n",
      "\tOthers using similar short-form videos include Facebook-owned Instagram's Reels and startups like Triller.\n",
      "\tSnap describes Spotlight as a \"new consumption experience\" for the social platform with an estimated 249 million active users at the end of September.\n",
      "\tThe company said the new offering could enable anyone to have their videos viewed by millions of users, and potentially earn money from them. This opens up the process of becoming an \"influencer\" eligible for Snapchat's funding of some $1 million per day.\n",
      "\tSnap said that all videos on Spotlight will be reviewed by human moderators before being shown on the platform -- in contrast with rivals which use automated systems and in many cases respond to inappropriate content or misinformation after the fact.\n",
      "\tAnother difference will be the lack of public comments on Spotlight, eliminating the need for moderation of abusive or unwelcome content.\n",
      "\tSpotlight aims to become a \"personalized\" feed which will be curated by algorithm based on users' viewing habits -- a move following the lead of TikTok which has seen sizzling growth in recent months.\n",
      "\tThe launch comes amid increasing competition among social networks and rivals copying Snapchat's disappearing messages.\n",
      "\tFacebook's core social network has been losing ground among younger audiences to rivals like Snapchat and TikTok, even as Facebook-owned Instagram continues to grow in that demographic group.\n",
      "\tA Piper Jaffay survey of U.S. teens last month showed Snapchat is their favorite social media platform, and that TikTok overtook Instagram for second place.\n",
      "\tDespite its popularity, Snap has yet to turn a profit some two years after its stock market debut. Snapchat gained notoriety for its disappearing \"Stories\" but has added a variety of media content with partnerships.\n",
      "\tIt lost $200 million in the third quarter, but managed to double revenue from a year ago thanks to changes that have helped boost user engagement. \n",

      "CONTENT : DETROIT -- \n",
      "\tGeneral Motors will recall about 7 million big pickup trucks and SUVs worldwide to replace potentially dangerous Takata air bag inflators.\n",
      "\tThe announcement came Monday after the U.S. government told the automaker it had to recall 6 million of the vehicles domestically.\n",
      "\tGM says it will not fight the decision, even though it believes the vehicles are safe. It will cost the company an estimated $1.2 billion, about one-third of its net income so far this year.\n",
      "\tThe automaker had petitioned the agency four times since 2016 to avoid recalls, contending the air bag inflator canisters have been safe on the road and in testing. But the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration on Monday denied the petitions, saying the inflators still run the risk of exploding.\n",
      "\tOwners complained to the NHTSA that the company was placing profits over safety.\n",
      "\tExploding Takata inflators caused the largest series of auto recalls in U.S. history, with at least 63 million inflators recalled. The U.S. government says that as of September, more than 11.1 million had not been fixed. About 100 million inflators have been recalled worldwide.\n",
      "\tTakata used volatile ammonium nitrate to create a small explosion to fill air bags in a crash. But the chemical can deteriorate when exposed to heat and humidity, and it can explode with too much pressure, blowing apart a metal canister and spewing shrapnel.\n",
      "\tTwenty-seven people have been killed worldwide by the exploding inflators, including 18 in the U.S.\n",
      "\tMonday's decision by NHTSA is a major step in drawing the Takata saga to a close. It means that all Takata ammonium nitrate inflators in the U.S. will be recalled, NHTSA said. Earlier this year the agency decided against a recall of inflators with a moisture-absorbing chemical called a dessicant. NHTSA said it would monitor those inflators and take action if problems arise.\n",
      "\tGM will recall full-size pickup trucks and SUVs from the 2007 through 2014 model years, including the Chevrolet Silverado 1500, 2500 and 3500 pickups. The Silverado is GM's top-selling vehicle and the second-best selling vehicle in the U.S. Also covered are the Chevrolet Suburban, Tahoe and Avalanche, the Cadillac Escalade, GMC Sierra 1500, 2500 and 3500, and the GMC Yukon.\n",
      "\tIt took the agency more than four years to arrive at its decision, which comes toward the end of President Donald Trump's four-year term.\n",
      "\tNHTSA said in a statement that it analyzed data on the air bags, including engineering and statistical analyses, aging tests and field data.\n",
      "\t\"Based on this information and information provided to the petition's public docket, NHTSA concluded that the GM inflators in question are at risk of the same type of explosion after long-term exposure to high heat and humidity as other recalled Takata inflators,\" the agency said.\n",
      "\tThe company has 30 days to give NHTSA a proposed schedule for notifying vehicle owners and starting the recall, the statement said.\n",
      "\tGM said that although it believes a recall isn't warranted based on the factual and scientific records, it will abide by NHTSA's decision.\n",
      "\tSpokesman Dan Flores said Monday that none of the inflators have blown apart in the field or in laboratory testing. But he said GM wants to avoid a drawn-out fight with the government.\n",
      "\t\"Although we are confident that the inflators in the GMT900 vehicles do not pose an unreasonable risk to safety, continue to perform as designed in the field and will continue to perform as designed in line with the results of our accelerated aging studies, we will abide by NHTSA's decision to maintain the trust and confidence of customers and regulators,\" he said in an email.\n",
      "\tIn a 2019 petition to NHTSA, GM said the inflators were designed to its specifications and are safe, with no explosions even though nearly 67,000 air bags have deployed in the field. The inflators, it said, have larger vents and steel end caps to make them stronger.\n",
      "\tBut Takata declared the GM front passenger inflators defective under a 2015 agreement with the government.\n",
      "\tNHTSA hired air bag chemical expert Harold Blomquist, who holds 25 air bag patents, to review the data, and he concluded that the GM air bags were similar to other Takata inflators that had exploded.\n",
      "\tTest results for the GM inflators included abnormally high-pressure events \"indicative of potential future rupture risk,\" NHTSA said in documents. \"These findings illustrate that GM's inflators have a similar, if not identical, degradation continuum\" to other Takata inflators that have exploded, the agency wrote.\n",
      "\tFlores said GM already has purchased 1.6 million replacement inflators made by ZF-TRW that do not use ammonium nitrate.\n",
      "\tLaurie Ablett of Redding, California, said she's been nervous about driving her 2007 Chevrolet Avalanche pickup since finding out that it had been recalled due to Takata air bags four years ago. She bought a Tesla Model 3 electric car to be her daily transportation.\n",
      "\tShe was happy to hear about the recall but said GM will have to earn back her trust.\n",
      "\t\"If they want me to be loyal to them like Tesla, then GM needs to stand by their products as well and not put my life in jeopardy,\" she said. \"I feel like they were disregarding my life, like they didn't value me as a customer.\"\n",
      "\tThe news, coupled with GM announcing it was abandoning legal efforts to end California's right to set its own clean-air standards, helped to push GM's shares up 4% Monday to close at $44.77. Earlier in the day, the stock hit $45.16, its highest level in more than two years. GM's stock has more than doubled in value since April.\n",
      "\tThe company said the recalls will be phased in based on replacement inflator availability, and will cost $400 million this year.\n",
      "\tDrivers can check to see if their vehicles have been recalled by going to https://www.nhtsa.gov/recalls and keying in their 17-digit vehicle identification number.\n",
      "\tThe previous Takata recalls drove the Japanese company into bankruptcy and brought criminal charges against the company. Eventually it was purchased by a Chinese-owned auto parts supplier.\n",

That would offer the first opportunity for scientists to study newly obtained lunar material since the American and Russian missions of the 1960s and 1970s.\n",
      "\tThe Chang'e 5 lander's time on the moon is scheduled to be short and sweet. It can only stay one lunar daytime, or about 14 Earth days, because it lacks the radioisotope heating units to withstand the moon's freezing nights.\n",
      "\tThe lander will dig for materials with its drill and robotic arm and transfer them to what's called an ascender, which will lift off from the moon and dock with the service capsule. The materials will then be moved to the return capsule to be hauled back to Earth.\n",
      "\tThe technical complexity of Chang'e 5, with its four components, makes it \"remarkable in many ways,\" said Joan Johnson-Freese, a space expert at the U.S. Naval War College.\n",
      "\t\"China is showing itself capable of developing and successfully carrying out sustained high-tech programs, important for regional influence and potentially global partnerships,\" she said.\n",
      "\tIn particular, the ability to collect samples from space is growing in value, said Jonathan McDowell, an astronomer at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. Other countries planning to retrieve material from asteroids or even Mars may look to China's experience, he said.\n",
      "\tWhile the mission is \"indeed challenging,\" McDowell said China has already landed twice on the moon with its Chang'e 3 and Chang'e 4 missions, and showed with a 2014 Chang'e 5 test mission that it can navigate back to Earth, re-enter and land a capsule. All that's left is to show it can collect samples and take off again from the moon.\n",
      "\t\"As a result of this, I'm pretty optimistic that China can pull this off,\" he said.\n",
      "\tThe mission is among China's boldest since it first put a man in space in 2003, becoming only the third nation to do so after the U.S. and Russia.\n",
      "\tChang'e 5 and future lunar missions aim to \"provide better technical support for future scientific and exploration activities,\" Pei Zhaoyu, mission spokesperson and deputy director of the Chinese National Space Administration's Lunar Exploration and Space Engineering Center told reporters at a Monday briefing.\n",
      "\t\"Scientific needs and technical and economic conditions\" would determine whether China decides to send a crewed mission to the moon, said Pei, whose comments were embargoed until after the launch. \"I think future exploration activities on the moon are most likely to be carried out in a human-machine combination.\"\n",
      "\tWhile many of China's crewed spaceflight achievements, including building an experimental space station and conducting a spacewalk, reproduce those of other countries from years past, the CNSA is now moving into new territory.\n",
      "\tChang'e 4 -- which made the first soft landing on the moon's relatively unexplored far side almost two years ago -- is currently collecting full measurements of radiation exposure from the lunar surface, information vital for any country that plans to send astronauts to the moon.\n",
      "\tChina in July became one of three countries to have launched a mission to Mars, in China's case an orbiter and a rover that will search for signs of water on the red planet. The CNSA says the spacecraft Tianwen 1 is on course to arrive at Mars around February.\n",
      "\tChina has increasingly engaged with foreign countries on missions, and the European Space Agency will be providing important ground station information for Chang'e 5.\n",
      "\tU.S. law, however, still prevents most collaborations with NASA, excluding China from partnering with the International Space Station. That has prompted China to start work on its own space station and launch its own programs that have put it in a steady competition with Japan and India, among Asian nations seeking to notch new achievements in space.\n",
      "\tChina's space program has progressed cautiously, with relatively few setbacks in recent years. The rocket being used for the current launch failed on a previous launch attempt, but has since performed without a glitch, including launching Chang'e 4.\n",
      "\t\"China works very incrementally, developing building blocks for long-term use for a variety of missions,\" Freese-Johnson said. China's one-party authoritarian system also allows for \"prolonged political will that is often difficult in democracies,\" she said.\n",
      "\tWhile the U.S. has followed China's successes closely, it's unlikely to expand co-operation with China in space amid political suspicions, a sharpening military rivalry and accusations of Chinese theft of technology, experts say.\n",
      "\t\"A change in U.S. policy regarding space co-operation is unlikely to get much government attention in the near future,\" Johnson-Freese said.\n",

      "\tChinese authorities are testing millions of people, imposing lockdowns and shutting down schools after multiple locally transmitted coronavirus cases were discovered in three cities across the country last week.\n",
      "\tAs temperatures drop, widescale measures are being enacted in Tianjin, Shanghai and Manzhouli, even though the number of new cases remains low compared to the United States and other countries that are seeing new waves of infections.\n",
      "\tExperts and government officials have warned that the chance of the virus spreading will be greater in cold weather. Recent flareups have shown that there is still a risk of the virus returning, despite being largely controlled within China.\n",
      "\tOn Monday, the National Health Commission reported two new locally transmitted cases in Shanghai over the previous 24 hours, bringing the total to seven since Friday. China has recorded 86,442 cases overall and 4,634 deaths since the virus was first detected in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year.\n",
      "\tThe two latest cases confirmed in Shanghai were close contacts of another airport worker who was diagnosed with COVID-19 earlier in November. On Sunday night, the city's Pudong International airport decided to test its workers, collecting 17,719 samples through the early hours of Monday morning. Plans call for testing others in surrounding communities if further cases are detected.\n",
      "\tVideos on social media purportedly from workers showed what appeared to be chaotic scenes at the airport as they were given last-minute orders to get tested. In the videos, people are seen standing in large groups pushing back and forth against officials in hazmat suits.\n",
      "\tShanghai has been more selective with mass testing, targeting people associated with a particular place, such as the airport or the hospital where someone who has tested positive had worked, rather than an entire district.\n",
      "\tIn Tianjin, health workers have collected more than 2.2 million samples for testing from residents in the Binhai new district, after five locally transmitted cases were discovered there last week.\n",
      "\tIn Manzhouli, a city of more than 200,000 people, local health authorities are testing all residents after two cases were reported on Saturday. They also shut down all schools and public venues and banned public gatherings such as banquets.\n",
      "\tChina has resorted to its heavy, top-down approach each time new cases of local transmission are found -- shutting down schools and hospitals, locking down residential communities and entire neighbourhoods, and testing millions.\n",
      "\tTianjin authorities shut down a kindergarten and moved all the teachers, family and students to a centralized quarantine space. They also sealed the residential compound where the five cases were found.\n",
      "\tChina's approach to controlling the pandemic has been criticized for being draconian. It locked down the city of Wuhan, where cases were first reported, for more than two months to contain the virus, with the local government shutting down all traffic and confining residents to their homes. Domestically, however, China has called its strategy \"clear to zero\" and has boasted of its success.\n",
      "\t\"In the entire world, only China has the ability to get to zero. Other countries don't have this ability,\" Zeng Guang, the chief epidemiologist at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said in a webinar hosted by Chinese media in September. \"It's not just getting to zero, even for them to control the first wave of the epidemic is hard.\"\n",
      "\t\"`Clearing to zero' is actually the most economically effective way to do epidemic prevention. If you don't do that, then this problem will get more troublesome,\" he said. \"Use a heavier hand, and get to zero, then people will feel reassured.\"\n",

      "\tRaymond shot and killed four people -- two civilians and two police officers -- from the window of his Fredericton apartment on Aug. 10, 2018. At his trial, the Crown and defence agreed Raymond suffered from a mental disorder. Evidence was presented that on the day of the shooting he believed the end of times had arrived and he was surrounded by demons. One psychiatrist testified that Raymond suffered from schizophrenia while another said it was a delusional disorder. Crown prosecutors argued Raymond's delusions were not intense enough to prevent him from understanding that he was shooting humans, and that it was wrong. A jury found Raymond not criminally responsible on Friday.\n",

      "\tBisesar fatally stabbed Rosemary Junor, a complete stranger, in a pharmacy in downtown Toronto on Dec. 11, 2015. In 2018, a judge found that Bisesar was in the throes of psychotic episode due to untreated schizophrenia at the time of the attack. A psychiatrist concluded Bisesar suffered from severe hallucinations and delusions that manifested as a voice commanding her to harm someone. Earlier this year, the Ontario Review Board -- which manages the cases of those found not criminally responsible and decides what level of supervision they need -- gave the director of the mental health hospital where Bisesar lives the discretion to allow her to live in supervised accommodation in the community.\n",

      "\tDe Grood was found not criminally responsible for the killings in April 2014 of Zackariah Rathwell, Jordan Segura, Kaitlin Perras, Josh Hunter and Lawrence Hong in Calgary. It was ruled that he was suffering delusions at the time and did not understand his actions were wrong. The university student, who has schizophrenia, went to a party that marked the end of the school year believing the devil was talking to him and a war was about to begin, signalling the end of the world. A provincial mental health review board said last month that de Grood is making progress as a patient at Alberta Hospital Edmonton, but will not be allowed to go into a group home in the next year. The board also rejected recommendations to allow de Grood travel of up to one week within Alberta and unsupervised passes in Edmonton. His lawyers are appealing the review board's decision.\n",

      "\tLi fatally stabbed and beheaded Tim McLean, the young man sleeping next to him on a Greyhound bus in Manitoba, on July 30, 2008. Li told a mental-health advocate he heard the voice of God telling him McLean was an alien who he needed to destroy. Li was found not criminally responsible and was sent to the Selkirk Mental Health Centre. Li saw his privileges expand slowly after his admission to the facility. In February 2016, Li, now known as Will Baker, won the right to eventually move out of a group home and live on his own. In 2017, he was granted an absolute discharge after the board found he did not pose a significant safety threat.\n",

      "\tKachkar stole a snow plow in the early morning of Jan. 12, 2011 and, in the middle of a two-hour rampage with it, hit and killed Toronto police Sgt. Ryan Russell. Witnesses heard him yell about the Taliban, Chinese technology and microchips. He was found not criminally responsible at trial in 2013 and was held in the secure unit of a mental health hospital near Toronto. In 2018, the Ontario Review Board gave Kachkar a conditional discharge.\n",

      "\tSchoenborn killed his three children, ages 10, eight and five, in Merritt, B.C., in April 2008. He was diagnosed with delusional disorder and said he killed the children to protect them from an imagined threat of sexual abuse. He was found not criminally responsible at trial in 2010 and has been living at a psychiatric hospital in Coquitlam, B.C. In March 2020, the British Columbia Review Board gave the director of the hospital the discretion to allow unescorted outings in the community for Schoenborn. A lawyer for Schoenborn told a review board hearing that the director's decision to grant access would be based on any future progress made by his client in treatment.\n",

      "\tLeaders from the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, including U.S. President Donald Trump, pledged Friday to work toward free, open and non-discriminatory trade and investment to revive their coronavirus-battered economies.\n",
      "\tThe leaders cast aside differences to issue their first joint statement since 2017, in which they agreed to further deepen regional integration by working toward a massive free trade agreement involving the 21 APEC economies.\n",
      "\tThis year's host, Malaysian Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin, told a news conference that the U.S.-China trade war that had hampered talks in the past has \"been eclipsed\" by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n",
      "\tWith growth in the Asia-Pacific region expected to slump 2.7% this year, from a 3.6% growth in 2019, he said APEC's focus was on accelerating economic recovery and developing an affordable vaccine.\n",
      "\t\"The health risks and its impact on the global economic ecosystem has been the major priority agenda for all APEC economies this year,\" he said.\n",
      "\tAPEC, whose members account for 60% of global GDP, has also \"pledged to refrain from backtracking and resorting to protectionist measures to keep markets and borders open,\" he added.\n",
      "\tThe APEC leaders' meeting was the first since 2018 after last year's host, Chile, cancelled the annual summit due to violent domestic protests. But at the Papua New Guinea summit in 2018, APEC leaders failed to issue a joint statement for the first time amid a U.S.-China row over trade policies.\n",
      "\tTrump's participation Friday, his first since 2017, came as a surprise as he challenges the outcome of the U.S. presidential election, won by Joe Biden. Last weekend, Trump skipped the East Asia Summits and withdrew from speaking at an APEC CEO meeting earlier Friday.\n",
      "\tTrump, whose \"America First\" policy has alienated trading partners, addressed the meeting but his speech wasn't immediately available.\n",
      "\tChinese President Xi Jinping, in his remarks, urged countries to \"defend multilateralism\" and called for the establishment of an \"Asia-Pacific free trade zone at an early date.\"\n",
      "\tHe told the meeting that Beijing would also \"actively consider\" joining the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade agreement that includes Japan, Canada, Mexico and other regional economies but not the United States. Trump pulled out of the CPTPP's predecessor, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which never took effect.\n",
      "\tXi's comments came just after Beijing and 14 Asian nations inked the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, the world's largest free trade agreement.\n",
      "\tIf China were to join the CPTPP, that would make Xi's government a member of the Asia-Pacific region's two biggest trade arrangements, while Washington is part of neither.\n",
      "\tAPEC leaders adopted the Putrajaya Vision 2040, a new 20-year growth vision to replace the Bogor Goals named after the Indonesian town where leaders agreed in 1994 to free and open trade and investment.\n",
      "\tThey pledged to build an \"open, dynamic, resilient and peaceful region\" by 2040, and tasked officers to draw up implementation plans by next year.\n",
      "\t\"We recognize the importance of a free, open, fair, non-discriminatory, transparent and predictable trade and investment environment to drive economic recovery at such a challenging time,\" according to the joint statement.\n",
      "\t\"We resolve to further navigate the region towards recovery along the path of strong, balanced, inclusive, sustainable, innovative and secure economic growth,\" the statement added.\n",
      "\tEarlier Friday, the leaders of Japan and New Zealand warned countries against the temptation of retreating into trade protectionism.\n",
      "\tSpeaking by video link from Tokyo to the meeting of APEC CEOs, Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga said \"making rules for a free and fair global economy is critically important.\"\n",
      "\tWhile continuing to promote WTO reform, he said Japan will \"aspire for the Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific.\"\n",
      "\tNew Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, who will be next year's APEC host, voiced hope that APEC leaders will join hands to bolster the regional economy.\n",
      "\t\"As we confront this generation's biggest economic challenge, we must not repeat the mistakes of history by retreating into protectionism. APEC must continue to commit to keeping markets open and trade flowing,\" she said.\n",

      "\tTrudeau hinted at his planned approach to the summit during a speech on Thursday that was followed by a question-and-answer session in which Ottawa's tense ties with Beijing and relationship with the White House figured prominently.\n",
      "\tThe summit, which is being hosted by Malaysia but held online because of COVID-19, is supposed to focus on the pandemic, particularly its economic impacts and what actions the members can take to mitigate those now and recover afterward.\n",
      "\tChinese President Xi Jinping and U.S. President Donald Trump will be among the participants, with the latter likely marking one of his last such international gatherings following this month's presidential election.\n",
      "\tThis year's meeting also comes days after China joined nearly a dozen other Asian countries along with Australia and New Zealand in inking what is being billed as the world's largest free-trade agreement, which excludes Canada and U.S.\n",
      "\tTrudeau stopped short Thursday of saying Canada was interested in joining the new Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, but instead suggested Ottawa would be watching to see how Beijing behaves in the trade deal.\n",
      "\tChina \"is an important player in the global economy that we need to try and include and get to play by better international rules,\" the prime minister said during the question-and-answer session during the APEC CEO Dialogue on Thursday.\n",
      "\t\"So if the RCEP deal is able to actually start to create level playing fields, that's going to be something very, very interesting. So we're going to watch carefully.\"\n",
      "\tTrudeau during the same session defended the detention of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou, who is facing extradition to the U.S. to face fraud charges, and whose case has become a weeping sore in the relationship between Canada and China.\n",
      "\tThe prime minister also indicated that he planned to not only push back against growing protectionism around the world, particularly during the pandemic, but also call for more of the benefits of free trade and globalization reach everyday people.\n",
      "\tMuch of the attention, however, will be on Trump and Xi. The former has refused to concede this month's U.S. presidential election to challenger Joe Biden, and has made a point in the past of calling out China on trade and security.\n",
      "\tThe Trump administration during the last APEC summit in 2018 refused to sign off on a final statement over those same issues.\n",
      "\tThe APEC meeting today will be followed this weekend by the G20 leaders' summit, which is being hosted by Saudi Arabia and will also focus on responding to the economic damage wrought by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n",

      "CONTENT : OTTAWA -- \n",
      "\tPrime Minister Justin Trudeau on Thursday defended the arrest of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou and urged countries to stand up to Chinese bullying as he prepared for two potentially explosive international summits.\n",
      "\tCanada's relations with both China and the U.S. figured prominently during a question-and-answer session with Trudeau ahead of Friday's Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation meeting.\n",
      "\tBoth the prime minister and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, are set to attend. But beforehand, Trudeau spoke to a virtual gathering of chief executives from APEC countries.\n",
      "\tAfter he touted his government's legislation on cutting greenhouse-gas emissions and called for more trade between Canada and Asia, Trudeau was asked whether he regretted that Canadian border authorities in Vancouver detained Meng in December 2018.\n",
      "\tThe Huawei executive was arrested, and is now facing extradition, because she is wanted in the U.S. on fraud charges. Her detention set off a steadily deepening diplomatic crisis with Beijing, which has arbitrarily detained two Canadians and imposed other retaliatory measures.\n",
      "\t“Do I regret that Canada followed its laws? Do I regret that Canada lived up to a long-standing extradition treaty with our closest ally? Absolutely not,” Trudeau said.\n",
      "\t“Canada is a country of the rule of law. And obeying those laws can't just be when it's convenient or when it's easy. If you're a country of the rule of law, if you're a country of values, you need to stick up for those. And that's exactly what we're doing.”\n",
      "\tThe prime minister also criticized China for its “aggressive coercive diplomacy,” which includes the arrests of Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, and accused it of “trying to use its weight to get its way,” before calling for countries to work together to counter China's efforts.\n",
      "\t“In the face of pressure and increasingly coercive moves by one of the world's great powers, I think that really highlights at which point we need to be working together as allies, as neighbours, as friends, as countries,” he said.\n",
      "\t“Very few countries could stand up on its own to a superpower, to a great power. But working together in alignment, we can make sure there is a recognition that the path that China is choosing to take right now is probably not going to be as effective - even for them - as they think it will.”\n",
      "\tCanadian Ambassador to China Dominic Barton spoke with Kovrig on Thursday as part of a rare virtual consular visit, according to Global Affairs Canada.\n",
      "\tTrudeau's words ahead of Friday's APEC summit are unlikely to ease tensions between Canada and China, which Ottawa and its allies have also roundly criticized for cracking down on democracy in Hong Kong and over its treatment of its Muslim Uighur minority.\n",
      "\tFurther complicating matters is the fact China and 14 other countries this week signed what is being billed as the world's largest free-trade deal, the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, which does not include the U.S. or Canada.\n",
      "\tYet the main fireworks during that summit as well as a G20 leaders' meeting being hosted by Saudi Arabia on Saturday and Sunday are expected to come from China and the U.S., with Donald Trump set to make what are likely to be some of his final appearances as president.\n",
      "\tBoth summits are supposed to be focused on the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly its economic impacts and what actions the international community should be taking to mitigate them now and recover afterward.\n",
      "\tTrudeau hinted during his address ahead of APEC on Friday that his plan is to call for more action on climate change while pushing back against protectionism, with an eye to ensuring more of the benefits of free trade and globalization reach everyday people.\n",
      "\t“But the focus is obviously going to be on Trump's farewell to China and other APEC partners, and is he going to kick the can on the way out or not,” said Fen Hampson, chancellor's professor at Carleton University's Norman Paterson School of International Affairs.\n",
      "\t“Trump may well use the occasion to once again point fingers at China on COVID, even though the focus of the summit is prosperity and how do we restart the global economy.”\n",
      "\tTrump prevented APEC members from agreeing on a joint concluding communique during the last leaders' summit in 2018 because of his unhappiness with China over trade and security. Those tensions have, if anything, grown worse in the past two years.\n",
      "\tThe G20 summit also threatens to be a prickly affair, because of host Saudi Arabia's abysmal human rights record and the fact the gathering will feature Trump, Xi as well as the autocratic leaders of Russia, Turkey and other countries.\n",
      "\tWhile the first G20 leaders' summit was held in 2008 and aimed to ensure a unified international response to the financial crisis that year, University of Waterloo international-affairs expert Bessma Momani said much has changed.\n",
      "\tThat includes more polarization and less co-operation around the world, Momani said, as evidenced by the rush for personal protective equipment - and the likely similar rush for vaccines - during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n",
      "\tTrudeau was asked Thursday about the breakdown in international co-operation, and whether he hoped that Joe Biden's election as president would lead to more leadership from the U.S., to which he said that Biden is not a “panacea” for the problems of the world.\n",
      "\t“There's going to be a lot of work for all of us to do to try and move the world forward in the right direction,” he said.\n",
      "\t“I'm sure that president-elect Biden is going to be a powerful ally in that. But we cannot expect to just sort of sit back and say: `OK, bigger countries are going to do the heavy lifting we couldn't.”'\n",

      "\tChina's President Xi Jinping on Thursday spurned suggestions that his country might decouple or separate itself from the U.S. and other trading partners amid tension with Washington and Europe over technology and security.\n",
      "\tSpeaking by video link from Beijing to a meeting of Asia-Pacific CEOs, Xi promised to open China's market wider but announced no initiatives to respond to complaints the ruling Communist Party improperly subsidizes and shields technology and other industries from foreign competitors.\n",
      "\tXi rejected suggestions Beijing might respond to U.S. sanctions on its fledgling technology companies by trying to separate their industries from global trading partners.\n",
      "\tThe ruling Communist Party has promoted its own standards for mobile phones and other technology, which would encourage customers that adopt them to use Chinese suppliers. That has prompted fears world markets might split into smaller segments with incompatible industry standards, hurting productivity.\n",
      "\t\"We will never go back in history by seeking to decouple or forming a `small circle' to keep others out,\" Xi said.\n",
      "\tThursday's event came ahead of a meeting of Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation leaders hosted by Malaysia. The meeting Friday is due to be conducted via video conference due to the pandemic.\n",
      "\tXi's comments followed Sunday's signing of the world's largest free trade agreement, the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, by Beijing and 14 other Asian neighbours.\n",
      "\tThe Chinese-initiated RCEP appeals to other developing countries because it reduces barriers to trade in farm goods, manufactured goods and components, which make up most of their exports. It says little about trade in services and access for companies to operate in each other's economies, which the United States and other developed countries want.\n",
      "\tThe Trump administration has cut off Chinese tech giant Huawei's access to most U.S. components and technology on security grounds. Washington has shut Huawei and a rival Chinese telecom equipment vendor, ZTE, out of the U.S. market. The White House is pressing the Chinese owner of video service TikTok to sell its U.S. operation, which American officials say is a security risk.\n",
      "\tXi promised to cut tariffs but gave no details.\n",
      "\t\"We will further reduce tariffs and institutional costs, cultivate a number of import trade promotion innovation demonstration zones, and expand imports of high-quality products and services from various countries,\" he said.\n",
      "\tChina's repeated promises to set up trade zones and ease import restrictions prompt complaints by the United States, Europe, Japan and other trading partners that Beijing is using such isolated steps to avoid complying with promises made when it joined the World Trade Organization in 2001 to allow foreign companies to compete freely in its economy.\n",
      "\tChina is one of the world's biggest importers, but the United States and other governments complain Beijing is dragging its feet on carrying out two-decade-old promises to open its markets to foreign competitors in banking, finance and other services.\n",
      "\tLeaders from Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia also spoke at Thursday's event, calling for a deeper commitment to open and free trade to bolster the region's economy.\n",
      "\tSingapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said RCEP was a \"big step forward\" for Asian economic integration as progress in APEC was hampered by Washington's inward-looking trade policy.\n",
      "\tWith new President-elect Joe Biden's government seen as more supportive of multilateral trade, Lee voiced hope the new U.S. government will be more constructive in its dealings with other countries.\n",
      "\t\"Taking care of America's interests does not mean having to ride roughshod over other countries' interests,\" Lee said.\n",
      "\tMalaysian Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin said free and open trade and investment, regional economic integration, as well as economic and technical co-operation must remain APEC's priorities moving forward.\n",
      "\tBut he said there is now a need \"to ensure a delicate balance between our health priorities and economic needs.\"\n",
      "\tIndonesian President Joko Widodo defended a controversial new jobs law that he said would improve the business climate and prop up his country's economic growth.\n",
      "\tThe law approved last month revises dozens of existing regulations to cut red tape. It sparked violent protests from workers who fear it will cripple labour rights and harm the environment.\n",
      "\t\"Indonesia is using the momentum of this crisis to carry out extraordinary structural reforms....so that we can move quickly through these difficult times. We are ready to open the doors widely for businessmen and for investors in new ways,\" Widodo said.\n",

      "\tThe border officer who led Meng Wanzhou's immigration exam at Vancouver's airport before her arrest two years ago says he wanted to adjourn the process as quickly as possible but was told to wait.\n",
      "\tSowmith Katragadda began his testimony Wednesday in B.C. Supreme Court as part of an evidentiary hearing in Meng's extradition case.\n",
      "\tOne of Katragadda's superiors also denied during cross-examination that he interjected with questions about Huawei's activity in the United States and Iran to aid American officials.\n",
      "\t\"I wanted to conduct my exam efficiently and conclude it as reasonably quickly as I can,\" Katragadda testified under questioning by a Crown prosecutor.\n",
      "\tKatragadda said although there were possible concerns about serious criminality and national security that could affect Meng's admissibility to Canada, he understood that completing those exams could take days. He knew the RCMP were prepared to arrest Meng and didn't want to unduly delay that process, he said.\n",
      "\t\"We felt it was not appropriate to delay the RCMP process by several days.\"\n",
      "\tKatragadda said he proceeded with a basic customs and immigration exam, which included examining her luggage and asking questions about her plans in Canada.\n",
      "\tIf Meng was ultimately extradited, the immigration exam would not be necessary and if she wasn't, it would resume at that point, he said.\n",
      "\tHe went into the superintendents' office and told his superiors he was ready to adjourn the exam. But they indicated they wanted to consult the Canada Border Services Agency's national security unit first, he said.\n",
      "\tThe process was delayed because it was difficult to reach someone at the unit on the weekend. After one of Katragadda's superiors got through to the unit, he verbally shared the questions with Katragadda, court heard.\n",
      "\tMeng told Katragadda where she had homes around the world, that she had relinquished her Canadian permanent residency and Chinese passport and only had status in Hong Kong, and that she had no issues with law enforcement anywhere, he said.\n",
      "\tKatragadda said he was concerned about the perception that the border agency and the RCMP were working together so he felt it was appropriate for the CBSA to conduct its process independently, before handing Meng over to the Mounties.\n",
      "\t\"I understood this was a serious case. I understood the likelihood of the whole process being reviewed and I felt we needed to take appropriate measures to ensure the processes were separate and clear,\" he said.\n",
      "\tDuring a meeting with the RCMP before Meng's plane landed, he told them that if they had any questions about information obtained during the border exam, there was a legal and appropriate venue for making such a request.\n",
      "\t\"It is within my personal normal practice to pre-emptively let a partner agency know, if they did have questions, there are proper avenues to receive those answers. And the proper avenue isn't through me,\" Katragadda said.\n",
      "\tMeng is facing extradition to the United States on charges of fraud and conspiracy to commit fraud.\n",
      "\tMeng and Huawei deny allegations that she made false statements to HSBC, significantly understating Huawei's relationship with Iranian affiliate Skycom Tech Co., which put the bank at risk of violating U.S. sanctions against Iran.\n",
      "\tMeng's lawyers plan to argue in February that she was subject to an abuse of process. They are gathering evidence in the evidentiary hearing to support their allegation that Canadian officials gathered evidence to support the criminal case in the U.S. under the guise of a routine border exam.\n",
      "\tCourt has heard that before the immigration exam was adjourned, one of Katragadda's superiors, acting Supt. Sanjit Dhillon, interjected with questions about where Huawei does business and specifically whether it does business in the United States or Iran.\n",
      "\tDhillon testified that a Wikipedia article he read before Meng's plane landed on Dec. 1, 2018, raised concerns about serious criminality and national security that could make her inadmissible to Canada.\n",
      "\tHe acknowledged under cross-examination that he only asked about the company's activity in the United States and Iran, not Canada.\n",
      "\t\"I didn't ask her specifically about her company doing espionage in Canada. No question I posited was as specific as that,\" Dhillon said.\n",
      "\tDhillon was one of two superintendents working that day and he also said he did not recall asking Katragadda to delay adjournment of the exam.\n",
      "\tDefence lawyer Mona Duckett posited to Dhillon that he was not questioning Meng to determine her admissibility to Canada, but to advance the interests of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\n",
      "\t\"My proposition to you is that you did not question her about admissibility issues ... but you questioned her about the topic of the U.S. warrant, which you knew from the meeting with the police was related to Iran and sanctions,\" Duckett said.\n",
      "\tDhillon said the questions were relevant to Meng's admissibility.\n",
      "\tDuckett then suggested that Dhillon never looked at Wikipedia that morning at all but only said so after one of his own superiors asked him where his line of questioning came from.\n",
      "\t\"This is a creation after the fact,\" Duckett said.\n",
      "\t\"No it is not,\" he replied.\n",
      "\tDuckett suggested he asked the questions knowing that Meng's passcodes to her electronics had been obtained, and that the exam would soon be adjourned.\n",
      "\t\"Your only intent in this matter, officer Dhillon, was to gather evidence that might be of use to the FBI,\" Duckett said.\n",

      "\tShe will be joined by former deputy public health officer Dr. Paul Gully and Mylaine Breton, who studies the organization of front-line health care at Universite de Sherbrooke in Quebec.\n",
      "\tThe network, known commonly as GPHIN, was created more than two decades ago and helped flag both the SARS pandemic in 2003 and H1N1 flu in 2009, before either really exploded. It is a big part of the World Health Organization's work gathering intelligence on health concerns arising around the world, such as the Ebola outbreak in West Africa in 2014.\n",
      "\tBut its focus on international outbreaks of disease shifted in 2019 when the Public Health Agency of Canada adjusted the network's mandate to focus more on domestic matters.\n",
      "\tSome experts have said that shift left Canada without much early intelligence or consistent warnings on the novel coronavirus as it emerged in China last fall.\n",
      "\tDr. Theresa Tam, the federal chief public health officer, has said GPHIN notified her last Dec. 31 of a mysterious cluster of pneumonia cases linked to a potentially new virus, and notified her provincial counterparts within days.\n",
      "\tAccording to Chinese reports, that was just four days after Chinese authorities were notified by doctors in Hubei province about a SARS-like virus causing pneumonia -- but a month after the first discussion of symptoms of an unknown virus began in China.\n",
      "\tGPHIN's warning also was issued the day after a warning came from ProMED, a similar alerting system run by the International Society for Infectious Diseases.\n",
      "\tAt the end of October Tam said COVID-19 has provided many lessons for public health about the systems Canada had in place to respond to an emerging pandemic, what worked and what didn't, including as it relates to GPHIN.\n",
      "\t\"GPHIN is something that we should be proud of,\" Tam said, at a news conference releasing her annual report Oct. 28. \"We need to think about what the next iteration of GPHIN looks like.\"\n",
      "\tHajdu said she ordered the review after scientists at the Public Health Agency of Canada said their concerns about GPHIN's priorities were not being heard by senior officials at the agency. She said the three panellists will report to her in the spring.\n",
      "\t\"I think that they will do an exemplary job at discovering why those decisions were made,\" Hajdu said.\n",
      "\tHajdu said a network like GPHIN is \"a critically important tool for Canada.\"\n",
      "\t\"I think it's very, very important that we understand what happened and, furthermore, how we ensure that we build it up to to make sure it has the strongest potential to alert Canada to emerging health threats, both globally but also here domestically,\" she said.\n",
      "\tConservative health critic Michelle Rempel Garner said Hajdu doesn't need a review panel because the decisions to adjust GPHIN's priorities would not have been finalized without the minister herself signing off on the plan.\n",
      "\t\"Why did she sign off on it or who did?\" said Rempel Garner. \"I don't think we need an inquiry for that. We just need them to be honest.\"\n",

      "\tSales of luxury apparel, jewelry and beauty products are set to slide by nearly a quarter this year as the pandemic wipes out more than six years of growth, according to a study released Wednesday by the consultancy Bain.\n",
      "\tStill, the drop is narrower than the 35% collapse forecast in the spring, thanks largely to a market recovery in China, which is generating nearly a third of all sales.\n",
      "\tFor 2020, the sector is expected to generate 217 billion euros ($256 billion) in revenues, which is 2 billion euros below 2014 levels and down 64 billion euros from 2019, Bain said in the semi-annual study prepared for Italy's Altagamma association of high-end producers.\n",
      "\tIt is the first decrease since the 2009 financial crisis, when the industry suffered a 9% drop but also quickly recovered the following year.\n",
      "\tThe timing of any bounce back from the pandemic remains uncertain as a resurgence in the virus is leading countries to once again shut down non-essential retail and travel around the globe. It will largely depend on the timing of a vaccine, Bain partner Claudia D'Arpizio said in an interview.\n",
      "\tD'Arpizio expects the outlook to become clearer in the second quarter, when it will be easier to understand how strong spending is in China, the impact of any stimulus measures in the U.S. and Europe as well as any new tax policies by U.S. President-elect Joe Biden, which are likely to affect high-earners.\n",
      "\t\"I see a lot of uncertainty for next year, with less uncertainty for the longer term,\" D'Arpizio said.\n",
      "\tForecasts for 2021 growth fall in an unusually large range of 10% to 19%. Brands' profits are expected to drop 60% this year and recover only half of that next year.\n",
      "\tChina, where the market is already improving, is expected to lead the trend. Bain foresees a full global recovery between 2022 and 2023, with Chinese customers responsible for nearly half of all sales by 2025.\n",
      "\tAs more people around the globe were forced to stay home, apparel sales fell 30% to 45 billion euros. Footwear slid 12% to 19 billion euros, thanks to the sneaker trend which drove a second half rebound, while Asian consumers helped cushion a 15% decline in jewelry sales to 18 billion euros.\n",
      "\tThe pandemic is accelerating transitions that were already under way in the sector, including a shift to online buying, a focus on sustainability and diversity, the growing role of younger generations and experimentation with digital platforms to replace or enhance the runway experience.\n",
      "\t\"The pandemic has eliminated the excuses for brands that didn't understand the trends, to give a sense of urgency to the right investments,\" D'Arpizio said.\n",
      "\tShe cautioned that the longer the crisis endures, some brands will run out of cash, forcing some out of business and others to restructure.\n",
      "\t\"The more the situation is sustained, the more we risk the crisis will be permanent,\" she said.\n",

      "\tCatriona Le May Doan says she's ready to mentor and shield Canada's athletes at the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing.\n",
      "\tThe two-time Olympic gold medallist in speedskating was named Canada's 2022 chef de mission Tuesday by the Canadian Olympic Committee.\n",
      "\tLe May Doan won gold in the 500 metres in 1998 and 2002. She became the first Canadian to successfully defend an Olympic title.\n",
      "\tThe 49-year-old from Saskatoon lives in Calgary, where she's president and chief executive officer of Sport Calgary.\n",
      "\tThe four-time Olympian worked as a CBC and CTV Olympic commentator since retiring from her sport.\n",
      "\tLe May Doan served on the Canadian team's mission staff in 2018 in Pyeongchang, South Korea.\n",
      "\tShe was a lead athlete mentor working alongside chef de mission Isabelle Charest, from whom Le May Doan inherits the job.\n",
      "\t\"It was a great experience in 2018 being on the mission team. I knew that I wanted to do more than that,\" Le May Doan told The Canadian Press.\n",
      "\t\"It really does kind of complete my Olympic circle, having been athlete, media and mission team. It was something I really wanted, I think maybe more than I even understood.\"\n",
      "\tCanadian athletes won 29 medals, including 11 gold, to rank third behind Norway and Germany in the overall medal count in Pyeongchang.\n",
      "\tThe chef de mission, or \"head of mission\", is an ambassador for the entire team leading into and during the Games.\n",
      "\tOnce a role given to Canadian sport administrators, the volunteer position is now filled by former Olympic athletes.\n",
      "\tChampion rower Marnie McBean is Canada's chef for the 2021 Summer Olympics in Tokyo.\n",
      "\tPrevious chefs include cyclist Curt Harnett (2016), skier Steve Podborski (2014), swimmer Mark Tewksbury (2012), speedskater Nathalie Lambert (2010) and diver Sylvie Bernier (2008).\n",
      "\t\"Catriona has huge credibility and respect in the sport and broader community, is an inspiring leader and is passionate about sport and the Olympic movement,\" COC president Tricia Smith said in a statement.\n",
      "\t\"Between her vast experience in the world of sport, her integrity and the way she consistently lives the Olympic values of excellence, respect and friendship, we are all extremely fortunate and excited to have Catriona as chef for Beijing 2022.\"\n",
      "\tIn addition to mentorship, the chef de mission also deals with Canadian team issues that can erupt into a firestorm.\n",
      "\tWhen Le May Doan claimed her first gold medal in Nagano, Japan, Canadian chef Bill Wakelin dealt with snowboarder Ross Rebagliati being stripped of his gold medal because he tested positive for marijuana.\n",
      "\tThe medal was reinstated before the closing ceremonies because marijuana wasn't on the prohibited list of banned substances.\n",
      "\tLe May Doan carried Canada's flag into the 2002 opening ceremonies in Salt Lake City, where chef Sally Rehorick got little sleep because of a figure-skating judging scandal.\n",
      "\tCanadian pair Jamie Sale and David Pelletier performed what many believed was the superior free skate, but were given lower marks and a silver medal behind a Russian duo.\n",
      "\tThe controversy burned and kept Canada front and centre at the Games until a duplicate set of gold medals were awarded to Sale and Pelletier.\n",
      "\t\"There's stuff in every Games for sure. In certain ways for me, it was good because it took attention away from me,\" Le May Doan recalled. \"There's so much pressure you put on yourself.\n",
      "\t\"When things are good, the chef steps aside and says the focus is on the athlete and that's what the Games are about.\n",
      "\t\"But when things are stressful, if there's some situation you have to deal with, the chef's role is to then stand in front of the team and be that spokesperson and take that sort of distraction away from the athletes.\"\n",
      "\tCanada's winter-sport athletes are facing travel complications, postponement and cancellation of events and shortened seasons because of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n",
      "\tCanada's relationship with China is strained. Canada arrested Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou in 2018 because of an extradition agreement with the United States.\n",
      "\tChina immediately arrested Canadian citizens Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig, who are still in custody.\n",
      "\tCanada's United Nations ambassador Bob Rae criticized China's treatment of Uyghur people in The Globe and Mail this week.\n",
      "\tIn the same article, Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology scholar Timothy Grose, who specializes in Chinese ethnic policy, suggested a boycott of the 2022 Olympics.\n",
      "\tWhen Le May Doan bore Canada's flag into the 2002 opening ceremonies, the man carrying the \"Canada\" placard in front of her was Brian Maxwell.\n",
      "\tHe wasn't wearing a Canadian uniform, Le May Doan said, and Canada's athletes didn't know who he was\n",
      "\tMaxwell was a Canadian marathoner who wasn't allowed to race in the 1980 Summer Games in Moscow.\n",
      "\tCanada had joined other countries in boycotting the Games over the Soviet Union's invasion of Afghanistan.\n",
      "\t\"A boycott only hurts the athletes. It does not solve anything,\" Le May Doan said.\n",
      "\t\"My role as chef and the athletes' role is to prepare and then go to the Games to show Canadian values, to represent our country, to represent Olympic values on that world stage and build bridges between countries.\"\n",

      "\tChinese telecom giant Huawei rose to dominance by stealing the technology of the defunct Canadian firm Nortel, Conservative Leader Erin O'Toole says.\n",
      "\tO'Toole levelled the industrial-espionage charge against Huawei and the Chinese Communist Party on Tuesday as he announced that the Conservatives are pushing the Liberals to decide within 30 days which companies can provide Canada's next-generation 5G wireless internet technology.\n",
      "\t\"The rise of Huawei was itself facilitated by years of industrial espionage conducted by China against Nortel,\" O'Toole told a press conference on Parliament Hill.\n",
      "\t\"Intellectual-property theft, counterfeiting and digital piracy are not exceptions to our dealings with China. They are the reality, and it's high time our government and many corporate leaders realize that,\" the Conservative leader added.\n",
      "\t\"We may have lost Nortel to Huawei but we can and must learn from it. Because if we don't, we have to accept that another company will be next.\"\n",
      "\tNortel Networks Corp., a once mighty Canadian telecom giant, filed for bankruptcy in 2009, becoming one of the country's most spectacular business failures. Two years later, Nortel executed the biggest patent sale in history, raising billions in cash, when it auctioned off 6,000 patents to a consortium that included Apple and Microsoft.\n",
      "\tThe Conservatives are tabling a motion in the House of Commons that demands the government decide whether Huawei ought to be banned from participating in Canadian 5G networks amid the ongoing diplomatic dispute between Canada and the People's Republic.\n",
      "\t \n",
      "\tChina has imprisoned two Canadians, Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, in apparent retaliation for the RCMP's arresting Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou nearly two years ago on a U.S. extradition warrant.\n",
      "\tThe United States is pressuring Canada and its allies in the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing network to ban Huawei because it views the company as an espionage arm of the Chinese state, a charge the company denies.\n",
      "\tPrime Minister Justin Trudeau was noncommittal Tuesday on the timing of his government's long-awaited 5G decision. He reiterated his government's position that it is relying on the advice of security and intelligence agencies, is consulting with allies, and is committed to keeping Canadians and their businesses safe.\n",
      "\tO'Toole said he wants the matter debated in the Commons and wants a new strategy for relations with China, because the Liberals have not done enough stand up to its intimidation of Canada.\n",
      "\tForeign Affairs Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne said during question period that he is open to working with the Conservatives on national security and foreign policy and would be prepared to propose constructive amendments moving forward.\n",
      "\tChampagne said the government is working on a new plan to deal with China because China is not the same country it was four years ago and Canada needs a plan to respond to the \"new reality.\"\n",
      "\tO'Toole said China poses long-standing domestic risks, including threats from its foreign agents to Chinese-Canadians and the peddling of anti-western propaganda through post-secondary Confucius Institute partnerships as well as Chinese media outlets.\n",
      "\t\"It is now fashionable in some quarters to say that say that standing up for human rights is anti-Chinese racism and that denouncing Chinese state bullying is paternalistic,\" said O'Toole.\n",
      "\t\"When a dictatorship starts having so much influence, to the point that protecting Canadian citizens on Canadian soil is now an open question for a debate, you know we have a problem.\"\n",
      "\tTrudeau told O'Toole during question period that Canadian security agencies are actively protecting Canadians from foreign influence and interference.\n",
      "\t\"Not all of it appears in the newspapers. On the contrary, a lot of the work that is done in important situations is never heard of at all,\" Trudeau said.\n",
      "\tThe prime minister also said the government is working with Canadian universities, industry partners and national security agencies to protect research projects from threats.\n",
      "\t\"We will always protect data and intellectual property, advance science and ensure that international research partnerships are always beneficial to Canadians,\" said Trudeau.\n",
      "\tChampagne told reporters after a Monday night cabinet meeting that the government takes reports of Chinese foreign intimidation seriously and that he is working with Public Safety Minister Bill Blair, the RCMP and the Canadian Security Intelligence Service to address it.\n",
      "\t\"Our security and intelligence community, including CSIS and the RCMP, are actively investigating threats of foreign interference and espionage, and where the evidence exists, we will take action,\" Blair said Tuesday.\n",
      "\tO'Toole acknowledged there could be an economic cost to Canada taking his proposed harder line against China, but he played down the potential effects.\n",
      "\tAsked whether his party's action would expose Kovrig and Spavor to reprisals from their Chinese captors, he blamed Trudeau for not doing enough to secure their release.\n",
      "\t\"I think about the two Michaels every day, and I think many Canadians do,\" he said.\n",

      "\tThe Long March-5 was transported by tractor from its hangar to the nearby launch site at the space base in Wenchang along the coast of the southern island province of Hainan.\n",
      "\tThe Chang'e 5 mission it will carry is scheduled to launch early next week, placing a lander on the moon that will drill 2 metres (almost 7 feet) beneath the surface and scoop up rocks and other debris to be brought to earth. That would allow scientists to study newly obtained lunar materials for the fist time since the American and Russian missions of the 1960s and 1970s.\n",
      "\tThe mission, named for the Chinese moon goddess, is among China's most ambitious as its space program continues to build steam since it first put a man in space in 2003, becoming only the third nation to do so after the U.S. and Russia.\n",
      "\tChina currently has a mission on the way to Mars, along with a rover on the moon's far side that is providing the first full measurements of radiation exposure from the lunar surface, information vital for any country that plans to send astronauts to the moon.\n",
      "\tChina has increasingly engaged with foreign countries on missions, although U.S. law still prevents collaboration with NASA, excluding China from partnering with the International Space Station. That has prompted China to work on its own space station and launch its own programs that have put it in a steady competition with Japan and India among Asian nations seeking to notch new achievements in space.\n",
      "\tThe space program has progressed cautiously, with relatively few setbacks in recent years. The Long March-5, nicknamed \"Fat 5\" because of its bulky shape, failed on a previous launch attempt, but China's enormous pool of technical and engineering talent appears to have allowed it to overcome most obstacles.\n",

      "CONTENT : OTTAWA -- \n",
      "\tPrime Minister Justin Trudeau highlighted the work of journalists working under pressure in Hong Kong and Belarus at Monday's international conference on media freedom.\n",
      "\tCanada has been vocal in condemning the clampdowns on democracy and free expression by the Chinese government in the former British colony of Hong Kong and the fraudulent presidential election in Belarus that has given rise to pro-democracy protests.\n",
      "\t“Today, we see citizens calling for change, from Hong Kong to Belarus, only to have the authorities attack the freedom of the press,” Trudeau told the conference co-hosted by Canada and Botswana on Monday.\n",
      "\tTrudeau denounced the imprisonment of Reuters journalists Kyaw Soe Oo and Wa Lone for reporting on military atrocities committed against the Rohingya people in Myanmar, and of Philippine journalist Maria Ressa.\n",
      "\tThe Reuters journalists have since gained freedom and have been awarded a Pulitzer Prize. In June, Ressa was convicted of “cyber libel” and sentenced to six years behind bars after complaints from her country's strongman president, Rodrigo Duterte, and other officials from his government.\n",
      "\t“It is never acceptable for a journalist to be attacked for doing their job,” said Trudeau.\n",
      "\t“A crackdown on the media puts democracy in danger. It puts lives in danger.”\n",
      "\tAt the same event, a coalition of international lawyers, led by a former Canadian attorney general, called for a new global charter to protect the rights of imprisoned journalists in an increasingly hostile world.\n",
      "\tIrwin Cotler, the former Liberal justice minister and international human rights lawyer, made the recommendation in a report he authored for a coalition of independent international legal experts.\n",
      "\tThe new charter would upgrade legal obligations on a country that arbitrarily imprisons a journalist and impose new legal duties on the home country of a journalist who has been rounded up.\n",
      "\tCotler says the new measures are needed because the current international laws designed to protect diplomatic access to people imprisoned in foreign countries are not adequate.\n",
      "\t“We meet today on the occasion not only of a global COVID pandemic, but a global political pandemic, characterized by a resurgent global authoritarianism, the backsliding of democracies and global assaults on media freedom, where journalists are increasingly under threat and under assault,” Cotler told the video conference.\n",
      "\t“Although some states already do this to some extent, the system is haphazard and weak,” said Amal Clooney, an international human rights lawyer who has represented imprisoned journalists\n",
      "\tCotler and Clooney say the COVID-19 pandemic has emboldened authoritarian governments and created new risks to journalists working internationally.\n",
      "\t“So the report proposes a new charter of rights for detained journalists and a new code of conduct for governments to be overseen by a newly appointed international commissioner who would be tasked with monitoring states compliance,” said Clooney.\n",
      "\tClooney and Cotler are the leading figures on a panel created last year by the Canadian and British governments to find ways to increase protection to journalists and prevent abuses of media freedom.\n",
      "\tTrudeau called the work of their committee “a great example of the power of working together - as civil society, government, and global organizations - to stand up for the kind of future we all want to build.”\n",
      "\tNeither Trudeau nor Foreign Affairs Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne, who chaired the day-long meeting, veered close to addressing the abuse that American journalists have had to endure during the presidency of Donald Trump, who has called journalists the “enemy of the people.”\n",
      "\tAn American journalist who questioned Champagne during the event's closing teleconference asked the minister if he had any advice for her colleagues who recently covered large events with people “not doing the COVID-19 thing with their mask” while being harassed and called fake news and that also included “instances of journalists just being beaten up on the street.”\n",
      "\tChampagne replied that “we probably need to change the narrative when it comes to journalism and journalists.”\n",
      "\tChampagne was also asked to address the periodic media freedom issues that arise in Canada, including a September incident that saw the Ontario Provincial Police contact an Indigenous journalist in Caledonia, Ont. to tell him he was facing charges of mischief and disobeying a court order.\n",
      "\tChampagne said he wasn't aware of the specifics of the Caledonia incident.\n",
      "\t“What I would say is that what we said around the world, we should also reflect in Canada what we can do better,” the minister replied.\n",
      "\t“The protection of journalists, the independence of the media across Canada is certainly top of mind.”\n",

      "\tFrench President Emmanuel Macron held a closed-door, low-key meeting Monday with U.S. President Donald Trump's top diplomat, a delicate tip-toe around the ticklish fact that France has already recognized President-elect Joe Biden as the U.S. election winner.\n",
      "\tThe zero fanfare welcome for U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, a Trump loyalist, at the presidential Elysee Palace was in itself indicative of how Macron's government is already looking ahead to the Biden era.\n",
      "\tNo press conferences were held, depriving journalists of an opportunity to ask Macron's office, his Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian or Pompeo about whether they discussed their conflicting interpretations of the U.S. election result. Unusually, Le Drian met Pompeo at the Elysee Palace, rather than his own office.\n",
      "\tMacron's office described Pompeo's stop as a “courtesy” visit. The State Department said Pompeo and Macron “discussed ”significant threats to global security, efforts to counter violent extremism, Iran's destabilizing behaviour, and Hezbollah's malign influence in Lebanon.“ It said Pompeo had also stressed the importance of transatlantic alliance, NATO unity and countering China's increasing global influence.\n",
      "\tPompeo tweeted a photo of himself wearing a Stars and Stripes face mask in the meeting with “my good friend” Le Drian and said they had an “important discussion.”\n",
      "\t“There is no challenge we cannot conquer when the U.S.-France Transatlantic relationship is strong,” he tweeted.\n",
      "\tThe State Department said Pompeo and Le Drian had covered a range of topics, including NATO, stabilization efforts for Libya and Africa's Sahel region and what a statement described as “our strong alliance in countering the Chinese Communist Party's malign activity in Europe.” The nature of the alleged activity wasn't detailed.\n",
      "\tStill, it wasn't clear why Pompeo came so far in the midst of the pandemic and for so long, on a three-day stop in Paris that is largely locked down because of a surge of coronavirus cases, for such a low-visibility outcome.\n",
      "\tOfficials in Pompeo's team said French authorities told them that no press access was possible due to concerns over the pandemic.\n",
      "\tPompeo appeared last week to cast doubt on Trump's election defeat, speaking instead of “ a smooth transition to a second Trump administration.”\n",
      "\tMacron last week spoke by phone with Biden to congratulate him.\n",
      "\tBefore meeting Macron and Le Drian, Pompeo laid a bouquet of red, white and blue flowers at a memorial to victims of terrorism at a Paris landmark, the Hotel des Invalides.\n",
      "\tThe ceremony lasted about a minute.\n",
      "\t“The United States stands with France. We mourn the victims, pray for their families, and condemn in the strongest terms these senseless attacks against innocent French citizens.” Pompeo tweeted.\n",
      "\tFrom Paris, Pompeo travelled on to Turkey, where he will meet religious leaders in Istanbul but not government officials.\n",
      "\tSenior State Department officials said the lack of official meetings in Turkey was due to scheduling issues during the brief stop. They said meetings had been sought but Turkish officials were unable to come to Istanbul from the capital of Ankara during the time Pompeo will be there. The officials noted that Pompeo and his Turkish counterpart plan to see each other in early December at a meeting of NATO foreign ministers.\n",
      "\tPompeo's stop in Turkey will focus on promoting religious freedom and fighting religious persecution, which is a key priority for the U.S. administration, officials said. Pompeo will discuss religious issues with the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople Bartholomew I, considered the “first among equals” in the Orthodox world, and with the apostolic nuncio to Turkey, Archbishop Paul Russell.\n",
      "\tLater stops on the tour will include visits to Israeli settlements in the West Bank that have been avoided by previous secretaries of state.\n",

      "\tThe Chinese government is firing back at Canada's ambassador to the United Nations for calling on the UN to investigate whether China's persecution of ethnic Muslim Uighurs in its Xinjiang province is a genocide.\n",
      "\tDuring a news conference Monday in Beijing, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian described Bob Rae's comments as \"ridiculous,\" adding that Canada itself better fits the description of having perpetrated a genocide.\n",
      "\tRae told the CBC on Sunday that he has asked the UN Human Rights Council to investigate China's treatment of the country's Uighurs in Xinjiang.\n",
      "\tLast month a Canadian parliamentary subcommittee concluded in a report that China's treatment of the Uighurs is a genocide. China rejected that report as baseless.\n",
      "\tChina has been accused of using forced birth control to limit Uighur births, and detention camps to indoctrinate the mostly-Muslim minority into mainstream Chinese society. Beijing has denied any wrongdoing, saying it is running a voluntary employment and language-training program.\n",
      "\tZhao on Monday used a number of select statistics that suggest China's Uighur population is growing at a faster rate than Canada's population to mock Rae's suggestions that the Uighurs are being persecuted.\n",
      "\t\"I would like to ask this ambassador, if his logic is plausible in finding out who best fits the label of genocide, it seems that it is not the Uighurs who are persecuted, but rather the people of Canada, am I right?\" Zhao said.\n",
      "\tHowever, Zhao's statistics appear to have been incomplete or inaccurate and did not address a report by The Associated Press in June that birthrates have been dramatically cut in Uighur-dominated areas of Xinjiang.\n",
      "\tRae told the CBC on Sunday that \"there's no question that there's aspects of what the Chinese are doing that fits into the definition of genocide in the genocide convention.\"\n",
      "\tYet even as he levelled the allegation, he said an investigation needs to be conducted to gather the required evidence.\n",
      "\tIn response, Zhao questioned how Rae \"reached his conclusion without any evidence?\"\n",
      "\tForeign Affairs Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne did not dispute Rae's assertion of a genocide but he would not repeat it either.\n",
      "\t\"We have expressed on many occasions that we are gravely concerned about the situation in Xinjiang,\" he said following a cabinet meeting Monday.\n",
      "\tChampagne said he's raised the issue privately and publicly with China's foreign minister and he noted that Canada has joined 38 other countries in calling for experts to go into Xinjiang \"to assess the situation and to report back.\"\n",
      "\t\"We will stand up, we will speak up whenever we feel it is appropriate,\" Champagne said, maintaining that human rights are a core pillar of Canadian foreign policy.\n",
      "\t\"We have done that with respect to Xinjiang. We have done that with respect to Hong Kong more recently and we will continue to do so.\"\n",
      "\tRelations between Canada and China are at an all-time low not only because of Beijing's treatment of its Uighurs, but also due to its continued detention of two Canadian citizens in retaliation for the arrest of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou.\n",
      "\tCanada has also joined Western allies in condemning Beijing's recent actions in Hong Kong, where the Communist regime has been accused of violating international agreements by cracking down on democracy in the former British colony.\n",
      "\tChampagne said the government is also taking \"very seriously\" reports that China has sent covert agents to Canada to spy on and intimidate Chinese-Canadians.\n",
      "\t\"We are very much seized of that,\" he said, adding that foreign interference \"won't be tolerated.\"\n",
      "\t\"We are working now with CSIS, with the RCMP, with Minister Blair to come up with a framework to make sure that we can continue to protect Canadians in light of this new threat.\"\n",
      "\tAt a meeting Monday evening of the Canada-China relations committee, Immigration Minister Marco Mendicino was repeatedly asked by opposition MPs whether Canada has revoked visas for anyone involved in acts of intimidation against Chinese-Canadians.\n",
      "\tHe would not answer directly, saying it would be inappropriate to comment on individual cases. But Mendicino did say that conduct that amounts to espionage or interference or a criminal act in Canada is taken seriously by public safety officials.\n",

      "\tAustralian swimmer Shayna Jack was banned for two years on Monday for accidental doping, with her sanction expiring days before the start of the Tokyo Olympics.\n",

      "CONTENT : HALLE, BELGIUM -- \n",
      "\tNew Kim is worth her weight in gold and then some -- actually much, much more.\n",
      "\tA wealthy Chinese pigeon racing fan put down a record price of 1.6 million euros (US$1.9 million) for the Belgian-bred bird, saying a lot more than merely what kind of money can be made in the once-quaint sport, which seemed destined to decline only a few years back.\n",
      "\tDuring a frantic last half hour Sunday at the end of a two-week auction at the Pipa pigeon centre, two Chinese bidders operating under the pseudonyms Super Duper and Hitman drove up the price by 280,000 euros ($325,000), leaving the previous record that Belgian-bred Armando fetched last year well behind by 350,000 euros ($406,000).\n",
      "\tSuper Duper got the hen, and behind the pseudonym is said to be the same wealthy Chinese industrialist who already had Armando, allowing for breeding with the two expensive birds.\n",
      "\tIt was proof again that an age-old hobby in Western Europe identified with working-class men now has a new, elitist foreign lease on life. Top breeders relying on generations of family experience can now sell their birds for prices unheard of merely a decade ago, and often China is their destination.\n",
      "\tOn this occasion, successful breeder Gaston Van de Wouwer retired at 76 and his son had too busy a professional life to continue the famed pigeon coop. All 445 birds were put on auction and the overall sale was already pushing past 6 million euros ($7 million). A second part of the auction is ending on Monday, but didn't include any bird that could match New Kim. It still amounted to an amazing weekend for one pigeon breeder.\n",
      "\tBelgians have long stood out as the best breeders, both because of their generations-long experience and the density of a network where many breeders can organize races close together. It's not a short-term endeavour, however, since becoming expert at genetic breeding with the constant mixing and mating of birds takes years, if not decades. Birds can live up to 15 years.\n",
      "\t\"Everybody is interested in our pigeons,\" Pascal Bodengien, head of the Belgian pigeon federation, told The Associated Press.\n",
      "\tOnly a decade ago, the record price for a pigeon stood at one-tenth of New Kim's price. And the current price of gold stands about 26,000 euros ($30,350) per pound.\n",
      "\tAs so often, globalization has made the difference.\n",
      "\tWith the rise of business wealth in China came also conspicuous consumption and a new venue for gambling. Somehow, pigeons fit the bill. China often features one-loft racing, where pigeons all get used to one coop for months and then are released many hundreds of miles away to make their way back with their unique sense of orientation and special speed training. Prize pots can reach into the tens of millions of euros.\n",
      "\tFor breeding, though, there is no place like Belgium. This is where, little more than a generation ago, the national weekend radio news was followed by announcements on whether pigeons were released in faraway places in France or even Spain and what weather conditions the birds were facing.\n",
      "\tAfter World War II, Belgium had over 250,000 members in the pigeon fancier federation. Now there are 18,000, Bodengien says.\n",
      "\tPigeon breeding demands constant attention, every single day of the year. Those demands had turned away many modern folk, once sending the sport into a decline.\n",
      "\t\"To be the best, it has to be your life's work. For some, it may seem boring. Day in, day out. Winter and summer, always those pigeons.\" he said.\n",
      "\tOnce bitten though, many remain committed for life. And the news that a pigeon can sell for $1.9 million could prompt new challengers to enter the sport. Bodengien welcomed that development but urged patience and a reality check.\n",
      "\t\"Anybody thinking about getting into our sport to get money out of it had better think again and move to another sport,\" he said.\n",

      "\tAs Chinese glass company Xinyi looks to develop a new manufacturing facility in Stratford, some residents are pushing back.\n",
      "\tThe $400 million plant has been proposed for south Stratford. Carmen Grant lives nearby and is raising concerns about its environmental impact.\n",
      "\t“Air quality, our water supply, and our soil quality,” she said. “Environmentally sound practices are the only way forward.”\n",
      "\tXinyi Canada Glass will use over one million litres of water a day. The City of Stratford says they are currently using only 31 per cent of their total water supply and the facility would increase that by eight per cent.\n",
      "\tChris Pidgeon, the lead consultant for the project, says the water they use will be recycled.\n",
      "\t“The water is predominantly used for cooling and they use that water over and over again,” he said.\n",
      "\tPidgeon adds that any wastewater discharge will go to the city’s treatment plant and these standards meet Stratford’s sewer bylaw.\n",
      "\tWhen it comes to the air, the consultant says most of the emissions will be steam from water, the other emissions is natural gas burning.\n",
      "\tThe company will also surpass Ontario’s current air quality standards and environmental regulations by using solar energy and heat recovery for electricity, according to Pidgeon.\n",
      "\t“Five different ministries have been involved vetting this process,” said Stratford Mayor Dan Mathieson. “Normally there would be a public process when the land would have been rezoned, but that’s not the case in this piece because of the minister’s zoning order.”\n",
      "\tThe public is invited to a special city council meeting on Monday to speak on the development.\n",
      "\t“People need the time to really look at this and understand what’s going on,” said Stratford resident Sharon Collingwood.\n",
      "\tXinyi’s construction proposal can be found below, with production at full capacity expected by 2024.\n",

      "\tU.S. President Donald Trump skipped summits with his Asian counterparts for the third year in a row on Saturday, even as rival China is set to expand its influence with a massive free trade deal in the region.\n",
      "\tNational Security Adviser Robert O'Brien said Trump regretted he was unable to attend the online summit with the 10 members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, but stressed the importance of ties with the region.\n",
      "\t\"At this time of global crisis, the U.S.-ASEAN strategic partnership has become even more important as we work together to combat the coronavirus,\" O'Brien said in remarks at the opening ceremony, which was livestreamed to ASEAN members watching from their respective countries.\n",
      "\tTrump attended the ASEAN summit in 2017, but sent only representatives during the last two meetings. A special summit with ASEAN that he was supposed to host in Las Vegas in March was called off due to the pandemic.\n",
      "\tTrump has been busy challenging the results of the Nov. 3 presidential election, insisting he was the victim of election fraud. Most countries have acknowledged Joe Biden's victory.\n",
      "\tO'Brien also represented the U.S. at an East Asia virtual summit later Saturday that included the ASEAN members as well as Australia, China, India, Japan, South Korea, New Zealand and Russia.\n",
      "\tDespite Trump's absence, the White House said in a statement that ASEAN remains central to his vision for a \"free and open Indo-Pacific,\" Washington's strategy to counter China's growing influence in the region.\n",
      "\tChina's sway in the region is set to expand with a free trade agreement that will be signed Sunday. The pact, which will cover almost a third of the world economy, includes the ASEAN nations, China, Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand.\n",
      "\tIndia backed out of the plan last year, and the agreement also does not include the United States, despite America's $2 trillion in trade with the countries in the pact.\n",
      "\tIn his remarks Saturday, O'Brien touted ASEAN as the fourth-largest trading partner for the U.S., with trade reaching over $354 billion last year.\n",
      "\t\"We deeply appreciate ASEAN partners' efforts to keep the key supply chains open, factories operating and PPE flowing,\" O'Brien said, referring to personal protective equipment used to protect against the coronavirus.\n",
      "\tHe noted that the U.S. had contributed $87 million to combat the coronavirus in Southeast Asia, including providing ventilators and PPE.\n",
      "\t\"The United States has your back and we know you have ours,\" O'Brien said.\n",
      "\tAt the East Asia summit later Saturday, UN Secretary-General Antonio Gutteres said the virus had infected at least 14 million people in Asia and killed more than a quarter million in the region. At least 39 million people could revert to extreme poverty in East Asia alone, he warned.\n",
      "\tThe UN has urged countries to put together a stimulus package amounting to at least 10% of global gross domestic product, Gutteres said.\n",
      "\tWith the global community facing its deepest recession since the Second World War, the World Bank is on track to commit a record $160 billion over 15 months, including grants and concessional financing, said its president, David Malpass.\n",
      "\tStill, the pandemic remains an enormous obstacle to development and a successful vaccination program will be key to recovery, he said.\n",
      "\tEarlier Saturday, China, Japan and South Korea sought deeper regional co-operation to battle the pandemic.\n",
      "\t\"Facing a possible second wave as winter is setting in, we can work together to mitigate the pandemic and to reopen the economy,\" said Chinese Premier Li Keqiang.\n",
      "\tSouth Korean President Moon Jae-in said the region must work together toward the development and equitable supply of vaccines and treatments, and establish an effective mechanism to prepare to battle new infectious diseases.\n",
      "\tHe said the speed of global economic recovery will be very uneven amid trade protectionism and uncertainties in the financial markets. An accelerated transition to a digital economy could also widen the gap between social classes, Moon warned.\n",
      "\t\"We must work to strengthen the resilience of our economies and identify measures for inclusive, sustainable growth,\" he said.\n",
      "\tJapanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga said Tokyo has been engaged in boosting ASEAN's economic resilience and remains committed to deepening ties with Southeast Asia.\n",

      "\tThe hit short-form video app -- which has some 100 million users in the U.S. -- was given a reprieve after the Commerce Department said it was holding off on banning it owing to an injunction by a federal judge issued on October 30.\n",

      "CONTENT : \n",
      "\tThe world watched as California and the Amazon went up in flames this year, but the largest tropical wetland on earth has been ablaze for months, largely unnoticed by the outside world.\n",
      "\tSouth America's Pantanal region has been hit by the worst wildfires in decades. The blazes have already consumed about 28% of the vast floodplain that stretches across parts of Brazil, Bolivia and Paraguay. They are still not completely under control.\n",
      "\tThe fires have destroyed unique habitats and wrecked the livelihoods of many of the Pantanal's diverse indigenous communities. But their damaging impact reaches far beyond the region.\n",
      "\tWetlands like the Pantanal are Earth's most effective carbon sinks -- ecosystems that absorb and store more carbon than they release, keeping it away from the atmosphere. At roughly 200,000 square kilometres, the Pantanal comprises about 3% of the globe's wetlands and plays a key role in the carbon cycle.\n",
      "\tWhen these carbon-rich ecosystems burn, vast amounts of heat-trapping gases are released back into the atmosphere, contributing to the greenhouse effect.\n",
      "\t\"The Pantanal is very important for the planet, it has unique wild areas that are fundamental to life on Earth,\" said Andre Luiz Siqueira, the CEO of ECOA, an environmental NGO based in the Brazilian state of Mato Grosso do Sul. \"It is vital that it [receives] as much attention as the Amazon.\"\n",
      "\tBrazil's National Institute of Space Research (INPE) has detected more than 21,200 fires in the Pantanal biome so far this year, a figure that is already 69% higher than the full-year record from 2005, when INPE recorded roughly 12,500 fires. There were 8,106 fires in September alone -- more than four times the historic average for the month.\n",
      "\tAlberto Setzer, a senior scientist at INPE, said satellite data shows the fires are the worst since records began in 2002, both in terms of the number of individual blazes and the area burnt.\n",
      "\tThe Pantanal's distinctive habitats rely on what scientists call the \"flood pulse.\" During the wet season between November and March, three quarters of the plain gets flooded, only for much of the water to drain away during the dry months, from April to September. This seasonal flooding makes the Pantanal a unique biome where large swaths of land regularly turn from terrestrial into aquatic habitats and back again.\n",
      "\tThe area is home to thousands of endangered or unusual species, including jaguars, capybaras, black caimans, giant otters and hyacinth macaws. It's also an important stop on the routes of around 180 species of migratory birds.\n",
      "\tAccording to the World Wide Fund for Nature (known as the World Wildlife Fund in the U.S. and Canada), the Pantanal boasts the greatest concentration of wildlife in South America -- higher than that of its more famous northern neighbor, the Amazon.\n",
      "\tBut this year's dry season has been the most severe since the 1970s. \"There has been a climate emergency situation, with a great drought, never seen before,\" Siqueira said.\n",
      "\tOccasional wildfires are normal in the Pantanal, so much so that some plants in the region developed resistance to fires -- for example by growing thick bark or covering their seeds with hard shells. But the unusually dry conditions this year have seen the blazes spread further and faster because there were fewer natural water barriers. Even areas that normally stay wet have turned into tinderboxes.\n",
      "\tThe fires ripping through the Pantanal are an example of a natural disaster that is exacerbated by climate change while simultaneously making the problem worse.\n",
      "\tExtreme weather events, such as drought and floods, are becoming more frequent and more severe around the world, and the Pantanal is no exception. There are indications that the region is getting drier and warmer as the global temperatures rise.\n",
      "\tThis year's record dry season can be traced back to 2019, when the Upper Paraguay Basin experienced unusually low rainfall.\n",
      "\tBiologist Debora Calheiros, who has been researching ecosystems in the Pantanal for decades, said official data showed precipitation had been below the long-term average over the past decade, but in the past two years had dropped further to just 70% of the average.\n",
      "\tThe region's rain patterns are also changing. While the amount of overall precipitation might not be dramatically different, the rains are becoming more extreme and concentrated over shorter periods of time.\n",
      "\tClimate change is just one part of the problem. Large-scale deforestation in the Amazon rainforest to the north and the Cerrado savanna to the east are also having profound effects on the Pantanal.\n",
      "\tEcology and conservation expert Leticia Larcher said deforestation was shortening rainy seasons and making droughts more severe in central and southeastern Brazil. She explained that it was impacting the \"flying rivers\" phenomenon, a crucial process in which a stream of moisture arising from the forest travels to other areas such as the Pantanal, where the water-filled air becomes colder and turns into rain.\n",
      "\t\"As the forest decreases and loses its ecological functions, the environmental service it provides is also being lost,\" Larcher said.\n",
      "\tWhile fires ignited by lightning sometimes occur naturally in the Pantanal, Larcher, who works for environmental NGO Instituto Homem Pantaneiro, said this year's fires have mostly been caused by people. This is despite the Brazilian government's ban on fires for 120 days in the Amazon and the Pantanal that was issued in July.\n",
      "\tBut Siqueira said the ban wasn't being enforced strictly enough. \"There are extensive areas (where) livestock farmers have regularly used fire as a way to clear farm fields,\" said Siqueira. \"This year, even with the governmental ban ... these producers set fire that ended up spreading for thousands of acres due to the great drought.\"\n",
      "\tAs the global demand for agricultural products rises, so commercial farmers clear more of the Pantanal's native vegetation for growing and grazing. Brazil is already the world's leading exporter of beef. As the demand for meat rises around the world, so does deforestation in the Amazon.\n",
      "\tSugarcane, cotton and soybeans are other lucrative options. When U.S. President Donald Trump imposed punitive tariffs on Chinese exports in 2018, Beijing retaliated by placing a new 25% tariff on American soybeans, forcing Chinese buyers to look for alternative sources of the protein-rich commodity.\n",
      "\tBrazil was ready to step in. The U.S. Department of Agriculture expects the South American country to have record soybean production this year, and the land area used keeps growing. A soy moratorium, in place since 2006, banned deforestation for the crop in the Amazon -- but those protections don't apply in the Pantanal and Cerrado.\n",
      "\tSiqueira and many others, including global environmental advocacy groups such as Greenpeace, Wetlands International and the WWF, blame the policies of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro and his Environment Minister Ricardo Salles for the devastation.\n",
      "\t\"It's a direct result of the dismantling of the Brazilian environmental agenda and its institutions under the current government,\" Siqueira said, pointing to deregulation and funding cuts for monitoring agencies.\n",
      "\t\"[There are] less actions to prevent fires, dismantling of responsible federal institutions, and omission at federal and state levels,\" said biologist Debora Calheiros, who has been researching ecosystems in the Pantanal for decades. \"Actually, it was the civil society that readily responded to rescue, save, feed and offer water to the surviving animals and help traditional riverine and indigenous people with food and mineral water,\" she added.\n",
      "\tAddressing the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) in September, Bolsonaro refused to accept any blame for the fires, claiming instead that they were an \"inevitable consequence of high local temperature, coupled with the accumulation of decaying organic matter.\"\n",
      "\tBolsonaro, who has repeatedly rejected criticism of his government's stance on the environment and has accused foreign actors of a \"brutal disinformation campaign\" on the issue, told the UNGA that no other country protected as much wild territory as Brazil.\n",
      "\tSpeaking to CNN's affiliate CNN Brasil last month, Salles, the environmental minister, doubled down on Bolsonaro's message. He blamed the fires on the drought and said farmers had no interest in burning the land, because they rely on it economically.\n",
      "\tThe government eventually recognized the Pantanal fires as a federal emergency and sent funding into the area, but for many, this was too little, too late.\n",
      "\tThe government's policies, Siqueira says, send a \"clear message of impunity of environmental crimes.\"\n",
      "\tParts of the Pantanal have been designated a biosphere conservation area and recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage site, but overall, less than 5% of the region is under formal protection, according to the WWF. More than 90% is privately owned by ranchers, farmers and conservation groups, with 80% of that private land used for cattle farming, according to Brazil's environment ministry.\n",
      "\tThe fires burned millions of acres of flowering plants, starving pollinators and leaving no food for other animals.\n",
      "\tThe blazes are hurting local people too. The Pantanal is home to a number of indigenous and traditional communities, which have settled on the banks of the rivers and make their living from fishing and small-scale agriculture. \"Riverside communities, which traditionally survive on artisanal fishing, build their culture there strictly linked to the biome,\" Larcher said.\n",
      "\tFires are still raging in parts of the Pantanal, but recovery efforts are already underway.\n",
      "\tThe biome has gone through periods of harsh drought in the past. However, Calheiros said the ecosystems are much more fragile than they were just a few decades ago and their capacity to recover is uncertain. The environmental damage inflicted on the Pantanal is also much greater, she added.\n",
      "\tSiqueira said it could take decades to restore what the blazes took. \"This will only be possible if we have a normal rainfall from 2020 to 2021,\" he said. If there is more drought, he added, the recovery of the plants and animals living in the Pantanal will be much more difficult.\n",

      "CONTENT : LONDON -- \n",
      "\tBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson's top adviser was seen Friday leaving Downing Street carrying a moving box, amid reports that he has left his job following a bruising battle for influence at the heart of the government fueled by tensions over Brexit and the coronavirus pandemic.\n",
      "\tDominic Cummings was pictured exiting the prime minister's 10 Downing Street office through the front door. British media reported he had left for good rather than staying on as Johnson's adviser until the end of the year, when he was expected to give up his post.\n",
      "\tThe prime minister's office hasn't confirmed Cummings' departure.\n",
      "\tCummings, a chief architect of the campaign to have Britain leave the European Union, has been a divisive figure inside the Conservative government since Johnson became prime minister 16 months ago. His position weakened earlier this year after he drove hundreds of miles across England after contracting COVID-19, violating national lockdown rules and leaving the impression that elite officials didn't have to obey the same onerous rules as everyone else.\n",
      "\tThe episode fueled criticism of the government's handling of the pandemic after delays in the expansion of testing and efforts to avoid a second national lockdown in England. That lockdown was finally imposed last week, but it couldn't stop the U.K. from becoming the first country in Europe to pass 50,000 deaths during the pandemic.\n",
      "\tNicknamed \"Boris' brain,\" Cummings has also been the target of complaints from senior members of Johnson's Conservative Party, who say that unelected advisers in the prime minister's Downing Street office were effectively running the government, sidelining ministers and Parliament.\n",
      "\tBernard Jenkin, chairman of an influential committee of Conservative lawmakers, said Cummings' resignation is an opportunity for Johnson to \"reset how the government operates.\"\n",
      "\t\"I would suggest there are three words that need to become the watchwords in Downing Street -- they are respect, integrity and trust,\" Jenkin told the BBC. \"And certainly in the relationship between the Downing Street machine and the parliamentary party, there's been a very strong sense that that has been lacking in recent months.\"\n",
      "\tDespite winning an 80-seat majority in last December's general election, Johnson's government has been forced into a series of embarrassing policy reversals in recent months, stoking criticism that Cummings was giving the prime minister bad advice.\n",
      "\tIn addition to his stance on lockdown, Johnson has backtracked on decisions to let the Chinese technology giant Huawei participate in building Britain's new mobile phone network; one to use an algorithm to assign grades to students after annual tests were cancelled due to the pandemic; and a third not to extend free meals to poor children when schools were closed as Britain faced rising unemployment due to the pandemic.\n",
      "\tIn a January blog post, Cummings called for changes in the way government works, claiming that the civil service didn't have enough expertise in some fields. He infamously said \"weirdos and misfits with odd skills\" could help the government develop better policies.\n",
      "\tIn that post, Cummings said he wanted to make himself \"largely redundant\" within the next year.\n",
      "\tIn his Thursday interview with the BBC, Cummings said rumours that he had threatened to resign this week were untrue, but that \"his position hasn't changed since my January blog.\"\n",
      "\tTransport Secretary Grant Shapps downplayed Cummings' departure, saying he has achieved many of the things he set out to do.\n",
      "\tCummings' signature policy goal was Brexit -- ensuring Britain's departure from the EU -- and that process is scheduled to be completed at the end of this year. More recently, he has taken the lead in rolling out mass testing to help control Britain's COVID-19 outbreak, and that program is now being rolled out.\n",
      "\t\"It's always been good to have somebody in the room who sort of shakes things up, asks why, doesn't take no for an answer,\" Shapps said. \"And that's been very much the way Dominic Cummings has been able to bring his talents to No. 10, but he's ready to move on.\"\n",
      "\tBut Cummings has been criticized for creating an adversarial relationship between the prime minister's office and those he thought stood in his way, including civil servants, the BBC and backbench lawmakers.\n",
      "\tJenkin said there has also been a breakdown in Johnson's government, with Johnson appointing inexperienced Cabinet ministers then dictating policies to them, rather than having ministers take responsibility for their departments.\n",
      "\tCummings' departure is an opportunity to reshuffle the government and bring in more experienced ministers, Jenkin said.\n",
      "\t\"If you don't have the corporate memory, well then history repeats itself and people make the same mistakes, or certainly mistakes that can be avoided,\" Jenkin said.\n",

      "\tChina on Friday became one of the last major countries to congratulate U.S. President-elect Joe Biden, who is expected to make few changes to U.S. policy in conflicts with Beijing over trade, technology and security.\n",
      "\tChina, along with Russia, avoided joining the throng that congratulated Biden last weekend after he and vice-presidential running mate Kamala Harris secured enough Electoral College votes to unseat U.S. President Donald Trump.\n",
      "\t\"We respect the choice of the American people,\" said a foreign ministry spokesman, Wang Wenbin. \"We congratulate Mr. Biden and Ms. Harris.\"\n",
      "\tWang gave no reason for the delay but said, \"the result will be confirmed according to U.S. laws and procedures.\"\n",
      "\tU.S.-Chinese relations have plunged to their lowest level in decades amid a tariff war over Beijing's technology ambitions and trade surplus, accusations of spying and tension over human rights, the coronavirus pandemic, Hong Kong and control of the South China Sea.\n",
      "\tTrump labeled China a security threat and imposed export curbs and other sanctions on Chinese companies. On Thursday, he stepped up those sanctions by issuing an order that bars Americans from investing in securities issued by companies U.S. officials say are owned or controlled by the Chinese military.\n",
      "\tForecasters had said even if lost his re-election bid, Trump was likely to try to increase pressure on Beijing before he leaves office on Jan. 20.\n",
      "\tPolitical analysts expect Biden to try to resume co-operation with Beijing on climate change, North Korea, Iran and the coronavirus. And they say Biden might pursue a more traditional, predictable policy toward China.\n",
      "\tHowever, economists and political analysts expect few big changes due to widespread frustration with Beijing's trade and human rights record and accusations of spying and technology theft.\n",
      "\t\"A tough stance on China has broad support across the U.S. political spectrum,\" Louis Kuijs of Oxford Economics said in a report this week. \"Biden's own pronouncements and policy program suggest he will continue to try to maintain the U.S. technological lead and to attract manufacturing activity.\"\n",
      "\tSome forecasters suggest the change from Trump, who rejected multilateral alliances, to Biden might increase pressure on China if Washington forms a coalition with other developed countries to push for policy changes.\n",
      "\tChina has tried to recruit Germany, France, South Korea and other governments as allies against Washington but all have refused. They criticized Trump's trade tactics of surprise tariff hikes, which also were used against allies, but echo U.S. complaints that China is violating its free-trade commitments.\n",
      "\tSome Chinese trade experts have suggested Beijing might try to renegotiate the \"Phase 1\" agreement signed in January as a first step toward ending the trade war. It calls for China to increase purchases of U.S. goods in exchange for postponing further tariff hikes. But that came before the coronavirus derailed global trade, leaving China behind on meeting its commitments.\n",
      "\tRenegotiation might fit a \"more strategic, longer-term orientation\" expected from a Biden administration, but he \"cannot be seen to be `soft' on China\" after the \"hard rhetoric\" of the campaign, Kuijs said.\n",
      "\tChinese leaders were quieter during this year's election than in the 2016 presidential race, when they favoured Trump over former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. They disliked her for carrying out then-President Barack Obama's foreign policy, which included pressuring Beijing on human rights. Trump's public image of business success resonated with the Chinese public.\n",
      "\tTrump shook up China's leaders by hiking tariffs on Chinese products in 2018 over complaints Beijing steals or pressures companies to hand over technology.\n",
      "\tThe White House has lobbied allies to exclude telecom equipment giant Huawei Technologies Ltd., China's first global tech brand, from next-generation telecom networks on security grounds. Huawei's access to American components and technology was cut off over the past year, threatening to cripple its global sales.\n",
      "\tTrump is trying to bar Chinese social media companies from the United States, citing fears they might gather too much personal information about Americans. The White House is pressing video service TikTok to sell its U.S. operation and is trying to block companies from dealing with WeChat, the popular Chinese message service.\n",

      "\tU.S. President Donald Trump has stepped up a conflict with China over security and technology by barring Americans from investing in companies that U.S. officials say are owned or controlled by the Chinese military.\n",
      "\tThe Chinese government accused Washington of misusing national security as an excuse to hamper competition and warned Friday that Trump's order would hurt U.S. and other investors worldwide.\n",
      "\tThe impact of Thursday's order wasn't immediately clear but it could add to pressure on companies including telecom equipment giant Huawei and video surveillance provider Hikvision that already face U.S. import bans and other sanctions.\n",
      "\tIt is Trump's first major action toward China since he lost his reelection bid to challenger Joe Biden. Economists and political analysts had said that even if Trump was defeated he was likely to launch more actions against Beijing before leaving office on Jan. 20.\n",
      "\tPolitical analysts expect little change in policy under Biden due to widespread frustration with China's trade and human rights records and accusations of spying and technology theft.\n",
      "\tChina's foreign ministry on Friday accused Washington of \"wantonly suppressing Chinese companies under the pretext of national security\" and violating market principles.\n",
      "\t\"The U.S. government maliciously slandered China's military-civilian integration development policy out of political motives and abused national power to unreasonably suppress Chinese companies,\" said a foreign ministry spokesman, Wang Wenbin.\n",
      "\t\"This move will not only seriously damage the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese companies, but will also damage the interests of investors from all countries, including the United States,\" Wang said.\n",
      "\tHe said Beijing will \"firmly safeguard\" the rights of Chinese companies, a statement Beijing often makes following unwelcome U.S. policy changes but that often results in no action.\n",
      "\tU.S. officials complain China's ruling Communist Party takes advantage of access to American technology and investment to expand its military, already one of the world's biggest and most heavily armed.\n",
      "\tThursday's order said the companies targeted \"directly support\" the Chinese military, intelligence and security apparatus. It said Beijing \"exploits United States investors\" to finance military development by selling securities in American and foreign financial markets.\n",
      "\tThe order bars American investors from conducting any transactions in publicly traded securities issued by any Chinese companies designated by the secretary of defence as being linked to the Communist Party's military wing, the People's Liberation Army.\n",
      "\tThe Pentagon earlier designated 31 companies as being owned or controlled by the Chinese military. Many are military contractors or state-owned companies such as phone carrier China Telecom Ltd. But the list also includes Huawei Technologies Ltd. and Hikvision Digital Technology Co., which say they are private and deny they are controlled by the military.\n",
      "\tHikvision criticized its inclusion in Thursday's order as unjustified. The company said it is independent of the PLA and never has participated in research and development for \"military applications.\"\n",
      "\t\"As we have shown time and again, Hikvision is not a `Chinese military company,\"' a Hikvision statement said. \"These punitive actions against the company do not make America, or the world, any safer.\"\n",
      "\tMost of those companies have no shares traded in the United States but many sell stocks, bonds and other securities in markets outside mainland China that are accessible to American investors.\n",
      "\tSales made to divest securities of those companies will be allowed until one year from now on Nov. 11, 2021.\n",

      "\tBrazilian trials of the CoronaVac vaccine will resume, after testing was temporarily stopped due to a \"serious adverse event\" in one of the volunteers.\n",
      "\tAccording to a police report, a volunteer in the study died by suicide, CNN confirmed Tuesday, resulting in an investigation into the cause of death and a pending toxicology report.\n",
      "\tBrazil's National Health Surveillance Agency (Anvisa) said on Wednesday that clinical trials of CoronaVac, developed by Chinese drug maker Sinovac, would be allowed to restart.\n",
      "\tPhase 3 of the trials have been suspended since Monday, following what Anvisa described as a \"serious adverse event\" on October 29. A note from Anvisa said the trial had been paused in order to better evaluate the data and assess the risk.\n",
      "\t\"After evaluating the new data presented by the sponsor after the study was suspended, Anvisa concludes that there are sufficient benefits to allow the vaccination to resume and continues to monitor the investigation of the outcome of the case to define the possible causal relationship between the unexpected adverse event and the vaccine,\" Anvisa said in a statement on Wednesday.\n",
      "\t\"It is important to clarify that a suspension does not necessarily mean that the product under investigation is not of quality, safety or efficacy,\" it said.\n",
      "\tDimas Covas, the director of Brazil's Butantan biomedical institute, said the incident was not linked to the vaccine trial itself. \"The serious adverse event observed in a volunteer in the trial has no relation to the vaccine,\" Covas told reporters Tuesday at a news conference in Sao Paulo. \"It was analyzed and determined that there was no relation.\"\n",
      "\tIn a statement posted online Tuesday, Sinovac said it was \"confident in the safety of the vaccine.\"\n",
      "\t\"We have communicated with our Brazilian partner, the Butantan Institute, and the head of the institute believes the incident has nothing to do with the vaccine. Sinovac will continue to communicate with the Brazilian side on this matter. Work related to our clinical research in Brazil will continue to be carried out in strict accordance with GCP (Good Clinical Practice) requirements,\" the statement said.\n",
      "\tSinovac began Phase 3 clinical trials of its CoronaVac vaccine in collaboration with the Butantan Institute and the state of Sao Paulo in late July, with an aim to recruit 130,000 volunteers.\n",
      "\tPhase 3 trials represent the final and most important testing stage before regulatory approval is sought.\n",
      "\tSinovac is also conducting Phase 3 trials in Indonesia and Turkey. Sinovac did not immediately responded to CNN's request for further comment.\n",
      "\tPausing a clinical trial is not unusual. In September, drug giant AstraZeneca paused global trials of its coronavirus vaccine because of an unexplained illness in one of the volunteers.\n",

      "\tIn light of China’s ongoing crackdown on democracy, the federal government is offering new immigration programs aimed at attracting young people from Hong Kong to Canada, and is promising to expedite paperwork for Canadians living there to come home.\n",
      "\tMinister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Marco Mendicino made the announcement on Thursday, saying that he remains “deeply concerned” about the imposition of a sweeping national security law that’s prompted large pro-democracy demonstrations in Hong Kong.\n",
      "\tIn an effort to attract students and youth, Canada will be offering a new expedited three-year open work permit to recent Hong Kong graduates and those with essential work experience who want to come to Canada to continue their studies or find employment. Eligible applicants are those who have graduated from a recognized post-secondary institution in the last five years, and their spouses and children will also be eligible to seek permanent Canadian residency.\n",
      "\tThere will also be two new streams to permanent residency for “the best and the brightest” Hong Kong residents already in Canada who have graduated with a degree in the last three years, and for those with recent degrees and a year of full-time work experience in Canada who want to come back here, once the existing COVID-19 travel restrictions are lifted.\n",
      "\tMendicino said the first applicants could be eligible to come to Canada in “early 2021.”\n",
      "\tThese new measures come on the heels of China removing four democratically elected lawmakers from office in Hong Kong, which Canada’s Foreign Affairs Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne has called “a further assault on Hong Kong’s high degree of freedoms.”\n",
      "\tIn a statement Champagne called it a “concerning disregard” for Hong Kong’s autonomy and said Canada stands with the people of Hong Kong.\n",
      "\t“We are deeply disappointed that China has chosen to break its international obligations,” the foreign affairs minister said.\n",
      "\tIn response to the legislation, Canada has frozen its extradition treaty and revised its Hong Kong travel advice, but has yet to move to offer a more widespread asylum stream or expedite asylum claim approvals to Hong Kong residents looking to leave.\n",
      "\tMendicino said that pro-democracy protesters are able to claim asylum or apply to other Canadian immigration programs so long as they have not committed any crime that would be recognized by Canadian law.\n",
      "\t“We remain very concerned with the situation in Hong Kong and as I said, that is very much the backdrop to this announcement today, but at the same time what we are highlighting is that in these new immigration routes, we see a silver lining. A silver lining for young Hong Kongers who may wish to come work in Canada, study in Canada, bring their families in Canada and build a better life in Canada,” Mendicino said.\n",
      "\tHowever, Alliance Canada Hong Kong's Cherie Wong told CTV News that when protesters are arrested in Hong Kong, their travel documents are often confiscated so additional resources may be needed to help eligible applicants leave.\n",
      "\t“I fear for the safety of a lot of folks, my frontline activist friends, my fellow Canadians in Hong Kong and in China,” she said. “I think today is a great example that Canada has taken a strong step in protesting what China has been doing to Hong Kong, but it is only one first small step and we have more to do.”\n",
      "\tFrom the perspective of Vivian Tam, a Canadian professor living in Hong Kong, every day the situation gets “a little bit worse.”\n",
      "\tShe said that she has peers who are looking to get out of Hong Kong and are assessing the offerings from the U.K. and Canada, and right now the U.K. is processing applications faster.\n",
      "\tConservative immigration critic Raquel Dancho echoed this, saying in a statement that Canada should “put in place a clear, expedited path for pro-democracy protestors and political refugees fleeing Hong Kong.”\n",
      "\t“Canada needs to do more than offer Hong Kong’s pro-democracy activists an economic immigration system crippled by years-long backlogs and beset by ongoing delays because of the COVID-19 pandemic,” Dancho said.\n",
      "\tBut immigration lawyer Chantal Desloges is questioning the rationale behind the federal government’s decision to target these programs at younger, highly-educated foreign nationals.\n",
      "\t“There are all around the world various situations where people are under threat of political persecution or other very serious situations, and why do we have a special program for Hong Kong that exists only for these people as opposed to a broader program that might help people from other countries?” she said.\n",
      "\t“What is so special about the situation in Hong Kong that is compelling the government to take this exceptional measure?” asked Desloges.\n",
      "\tThese measures come in addition to a promise of expediting document application such as family sponsorship for Canadians currently living in Hong Kong who want to come home.\n",
      "\tThe minister emphasized in his announcement that Canadians and Canadian permanent residents in Hong Kong can return to Canada at any time, and family members in Hong Kong of Canadians and Canadian permanent residents can also travel to Canada under the current compassionate exemptions to travel restrictions, though they must quarantine for 14 days upon arrival.\n",
      "\tOttawa’s top diplomat in Hong Kong told MPs on the Special Committee on Canada-China Relations on Nov. 2 that the federal government had made preparations to evacuate some 300,000 Canadian citizens out of Hong Kong should the situation worsen.\n",
      "\t“We have detailed plans in place, and we have resources available and identified to cover a range of situations up to and including a situation where the urgent departure of a large number of Canadians would be necessary,” Jeff Nankivell, Canada’s consul general in Hong Kong and Macau said.\n",
      "\tIn a separate press conference where Canadian politicians focused in on the situation in China, MPs on the House of Commons Subcommittee on International Human Rights, discussed a report they recently put out on the situation of the Uyghurs in China, saying they felt it was important for Canadians to be aware of what has been occurring.\n",
      "\tIn its findings released on Oct. 21, the committee unanimously agreed the actions of the Chinese government constitutes a genocide of the Muslim minority in Xinjiang through mass detentions, forced labour, state surveillance, and imposed population control.\n",
      "\t“This is a non-partisan issue, this is a humanitarian issue, this is an issue of genocide, of crimes against humanity,” said Liberal MP Sameer Zuberi.\n",
      "\tThe MPs warned in the report that “if the international community does not condemn the human rights abuses in Xinjiang province by the Government of China, a precedent will be set, and these methods will be adopted by other regimes.”\n",
      "\tLast month during a press conference reflecting on the 50th anniversary of the establishment of now-strained diplomatic relations between China and Canada, China’s Ambassador to Canada Cong Peiwu cautioned the federal government about interfering in internal Chinese affairs.\n",

      "\tAfter sharp criticism for not taking a stronger role in curbing the pandemic, the UN health agency holds its annual meeting this week under intense pressure to reform. WHO is also hoping that U.S. President-elect Joe Biden will reverse a decision by Washington to leave the organization made by the Trump administration in June.\n",

WHO scientists labeled some of their approaches as \"macabre\" and \"an unfortunate laboratory to study the virus,\" according to dozens of leaked recordings of internal WHO meetings and documents from January to April obtained by The Associated Press.\n",

      "\tOthers said it would be politically unwise for WHO to be too outspoken unless countries give the agency more power.\n",
      "\t\"If Tedros was to take a very aggressive stance toward member countries, there would be repercussions,\" said Suerie Moon, co-director of the Global Health Centre at the Graduate Institute of Geneva, referring to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.\n",
      "\tWHO spokeswoman Farah Dakhlallah said that since the beginning of the coronavirus outbreak, \"WHO officials have had and continue to have, frank and open discussions with government counterparts ΓÇª We are proud of an organizational culture that fosters candid discussions.\"\n",
      "\tIt's not unprecedented for WHO to publicly question its member states. It threatened to close its China office when the country was hiding cases during the SARS outbreak and loudly called for Nigeria to reverse its boycott of the polio vaccine in 2003.\n",
      "\tWHO's reticence to call out countries started with China, as the AP earlier reported. Despite a January meeting between Tedros and Chinese President Xi Jinping, information from Beijing was still sparse throughout February. Maria Van Kerkhove, WHO's technical lead for COVID-19, noted that the agency lacked \"enough detail to say what has worked and what hasn't.\"\n",
      "\tWHO scientists soon grew concerned about Japan. On Feb. 1, a passenger who disembarked the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Hong Kong tested positive for the coronavirus. At the ship's next stop in Yokohama, authorities put all 3,711 people aboard under lockdown.\n",
      "\tWHO emergencies chief Michael Ryan told reporters at the time: \"Let's be careful here not to overreact.\" But on Feb. 10, the case count nearly doubled overnight.\n",
      "\t\"(That's) not surprising given the nature of the response of the investigation,\" Ryan said at an internal meeting, noting Japan had only assigned a small number of epidemiologists to investigate.\n",
      "\tDr. Thomas Grein, WHO's chief of acute events management team, said they had failed to glean much information from their Japanese counterparts, calling it a \"very, very sensitive issue.\"\n",
      "\tAlthough WHO was keenly aware the situation was deteriorating, scientists said the outbreak could help in understanding COVID-19 transmission.\n",
      "\t\"(It's) unfortunate, but a useful opportunity to study the natural history of the virus,\" Ryan said.\n",
      "\tIn late February, the virus also gained a foothold in Italy, turning Europe into the epicenter of the pandemic.\n",
      "\tAt WHO, Grein told his colleagues that WHO's efforts to get more detail about the spiraling outbreaks in Italy and elsewhere had \"spectacularly failed\" as officials worried about the lack of action taken across Europe.\n",
      "\tYet on March 8, Tedros tweeted that \"the government & the people of Italy are taking bold, courageous steps aimed at slowing the spread of the .coronavirus.\"\n",
      "\tLawrence Gostin, director of the WHO Collaborating Center on Public Health Law and Human Rights at Georgetown University, said WHO should be obligated to report when countries are not sharing data, saying it was dangerous for the agency to be \"flying blind.\"\n",
      "\tWHO also complained in private about Western countries hoarding scarce pandemic supplies.\n",
      "\t\"We had the terrible situation yesterday with (protective personal equipment) where all the supplies were requisitioned in France and we lost access,\" Ryan told his colleagues.\n",
      "\tAs countries across Europe adopted social distancing measures and cancelled mass gatherings in early March, Ryan noticed one country did not: Britain.\n",
      "\t\"There isn't a single sports event in Europe and yet all of the Premier League matches in the U.K. are to go ahead,\" he said. Ryan described Britain's pandemic strategy as \"problematic\" after hearing the U.K.'s chief scientific officer say the country was aiming for herd immunity.\n",
      "\t\"For that to happen, hundreds of thousands and millions of older people are going to become infected and there is just going to be so much death,\" Ryan said. Still, he said the different approaches to tackling COVID-19 globally could prove to be \"a massive ecological study\" that would allow WHO to document what worked.\n",
      "\t\"It's macabre in some ways, but it's reality,\" he said.\n",
      "\tGoing forward, WHO's role trying to stop the pandemic will depend in part on the independent panel review. Harman, the expert from Queen Mary University, sympathized that WHO had enormous responsibility in the early months of COVID-19, but said even greater challenges loom now.\n",
      "\t\"With the next wave of the pandemic, I think the time for quiet diplomacy has passed,\" she said.\n",

      "CONTENT : NEW YORK -- \n",
      "\tU.S. stocks pulled back on Thursday, amid increasing worries about worsening coronavirus counts across the country.\n",
      "\tMarkets around the world have taken a pause after galloping higher this month, at first on expectations that Washington will continue several pro-business policies following last week's U.S. elections. More recently, encouraging early results for a potential COVID-19 vaccine have investors envisioning a global economy returning to normal.\n",
      "\tThe S&P 500 index lost 35.65 points, or 1%, to 3,537.01. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 317.46 points, or 1.1%, to 29,080.17 and the Nasdaq composite lost 76.84 points, or 0.7%, to 11,709.59.\n",
      "\tAnalysts are still largely optimistic the market can climb even higher, largely because they see a potential vaccine as a game changer. Despite the declines, the S&P 500 and Dow are both close to their record highs. But several risks remain that could trip up markets in the near term. Rising above them all is the continuing pandemic, with daily counts climbing in nearly every state.\n",
      "\tThe trends are worsening enough in New York, for example, that the state is ordering restaurants, bars and gyms to close at 10 p.m. each night, beginning Friday. New York had been a hotbed for the virus early in the year but had seemed to have gotten it largely under control. In Europe, several governments have brought back even tougher restrictions that will likely restrain the economy.\n",
      "\t“From a health standpoint and economic standpoint, the very near term looks relatively bleak,” said Mike Dowdall, investment strategist with BMO Global Asset Management.\n",
      "\tBut while he says more volatility may hit the market in the near term as governments bring back restrictions, he's still optimistic about its prospects into next year.\n",
      "\t“If you think back to the dark days of March, you didn't know how far we were from normalization,” he said. “People were saying it may be years. But the backdrop from a markets standpoint is just a lot different than it was in March.”\n",
      "\tBeyond the vaccines in development, which could get everyday life closer to normal, he cited the Federal Reserve, which has already shown it can roll out bond-buying programs swiftly to support markets.\n",
      "\tThursday's slip for the S&P 500 pares its gain for November down to 8.2%. If it holds there, it would still be the best month for the benchmark index since April, when the market was first exploding out of the crater created by the market's sell-off amid pandemic panic.\n",
      "\tDeclines in Big Tech stocks, which have held out well throughout much of the pandemic, helped pull the market lower. Microsoft and Facebook each slipped 0.5%.\n",
      "\tSeveral of the stocks that would benefit most from an economy returning to normal, meanwhile, were lagging.\n",
      "\tFinancial stocks in the S&P 500, whose profits are more closely tied to the strength of the economy than Big Tech, fell 1.7% for one of the largest losses among the 11 sectors that make up the index. Only energy, raw materials and utility companies fell more.\n",
      "\tWhile the market is showing signs of worry over the uptick in virus cases, the longer view for an economic recovery is still solid, said Brent Schutte, chief investment strategist of Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management. That scenario is bolstered by the advances in vaccine development.\n",
      "\t“At some point the vaccine means the virus ends and we get back to something normal,” he said. “I feel fairly confident going into next year.”\n",
      "\tA report on Thursday showed that the number of layoffs across the country remains incredibly high, though it again eased by a bit. Last week, 709,000 workers filed for unemployment benefits, down from 757,000 a week earlier. It was also a better reading than economists were expecting.\n",
      "\tBut economists caution that the numbers could climb again if coronavirus counts keep rising across the country and trigger more business closures.\n",
      "\tA separate report showed that inflation at the consumer level was weaker last month than economists expected.\n",
      "\tIn European stock markets, the French CAC 40 fell 1.5%, and Germany's DAX lost 1.2%. The FTSE 100 in London dropped 0.7% after data showed the economy slowed in September following strong growth in the summer. That bodes ill for the autumn, when new restrictions on businesses were imposed.\n",
      "\tIn Asia, Japan's Nikkei 225 rose 0.7% but other indexes were weaker. South Korea's Kospi lost 0.4%, Hong Kong's Hang Seng dipped 0.2% and stocks in Shanghai slipped 0.1%.\n",
      "\tChinese technology shares have taken a beating this week, losing about $290 billion in market capitalization after the government issued new proposed anti-trust regulations for digital industries, said Jeffrey Halley of Oanda.\n",

      "\tPro-democracy legislators in Hong Kong began resigning Thursday to protest the expulsion of four other lawmakers, heightening a conflict with Beijing over the semi-autonomous Chinese territory's future.\n",
      "\tPro-democracy activists say China's ruling Communist Party, which has tightened control in Hong Kong in response to demands for more democracy, is destroying the civil liberties and rights that were promised the territory when Britain returned it to China in 1997.\n",
      "\tThe 15 remaining lawmakers in the pro-democracy bloc said Wednesday they will resign en masse after China's central government passed a resolution this week that led to the four lawmakers' disqualification.\n",
      "\tThe four had urged foreign governments to sanction China and Hong Kong over Beijing's crackdown on dissent in the territory. The Communist Party accused them of violating their oaths of office.\n",
      "\tMost of the 15 lawmakers did not attend a regular session of the legislature on Thursday, and some later handed in resignation letters at the Legislative Council's secretariat.\n",
      "\tChina sharply criticized the move. Its Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office called the mass resignation “an open challenge” to the authority of the central government and the Basic Law, Hong Kong's constitution.\n",
      "\t“If these lawmakers hope to use their resignation to provoke opposition and beg for foreign interference, they have miscalculated,” it said in a statement.\n",
      "\tWu Chi-wai, the head of the pro-democracy bloc, said the Chinese and Hong Kong governments were trying to take away the separation of powers in the city, since the ousting of the four lawmakers bypassed the courts.\n",
      "\t“We lost our check-and-balance power, and all the constitutional power in Hong Kong rests in the chief executive's hands,” Wu said.\n",
      "\tHe said it was the end of the city's “one country, two systems” framework under which Hong Kong enjoyed autonomy and freedoms not found on the mainland since it was returned to China in 1997.\n",
      "\tClaudia Mo, a pro-democracy lawmaker who also handed in her resignation, said: “We are quitting the legislature only at this juncture. We're not quitting Hong Kong's democracy fight.”\n",
      "\tEarlier in the day, one of the pro-democracy lawmakers, Lam Cheuk-ting, unfurled a banner from a balcony inside the Legislative Council building saying city leader Carrie Lam had brought disaster to Hong Kong and its people, and that her infamy would last ten thousand years.\n",
      "\tThe mass departure will leave Hong Kong's legislature with just 43 legislators, 41 of whom belong to the pro-Beijing bloc. This means that the legislature could pass bills favoured by Beijing with little opposition.\n",
      "\tThe lawmakers announced their decision to resign hours after the Hong Kong government said it was disqualifying the four legislators - Alvin Yeung, Dennis Kwok, Kwok Ka-ki and Kenneth Leung.\n",
      "\tA resolution passed this week by the Standing Committee of China's National People's Congress said that any lawmaker who supports Hong Kong's independence, refuses to acknowledge China's sovereignty over the city, threatens national security, or asks external forces to interfere in the city's affairs should be disqualified.\n",
      "\tChinese foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin on Thursday reiterated Beijing's support for Hong Kong's government in “fulfilling its duty according to the NPC Standing Committee's decision.”\n",
      "\t“No country will turn a blind eye to acts of betrayal of the country by public officials, including members of the Legislative Council, who break their oaths of office,” Wang said at a daily news briefing.\n",
      "\tBritain, the United States, Australia and the EU denounced China's move.\n",
      "\tThe U.K. summoned China's ambassador in London to register “deep concern at this latest action by his government,” Foreign Office minister Nigel Adams told lawmakers Thursday.\n",
      "\tAdams said it was “another sad day for the people of Hong Kong” and that the British government has declared it the third breach of the Sino-British Joint Declaration on the territory's handover since it came into force in 1997 and the second time in the last six months.\n",
      "\tHe said China's actions are “designed to harass and stifle all voices critical of China's policies.”\n",
      "\tHong Kong's people, he added, are left now with a “neutered legislature.”\n",
      "\tPresident Donald Trump's national security adviser, Robert O'Brien, said the Chinese Communist Party has violated its international commitment to the people of Hong Kong.\n",
      "\t“'One country, two systems' is now merely a fig leaf covering for the CCP's expanding one-party dictatorship in Hong Kong,” he said.\n",
      "\tAustralian Foreign Minister Marise Payne said the disqualification of the four lawmakers “seriously undermined” Hong Kong's democratic processes and institutions.\n",
      "\tThe EU's foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, said China's moves “constitute a further severe blow to political pluralism and freedom of opinion in Hong Kong.”\n",
      "\t“We call for the immediate reversal of these decisions by the authorities in Beijing and Hong Kong Government and for the immediate reinstatement of the Legislative Council members,” he said in a statement.\n",
      "\tIn recent months, Beijing has increasingly clamped down on Hong Kong, despite promising when it took control in 1997 to leave the territory's more open legal and economic systems intact for 50 years until 2047.\n",
      "\tBeijing imposed a national security law in June that some have labeled draconian after anti-government protests rocked the city for months last year, and it has used it to crack down on opposition voices.\n",
      "\tIn response, the U.S. levelled sanctions on several officials, including Carrie Lam. Several Western countries have suspended their extradition treaties with the territory, and Australia and Britain have offered Hong Kongers easier paths to settle in those countries.\n",
      "\tEarlier in the year, the four lawmakers were barred from seeking reelection in a vote originally scheduled for September.\n",
      "\tThe government eventually postponed the election by a year, citing the coronavirus. The pro-democracy camp criticized the move as an attempt to block them from winning a majority of seats in the legislature - which was a possibility in the election.\n",

      "\tBy the summer of 1940, Hitler’s armies had blitzkrieged through Europe, threatening the fate of the entire world — and it was against that backdrop that 18-year-old George Chow walked into Victoria’s Bay Street Armoury and volunteered to join the fight.\n",
      "\tIt was a time when Chinese-Canadians could not vote and the federal government’s Chinese Exclusion Act was still on the books.\n",
      "\tStill, Chow signed up and shipped out for basic training in Vancouver.\n",
      "\t“I remember they asked a question, ‘Do you want a lot of action?’” Chow recalled years later in an interview with the Juno Beach Centre. “I said, 'Of course.' All I could say was, ‘Yes, yes sir.’”\n",
      "\tChow died in Vancouver last week on Nov. 6, just one day after his 99th birthday.\n",
      "\tIn 1942, he set sail for England where he was part of the first Canadian anti-aircraft crew to shoot down a German plane on British soil.\n",
      "\n",
      "\tFrom there Chow would land on the beaches of Normandy on D-Day, and carry on fighting through France, Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands, helping to liberate Europe.\n",
      "\tAlong the way, he came under fire, and lost friends in heavy combat.\n",
      "\t“I was talking to three other gunners,” Chow said in the Juno Beach Centre interview. “I heard this whistle and I knew darn well it was a bomb. It’s got to be a bomb. So, I dove in the trench.”\n",
      "\tWhen the smoke cleared, the other three soldiers who had been beside Chow were dead.\n",
      "\t“It was maybe just pure luck,” Chow said. “Somebody’s looking after me, that’s all I can say.”\n",
      "\tFollowing the Allies' victory in Europe, Chow planned to continue fighting for Canada in the Pacific, but when the Americans dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, forcing Japan to surrender, he returned home to British Columbia.\n",
      "\tCanada now has one of the most diverse militaries in the world, but when Chow volunteered in 1940, that wasn’t the case, and today he is remembered as a trailblazer.\n",
      "\t“At a time when he wasn’t even allowed to be a citizen, he still wanted to serve,” Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan told CTV News at Vancouver’s Victory Square on Remembrance Day.\n",
      "\tSajjan knew Chow well, having spent time with him in Europe at ceremonies commemorating Canada’s role in the Second World War.\n",
      "\t“That was a real treat and privilege for me because he fought on those grounds,” said Sajjan. “To be there alongside him and many of his friends and veterans, was a true honour and I was just lucky to know him.”\n",
      "\tAfter the war, Chow re-enlisted in the military, serving as a gunnery instructor until he retired from active duty in 1963 with the rank of Master Warrant Officer.\n",
      "\tHis many medals and awards include the Canadian Forces Decoration, the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee Medal, and France’s Medal of the Legion of Honour. \n",

      "\tK-Pop band Blackpink has sparked outrage in China after videos were circulated showing band members handling a giant panda cub in a South Korean zoo.\n",
      "\tThe band aired footage of members holding Fu Bao -- the first panda to be born in South Korea -- in a clip posted to YouTube this month, Reuters reported. \n",
      "\tAccording to South Korea's Yonhap news agency, Fu Bao was born at the Everland Resort theme park, about 20 miles south of Seoul, to pandas sent to the country in 2016 from China's Sichuan province.\n",
      "\tFor years, China has sent giant pandas abroad as a sign of friendship and cooperation between Beijing and other countries -- part of a campaign known as \"panda diplomacy,\" fostering ties between governments while also offering foreigners a chance to see the rare animals in person.\n",
      "\tBut Blackpink's clip, which showed band members touching the animal and was due to be aired as part of the band's \"24/365 with BLACKPINK\" reality series, generated an angry response. The clip is no longer available to view online.\n",
      "\tChina's Wildlife Conservation Association issued a statement asking Everland Zoo to immediately stop allowing non-professional contact with giant panda cubs, claiming the zoo \"violated the professional requirements for the protection of giant pandas\" in allowing band members contact with the animal.\n",
      "\t\"On November 5, the China Wildlife Conservation Association sent a formal letter to South Korea's Everland Zoo after the zoo violated the professional requirements for the protection of giant pandas as it organized performance-related personnel to have close contact with giant panda cubs and producing entertainment programs,\" the association said in a statement.\n",
      "\t\"Here we ask the zoo to stop playing and disseminating related content videos. [We suggest to the zoo that] it is necessary to further strengthen management, scientific management and protection, and resolutely prevent such incidents from happening again,\" the association said.\n",
      "\tBlackpink said they had decided to postpone the release of the show, scheduled to be uploaded on Nov. 7, but said the visit with the panda was conducted in the presence of professional veterinarians and breeders, and following \"strict anti-virus management and hygiene rules.\"\n",
      "\tThe band, which became a global sensation after forming in 2016, added in a statement released on Twitter: \"In honor of the recommendations of panda experts and international cooperation practices saying that 'the behavior of non-professionals in close contact with baby pandas can cause misunderstanding of others,' we decided to delay the screening of related videos.\"\n",
      "\tStill, users of the Chinese social media platform Weibo expressed anger. In the comment section of a news post detailing Blackpink's statement, thousands demanded an apology from the band.\n",
      "\t\"They didn't explain why they touched the baby panda with heavy makeup! \" one user wrote, while another popular comment read: \"BLACKPINK should apologize.\"\n",
      "\tOthers directed their irritation at the theme park, with one popular comment asking: \"What was Everland doing? They are professionals. Jeez..\"\n",
      "\tGiant pandas are among some of the rarest animals on the planet, though efforts to preserve the species have shown some success in recent years. There are only an estimated 1,800 of the creatures, which are considered \"vulnerable,\" living in the wild, according to the World Wildlife Fund.\n",

      "\tFrom Nov. 1 to Nov. 11, shoppers spent 498.2 billion yuan (US$75.1 billion) on Taobao and Tmall, the e-commerce platforms operated by Alibaba, China's largest e-commerce company.\n",
      "\tThe final sales figure exceeded last year's $38.4 billion over 24 hours, after Alibaba extended its sales period this year for the first time as it sought to help boost sales for merchants affected by the coronavirus pandemic.\n",
      "\tOn rival platform JD.com, consumers racked up 271.5 billion yuan ($40.9 billion) in sales over the same period.\n",
      "\tThe annual Singles' Day shopping festival, the world's largest of its kind, offers shoppers generous discounts on a variety of products, from fresh produce to luxury items.\n",
      "\tMerchants big and small, from small online stores to international brands like Apple, Nike and L'Oreal, participate in the festival by slashing prices on their products.\n",
      "\tThe annual shopping festival is closely watched as a barometer for consumption in China. Alibaba, which pioneered the shopping festival, held its first Singles' Day sale in 2009. Over the past decade, the shopping bonanza has become the world's largest, regularly dwarfing Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales in the U.S.\n",
      "\tThe Singles' Day festival is named as such because the main shopping day falls on Nov. 11, which when written numerically as 11.11 resembles \"bare branches\", a Chinese expression for the single and unattached.\n",

      "\tTikTok's Chinese owner, ByteDance, has until Thursday to sell off its U.S. operations under an executive order that Trump signed in August.\n",
      "\tTrump in September gave his tentative blessing to a ByteDance proposal meant to resolve U.S. national security concerns by placing TikTok under the oversight of American companies Oracle and Walmart, each of which would also have a financial stake in the company. But TikTok said this week it's received \"no clarity\" from the U.S. government about whether its proposals have been accepted.\n",
      "\tThe deal has been under a national-security review by the interagency Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS, which is led by the Treasury Department.

      "\t\"With the November 12 CFIUS deadline imminent and without an extension in hand, we have no choice but to file a petition in court to defend our rights and those of our more than 1,500 employees in the US,\" TikTok said in a written statement Tuesday.\n",
      "\tTrump has cited concerns that the Chinese government could spy on TikTok users if the app remains under Chinese ownership. TikTok has denied it's a security threat but said it's still trying to work with the administration to resolve its concerns.\n",
      "\tThe legal challenge is \"a protection to ensure these discussions can take place,\" the company said.\n",
      "\tThe Trump administration had earlier sought to ban the app from smartphone app stores and deprive it of vital technical services, but federal judges have so far blocked those actions.\n",
      "\tTikTok is now looking to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to review Trump's divestment order and the government's national-security review.\n",

      "CONTENT : TORONTO -- \n",
      "\tAs countries around the world scramble to become the first to develop a vaccine to protect against COVID-19, one expert says she’s concerned that it may be used as a geopolitical tool.\n",
      "\tThere are currently 11 vaccine candidates in at least Phase 3 of their clinical trials, which means they have begun large-scale testing in people for efficacy and safety.\n",
      "\tThe U.S. and China are leading other countries with the most vaccine candidates at the critical Phase 3 testing with four each. Because of heightened tensions between the two countries in recent years, concerns are being raised about what that will mean should one of the countries create a vaccine first.\n",
      "\tMargaret McCuaig-Johnston, a senior fellow at the University of Alberta’s China Institute, said there is a lot of competition among the different countries racing to develop a vaccine for coronavirus.\n",
      "\t“Actually, this is good in terms of the vaccine researchers and production facilities because it’s getting them all to really focus on a critical health challenge that the world now has,” she told CTV’s Your Morning on Wednesday.\n",
      "\t“This is terrific because they’re all giving top priority to this and that means that we’re going to get high-quality products as soon as possible.”\n",
      "\tAnd, while the prospect of an effective and safe vaccine in the near future is welcome news, McCuaig-Johnston said if China is the first to develop it, there could be repercussions for those countries that don’t have friendly relations with the ruling Communist Party.\n",
      "\tMcCuaig-Johnston pointed to the development of a vaccine by CanSino Biologics, a Chinese biopharmaceutical company, which was working in collaboration with Canadian researchers.\n",
      "\t“Part of the deal was that we were going to get it for Phase 3 testing and it was already to come to Canada and got blocked by senior Chinese government officials at customs leaving China,” she explained.\n",
      "\t“It was there for months and we just weren't getting the access that we had expected that we would.”\n",
      "\tMcCuaig-Johnston said the vaccine candidate ultimately went to Russia and Saudi Arabia instead, because China wanted to improve relations with those countries. She said China is still punishing Canada for the arrest of Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer and heiress to China’s telecom giant Huawei in 2018.\n",
      "\tSo in that sense, McCuaig-Johnston said China has already started using a vaccine candidate as a geopolitical tool, even before it’s been fully approved.\n",
      "\tThat’s also despite China’s recent move to join an international initiative to distribute COVID-19 vaccines to countries worldwide known as COVAX, which is led by the World Health Organization (WHO).\n",
      "\tThe alliance was created to ensure the equitable distribution of vaccines, particularly to developing countries.  \n",
      "\tChinese leader Xi Jinping has said the country would make the vaccine a global public good and distribute shots in Africa, but only after its own population has been immunized.\n",
      "\tThe U.S., on the other hand, has refused to join the alliance with President Donald Trump decrying that it was “influenced by the corrupt WHO and China.”\n",
      "\tMcCuaig-Johnston said China may use the vaccine to enhance its friendships with developing countries in Africa, South America, and Central America where it has already established ties through its Belt and Road Initiative – a global infrastructure project.\n",
      "\tWhile Canada’s relationship with China may be on thin ice, McCuaig-Johnston said she’s not overly concerned because the Canadian government has already signed agreements with a number of different companies that are currently developing vaccines.\n",
      "\t“We’re pretty well set already in that score,” she said.\n",

      "\tHong Kong's pro-democracy lawmakers announced Wednesday they would resign en masse after four of them were ousted from the semiautonomous Chinese territory's Legislature in a move one legislator said could sound the \"death knell\" for democracy there.\n",
      "\tThe resignation of the 15 remaining pro-democracy lawmakers will ratchet up tensions over the future of Hong Kong, a former British colony that has long been a regional financial hub and bastion of Western-style civil liberties but over which China's government has increasingly tightened its control. A new national security law imposed by Beijing this year has alarmed the international community.\n",
      "\tThe mass departure will also leave Hong Kong's Legislature with only pro-Beijing lawmakers, who already made up a majority but can now pass bills favoured by Beijing without much opposition.\n",
      "\tThe lawmakers told a news conference they would submit their letters of resignation on Thursday. The announcement came hours after the Hong Kong government said it was disqualifying the four legislators -- Alvin Yeung, Dennis Kwok, Kwok Ka-ki and Kenneth Leung.\n",
      "\tThe ousters came after China's National People's Congress Standing Committee passed a resolution this week saying that any lawmaker who supports Hong Kong's independence, refuses to acknowledge China's sovereignty over the city, threatens national security, or asks external forces to interfere in the city's affairs should be disqualified.\n",
      "\t\"Today we will resign from our positions because our partners, our colleagues have been disqualified by the central government's ruthless move,\" Wu Chi-wai, the leader of the pro-democracy camp, told reporters.\n",
      "\tDuring the news conference, the lawmakers held hands and chanted, \"Hong Kong add oil! Together we stand!\" The phrase \"add oil\" is a direct translation of a Chinese expression of encouragement.\n",
      "\t\"This is an actual act by Beijing ... to sound the death knell of Hong Kong's democracy fight because they would think that, from now on, anyone they found to be politically incorrect or unpatriotic or are simply not likable to look at, they could just oust you using any means,\" lawmaker Claudia Mo told reporters.\n",
      "\tIn recent months, Beijing has increasingly clamped down on Hong Kong, which it took back control of in 1997, despite promising at the time to leave the territory's more open legal and economic systems intact for 50 years until 2047.\n",
      "\tBeijing imposed a national security law in June that some have labeled draconian after anti-government protests rocked the city for months last year, and it has used it to crackdown on opposition voices.\n",
      "\tIn response, the U.S. levelled sanctions on several officials, including Hong Kong's pro-Beijing leader, several Western countries have suspended their extradition treaties with the territory, and Australia and Britain offered Hong Kongers easier paths to settle in those countries.\n",
      "\tBritain said Wednesday that the decision to remove the lawmakers raises further concerns.\n",
      "\t\"This campaign to harass, stifle and disqualify democratic opposition tarnishes China's international reputation and undermines Hong Kong's long-term stability,\" Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said in a statement.\n",
      "\tBeijing has rejected the criticism and lashed out at what it calls gross foreign interference in Chinese politics.\n",
      "\tOn Wednesday, Hong Kong's leader, Carrie Lam, defended the lawmakers' removal, telling reporters that legislators must act properly and that the city needs a body comprised of patriots.\n",
      "\t\"We cannot allow members of the Legislative Council who have been judged in accordance with the law to be unable to fulfil the requirements and prerequisites for serving on the Legislative Council to continue to operate in the Legislative Council,\" Lam said.\n",
      "\tStill, Lam said that the Legislature would not become a rubber-stamp body, and that diverse opinion is welcome.\n",
      "\t\"In terms of legality and constitutionality, obviously, from our point of view, this is clearly in breach of the Basic Law and our rights to participate in public affairs, and a failure to observe due process,\" Kwok, one of the ousted lawmakers, told reporters, referring to Hong Kong's mini-constitution.\n",
      "\tEarlier in the year, the four lawmakers were barred from seeking reelection in a vote originally scheduled for September -- but remained in their posts. They were disqualified over their calls for foreign governments to impose sanctions on Hong Kong and Beijing.\n",
      "\tThe government eventually postponed the planned September election by a year, citing the coronavirus, but the pro-democracy camp criticized the move as an attempt to block them from taking a majority of seats in the Legislature -- which was a possibility in the coming election.\n",
      "\tChinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said that the disqualification was necessary to maintain rule of law and constitutional order in Hong Kong.\n",
      "\t\"We firmly support the (Hong Kong) government in performing its duties in accordance with the Standing Committee's decision,\" Wang said at a regular news conference Wednesday.\n",

      "\tA senior U.S. government official complained Tuesday that the World Health Organization has not shared enough information about its planned mission to China to investigate the animal origins of the coronavirus.\n",
      "\tGarrett Grisby of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services griped that the criteria for WHO's China mission had not been shared with other nations. He spoke during a weeklong meeting of the U.H. health agency's member countries.\n",
      "\t\"The (terms of reference) were not negotiated in a transparent way with all WHO member states,\" he said via video conference, referring to the mission's criteria. \"Understanding the origins of COVID-19 through a transparent and inclusive investigation is what must be done.\"\n",
      "\tIn recent months, a long-planned WHO-led team seeking to investigate the coronavirus' animal origins in China has stalled. Although pandemic travel restrictions and the focus on stemming the overwhelming number of new coronavirus cases have complicated matters, some scientists worry that China has still not provided key details about what research is already ongoing.\n",
      "\tThe U.S. objections came as an independent panel commissioned by WHO to evaluate its management of the global COVID-19 response said it's considering whether the U.N. health agency has enough power and financing to stop future pandemics.\n",
      "\tFormer New Zealand Prime Minister Helen Clark, who co-chairs the panel, said the group was especially interested in establishing an accurate chronology of the very first coronavirus alerts and what responses were taken.\n",
      "\t\"The Independent Panel will do its best to shed light on what has happened, is still happening and why,\" Clark said. \"We are asking whether WHO has the right mandate, the right powers, the right capacities and the right financing to deliver on pandemic preparedness and response.\"\n",
      "\tCritics, including President Donald Trump, have slammed WHO for allegedly \"colluding\" with China to hide the extent of the initial coronavirus outbreak. Earlier this year, The Associated Press reported that senior Chinese officials didn't warn the public about the pandemic threat of coronavirus for six days and that they stalled on sharing the virus' genetic sequence and other key data with WHO experts.\n",
      "\tClark said the panel would also review \"how well the World Health Organization and the international system at large have been able to deliver on country needs and expectations.\"\n",
      "\tOn Monday, WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus pleaded for more funds, saying the agency's budget was the equivalent of what the world spends on tobacco every day.\n",
      "\tClark has shied away from criticizing WHO or member states like China for their COVID-19 efforts.\n",
      "\tLast month, Germany and France led a call from European Union countries arguing that WHO should have more powers to independently investigate outbreaks in countries and that their funding should be boosted.\n",
      "\tEarlier this year, the Trump administration halted U.S. funding for the WHO and vowed to pull the United States -- its biggest single donor -- out of the U.N. health agency by next summer. President-elect Joe Biden has said he plans to keep the United States in the organization.\n",
      "\tThe WHO meeting finishes Saturday. So far the world has seen over 50 million confirmed coronavirus cases and 1.26 million deaths, but experts say all numbers understate the pandemic's true toll.\n",

      "\tWhile that might be setting Trudeau and Canada up for some retaliatory pain from Donald Trump, analysts are divided on how much misery even a very vindictive lame-duck president could inflict on his closest neighbour.\n",
      "\tOn Monday, Trudeau became the first international leader to speak to Biden, following his swift congratulations to the former American vice-president and his running mate Kamala Harris on Saturday.\n",
      "\tThe Prime Minister's Office released a statement congratulating Biden within 45 minutes of multiple news outlets having called the Democrat's pivotal victory in Pennsylvania.\n",
      "\tBessma Momani, an international affairs expert at the University of Waterloo, says Trump is likely keeping track of who is congratulating Biden.\n",
      "\tShe said there is no ruling out that Trump could find a way to retaliate against Canada in his remaining time in the Oval Office.\n",
      "\t\"Certainly, if one looks at why the Chinese have still held out on congratulating Trump, there is fear that Trump could be punitive on trade or other matters for those who are seen to side with Biden in the legal battle Trump has undertaken,\" said Momani.\n",
      "\t\"One should not doubt that Trump is taking names and personalizing the congratulatory good wishes to Biden.\"\n",
      "\tTrump has refused to concede defeat and is threatening legal action, claiming without evidence that he was cheated out of victory. His top diplomat, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, told reporters Tuesday he expects a \"smooth transition to a second Trump administration.\"\n",
      "\tTrump imposed punitive tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum in 2018 using a seldom-used section of U.S. trade law that gives the executive branch that power to protect national security.\n",
      "\tThe tariffs were ostensibly levied to block the flood of cheap Chinese steel into the U.S. through Canada. But Trump's commerce secretary said at the time they were being imposed because the Americans were unhappy with the slow pace of the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement.\n",
      "\tTrump eventually removed the tariffs but reimposed a levy on Canadian aluminum in August, which was lifted less than a week before the presidential election.\n",
      "\t\"I don't have any suspicion that Mr. Trump is going to try to cause trouble from a trade point of view over the next couple of months,\" said Dennis Darby, the president of Canadian Manufacturers and Exporters.\n",
      "\tTrump is likely not preoccupied with foreign opinions of him, and will turn his remaining days in office to making life miserable for his political opponents within the U.S., said Sarah Goldfeder, a former U.S. diplomat who is now an Ottawa-based consultant.\n",
      "\t\"I think Trump has two things on his mind and neither is Canada,\" said Goldfeder. Those are his political and financial survival \"and making life hard for the Democrats and never-Trumpers.\"\n",
      "\tShe said \"Trudeau did not reveal anything that Trump didn't already know\" by calling Biden.\n",
      "\tTrudeau and Biden released separate readouts of their conversation Monday, which summarized areas of potential co-operation as well as differences.\n",
      "\tTrudeau's office said he and Biden discussed COVID-19, climate change, fighting anti-Black racism and China's detention of two Canadians, Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor.\n",
      "\tBiden's statement said he was looking forward to working closely with Trudeau on global health, revitalizing bilateral economic ties as well as the broader North American partnership, and working with Canada on a range of regional and global challenges.\n",
      "\tMeredith Lilly, the Simon Reisman Chair in trade policy at Carleton University's Norman Paterson School of International Affairs, said Trump's bigger worries are all domestic and the Biden-Trudeau call likely hasn't even registered with him.\n",
      "\tFrench President Emmanuel Macron has also now spoken with Biden, as will more world leaders in the coming days, \"so we have some comfort in numbers,\" said Lilly.\n",
      "\t\"During the lame-duck period, it will be important for Canadian officials to maintain constructive working relations with the Trump administration, and I'm confident that Ambassador (Kirsten) Hillman and her team in Washington will do this with professionalism.\"\n",
      "\tFen Hampson, an international affairs expert at Norman Paterson who authored a book about Brian Mulroney's foreign policy, said it is not unusual for Canadian prime ministers to reach out to the winners of the U.S. presidential election before they have been formally sworn in, as Mulroney did with Bill Clinton.\n",
      "\t\"The calculus surely was that Trump is a now lame duck and already has done as much damage as he can to bilateral relations,\" said Hampson, adding that Trudeau likely wanted to \"seize the day and not be too preoccupied with the downside risk.\"\n",

      "CONTENT : \n",
      "\tIn case there was any doubt about what we'd remember 2020 for, Collins English Dictionary has helpfully reminded us -- opting to name \"lockdown\" its word of the year.\n",
      "\tThe term, a once-obscure noun that has wormed its way into many of our conversations recently, was recognized by the linguistic authority after its meaning evolved globally due to public health measures against the COVID-19 pandemic.\n",
      "\t\"Our lexicographers chose 'lockdown' as Word of the Year because it is a unifying experience for billions of people across the world, who have had, collectively, to play their part in combating the spread of COVID-19,\" Collins wrote after announcing the award.\n",
      "\t\"It's not a shock to remember that lockdown was originally a piece of prison vocabulary: it's when inmates are confined to their cells because of some disturbance on the wing,\" it added.\n",
      "\t\"2020 is year that the meaning of the word shifted irrevocably: in most people's minds, lockdown is now a public health measure -- its use having increased exponentially since 2019.\"\n",
      "\tThe dictionary said it registered over a quarter of a million usages of \"lockdown\" during 2020, up from only 4,000 the previous year.\n",
      "\tThe term first started appearing in news reports in January, when the Chinese city of Wuhan put strict travel restrictions in place to fight a spreading virus.\n",
      "\tSince then, virtually every major country has enacted some form of lockdown -- with unprecedented social restrictions limiting human interaction and making 2020 a year unlike any other in modern history.\n",
      "\tThe pandemic unsurprisingly influenced many of the shortlisted words that Collins considered. \"Coronavirus,\" \"key worker,\" \"furlough\" and \"social distancing\" were all mentioned as the dictionary unveiled its annual choice.\n",
      "\t\"BLM,\" an abbreviation for the Black Lives Matter movement, also made the shortlist, as did \"Megxit\" -- the term used by parts of the media to refer to Prince Harry and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex's withdrawal from the British royal family.\n",
      "\tThe Collins English Dictionary is currently in its 13th edition, and its publishers highlight words each year that dominated contemporary news events. Last year, \"climate strike\" was chosen, and in 2018 they opted for \"single-use.\"\n",
      "\tBut this year's choice was an easy one. \"It's no surprise that quite a few of the words on Collins Word of the Year 2020 shortlist have one big thing in common: the pandemic,\" the dictionary wrote.\n",
      "\t\"Something that changed everyone's lives so profoundly -- leaving no country or continent untouched -- was bound to have a significant impact on our language.\"\n",

      "CONTENT : KARACHI, PAKISTAN -- \n",
      "\tA fiery online series about a group of women who unleash revenge on men has sparked a backlash in conservative Pakistan, where tough censorship rules prevent such shows from appearing on television.\n",
      "\tFilmed in Karachi but released by an India-based streaming service, \"Churails,\" or \"Witches\" in English, centres on four women who open an underground detective agency under the guise of a clothing store to catch cheating husbands.\n",
      "\tThe storylines cover often untouched topics such as gay relationships, sexual exploitation, male dominance and Pakistan's obsession with fair skin.\n",
      "\tIt caused a buzz among much of its audience online -- often limited to affluent Pakistanis who can afford the platform's subscription fee -- but infuriated conservatives when clips began to circulate on social media.\n",
      "\t\"When all of us read the script for the first time we thought to ourselves, 'Are we even allowed to do this?',\" said actress Mehar Bano.\n",
      "\tShe plays Zubaida, a young woman from a poor and traditional family who loves boxing but is forbidden from practising the sport.\n",
      "\t\"We knew what we were getting into, we knew that something like this would garner a lot of hate,\" she told AFP.\n",
      "\tIt is a rare women-centred script for strait-laced Pakistan, where shows are often limited to the stormy relationships between stay-at-home wives and their demanding mothers-in-law.\n",
      "\t\"Before this, I had not heard or seen these women on television or on digital platforms or cinema, even though I knew they existed,\" said British-Pakistani filmmaker Asim Abbasi, who wrote the 10-episode series.\n",
      "\tHe faced relentless accusations of \"making immorality glamorous\" once the show began streaming, especially after a clip from the series went viral on social media.\n",
      "\tIt portrayed a successful businesswoman character who discussed having to perform sexual services for her boss in order to be promoted.\n",
      "\tZee5 later temporarily pulled the series while it \"addressed\" a complaint from the Pakistan Television Authority.\n",
      "\t\"How do we fix something when it's not being talked about? It keeps the status quo in place,\" said Bano of complaints by the \"moral police\".\n",
      "\tThe actress, whose character is rescued from a forced wedding while her parents are held at gunpoint, said the familiar portrayal of women as respectful and subservient was keeping Pakistani women at a disadvantage.\n",
      "\tAbbasi said he would never have been able to produce the show for Pakistani television, which faces heavy censorship from authorities particularly related to sexuality.\n",
      "\tInternational subscription streaming platforms do not face the same constraints, but tech companies do risk outright prohibition -- Pakistan briefly banned Chinese short video app TikTok in September because of \"immoral\" content.\n",
      "\tSeries star Sarwat Gillani told AFP her country was \"living in denial,\" with the lives of Pakistanis \"sugarcoated\" for television.\n",
      "\t\"We weren't telling a lie,\" she says of \"Churails\", in which she plays a rich trophy wife who founds the detective agency after discovering her husband has been texting dozens of women.\n",
      "\t\"We weren't telling a story of another country. We were telling a story about our people,\" she adds.\n",
      "\tPakistan's censorship crusade against supposedly indecent media has been gathering pace under Prime Minister Imran Khan, a former cricket star with a playboy past, who has sought to placate powerful conservative and religious constituencies.\n",
      "\t\"The problem is that you cannot define indecency. It has a totally different definition for different segments of the population,\" complained science minister Fawad Chaudhry, who opposes the government bans and says they are harming the country's tech industry.\n",
      "\tIn the past few months, foreign-made dating apps such as Tinder and Grindr have been blocked and YouTube has been threatened.\n",
      "\tThere has been an \"erosion of the kind of things we can talk about\", said filmmaker Hasan Zaidi, a former head of the Karachi Film Festival.\n",
      "\t\"The avenues and space available for creativity have really shrunk in Pakistan,\" he said.\n",
      "\tSeries star Bano added that she understood it was \"uncomfortable\" for Pakistanis to see the flaws in their own society but said entertaining narratives gave audiences a chance to reflect.\n",
      "\t\"Because of this banning culture, there are a lot of problems that are being swept under the rug,\" she said.\n",

      "\tSeventy years after Canada committed troops to a conflict the public still knows little about, the country's dwindling ranks of Korean War veterans continue to speak out about their experiences in the \"forgotten war.\"\n",
      "\tMore than 26,000 Canadians fought as part of a 16-member United Nations force that interceded after the Communist north invaded the south in June 1950. Over the three years the war raged across the rugged hills of the Korean Peninsula, 516 Canadian servicemen would lose their lives.\n",
      "\tAnother 7,000, including Andy Barber of Mississauga, Ont., would serve as part of a peacekeeping force that monitored the stalemate for two years following the armistice signed in July, 1953.\n",
      "\t\"There was a lot of anxiety because you never knew when the other shoe would drop,\" said Barber, who turned 20 while serving as a flag signaller aboard HMCS Haida as it patrolled a string of coastal islands in late 1953.\n",
      "\tNow 87, Barber takes every opportunity he can to speak to schoolchildren and community groups as part of the Memory Project, a volunteer speakers bureau run by Historica Canada that allows veterans to share their experiences in the military.\n",
      "\t\"It was called for many years the forgotten war,\" Barber said in a recent interview. \"If you look at any of these schoolbooks they have maybe a paragraph or two about the Korean War and probably a couple of pages of World War Two.\"\n",
      "\tBarber said the lack of information and recognition for their service led veterans to form the Korean Veterans Association in 1974 so that they could \"get together and make sure the history of the war was carried on.\"\n",
      "\tIn fact, it took until May 1982 before the National War Memorial was rededicated to include the dates of the Korean War, and it wasn't until June 2013 that the Korean War Veterans Day Act became law, declaring July 27 a national day of remembrance.\n",
      "\tTed Barris, author of \"Deadlock in Korea,\" which details Canada's role in the war, said that although the conflict was the first test of the United Nations Peace Charter, it was often derisively referred to as a \"police action\" by politicians at the time.\n",
      "\tBarris noted the war broke out just five years after the end of the Second World War and was largely greeted with indifference by a war-weary public more interested in participating in the economic boom of the 1950s.\n",
      "\tAnd although Canadian soldiers, sailors and airmen fought with distinction in Korea, Barris said their service ended up being neglected because of how the war was generally perceived. He said the prevailing attitude was that no one wanted a Third World War, and those in charge simply wanted Korea \"cleaned up and kept quiet.\"\n",
      "\t\"We don't come away with huge monuments and great memories of great victories,\" he said. \"I think it was a subtler one (victory), and subtlety is a very odd phenomenon in war.\"\n",
      "\tThough slow in coming, veterans have received medals for their service in Korea and have seen a Korean War memorial wall erected in Brampton, Ont.\n",
      "\tBarber said there has also been satisfaction in the relationship veterans have developed with the South Korean people in the years since the war, likening it to the ties between Canadian soldiers and the people of Belgium and the Netherlands since the end of the Second World War.\n",
      "\tHe recounted a return visit in 2010 when he ended up staying at a five-star hotel at Korean government expense and was showered with small gifts of appreciation from average people who \"couldn't do enough for us.\"\n",
      "\t\"We had about 1,400 little Canadian lapel pins we were giving out, and we had people following us down the streets so they could get them,\" Barber said.\n",
      "\tDonald and Grace Sudden of Breslau, Ont., said that \"strong and ongoing\" relationship has been something veterans can rely on.\n",
      "\tDonald Sudden, now 87, served on the front lines as an artilleryman and fought in one of Canada's most famous and bloodiest battles of the war -- Hill 187 -- where the 3rd Battalion, Royal Canadian Regiment was eventually overrun by a Chinese attack.\n",
      "\tHe noted that in July he received a package of more than 25 high-quality masks from the Korean government, which sent out 35,000 in all to help veterans through the COVID-19 pandemic.\n",
      "\t\"If we run out of these, we'll get the consul general in Toronto, and he'll send us more,\" he said.\n",
      "\tGrace Sudden said the couple were also part of two return visits to Korea in 1987 and 2017.\n",
      "\tShe said she's often heard veterans remark that it felt good to return to a country that had developed so significantly economically and as a democracy in the years since the war.\n",
      "\t\"It gave some a very positive sense of their accomplishments during the war,\" she said. \"It gives a tremendous morale boost to the soldiers.\"\n",

      "\t\t\"What shocks us is that while everyone is rushing, doing what is possible so we have this vaccine available to the population, some people are betting on the opposite, coincidentally on the same day that the Sao Paulo government announces the arrival of the first doses of the vaccine,\" he said.\n",
      "\t\t\"Some people celebrate the fact that a death appeared to create this mess and try to denigrate a vaccine that is being produced in this partnership with the Chinese lab. It is very sad that I have to answer in such way.\"\n",
      "\t\tFormer President Fernando Henrique Cardoso, one of the leaders of Gov. Doria's centre-right party, said Anvisa's decision appeared to be unscientific.\n",
      "\t\t\"What is happenning is regrettable; the politization of the vaccine that will rid us of the coronavirus...,\" Cardoso said on Twitter. \"Anvisa needs to explain. And quick.\"\n",
      "\t\tCoronaVac is being tested in seven Brazilian states, plus the federal district where the capital Brasilia lies.\n",
      "\t\tFollowing the imbroglio last month surrounding the CoronaVac shot, Anvisa authorized the import from China of 6 million doses. The potential vaccine cannot be administered to Brazilians as it isn't yet approved locally, the agency said at the time.\n",
      "\t\tEarlier Monday, Sao Paulo state's health secretary, Jean Gorinchteyn, said the first 120,000 CoronaVac shots would arrive at Sao Paulo's international airport Nov. 20, though he said, \"They will only be taken to the public after a final authorization from Brazil's health regulator.\"\n",
      "\t\tThe secretary added that nearly all of the volunteers who were given two doses of the vaccine produced antibodies thought to protect people from the virus.\n",
      "\t\tSao Paulo is also importing raw material to produce40 million CoronaVac shots, which is due to start arriving Nov. 27.\n",

      "CONTENT : HONG KONG -- \n",
      "\tChinese consumers are expected to spend tens of billions on everything from fresh food to luxury goods during this year's Singles' Day online shopping festival, as the country recovers from the pandemic.\n",
      "\tThe shopping festival, which is the world's largest and typically begins in November, is an annual extravaganza where China's e-commerce companies, including Alibaba, JD.com and Pinduoduo, offer generous discounts on their platforms.\n",
      "\tBy 12:30 a.m. (1630 GMT, 11:30 a.m. EDT) on Wednesday, consumers had already spent 372.3 billion yuan (US$56.3 billion) on Alibaba's Taobao and Tmall e-commerce platforms since the company kicked off the shopping festival on Nov. 1.\n",
      "\tRival JD.com also reported cumulative sales of 200 billion yuan ($30.2 billion) since Nov. 1, nine minutes after the clock struck midnight on Wednesday.\n",
      "\tThe shopping festival got its name as the main shopping day falls on Nov. 11 every year. Also known as 11.11 or Double 11, the numbers look like \"bare branches\", an expression referring to those who are single and unattached in China. The day thus later became known as Singles' Day.\n",
      "\tThis year's festival will be closely watched as a barometer of consumption in China, which is just beginning to bounce back from the coronavirus pandemic after months of lockdown earlier in the year.\n",
      "\tAnalysts expect Chinese consumers to spend more on imported products and foreign luxury brands, since many Chinese tourists were unable to travel internationally due to the coronavirus pandemic and tightened travel restrictions.\n",
      "\tA survey by consulting firm Oliver Wyman found that 86% of Chinese consumers are willing to spend the same as or more than during last year's Singles' Day festival.\n",
      "\t\"In the last six months or so, wealthy households have actually spent more money,\" said Sean Shen, customer and strategy competence leader for EY in Greater China. \"We also see that purchases of luxury segment products are increasing because of the international travel restrictions.\"\n",
      "\tIn 2018, Chinese consumers spent about 770 billion yuan ($116.3 billion) on luxury items, accounting for about a third of the global spend, with each luxury-consuming household spending an average of 80,000 yuan annually ($12,089), according to a 2019 McKinsey report on luxury.\n",
      "\tSales of electronic goods and health and wellness products are also expected to rise, as more people work from home and pay more attention to their health amid the pandemic, according to a report by consultancy Bain & Company.\n",
      "\tTo help merchants cope with the impact from the coronavirus, online platforms have extended the shopping festival period this year in hopes of boosting sales.\n",
      "\tBoth Alibaba and JD.com, the country's two biggest e-commerce companies, began offering discounts on Oct. 21, three weeks ahead of Nov. 11. Some brands and merchants that slashed their prices booked hundreds of millions of yuan (tens of millions of dollars) in sales just hours into the shopping festival.\n",
      "\tTang Chenghui, an electrical engineer who lives in Beijing sees Singles' Day as an opportunity to stock up on snacks and imported products such as milk from Australia. Ahead of the festival, Tang pre-ordered 3 boxes of duck eggs, 10 packets of soybean milk powder, two boxes of yogurt, coffee and wine.\n",
      "\t\"I'm buying more snacks this year because I've just moved into a new apartment and have enough storage space to stockpile the snacks I like,\" said Tang. \"Some of these products are really cheap during the Singles' Day discounts.\"\n",
      "\tUnlike Black Friday and Cyber Monday in the U.S., Singles' Day in China is not just about deep bargains. Alibaba pioneered the concept of Singles' Day and holds an annual gala on Nov. 11 with celebrity performances to entertain shoppers.\n",
      "\tE-commerce companies don't break down Singles Day sales volume by brands so it is hard to know what share goes to foreign companies, though some companies might announce their own performances.\n",
      "\tSales via livestreaming and Alibaba's annual gala are part of a \"shoppertainment\" trend which blends shopping with entertainment in order to become more appealing and engaging to shoppers.\n",
      "\tMini games within online shopping platforms entice shoppers with deeper discounts while encouraging them to spend more time within the app.\n",
      "\t\"Because of COVID-19, brands and retailers have doubled down on e-commerce and livestreaming commerce to drive growth, and it will show strongly on (Singles' Day) this year,\" said Wang Xiaofeng, a senior analyst at Forrester.\n",
      "\tBut while millions of shoppers spend hours on mini games hoping to snag better bargains, some are irked by the complexities required to win such discounts.\n",
      "\t\"Black Friday discounts tend to be better, and they are more straightforward,\" said Liu Zhirou, a 27 year-old Beijing-based accountant. \"Now, I still ask my friends to help me buy things from the U.S. during Black Friday.\"\n",
      "\t\"The rules around Singles' Day discounts now are getting more and more complicated,\" she said. \"I usually just spend my money on Black Friday, and buy less on Singles' Day.\"\n",

      "\tA diverse group of notable Canadians, including Indigenous advocates and veterans, an Inuit artist and the first person of Chinese descent born in this country have been shortlisted to appear on the new $5 bill.\n",
      "\tTerry Fox, who captivated a nation as he ran to raise awareness and money for cancer research, is also among the eight names the Bank of Canada has sent to the government as it considers who should be featured on the bank note when it gets a redesign next year.\n",
      "\tThe bank says it received more than 600 eligible names from nearly 45,000 Canadians, and an advisory committee whittled the list down to eight people.\n",
      "\tPitseolak Ashoona: Born in the first few years of the 20th century, Ashoona was a self-taught artist. Her art, which has been shown around Canada and the world, reflects the “old ways” of the Inuit of the Eastern Arctic.\n",
      "\tRobertine “Francoise” Barry: The first female French-Canadian journalist, Barry was an advocate for women's right to vote, post-secondary education and victims of domestic violence.\n",
      "\tBinaaswi (Francis Pegahmagabow): The most highly decorated Indigenous soldier in Canadian history was a veteran of the First World War and later advocated for Indigenous rights in Canada.\n",
      "\tWon Alexander Cumyow: Born pre-Confederation, he is the first known Chinese-Canadian to be born in Canada and used his language skills - he was fluent in Cantonese and English - to bridge racial and linguistic divides in Vancouver and helped change attitudes toward Chinese people in this country.\n",
      "\tTerry Fox: His “Marathon of Hope” raised millions of dollars for cancer research. Cancer halted his run and ultimately took his life, but communities still hold annual runs to raise money for cancer research.\n",
      "\tLotta Hitschmanova: Immigrating to Canada in 1942, the Czech-born refugee was the founder of the Unitarian Service Committee of Canada and worked tirelessly to help people, especially children, in Europe, India, Nepal, Palestine, Indonesia and Africa.\n",
      "\tIsapo-muxika/Sahpo Muxika (Crowfoot): A leader of the Blackfoot Confederacy, he was an advocate for peace among Indigenous nations, and between Indigenous Peoples and settlers, and was key to Treaty 7 negotiations.\n",
      "\tOnondeyoh (Frederick Ogilvie Loft): Founded the first pan-Canadian Indigenous group in 1918 to advocate for Indigenous rights, laying the foundation for modern regional and national organizations. He was also a Mohawk chief and veteran of the First World War.\n",
      "\tMore information on each is available on the Bank of Canada's website.\n",
      "\tFinance Minister Chrystia Freeland is to make a decision early next year about who should adorn the new bill.\n",
      "\tLike the redesigned $10 bill, the new $5 bill will have a vertical design. The chosen person will be featured on one side, with another image on the other side.\n",
      "\tIn 2018, the $10 bill got the first redesign with an image on one side of Viola Desmond as well as a map of the historic north end of Halifax where Desmond lived and worked. In 1946, it was Desmond's refusal to leave a whites-only area of a movie theatre that fuelled drives towards racial equality in Canada.\n",
      "\tOn the other side of the $10 note, is an eagle feather to represent ongoing work on Indigenous rights, part of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, and laurel leaves, an old symbol for justice, found in the Supreme Court of Canada building.\n",
      "\tLike the $10 bill, the new $5 bill will have the latest security measures.\n",
      "\tThe bank says the current $5 bill will still circulate for some time even after the redesign. The image of Sir Wilfrid Laurier will be featured on one of the country's higher-value notes, like the $50 bill or $100 bill, when they are redesigned. The central bank says the process to redesign bills can take years from public consultations to design, production and release.\n",

      "CONTENT : TORONTO -- \n",
      "\tWhen U.S. President Donald Trump was ramping up his efforts to ban social media platform TikTok in the U.S. over security concerns earlier this year, the company behind the Chinese-bred app was quietly making inroads in another market: Canada.\n",
      "\tTikTok, a smartphone app for making and watching short videos, spent the last few months setting up an office in Toronto and hired 50 employees to work there while entertaining Walmart, Oracle and Microsoft bids for its business south of the border.\n",
      "\tThe Trump administration has tried to ban TikTok on the grounds that it is a security threat, citing its Chinese owner, ByteDance and the possibility that the Chinese government could spy on users. Trump's executive order to cut TikTok off from vital technical services was set to take effect Nov. 12, but is now on hold as a lawsuit from several U.S. content creators proceeds.\n",
      "\tIn the meantime, the \"bite-sized\" video app's new Canadian general manager Daniel Habashi wants users here to know \"we are here to stay and we are excited about our future in Canada without question.\"\n",
      "\t\"Our commitment to grow the platform locally is unchanged,\" Habashi told The Canadian Press recently.\n",
      "\tWhile he wouldn't discuss the U.S. situation due to the ongoing court case, Habashi opened up about how TikTok plans to find its groove in Canada -- even during a pandemic.\n",
      "\tWith most people at home for longer periods and COVID-19 boredom setting in, the app is bustling with millions of users lip syncing, dancing and singing and brands like Tim Hortons and Wealthsimple vying for their attention.\n",
      "\tTikTok, which was founded by Beijing tech company ByteDance in 2016 and merged with competitor platform Musical.ly in August 2018, has been catapulted to top download lists and become a favourite to just about every member of Generation Z in North America.\n",
      "\tHabashi, whose resume includes stints at Microsoft, Instagram, Facebook and even the Soho House members' club, is keen on keeping that hype and engagement up -- and the stakes are high.\n",
      "\tTrendy social media apps don't always stay successful for long. Explosive growth can create unwieldy companies, and international growth comes with a host of regulatory and legal navigational challenges. And despite popularity, apps may fail to catch on with a wide enough audience.\n",
      "\tJust 9 per cent of Canadians between the ages of 16 and 64 were using TikTok by the end of 2019, a study from We Are Social Media marketing insights firm and B.C. tech company HootSuite revealed.\n",
      "\tA 2020 study from Ryerson University found TikTok found that while the portion of social media users in Canada on TikTok is relatively small, those with accounts use it regularly. Engagement levels are a commonly used success measurement for social media companies.\n",
      "\tKeeping TikTok growing in Canada will involve capitalizing on local trends, said Habashi.\n",
      "\t\"We take a market-led approach, which means we focus on content that resonates with Canadians and there's a huge appetite from Canadians around learning content specifically, he said, mentioning instructional TikToks about how to cook a steak or chemistry projects you can do with your kids as an example.\n",
      "\t\"If the audience finds it engaging, we ensure that it's readily available and accessible on TikTok.\"\n",
      "\tAside from educational content, the app is seeing spikes in posts about .greatoutdoors (230 million video views), .hockeytok (214 million views) and .familyfun (2.4 billion views).\n",
      "\tPublic health TikTok videos are also proving popular these days in Canada, Habashi said.\n",
      "\tGovernment officials, mayors and doctors have all used the app to share messages about staying home, when and how to get tested for COVID-19 and changing policies around bubbles and gatherings.\n",
      "\tThey know TikTok's younger user base isn't tuning into the evening news or visiting public health websites, but they'll spend hours watching people lip sync and shake and shimmy on TikTok.\n",
      "\tHabashi is quick to argue that it's not just youth on the platform, especially during the new work-from-home era.\n",
      "\t\"TikTok has been called the last funny corner of the internet and the sense of positivity and entertainment has been really attractive ΓÇª for all ages and walks of life,\" he said.\n",
      "\t\"We continue to see growth across all demographics and especially around the COVID period, we saw a lot of multi-generational TikToks, where you saw not just the creators themselves, but millennials all the way through to grandparents getting involved in TikTok.\"\n",
      "\tAmid all the buzz, TikTok signed the lease on a new office space in Toronto's Liberty Village neighbourhood, complete with dedicated space for creators and brands and access to a full production studio.\n",
      "\tIt also teamed up with Ottawa's Shopify Inc. to offer U.S. merchants \"shoppable\" videos and boosted staffing levels in Canada and abroad. The company has snagged Gave Lindo, a CBC exec who led the broadcaster's programming and later streaming efforts, and earlier this month welcomed Vanessa Craft, Elle Canada's former editor-in-chief.\n",
      "\tThat's just the beginning, Habashi says.\n",
      "\tOver the next three years, TikTok has plans to hire about 3,000 engineers. The bulk will be in Canada, Singapore and parts of Europe.\n",
      "\tThe company didn't say how many of the engineers will land in Canada, but Habashi hinted that the company is thinking broadly and ambitiously.\n",
      "\t\"Stay tuned on that, but absolutely the plan is to expand beyond Ontario.\"\n",

      "\tRussian President Vladimir Putin won't congratulate President-elect Joe Biden until legal challenges to the U.S. election are resolved and the result is official, the Kremlin announced Monday.\n",
      "\tPutin is one of a handful of world leaders who have not commented on Biden's victory, which was called by major news organizations on Saturday. But President Donald Trump's team has promised legal action in the coming days and refused to concede his loss, while alleging large-scale voter fraud, so far without proof.\n",
      "\tWhen Trump won in 2016, Putin was prompt in offering congratulations -- but Trump's challenger in that election, Hillary Clinton, also conceded the day after the vote.\n",
      "\tPutin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters Monday that this year is different.\n",
      "\t\"Obviously, you can see that certain legal procedures are coming there, which were announced by the incumbent president -- therefore this situation is different, so we consider it correct to wait for the official announcement,\" he said.\n",
      "\tThe leaders of China, Brazil and Turkey also are holdouts in offering congratulations. And Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador also said he would wait to comment until the legal challenges were resolved.\n",
      "\tChinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin offered a similar explanation of why President Xi Jinping has stayed silent.\n",
      "\t\"We understand the presidential election result will be determined following U.S. laws and procedures,\" he said.\n",
      "\tA senior Turkish official said Ankara also was waiting for the various legal challenges to be settled before congratulating \"the winner.\"\n",
      "\t\"Turkey will congratulate the winner as soon as the results of the election will become official as part of the respect it has for the U.S. people and democracy,\" said Omer Celik, spokesman for President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's ruling party. \"We are waiting for the final results ... because there are objections and other disputes.\"\n",
      "\tCelik said Turkey knows both Trump and Biden and is prepared to work with \"whichever wing\" is the winner.\n",
      "\tPeskov suggested that when the time comes, a congratulatory message from Putin would come with all the expected protocol.\n",
      "\t\"I remind you that Vladimir Putin said more than once that he will respect any choice of American people, and will be ready to work with any chosen president of the United States,\" he said.\n",
      "\tFor now, Putin's holding back allows a delay in addressing that fraught question of how to improve relations. Although Russian politicians widely lauded Trump's election in 2016, expecting him to make good on his promises of improving ties, his administration disappointed Moscow by enacting sanctions, expelling scores of Russian diplomats in the wake of the poisoning of double agent Sergei Skripal in the U.K., and authorizing lethal weapons sales to Ukraine.\n",
      "\tBut Russia is characteristically wary of Democratic U.S. administrations because they tend to be more forward about criticizing Russia on human rights and democracy issues.\n",
      "\tBiden, in a 2011 trip to Russia as vice-president, epitomized that approach in a speech at Moscow Statue University, the country's most prestigious higher education institution.\n",
      "\t\"Don't compromise on the basic elements of democracy. You need not make that Faustian bargain,\" he told students.\n",
      "\tBiden also is tainted in Russia's eyes by having been the Obama administration's point-man in Ukraine after the uprising that drove the country's Kremlin-friendly president from power in 2014. Russia contended that those protests were fomented by the United States.\n",
      "\tRussian officials frequently blamed the difficulties of Moscow-Washington relations during the Trump administration on alleged \"Russophobia\" carried over from the Obama years. Some politicians expect that could increase under Biden.\n",
      "\t\"With the victory of a Democrat, one can expect revenge from all nonconservative forces around the world. This means more Russophobia in Europe, more deaths in (eastern Ukraine) and in many other hot spots of the world, as well as more politically motivated sanctions, if we talk about the direct and simplest consequences,\" said Konstantin Kosachev, chairman of the foreign affairs committee in the upper house of parliament, whose views generally parallel the Kremlin's.\n",
      "\t\"The Biden administration may return to a much more assertive policy in the post-Soviet space, which is always extremely unnerving for Moscow,\" Fyodor Lukyanov, editor of the Russia In Global Affairs journal, told the state news agency Tass.\n",
      "\tBoth, however, noted that a Biden administration is likely to be more amenable to international co-operation, especially in arms control such as renewing the New START treaty between Russia and the U.S. that is to expire next year.\n",
      "\tKosachev also suggested that Biden's election would largely eliminate complaints about Russian election interference, thereby smoothing the way for armaments agreements.\n",
      "\t\"Not that we believe Washington will be sobering up, but at least a key irritant can go away. Is this not a reason for the resumption of negotiations, for example, on arms control? We are definitely ready,\" he said.\n",

      "CONTENT : MONTREAL -- \n",
      "\tAir Canada shares surged more than 28 per cent Monday as news of a potential COVID-19 vaccine and government assistance for the industry eclipsed dismal third-quarter results brought about by global pandemic lockdowns.\n",
      "\tThe Montreal-based airline said it lost $685 million, or $2.31 per diluted share, in the three months ending Sept. 30, during what is normally its most profitable quarter.\n",
      "\t\"I think there are a lot of people who are very, very hesitant to make any travel arrangements now, based on these restrictions and quarantines,\" said chief executive Calin Rovinescu on a conference call with financial analysts on Monday.\n",
      "\t\"Even if they feel safe to travel ... they can't justify coming back and taking two weeks at home in quarantine.\"\n",
      "\tDuring the same period last year, Air Canada had a profit of $636 million, or $2.35 per diluted share. Third-quarter sales fell 86 per cent from a year ago, down to $757 million from $4.77 billion.\n",
      "\tDespite the losses, Air Canada shares closed up $4.53, or 28.6 per cent, at $20.35 apiece on the Toronto Stock Exchange.\n",
      "\tThe company says it hopes to save $3 billion between now and 2023 by cutting the number of planes in its hangars.\n",
      "\tIt plans to retire 79 older aircraft, defer the purchase of 18 Airbus planes and 16 Boeing planes, and cancel its plans to buy 10 Boeing 737 MAX 8 and 12 Airbus A220s. However, it will still receive five new Airbus A220s this winter.\n",
      "\tThe cost-cutting measures come as Air Canada plans to cut its fourth-quarter capacity by approximately 75 per cent compared with the fourth quarter of 2019.\n",
      "\tThe company -- which has already cut 20,000 jobs, suspended 30 domestic routes and closed eight regional stations this year -- said it is eyeing another 95 routes for potential suspension and nine Canadian stations for potential closure.\n",
      "\tRovinescu said the company is planning to dive into talks with the federal government \"immediately\" after Transport Minister Marc Garneau announced on Sunday that the government will soon present an aid program for the country's airline industry.Garneau said any help will be contingent on carriers providing refunds to passengers whose flights were cancelled.\n",
      "\tChief commercial officer Lucie Guillemette said Air Canada has struggled more than some U.S. counterparts with the COVID-19 pandemic, as the Chinese government has limited the number of flights from Canada and the bubble of Atlantic provinces dampened domestic travel.\n",
      "\tThe airline says its net cash burn for the quarter totalled $818 million or approximately $9 million per day, better than its expectations for between $1.35 billion and $1.6 billion or between $15 million and $17 million per day.\n",
      "\tNet debt was $4.97 billion as of Sept. 30, up by $2.13 billion from the end of last year.\n",
      "\tSlashing airplane orders and other costs means that Air Canada will emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic as a smaller company, executives told analysts on a conference call Monday.\n",
      "\tRovinescu said Air Canada expects to have a smaller footprint for \"several years.\" When asked when he expected business travellers to return to air travel, he said he expects it will be three to five years before Air Canada sees business travel at 2019 levels.\n",
      "\tDespite calling the company's recovery \"fragile\" and \"uneven,\" executives left the door open to expanding through the proposed acquisition of Transat, as well as buying planes later through flexible contracts or bankruptcies.\n",
      "\tExecutives also said they plan to grow the business in other ways. The company is among contenders for a government contract to transport COVID-19 vaccines, and Guillemette said Air Canada is hoping to leverage the growing popularity of online shopping and the need to transport medical supplies. It has plans to fly 100 cargo flights per week this winter.Air Canada is also investing in technology to improve health and safety in airports, encouraging rapid testing trials and touchless lounges, and is trying to reach \"niche\" markets travelling to Qatar and the Caribbean. Guillemette also stressed the importance of a partnership with United Airlines to feed travellers to Air Canada.\n",
      "\t\"You know, there may be some additional sun activity into the Florida markets and into the Caribbean markets. But it's not going to be material to move the dial,\" said Rousseau.\n",
      "\tGuillemette said that restoring service for people visiting friends and relatives in China and India will be a top priority. This segment would be among the quickest to rebound if travel restrictions are lifted or a vaccine becomes available, she said.\n",
      "\tRaymond James analyst Savanthi Syth wrote in a client note on Monday that -- although Air Canada's overall financial results fell short of expectations in the third quarter -- \"we expect shares to react positively this morning on COVID vaccine news and news reports on Sunday that Canada's Transport Minister is starting talks with airlines.\"\n",

      "\tThere's opportunity for Canada to help supply the world's growing need for \"energy transition metals\" used in electric vehicle and power storage batteries but it faces stiff competition from other countries, especially China, observers say.\n",
      "\tLast month, the federal and Ontario governments announced they will each contribute $295 million to help Ford Canada produce electric vehicles in Oakville, Ont., while also vowing to help Fiat Chrysler in its plans to invest up to $1.5 billion at its Windsor, Ont., plant.\n",
      "\tMeanwhile, Elon Musk, CEO of EV manufacturer Tesla, has promised big contracts for miners around the world who increase nickel production for the batteries his vehicles are soon going to need.\n",
      "\t\"We are pretty excited about these recent announcements regarding electrification because there's absolutely no reason why Canada can't be a bigger supplier going forward of these critical materials,\" said Pierre Gratton, CEO of the Mining Association of Canada, in an interview.\n",
      "\t\"But we're going to have to find them and mine them.\"\n",
      "\tMore than $1 trillion of investment will be needed in key energy transition metals -- aluminum, cobalt, copper, nickel and lithium -- over the next 15 years just to meet the growing demands of decarbonization if global warming is to be kept to less than two degrees by 2050, according to a recent report by consultancy firm Wood Mackenzie.\n",
      "\tThat's almost double the figure invested over the previous 15 years.\n",
      "\tCanada is well-endowed with copper, aluminum and nickel resources and could attract some of those investment dollars, says report author Julian Kettle, Wood Mackenzie's vice-chairman of metals and mining, but it faces the same price-related issues as the rest of the world.\n",
      "\t\"The price levels for a whole range of mined commodities are below the incentive price level, and some by a large margin,\" he said in an interview.\n",
      "\t\"\"The energy transition starts and ends with metals -- but the caveat is, not just yet.\"\n",
      "\tThe cost of electric vehicles is expected to decline to reach parity with internal combustion vehicles in 2024 and 2025 and consumer demand could skyrocket in a very short period of time, Kettle said.\n",
      "\tThe trouble is that planning, designing and building a mine takes five to seven years, plus the time to satisfy regulators, he added.\n",
      "\tCanada is considered the fifth largest producer of nickel, with output of about 181,000 tonnes in 2019, up from 157,000 in 2010, according to Natural Resources Canada, which estimates about three per cent of the world's reserves are in Canada.\n",
      "\tThe country is well out of the top 10 when it comes to cobalt, with only 3,340 tonnes produced in 2019, up from 2,600 in 2010, and for copper production, at 544,000 tonnes in 2019, up from 508,000 in 2010, the federal department said.\n",
      "\tThere are dozens of proposals to build lithium mines in Eastern Canada and to sift lithium from oilfield brines in Alberta but Canada's only operating mine, North American Lithium in Quebec, was shut down in 2019 and is being marketed in a court-supervised process after the owner declared insolvency.\n",
      "\tLast March, Quebec set aside $90 million over five years in its budget for development of \"critical and strategic minerals\" such as lithium, cobalt, graphite, rare earth elements, niobium and titanium.\n",
      "\tThe risks of investing in metals mining are well-known at Sherritt International Corp., which mines for cobalt and nickel in Cuba and processes the metal at a refinery in Alberta.\n",
      "\tThe Toronto-based company concluded a court-supervised restructuring in August that allowed it to finally get out from under crushing debt resulting from an ill-timed investment in the Ambatovy nickel mine in Madagascar in 2007, said CEO David Pathe.\n",
      "\tDemand for nickel and cobalt for batteries is expected to increase, Pathe said, but new mines aren't likely to be greenlighted until nickel rises from today's prices of around US$7 per pound to $10 or $12.\n",
      "\tAccording to the Canadian Mining Association, China produces 59 per cent of the world's lithium supply, 70 per cent of its graphite and 36 per cent of its cobalt.\n",
      "\tChina's is also growing its control of the global nickel market, Kettle said.\n",
      "\t\"For the Chinese it doesn't matter. They're not worried about returns. They just want to secure the metal,\" he said.\n",
      "\tThe mining association has called for more money for CanmetMining, the main research arm of Natural Resources Canada. It also wants a $250-million fund created to focus on building northern infrastructure to allow more electrification of mining there.\n",
      "\t\"The biggest issue for us is that Canada is a vast country,\" says Gratton. \"We have known deposits but they're remote, they lack infrastructure, and they're just not economic.\"\n",

      "\tWorld leaders on Sunday cheered Joe Biden's election as U.S. president as a chance to enhance co-operation on climate change, the coronavirus and other problems after four years of President Donald Trump's rejection of international alliances.\n",
      "\tTrump had yet to concede defeat, but Western and Asian allies expressed hoped for a fresh start following Trump's \"American First\" trade policies, withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement and attacks on NATO and the World Health Organization.\n",
      "\tIn Asia, a region on edge about the strategic ambitions of China's ruling Communist Party, the elected leaders of Japan, South Korea and Taiwan invoked \"shared values\" with Washington and expressed hope for close relations.\n",
      "\t\"I look forward to working with you to further strengthen the Japan-US Alliance and ensure peace, freedom, and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region and beyond,\" said Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga on Twitter. President Moon Jae-in of South Korea said he looked forward to working together \"for our shared values.\"\n",
      "\tWord of the victory in Pennsylvania that pushed Barack Obama's former vice-president past the threshold of the 270 Electoral College votes needed to take over the Oval Office spread around the globe, sparking celebrations.\n",
      "\tThere was no immediate official reaction from Beijing, which is mired in conflicts with the Trump administration over trade, security and technology. But Chinese social media users welcomed the change. A post on the Sina Weibo microblog service, signed Gong Teng Xin Yi, said, \"Congratulating Biden, the old friend of Chinese people on winning the election.\"\n",
      "\tAfter Trump said he won \"by a lot,\" the Communist Party newspaper People's Daily responded on Twitter, \"HaHa.\"\n",
      "\tPresident Tsai Ing-wen of Taiwan, the self-ruled island Beijing claims as part of its territory, expressed hope to \"further our friendship.\" Biden had congratulated Tsai on her reelection in January, saying Taiwan is \"stronger because of your free and open society.\" Washington has no formal relations with Taiwan, but Trump raised the profile of informal contacts by sending Cabinet officials to the island, an act that irritated Beijing.\n",
      "\tThere also was no immediate reaction from Russian President Vladimir Putin, who was friendly with Trump. Other leaders who supported Trump, including President Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines, congratulated Biden, indicating they rejected Trump's claim the election wasn't over.\n",
      "\tMost Western allies welcomed a fresh start with Washington. Many have been dismayed at Trump's criticism of decades-old military and economic alliances.\n",
      "\t\"We want to work in our co-operation for a new trans-Atlantic beginning, a New Deal,\" said German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas on Twitter.\n",
      "\tOthers expressed hope Biden might revive co-operation on health, climate and other issues following Trump's rejection of the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement and pressure on Canada, Mexico, South Korea and other partners to renegotiate trade terms.\n",
      "\t\"I look forward to working with President-elect Biden, Vice-President-elect Harris, their administration, and the United States Congress as we tackle the world's greatest challenges together,\" Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who was the target of personal insults by Trump, said on Twitter.\n",
      "\tPrime Minister Scott Morrison of Australia told reporters he looked forward to a \"great partnership\" with Washington. He cited challenges including the coronavirus and \"ensuring a free and open\" Indo-Pacific region, a reference to China's disputes with its neighbours over control of vast tracts of ocean.\n",
      "\t\"American leadership is indispensable to meeting these challenges,\" Morrison said.\n",
      "\tPrime Minister Imran Khan of Pakistan said he looked forward to working together to end illegal tax havens and on peacemaking in Afghanistan.\n",
      "\tOther leaders who sent congratulations included German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Emmanuel Macron and Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi.\n",
      "\tEmbattled Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and his U.S.-backed rival, Juan Guaido, both congratulated Biden and Vice-President-elect Kamala Harris. Maduro said Venezuela, which is under crippling U.S. sanctions aimed at forcing him out of office, was \"ready for dialogue and understanding\" with the United States.\n",
      "\tThe election outcome drew mixed reviews in Iraq, where Biden is remembered as a champion of the U.S. invasion in 2003. Still, Iraqi President Barham Salih described Biden as a friend and trusted partner.\n",
      "\tIn Iran, where the economy has been choked by U.S. sanctions, senior Vice-President Eshaq Jahangiri wrote on Facebook, \"The era of Trump and his warmongering and adventurist team is over.\" The newspaper Resalat published images of Trump without a mask against the coronavirus and Biden with a mask, and said, \"Maskless enemy left, masked enemy arrived.\"\n",
      "\tCongratulations also poured in from leaders who got along with Trump but ignored his claims the election wasn't over.\n",
      "\tThe Philippines' Duterte, who had said Filipino-Americans would \"get the best deal with Trump,\" expressed hope for enhanced ties based on \"shared commitment to democracy, freedom and the rule of law.\"\n",
      "\tCrown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan of the United Arab Emirates, who was close to Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, extended his best wishes to Biden and Harris on Twitter.\n",
      "\tIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has been known for public displays of bonhomie with Trump, shared a photo of himself with Biden and offered his congratulations \"on your spectacular victory!\"\n",
      "\tBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson, another Trump ally, said he looked forward to \"working closely together on our shared priorities, from climate change to trade and security.\"\n",
      "\tHarris's election inspired calls in parts of Africa for more women in government.\n",
      "\t\"The time has also come to give our women the chance to occupy such a high office in our country and even the number one position,\" said a Nigerian Cabinet minister, Festus Keyamo, on Twitter.\n",
      "\tOthers expressed hope Biden will help to heal divisions in American society and global politics.\n",
      "\t\"He seems open to accepting people's different viewpoints and wants to move forward in a united manner,\" said Mika Goto, a nursery school employee in Tokyo.\n",
      "\tWhile outspoken disappointment was scarce, several prominent leaders who have maintained warm relations with Trump's administration kept silent.\n",
      "\tThat included President Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia. Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said he would wait \"until all the issues are resolved.\"\n",
      "\tIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, whose Twitter profile photo shows him sitting beside Trump, described Biden as a friend of Israel and said he looked forward to working with him and Harris to \"strength the special alliance\" between their countries. In a separate statement, he thanked Trump for raising U.S.-Israeli relations to \"unprecedented heights.\"\n",
      "\tMany people, particularly in nations with turbulent politics, took Biden's win as improving the outlook for respect of democracy.\n",
      "\tAmong them was Tanzanian opposition leader Zitto Kabwe, who was arrested and charged with terrorism-related offences after his country's bruising presidential election.\n",
      "\t\"This victory symbolizes the hope for democracy at a time when many other parts of the world are seeing that light diminishing,\" Kabwe said.\n",
      "\tThe outcome inspired disbelief in Slovenia, the homeland of first lady Melania Trump. Prime Minister Janez Jansa was the only leader who congratulated Trump even before all votes were counted and showed support after Biden's win was announced.\n",

      "\tWhen code red restrictions came into effect in the Winnipeg Metro Region, Lois Coward, the executive director of the Niigaanaki Day Care Centre in the city, said she was told by the province that all staff at child care centres would now have to wear a medical-grade mask.\n",
      "\t“With that, we got another message from the Early Learning and Child Care Program saying that they would be supplying us with medical-grade masks, and we thought ‘okay, this is great,’” Coward told CTV News.\n",

      "\tChina on Thursday defended a ban on non-Chinese arrivals from a growing list of countries as \"reasonable and fair\" as it guards against a resurgence of the coronavirus.\n",
      "\tCOVID-19 first emerged in central China late last year, but Beijing has largely brought its outbreak under control through tight travel restrictions and stringent health measures for anyone entering the country.\n",
      "\tIn March, as the virus ripped across the world, China shut its borders to all foreign nationals.\n",
      "\tIt gradually eased restrictions to allow those stranded overseas to return with special permission from its embassies, negative COVID-19 tests and a two-week quarantine on arrival.\n",
      "\tBut in a sharp reversal, as the outbreak once more billows out across Europe, the Chinese embassy in the UK on Wednesday said Beijing had decided to \"temporarily suspend\" entry from Britain by non-Chinese nationals.\n",
      "\tEmbassies in Belgium, the Philippines, India, Ukraine and Bangladesh have since put out similar notices.\n",
      "\tThe Chinese foreign ministry said Thursday it was a \"reasonable and fair\" measure to tackle the pandemic.\n",
      "\t\"China is drawing on the practices of many countries and adjusting its handling of the entry of the relevant people into China based on the changing pandemic situation,\" said ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin.\n",
      "\tBritain -- one of the world's hardest-hit countries with nearly 48,000 deaths linked to the virus and more than one million cases -- has entered a new nationwide lockdown to curb the contagion's spread.\n",
      "\tBelgium, meanwhile, which has the most COVID-19 cases per capita in the world, has been in lockdown since last week, while large parts of the Philippines went back into lockdown in October.\n",
      "\tIndia passed eight million cases last week, second only to the United States, while Ukraine and Bangladesh have also been sources of imported cases in China in recent months.\n",
      "\tBeijing has recently tightened requirements for travellers from several other countries, making entry much more difficult.\n",
      "\tThey include the presentation of a health certificate from the local Chinese embassy showing the results of a nucleic acid test and an antibody test -- within 48 hours of travel.\n",
      "\tThe new rules apply to travellers from countries including France, Singapore, Canada, Germany, Pakistan, South Africa and the US.\n",
      "\tThe strict two-test entry requirement and short time frame have sparked complaints.\n",
      "\tThe European Chamber of Commerce in China said the measures were \"a de facto ban on anyone trying to get back to their lives, work and families in China.\"\n",

      "\tThe federal government has made preparations to evacuate some 300,000 Canadian citizens out of Hong Kong should the situation deteriorate, even though the chances of it becoming necessary are currently very low, according to Ottawa’s top diplomat in Hong Kong.\n",
      "\tThe government, however, will be unable to help non-citizens seeking asylum, including relatives of Canadian citizens, Jeff Nankivell, Canada’s consul general in Hong Kong and Macau, told the Special Committee on Canada-China Relations in Ottawa this week.\n",
      "\t“We have detailed plans in place, and we have resources available and identified to cover a range of situations up to and including a situation where the urgent departure of a large number of Canadians would be necessary,” said Nankivell, adding that the plans include bringing in additional resources should circumstances necessitate it.\n",
      "\t“The likelihood of that kind of extreme scenario appears right now to be very, very low, but it‘s our job to plan for the most extreme situations and we do have detailed plans in place.”\n",
      "\tBut the consulate, like those of other countries, can not accept applications for asylum from non-citizens in their own territory, Nankivell explained, saying they would need to make a claim from a third country, something he admitted could be difficult due to the possibility authorities could prevent people from leaving.\n",
      "\tNo Canadians or others have approached the consulate to ask for protection or seek asylum yet, he said. The consulate has also not heard of any cases where residents in Hong Kong have been prevented from exiting the territory, he added, unless they were already under legal constraints, such as bail conditions and the 2,300 individuals arrested during protests who are now facing charges.\n",
      "\tConcerns for Canadians in Hong Kong come as China continues to tighten its grip on the territory. Hundreds of thousands of Hong Kong residents, possibly more, took to the streets last year in large-scale demonstrations that lasted months amid concerns that China was encroaching on the “one country, two systems” principle with an extradition bill that residents worried at the time could give the communist government undue influence over the region.\n",
      "\tChina and the U.K. had signed a joint declaration in 1984 that took effect in 1997, when Hong Kong was returned to China, and included the Basic Law. The law ensured Hong Kong would retain many of its existing systems -- economic, legal, legislative, human rights and freedoms -- for 50 years.\n",
      "\t“It’s not simply a bilateral treaty, it was registered at the United Nations and Canada was a witness to that registration. As a result, Canada has an obligation to ensure that this international treaty is upheld, which is currently not the case,” Michael Chong, a Conservative MP and member of the special committee, noted during the meeting.\n",
      "\tBut in June of this year, China enacted a sweeping national security law bypassing Hong Kong approval that has drawn international criticism for its broad and vague language prohibiting subversion against the Chinese government and other acts deemed a security threat.\n",
      "\t“It was fundamentally improper. It was secretive, the law itself. The details of the law were only revealed to the public at the very moment that it took effect, which is extraordinary in a common law system,” Nankivell told committee members.\n",
      "\t“Really the most troubling aspect of the law is in its Article 55, which provides for security agencies of the central government to operate without supervision from Hong Kong authorities and beyond the reach of Hong Kong courts.”\n",
      "\tArticle 38 of the law has also come under scrutiny due to implications that the law also applied to all non-Chinese citizens who did not live in the region.\n",
      "\tCanada and China relations already reached their lowest point in years after Canada detained Meng Wanzhou, a top executive with Chinese telecom company Huawei, on an extradition request from the U.S. China then arrested two Canadians, Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig, in what Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has since described as coercive diplomacy.\n",
      "\tLast month, tensions rose further after China’s ambassador to Canada, Cong Peiwu, said Canada would be interfering in China’s internal affairs if Ottawa granted asylum to pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong.\n",
      "\t“If the Canadian side really cares about the stability and the prosperity in Hong Kong, and really cares about the good health and safety of those 300,000 Canadian passport-holders in Hong Kong and the large number of Canadian companies operating in Hong Kong SAR, you should support those efforts to fight violent crimes,” Cong said in a video news conference.\n",
      "\tWhen asked if his comments were a threat, Cong responded, “That is your interpretation.”\n",
      "\tThe consulate has seen some increases in visa and immigration inquiries since the law was enacted, but Nankivell said the numbers are not huge according to Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada.\n",
      "\t“So we haven’t seen a big surge. We’ve seen a couple of small spikes in inquiries about a year ago when the protests were at their peak in the fall of 2019 and around July 1, with the passage of the national security law,” he told committee members.\n",
      "\t“There’s a definite trend, but the increases are very modest.”\n",

      "\tThe discovery of a five-eyed shrimp-like creature that lived about 520 million years ago may end a long-running debate about the evolution of Earth's most common animals.\n",
      "\tArthropods, ranging from lobsters and crabs to spiders and millipedes, make up around 80 percent of all animal species alive today and are characterised by their hard exoskeleton.\n",
      "\tBut their evolution has long remained something of a mystery, because their ancient ancestors carry a variety of features that their modern counterparts do not.\n",
      "\tEnter Kylinxia zhangi, a shrimp-like creature preserved in fossils found in China's Yunnan province -- a discovery that researchers now say could be a key \"missing link\" in arthropod evolution.\n",
      "\tLike today's arthropods, Kylinxia had a hard shell, a segmented body and legs with joints.\n",
      "\tBut the ancient creature also had characteristics in common with even older animals, leading researchers to name it after the \"Kylin\", a creature in traditional Chinese mythology with attributes from a variety of animals.\n",
      "\tFirst there are those eyes -- three smaller ones in a row on its head, with two larger ones directly behind.\n",
      "\tIt might sound bizarre, but it's a feature scientists have seen before, in an ancient creature called Opabinia, known informally as a \"weird wonder\".\n",
      "\tAnd the Kylinxia's two spiky front appendages, researchers say, are reminiscent of another creature thought to be an arthropod ancestor: the Anomalocaris.\n",
      "\tWhile both have been theorized as precursors to modern arthropods, an evolutionary gap in the fossil record made that difficult to prove -- until this week.\n",
      "\t\"Kylinxia represents a crucial transitional fossil predicted by Darwin's evolutionary theory,\" said Han Zeng, first author of a study published in the journal Nature on Wednesday.\n",
      "\t\"It bridges the evolutionary gap from Anomalocaris to true arthropods and forms a key 'missing link' in the origin of arthropods,\" added Zeng, a researcher at the Nanjing Institute of Geology and Paleontology (NIGPAS), in a press release.\n",
      "\tIn fact, when the first of the fossils was revealed, only its front legs were visible, and researchers assumed it was another specimen of Anomalocaris, said Diying Huang, a professor at NIGPAS.\n",
      "\t\"It looked strange, like a frontal appendage of Anomalocaris attached to the body of a common arthropod,\" Huang, the study's corresponding author, told AFP.\n",
      "\t\"After careful preparation... I knew it was a new and very important arthropod.\"\n",
      "\tPart of the value of Kylinxia lies in the unusual detail preserved in the fossils.\n",
      "\t\"The Kylinxia fossils exhibit exquisite anatomical structures,\" said Fangchen Zhao, co-author of the study.\n",
      "\t\"For example, nervous tissue, eyes, and digestive system -- these are soft body parts we usually cannot see in conventional fossils.\"\n",

      "\tDemocrat Mark Kelly won the Arizona Senate seat once held by John McCain, riding Arizona's changing electorate to flip a Republican Senate seat in a state long dominated by the GOP.\n",
      "\tArizona will send two Democrats to the Senate for the first time in nearly 70 years when Kelly joins Kyrsten Sinema in Washington.\n",
      "\tKelly, a former astronaut, defeated Republican Martha McSally, who was appointed to the seat by GOP Gov. Doug Ducey after McCain's death in 2018.\n",
      "\tIn his first run for political office, Kelly positioned himself as a pragmatic centrist with no patience for Washington partisanship. When the coronavirus pandemic struck, he retreated to mostly online outreach, minimizing face-to-face campaigning while blasting McSally and President Donald Trump for allowing the pandemic to get out of control.\n",
      "\t“The work starts now. And we desperately need Washington to work for Arizona,” Kelly told a small group of family and reporters gathered for his victory speech in Tucson. “My top priority is making sure we have a plan to slow the spread of this virus, and then getting Arizona the resources our state needs right now.”\n",
      "\tKelly flew four space shuttle missions and leaned heavily on his NASA background in campaign ads and speeches, but he's perhaps best known in Arizona as the husband of former Democratic U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, who was shot in the head in an assassination attempt during a constituent event in Tucson in 2011.\n",
      "\tGiffords introduced Kelly when he launched his campaign, appeared in a television ad for him and joined him at events for supporters in the campaign's closing days.\n",
      "\tMcSally did not speak publicly, nor did she concede.\n",
      "\t“Hundreds of thousands of votes have still not been counted,” McSally's spokeswoman, Caroline Anderegg, said in an email. “Every Arizonan deserves to have their voice heard and vote counted. We continue to monitor returns. The voters of Arizona decide this election, not media outlets.”\n",
      "\tAn influx of new voters in the fast-growing suburbs of Phoenix and extensive get-out-the-vote effort in the Latino communities in Phoenix and Tucson helped put Arizona, a longtime Republican stronghold, in play for Democrats. The trend accelerated with a shift away from the GOP among white suburban women who turned against Trump.\n",
      "\tThe 2018 victory of Sinema, the first Democrat to win an Arizona Senate seat in 30 years, illustrated the changing nature of the state.\n",
      "\tMcSally was a trailblazing woman in the U.S. Air Force - the first woman to fly in combat and to lead a fighter squadron. More recently, she revealed a darker side of her military career, disclosing last year that she was raped by a superior officer.\n",
      "\tKelly flew combat missions for the Navy during Operation Desert Storm before becoming a test pilot and later an astronaut. He flew four missions to the International Space Station. After Giffords was shot, the couple founded a group that works to elect lawmakers who support gun control.\n",
      "\tKelly had a big fundraising advantage, outraising McSally by more than $30 million through Oct. 14. Both candidates shattered fundraising records for Arizona, raising more than $146 million between them, more than triple the combined spending on the 2018 McSally-Sinema race. Independent groups spent tens of millions more to sway voters.\n",
      "\tThat money flooded airwaves, websites and mailboxes with ads.\n",
      "\tDemocrats portrayed Kelly as an independent thinker not beholden to either party. They slammed McSally's votes to repeal the federal health care law, which they said would make it expensive, if not impossible, for people with preexisting conditions to get health care coverage.\n",
      "\tRepublicans presented McSally as a tough-minded fighter on behalf of Arizona residents. They targeted Kelly's business ties to China, pointing to an investment from a Chinese firm in a business Kelly co-founded and alleging he would “do anything for a buck and say anything for a vote.”\n",
      "\tMcSally also tried to deflate Kelly's independent image by linking him to left-wing members of his party, such as Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar.\n",
      "\tShe warned that a Kelly victory could give Democrats control of the Senate and usher in liberal priorities such as Medicare for all and the Democratic Green New Deal climate plan, though Kelly has said he opposes both.\n",
      "\tKelly will take office as early as Nov. 30, finish the last two years of McCain's term and then face reelection in 2022.\n",

      "\tRegulators suspended Ant Group's record-setting $34.5 billion stock offering two days before trading was due to start in order to \"maintain the stability of the capital market\" and protect investors, a foreign ministry spokesman, Zhao Lijian, said Wednesday.\n",

      "\tThe planned market launch of Ant, spun off from Alibaba Group, the world's biggest e-commerce company by sales volume, symbolized China's rebound and added to a string of smaller offerings by biotech and other new companies. In an unusual move, it was due to trade in both Shanghai for mainland investors and in Hong Kong for international buyers.\n",
      "\tA brief official announcement Tuesday cited regulatory changes. It gave no details, but authorities have tightened controls on lending by online finance platforms and raised the amount of capital they must have.\n",
      "\tThe abrupt action might make investors more cautious about China, said Shaun Rein of China Market Research Group in Shanghai, whose clients include hedge funds and institutional investors. He said they are left to wonder whether regulators were worried about risks or acted out of irritation at Ant founder Jack Ma, China's richest entrepreneur, who publicly complained they hamper innovation.\n",
      "\t\"Whatever it is, it doesn't make the system look good,\" Rein said. \"It makes a lot of global institutional investors more nervous about investing into China.\"\n",
      "\tAnt said Wednesday it will return subscription fees to investors, suggesting it might be some time before the company is allowed to offer shares to the public.\n",
      "\tThe ruling party is trying to make the state-dominated financial system more market-oriented and increase access to lending for entrepreneurs who generate most of China's jobs and wealth. At the same time, it wants to reduce risks due to surging debt that could imperil its financial system. Rating agencies have cut Bejiing's credit rating for government borrowing.\n",
      "\tThe latest debacle reflects the collision between those official worries and the ambitions of Ma, who founded Alibaba in 1999 to connect Chinese suppliers with Western customers. It has expanded into consumer e-commerce, film production and other industries.\n",
      "\tMa launched an online payments service, Alipay, in 2004 to facilitate sales in a society where few people had credit cards.\n",
      "\tAlipay was split off from Alibaba in 2011 and evolved into Ant Group. In addition to Alipay, Ant operates one of the world's biggest money market funds and Sesame Credit, a credit rating system. The company was valued at $150 billion after a 2018 round of fundraising, more valuable than all but the biggest global banks.\n",
      "\tAnt helped to fuel an online borrowing boom that has pushed up household debt.\n",
      "\t\"Ant ended up being a poster child for potentially excessive borrowing,\" said Martin Chorzempa of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.\n",
      "\tAnt Group has invested in payments providers in Southeast Asia and Europe. Last year, it bought British payments company WorldFirst.\n",
      "\tAnt promotes itself as a technology company, not a financial institution, but this week's action suggests regulators rejected that.\n",
      "\tMa irked regulators when he said at a recent financial forum that their focus on risk hampers innovation, according to Chinese media.\n",
      "\t\"Jack Ma needs a refresher on how financial regulation works,\" said the business news magazine Caixin.\n",
      "\tAt the same forum in Shanghai, Chinese Vice-President Wang Qishan said new technologies increased efficiency and convenience but \"amplified financial risks,\" according to Caixin.\n",
      "\tAnt and other private sector, consumer-oriented online finance platforms are making inroads into an industry dominated by state-owned banks that were set up to support government companies, not serve the public.\n",
      "\tAnt needs to improve management in some areas to match traditional businesses, said Guo Tianyong, a banking specialist at the Central University of Finance and Economics in Beijing.\n",
      "\t\"They're similar to a bank's credit card business, but internal management isn't as good as banks,\" said Guo. \"Of course, we don't question the quality of Ant Group. But the government must be sure that a company should be operating in compliance with regulation.\"\n",
      "\tAnt and some others connect borrowers to state banks. But they also squeeze state institutions by allowing entrepreneurs and consumers to shop for higher deposit rates or lower-priced services.\n",
      "\tAnt has been \"taking away market share from the commercial banks,\" said Francis Lun, CEO of Geo Securities Ltd. in Hong Kong.\n",
      "\tThe government \"stepped in to protect its own interests,\" said Lun.\n",
      "\t\"The state cannot allow these tech-run financial institutions to grow bigger than the commercial banks and not be subject to any regulatory requirements,\" he said.\n",
      "\tAt a more basic level, such platforms also are changing the way capital flows through the state-dominated economy.\n",
      "\t\"It's hard for regulators to get comfortable with the scale of these emerging players,\" said Duncan Clark, chairman of BDA China, a research firm, and author of the book \"Alibaba: The House that Jack Ma Built.\"\n",
      "\t\"Innovation takes a back seat to stability,\" said Clark. \"Also, the party superstructure builds in strong links between state-owned banks and the regulators.\"\n",
      "\tInvestors were shocked and dismayed. They had been looking forward to the hottest IPO of the year at a time when Western economies are struggling.\n",
      "\t\"This reminds us of how unpredictable China is,\" said Au Yeung, who works in finance in Hong Kong. Au said she aside 160,000 Hong Kong dollars ($21,000), most of her savings, to buy Ant shares.\n",
      "\tZhang Yuan, a bank employee in Shenzhen, near Hong Kong, said she paid 34,400 yuan ($5,100) for 500 shares of Ant Group. She expressed shock at the suspension but confidence in Ant Group.\n",
      "\t\"I am optimistic about Ant Group. It is an innovative company with a good future,\" said Zhang, 39. \"We ordinary investors may not know something, but we are still optimistic about the company's future development.\"\n",
      "\tThe decision also might rattle Chinese entrepreneurs who were considering selling shares on their own country's market, said Rein.\n",
      "\t\"Until yesterday, every entrepreneur I talked to wanted to go public in the mainland, because they thought valuations would be better, and it might make them look better in front of the government,\" said Rein. \"Now, after Jack Ma, I'm not sure what they're going to do.\"\n",

      "\tChina vowed Wednesday that it will make a \"proper and necessary response\" if the U.S. proceeds with its latest planned arms sale to Taiwan.\n",
      "\tForeign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said the sale of US$600 million in armed drones to the island \"brutally interferes in China's internal affairs and seriously undermines China's sovereignty and security interests.\"\n",
      "\tThe U.S. should cancel all such sales to Taiwan \"so as to avoid further damage to China-U.S. relations and peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait,\" Wang told reporters at a daily briefing.\n",
      "\tChina, which claims Taiwan as its own territory, will make a \"proper and necessary response according to the development of the situation,\" Wang said.\n",
      "\tThe State Department said Tuesday it had greenlighted Taiwan's purchase of four \"weapons ready\" remotely piloted aircraft and related equipment, the latest in a series of arms transfers for the island.\n",
      "\tIn its announcement, the department said the proposed sale \"serves U.S. national, economic, and security interests by supporting the recipient's continuing efforts to modernize its armed forces and to maintain a credible defensive capability.\"\n",
      "\tJust last week, the administration approved plans for a $2.37 billion sale of Harpoon missile systems to Taiwan. That came hours after Beijing had announced sanctions on U.S. defence contractors, including Boeing, the lead contractor on the Harpoon deal, over a previous weapons deal.\n",
      "\tChina's ruling Communist Party threatens to use force to annex Taiwan, which it has regarded as a breakaway province since the sides split amid civil war in 1949. Washington maintains only unofficial ties with Taipei in deference to Beijing but remains the islands most important source of weaponry and is legally bound to ensure its armed forces can mount an adequate defence.\n",
      "\tChinese-U.S. relations have plunged to their lowest level in decades amid disputes about security, technology, the coronavirus pandemic and human rights. At the same time, China has stepped up military flights into Taiwanese airspace in what it calls a warning to the pro-independence administration of President Tsai Ing-wen, further bolstering bipartisan political support for Taiwan in the U.S.\n",

Now that an inflection point in Trump's time in office is at hand with Tuesday's U.S. election, what's at stake if his presidency ends -- or if it continues?

      "\tFar-right President Jair Bolsonaro has made no secret of his preferred winner, openly declaring support for Donald Trump after U.S. and Brazilian officials last month signed a trade facilitation agreement and then a deal for up to $1 billion in financing from the U.S. Export-Import bank.\n",
      "\t“I hope, if it is God's will, to appear at the inauguration of the president soon to be reelected in the U.S.,” Bolsonaro said with a smile on Oct. 20. “I don't need to hide that. It's from the heart.”\n",
      "\tLike Trump, Bolsonaro rode a populist wave to election, often appearing to take cues from his U.S. counterpart as he pledged to restore Christian values, squash the radical left and root out corruption. Local political analysts have speculated that the U.S. election could be a bellwether for sustained domestic support of Brazil's crusading strongman.\n",
      "\tOne issue that looms large for Brazil is destruction of the Amazon rainforest. Trump has kept silent, but its protection would be front and centre for a Joe Biden administration, according to Anya Prusa, a senior associate at the Woodrow Wilson International Center's Brazil Institute. That was underscored by Biden singling out Brazil during the first presidential debate, saying it should face consequences if it fails to curb deforestation.\n",
      "\tBolsonaro, who has staunchly defended Brazil's sovereignty over the Amazon, shot back that Biden's comment “clearly signals that he wants to give up a cordial and profitable coexistence.”\n",
      "\tOn the election's eve, Bolsonaro took to Twitter to deny a report he had contacted Biden's team or asked his ambassador to the U.S. to do so. And on Tuesday, he suggested there are strong suspicions foreign powers might try to interfere in the U.S. election - and with his own reelection bid in 2022.\n",

      "\tWhile Joe Biden was part of an administration that reestablished diplomatic ties with Cuba, loosened travel restrictions and made it easier for Cubans in the United States to send money home, President Donald Trump has increased sanctions on companies that do business with the island's government and even banned Americans from staying in Cuban state-owned hotels.\n",
      "\tIf re-elected, Trump has vowed to increase sanctions on Cuba's socialist government in a bid to starve it of funds and spark political changes in the single-party state.\n",
      "\t“This is the first election in a long time where there is a clear chasm in both candidates' plans for Cuba,” said Carlos Alzugaray, a former Cuban diplomat and political analyst. “With Trump, there will be more embargo, more hostility and four very difficult years ahead. With Biden, we will likely return to Obama's policies.”\n",
      "\tUpon taking office, Trump began to turn around policy toward Cuba with measures favoured by conservative exiles in Southern Florida. Cruise ship travel to Cuba was banned last year, along with educational travel. Shipping companies that took oil to Cuba from Venezuela were threatened with sanctions, along with banks that lent money to the government.\n",
      "\tThe island's government has not buckled under the pressure, but Trump's measures have impacted the country's citizens, who have faced shortages of food, medicines and gas as the government runs out of money for imports.\n",
      "\t“He has not been good for us” said Daniel Martinez, a 51-year-old entrepreneur. “But no matter who wins, we need to improve our economy and stop depending on whether Americans are good or bad.”\n",
      "\tAlzugaray said that some initial steps Biden could take to normalize relations would be sending an ambassador to Cuba, reestablishing co-operation agreements in areas like science and restarting consular activities, none of which would need congressional approval.\n",

      "\tAngry winemakers across France hope that a change in U.S. president could lead to a change of heart on the crippling import duties.\n",
      "\tThe French Federation of Wine Exporters said recently that American imports of French still wines fell by 35% during the first eight months the tariffs were in place, representing nearly 415 million euros ($500 million) in lost sales. The tariffs were levied as part of a 16-year-old dispute over government subsidies for the European multinational aircraft maker Airbus.\n",
      "\tDominique Piron, president of the trade body Inter Beaujolais, thinks a Biden administration could change the dispute's dynamics.\n",
      "\t“Under a President Biden, I hope that governments would be able to talk around a table in dialogue and not fire off tweets to decide things,” he said. “The wine industry will be better off with Biden as he seems more reliable and less aggressive. But who knows?”\n",
      "\tPiron acknowledged a possible difficulty with either leader: Both proclaim themselves to be teetotallers.\n",

      "\tThe outcome of the U.S. election is being closely watched in the two Balkan countries, where many think the next American leader could be critical to helping the foes find a lasting peace.\n",
      "\tKosovo prefers “a president who would cultivate good ties with Europe because Kosovo is a project of both of them, the U.S. and the European Union,” according to independent Kosovo analyst Evliana Berani.\n",
      "\tEarlier this year, Trump's envoy negotiated a trade deal between Serbia and Kosovo that was signed at the White House. But the agreement did not solve the key issue weighing on relations between the two countries: Serbia's refusal to recognize Kosovo's independence, proclaimed in 2008.\n",
      "\tThat did not stop Trump from taking the credit for ending the bloodshed between the two Balkan nations, although their war ended more than two decades ago. Trump told his supporters at rallies last week that the agreement “saved a lot of lives.”\n",
      "\tIn fact, Biden was among those who contributed to the end of the Kosovo war that left at least 10,000 dead. As a U.S. senator in 1999, Biden supported NATO airstrikes against Serbia that stopped its bloody crackdown against Kosovo Albanian separatists - something Serbs nationalists are unlikely to forgive anytime soon.\n",

      "\t“We are going to have a single policy -- dialogue, dialogue and dialogue -- with whoever wins in the United States,” Maduro said. “We hope to overcome obstacles imposed by imperialist policies.”\n",
      "\tStrained relations with the last five U.S. presidents completely broke down under Trump, who has pressed to rid Venezuela of Maduro, labeling him a “dictator.”\n",
      "\tTrump closed the U.S. embassy in Caracas, backing Juan Guaido, head of Venezuela's congress, as the nation's legitimate leader. He also hit Maduro with sweeping financial sanctions, and justice officials indicted him as a narcoterrorist, carrying a $15 million reward for his capture.\n",
      "\tLuis Vicente Leon, president of the Caracas-based polling firm Datanalisis, said a second-term Trump might recognize his failure to force out Maduro and chart a new strategy, potentially inviting Maduro to negotiate his exit.\n",
      "\tIf Biden wins, he likely wouldn't lift the sanctions, but could move to decrease the pain they cause average Venezuelans with moves like allowing in humanitarian aid or gasoline, Leon said.\n",

      "\tLopez Obrador has shown a surprising ability to get along with President Donald Trump, who as a candidate four years ago famously said Mexico was sending rapists and criminals to the U.S. The two leaders see themselves as outsiders and are fond of populist rhetoric, despite coming from opposite ends of the political spectrum.\n",
      "\tRaymundo Barraza Gomez, who owns and runs a jewelry shop in the border city of Tijuana, recalls the concern and uncertainty business owners felt when Donald Trump was elected four years ago.\n",
      "\t\"At the beginning of his administration, we expected economic matters toward Mexico to be a lot tougher,\" Barraza said. \"However, throughout all this time, it hasn't been that bad.\"\n",
      "\tA Biden administration could offer more certainty to young Mexicans who were brought to the U.S. illegally as children and received protection from the Obama administration. Biden also has promised to end Trump's Migrant Protection Protocols, commonly known as \"Remain in Mexico,\" which forced thousands of asylum seekers to wait in Tijuana and other Mexican border cities while their asylum cases were processed in the U.S.\n",

      "\tRussian President Vladimir Putin is frustrated with President Donald Trump's failure to deliver on his promise to fix ties between the countries. But Democratic challenger Joe Biden does not offer the Kremlin much hope either.\n",
      "\tU.S. officials say Russia interfered in the 2016 election in an effort to help Trump beat Democrat Hillary Clinton. But the Kremlin has been bitterly disappointed with Trump's tenure, which saw multiple rounds of bruising sanctions against Moscow.\n",
      "\tStill, American intelligence officials believe Russia is using a variety of measures to denigrate Biden and that individuals linked to the Kremlin are boosting Trump's reelection bid -- though Putin has repeatedly denied meddling.\n",
      "\tPutin has tried to hedge his bets. Bemoaning what he called Biden's \"sharp anti-Russian rhetoric,\" the Russian leader has praised the nominee's promise to extend the last remaining U.S.-Russian nuclear arms control pact, something that Trump's administration has been reluctant to do.\n",
      "\tIn another sign of flirting with the Democratic camp, Putin also said he didn't see \"anything criminal\" about Biden's son's business dealings in Ukraine, refusing to back Trump's favourite line of attack against his opponent.\n",
      "\t\"Biden's chances of winning look strong enough for Russia to start preparing for that,\" Tatiana Stanovaya, a political scholar with the Carnegie Moscow Center, said in a recent commentary. \"The negative consequences of the Trump presidency and disappointment in him have led to a more sober and pragmatic approach.\"\n",

      "\tOn the eve of the U.S. presidential election, leaders of Israeli settlers in the West Bank gathered in the biblical city of Hebron to pray for victory for President Donald Trump.\n",
      "\tIt was a highly symbolic move by the settlers, who have been among the biggest beneficiaries of the president's Mideast policies.\n",
      "\tMonday's gathering took place in front of a holy site revered by Jews and Muslims as the burial place of the biblical patriarch Abraham, a gesture to the Trump-brokered deals between Israel and Arab countries known as the \"Abraham Accords.\"\n",
      "\t\"We are grateful for his first term, and we pray that he may be elected for another four years of blessed endeavours,\" said Rabbi Hillel Horowitz, mayor of Hebron's ultranationalist Jewish community.\n",
      "\tIt was almost certainly the first time settler leaders, long ostracized by the U.S., have publicly prayed for victory for a sitting American president.\n",
      "\tBut Trump is unlike any of his predecessors. He has embraced Israel's religious and nationalist right wing and showered Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu with a string of diplomatic gifts: withdrawing from the Iran nuclear deal, recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital, offering a Mideast plan that would allow Israel to annex large swaths of the West Bank, including all of its settlements.\n",
      "\tNetanyahu, while careful not to openly take sides, made little secret of his preference when he said this week he hopes Trump's policies \"will continue in the coming years.\" The Palestinians, sidelined and humiliated by Trump, have been even clearer that they are pulling for Joe Biden.\n",
      "\tThe Democratic challenger has already signalled he will scrap Trump's approach toward Iran and the Palestinians. That has raised concerns in Israel, especially on the right.\n",
      "\tElie Pieprz, an American-Israeli consultant who lives in the Karnei Shomron settlement, said Trump has been a \"tremendous success\" by rejecting policies of the past. He said, if Biden wins, he hopes he will \"learn the proper lessons.\"\n",

      "\tBut for their government, the election is all about the recent military and diplomatic convergence between the two countries to counter their shared rival China.\n",
      "\tDespite some friction over trade issues, the India-U.S. relationship has steadily strengthened in security and defenceco-operation in the last four years. It has largely been defined by public displays of bonhomie between President Donald Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, both seen as populists.\n",
      "\tModi's second term has been marked by many convulsions at home: widening social strife, policies that discriminate against Muslims and the rising intolerance against minorities. Trump has mostly chosen to ignore them, partly as an effort to woo Indian American voters.\n",
      "\tBy contrast, Democratic challenger Joe Biden and running mate Harris have been vocal about Modi's hardline Hindu-nationalist policies, including his administration's decision to revoke disputed Kashmir's semiautonomous powers. Should they win, India might expect to come under more pressure internationally for such policies.\n",

      "\tWith the talks in disarray, the election could have serious implications for North Korea's relentless pursuit of an arsenal capable of targeting U.S. allies and the American homeland.\n",
      "\tPresident Donald Trump's three summits with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un since 2018 -- which South Korea helped set up -- brought a temporary lull to tensions.\n",
      "\tBut negotiations -- which seek to exchange an easing of crippling U.S.-led sanctions for disarmament steps by the North -- have now stalled.\n",
      "\tIf Trump is reelected, some experts say the North would try to resume the summits. North Korea prefers a summit-driven process, which gives it a better shot at winning instant concessions, such as Trump's surprise agreement to cease major U.S. military exercises with South Korea after his first meeting with Kim.\n",
      "\tDemocratic challenger Joe Biden, whom North Korea's state media has called a \"rabid dog\" after he accused Trump of cozying up to dictators, has endorsed an approach that starts with meetings between lower-level officials. He has also demanded that the North show genuine willingness to abandon its nuclear weapons and missiles.\n",
      "\tSome analysts say the North could try to pressure a Biden administration by resuming tests of nuclear warheads and long-range missiles it halted during its diplomacy with Trump. In a recent military parade in Pyongyang, Kim revealed a slew of new weapons, including what appeared to be North Korea's biggest intercontinental ballistic missile yet.\n",
      "\tSouth Korea, meanwhile, has struggled to deal with Trump, who has been less wedded to historic alliances than his predecessors. Trump has constantly complained about the cost of having 28,500 U.S. troops stationed in South Korea. A cost-sharing agreement expired in 2019, and the two sides have failed to agree on a replacement.\n",

      "\tIt's all about trade for China -- and trade is about hitting economic growth targets at home and being a technology leader abroad.\n",
      "\tThe stormy commercial relationship between the world's two biggest economies since President Donald Trump took office is front and centre in China's view of the U.S. election. While a win for Democratic challenger Joe Biden offers no guarantee of relief, Beijing hopes to avoid a further deterioration and see negotiations put on an even keel.\n",
      "\t\"People are concerned. They want to know what their future is to be,\" said investor and prominent blogger Ding Chenling. \"Whoever is the U.S. president has no choice: They will have to do business with China.\"\n",
      "\tTrump seized on longstanding concerns about Chinese commercial espionage, the forced handover of technology, and state subsidies for Chinese companies. He elevated them into a high-stakes tariff war launched in 2018, and last year tightened controls on Chinese purchases of computer chips and other high-tech components.\n",
      "\tThat could place a drag on China's ambitions to be a global leader in cutting edge technologies and build, as it calls it, a \"moderately prosperous society\" at home, although the loss of access to U.S. technology is also motivating a drive for self-sufficiency.\n",
      "\tMeanwhile, Trump's vow that China would pay for allegedly cheating the U.S. consumer has yet to yield more balanced trade.\n",
      "\tSeptember exports to the U.S. rose 20.5% over a year ago to $44 billion as China's factories continued to assemble most of the world's smartphones, personal computers and consumer electronics, along with much of the clothing, housewares and toys sold in the U.S.\n",
      "\tThat means that, despite disruptions from trade tension and the pandemic, the ruling Communist Party is likely to hit its economic targets for the time being. Still, calming the stormy seas of trade could provide the long-term assurance Beijing's leaders seek.\n",
      "\t\"I believe Joe Biden would ease relations,\" said Qu Zhan, a Beijing health care worker.\n",
      "------\n",
      "\tThe next U.S. president could reshape the country's relationship with President Rodrigo Duterte, who leads a key American treaty ally in Asia -- but presents a dilemma.\n",
      "\tDuterte has been regarded by international watchdogs as a human rights calamity for his notorious anti-drug crackdown that has left thousands of mostly poor suspects dead. He has been accused of undermining one of Asia's most vibrant democracies -- an American legacy.\n",
      "\tKnown for his expletive-laced outbursts, the 75-year-old leader is hypersensitive to criticism of his so-called war on drugs. He once told then-President Barack Obama in a speech to \"go to hell.\"\n",
      "\tUnlike his predecessor, President Donald Trump has not publicly raised red flags over Duterte's brutal campaign. Trump's gambit won him cozier ties with Duterte, who called on Filipino Americans in March to vote Republican, saying, \"you are getting the best deal with Trump.\"\n",
      "\tBut the Filipino leader has pressed on with his anti-U.S. broadsides while nurturing ties with China and Russia. In February, his government notified Washington of its intent to terminate a key security pact, although he later delayed the effect of that decision.\n",
      "\t\"Do we need America to survive as a nation?\" he asked. He essentially said, no.\n",
      "\tWhile a Trump reelection would likely mean business as usual for Duterte, a Biden presidency carries the prospect of a stronger U.S. pushback against Duterte at the risk of further alienating the leader of a crucial ally with less than two years left in office.\n",

      "CONTENT : HONG KONG -- \n",
      "\tThe planned stock market debut of the world's biggest online finance company, Ant Group, was suspended in Shanghai and Hong Kong on Tuesday, disrupting a record-setting US$34.5 billion initial public offering that highlighted China's recovery from the coronavirus pandemic.\n",
      "\tThe Shanghai stock exchange cited regulatory changes in Ant's industry and a possible failure to meet disclosure requirements but gave no details. Ant said later it would suspend its Hong Kong debut due to the Shanghai suspension. Shares were to have started trading on both exchanges Thursday.\n",
      "\tThe suspension followed a Monday meeting between regulators and Ant executives including founder Jack Ma, China's richest entrepreneur. Ma also founded Alibaba Group, the world's biggest e-commerce company by sales volume, which spun off its Alipay payments service to create the company that became Ant Group.\n",
      "\t“Views regarding the health and stability of the financial sector were exchanged,” Ant Group said in a prepared statement. The company said it was “committed to implementing the meeting opinions” but gave no details.\n",
      "\t“We will continue to improve our capabilities to provide inclusive services and promote economic development to improve the lives of ordinary citizens,” the company said.\n",
      "\tAnt apologized to investors and said it would wait for notice from regulators about further developments. U.S.-traded shares of Alibaba closed Tuesday down more than 8 per cent, matching the company's largest percentage decline since its first day of trading on the New York Stock Exchange.\n",
      "\tAnt operates Alipay, the world's biggest financial technology company and, along with Tencent's WeChat Pay, one of two dominant electronic payment systems in China.\n",
      "\tIn a joint statement, the Chinese central bank, securities regulator and other agencies said Monday they had “regulatory interviews” with Ma, Ant Group chairman Eric Jing and president Hu Xiaoming.\n",
      "\tIt was hoped that Ant's debut would put a spotlight on the economic rebound of China, the first major economy to return to growth after the coronavirus pandemic began last December.\n",
      "\tThe decision to go public on exchanges in both Shanghai and Hong Kong reflected the evolving nature of China's fast-growing financial markets and their relationship to fledgling private sector corporate giants such as Ant and Alibaba.\n",
      "\tMainland markets are off-limits to most foreign investors and until recently were used mostly to raise money for state-owned industry. Private sector companies and those that wanted access to foreign investors sold shares in Hong Kong, New York or other offshore centres. Alibaba went public in New York rather than on a mainland exchange.\n",
      "\tMore recently, the ruling Communist Party has been encouraging use of mainland markets to raise money for private sector companies that generate most of China's jobs and wealth and to give Chinese investors a chance to profit from their growth.\n",
      "\tAnt's earlier announcement of its plan cited “innovative measures” in Shanghai and Hong Kong, which created separate trading boards for tech stocks. It said “leading edge technology companies” would have “greater access to the capital markets.”\n",
      "\tMa founded Alibaba in 1999 to help link Chinese wholesalers with foreign retailers. Alipay was created to facilitate payments in an economy where few people had credit cards.\n",
      "\tAlibaba currently owns one-third of Ant Group.\n",
      "\tAlipay was transferred in 2011 from Alibaba Group to a company controlled by Ma. That prompted complaints Ma failed to inform shareholders including Yahoo Inc. and Japan's Softbank.\n",
      "\tAlibaba said the move was required to comply with Chinese regulations, but some financial analysts said the company was paid too little. The dispute was later resolved by Alibaba, Yahoo and Softbank.\n",
      "\tAlipay became a freestanding company in 2014 and was renamed Ant Financial. It was renamed Ant Group ahead of its stock market debut.\n",
      "\tAnt Group's shares were due to begin trade in Hong Kong and Shanghai on Thursday after it raised at least $34.5 billion. Retail investors in Shanghai placed bids for nearly $3 trillion worth of shares.\n",
      "\tThe company has come under increased scrutiny and tighter regulation as it expanded the range of financial technology services it offers. Among the new regulations are caps on the use of asset-backed securities to fund consumer loans, new capital and licensing requirements and caps on lending rates.\n",
      "\tOn Monday, the central bank raised the minimum required capital for lenders such as Ant to a 5 billion yuan ($750 million).\n",

      "\t“It only got worse and now it's completely dead,” said Montreal Chinatown Development Council president Sherry Ao.\n",
      "\t“Even our western clients who come to our salon, they get criticized by their friends. 'Why are you going to Chinatown, are you crazy?'” said Sasa Salon owner Kate Lau.\n",
      "\tIn a bid to combat the intolerance, Chinese restaurants are handing out thousands of fortune cookies loaded with messages of love and acceptance with takeout orders. One example of a fortune is “The wise practice social distancing, not racial discrimination.”\n",
      "\tChang said the messages double as an effort to encourage the neighbourhood's businesses.\n",
      "\t“We encourage those who get the fortune cookies to hold on to their little fortunes, because that's going to entitle them to a 10 per cent discount the next time they order,” said Chang.  \n",

      "\tA federal judge has postponed President Donald Trump's threatened shutdown of the popular short-form video app TikTok, siding with a Pennsylvania comedian and two other TikTok creators who say Trump's order hampers their free speech.\n",
      "\tU.S. District Judge Wendy Beetlestone on Friday blocked an upcoming Commerce Department action that would have effectively banned TikTok in the U.S. by cutting it off from vital technical services.\n",
      "\tThe Trump administration has said TikTok is a security threat, citing its Chinese owner, ByteDance, and the possibility that the Chinese government could spy on users. Trump's executive order was set to take effect Nov. 12, but is now on hold as the lawsuit proceeds.\n",
      "\tThis is not the first court challenge to Trump's attempted crackdown on TikTok. Another federal judge in September postponed a Trump administration order that would have banned TikTok from smartphone app stores. In that case, lawyers for TikTok argued that the administration's app-store ban would infringe on First Amendment rights and do irreparable harm to the business.\n",
      "\tBut Beetlestone's case in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania was brought forth not by the company, but three of its users who've built a following on the app: Douglas Marland, a comedian from Pennsylvania's Bucks County, along with Southern California fashion designer Cosette Rinab and Connecticut musician Alec Chambers.\n",
      "\t“We are pleased that the judge has halted this ban, which exceeds the President's authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, namely portions of the Act that reflect our nation's deep commitment to free speech,” said their lawyer, Ambika Kumar Doran, in a prepared statement.\n",
      "\tThe Commerce Department and White House didn't immediately return requests for comment. The administration has said it is exercising Trump's emergency authority under the 1977 law enabling a president to regulate international commerce to address unusual threats.\n",
      "\tTikTok said in a statement Friday that it is “deeply moved by the outpouring of support from our creators, who have worked to protect their rights to expression, their careers, and to helping small businesses, particularly during the pandemic.”\n",

      "\tHate crime incidents across Vancouver have increased this year compared to 2019, with a dramatic spike in incidents targeting Asian communities specifically, a report presented to the city's police board Thursday says.\n",
      "\tAccording to the Vancouver Police Department's third key performance indicator report for the year, which looks at crime statistics for the first nine months of 2020, there's been a 116 per cent increase in hate crime incidents compared to the same time period in 2019. More specifically, anti-Asian hate crime incidents have seen an 878 per cent increase. \n",
      "\tDuring Thursday's meeting, the police board heard that in the first nine months of 2019, there were nine anti-Asian hate crime incidents. So far this year, there have been 88. \n",
      "\tDeputy Chief Const. Howard Chow called those \"really concerning numbers,\" during the meeting. Chow explained that police \"right away noticed some concerning trends\" when they began closely tracking hate crime incidents in the spring. \n",
      "\tAs a result, police issued several notices earlier in the year, warning of the uptick in hate crimes.  \n",
      "\tSome of the anti-Asian incidents police investigated included racial slurs or assaults. For example, Vancouver's Chinese Cultural Centre was repeatedly vandalized. Additionally, in March, police say a 92-year-old Asian man suffering from dementia was attacked at an East Vancouver convenience store.  \n",
      "\tAnd, in June, a poll conducted by Research Co. showed nearly one quarter of respondents of East or South Asian descent said they'd been the target of racial slurs or insults throughout the spring.  \n",
      "\t\"We met with a lot of associations, groups, benevolent associations in Chinatown to protect, raise awareness and also appropriately report these types of incidents,\" Chow said Thursday. \"There's been quite a bit of work on this.\"\n",
      "\tThe report presented Thursday also showed total assaults in the city have increased by 1.8 per cent, and every patrol district said it's experienced an increase in serious assaults this year. Police said intimate partner violence \"is at an all-time high,\" and such incidents are 4.6 per cent higher than last year.\n",
      "\t\"These files are very time-consuming for patrol officers, often consuming an entire shift,\" the report says.\n",
      "\tProperty crimes, however, are down 20 per cent, including a 37 per cent decrease in thefts from automobiles. \n",
      "\tOverall, the report says the COVID-19 pandemic has led to a \"historical anomaly\" in crime stats. \n",

      "\tA lab experiment aimed at fixing defective DNA in human embryos shows what can go wrong with this type of gene editing and why leading scientists say it's too unsafe to try. In more than half of the cases, the editing caused unintended changes, such as loss of an entire chromosome or big chunks of it.\n",
      "\tColumbia University researchers describe their work Thursday in the journal Cell. They used CRISPR-cas9, the same chemical tool that a Chinese scientist used on embryos in 2018 to help make the world's first gene-edited babies, which landed him in prison and drew international scorn.\n",
      "\tThe tool lets scientists cut DNA in a precise spot and has profound potential for good -- it's already used to raise better crops and livestock, holds promise for treating diseases and earned its discoverers a Nobel Prize earlier this month.\n",
      "\tBut using it on embryos, sperm or eggs makes changes that can pass to future generations. Several international panels of scientists and ethicists have said it's too soon to know whether that can be done safely, and the new Columbia work shows the possible harm.\n",
      "\t\"If our results had been known two years ago, I doubt that anyone would have gone ahead\" and tried it on embryos intended for pregnancy, said biologist Dieter Egli, who led the study.\n",
      "\tResearchers made 40 embryos with eggs from healthy donors and sperm from a man with a gene mutation -- a single letter missing in the DNA alphabet -- that causes blindness. Editing was aimed at adding the missing letter so the gene would work.\n",
      "\tIn some embryos, the editing was tried at fertilization, thought to be the best time for such attempts. Other embryos were edited when they contained two cells and were almost two days old. Cells then were analyzed at various stages of development to see how many had the mutation repaired.\n",
      "\tSurprisingly, it didn't work in any of the cells from embryos edited at fertilization. It only worked in three of the 45 cells from embryos edited at the later stage.\n",
      "\tIn many of the rest, \"what we found is that instead of the mutation being fixed, the chromosome carrying the mutation is gone\" -- a profound change that likely dooms the embryo, Egli said. Many other cells showed changes in other chromosomes that also could do harm.\n",
      "\tPrevious researchers who thought they had repaired a defect in embryos may have been misled into thinking they had succeeded because usual lab tests no longer detected the mutation. However, more extensive testing like what was done in this study shows that other changes could have happened, such as an entire chromosome being wiped out, Egli said.\n",
      "\tThe new work suggests that gene editing might hold promise for correcting disorders caused by an extra copy of a chromosome, such as Down syndrome. However, the danger revealed in the new study \"further affirms we are not ready, not even close\" to try this, Dr. Eric Topol wrote in an email.\n",
      "\t\"This takes the concerns that have already been expressed about human embryo editing to another level,\" added Topol, who heads the Scripps Research Translational Institute in San Diego and had no role in the new work.\n",
      "\tIn the U.S., federal funds can't be used for research on human embryos, so the Columbia researchers used private money from two foundations. Several of the scientists have ties to gene therapy or analysis companies.\n",

      "\tFinnish telecommunications company Nokia on Thursday reported improved third-quarter earnings largely in line with expectations, but acknowledged it faced challenges in the race for 5G cellular networks.\n",
      "\tNokia said it would invest more in the new generation of broadband technology and revamp business strategy under its new CEO, who said the company would do \"whatever it takes\" to achieve 5G leadership.\n",
      "\tThe company based in Espoo, Finland reported that net profit for the July-September period was up 14% to 305 million euros ($358 million). Sales were down 7% to 5.3 billion euros.\n",
      "\tThe quarterly report was the first one issued since CEO Pekka Lundmark took over the company's top spot on Aug. 1.\n",
      "\tHe said Thursday that \"more change is needed\" within Nokia, which has played catch-up with China's Huawei and Sweden's Ericsson in the 5G market. Last week, Ericsson reported upbeat third-quarter earnings that were helped by the rollout of 5G networks in China and a strong U.S. market.\n",
      "\t\"Our financial performance in 2021 is expected to be challenging,\" Lundmark said. \"We have lost share at one large North American customer, see some margin pressure in that market, and believe we need to further increase R&D investments to ensure leadership in 5G. In fact, we have decided that we will invest whatever it takes to win in 5G.\"\n",
      "\tNokia said Thursday it has secured 101 commercial 5G deals with 36 live networks, while Ericsson, respectively, said last week it had 112 commercial 5G agreements with 65 live networks. The Nordic duo is still trailing 5G global market leader Huawei.\n",
      "\tIn a call with reporters, Lundmark said Nokia was \"well placed\" to take advantage of bans imposed on some network equipment vendors, clearly pointing to Huawei and some other Chinese companies without naming them.\n",
      "\t\"Some of the geopolitical trends are opening up new opportunities,\" Lundmark said in the call. \"We understand that the safety and security of the network and the trustworthiness of the vendor is extremely important. It's going to be increasingly important in the future.\"\n",
      "\tHuawei has been banned by several governments from 5G networks over allegations it can allow the Chinese government to snoop on data. Huawei has denied the allegations. Sweden became latest European country last week to ban Huawei and ZTE, another Chinese network equipment provider, from its 5G networks.\n",
      "\tNokia also announced a new strategy, effective Jan. 1, where it will have four business groups consisting of mobile networks, fixed networks, cloud and network services, and the Nokia Technologies unit. Lundmark said Nokia would share details of the new strategy in December.\n",

      "\tLeaders of the ruling Communist Party made the announcement Thursday after a meeting to draft a development blueprint for the state-dominated economy over the next five years.\n",
      "\tPresident Xi Jinping's government is trying to limit damage from the Trump administration's curbs on technology sales to China in a fight over security and spying. Those threaten to disrupt plans to create Chinese companies able to compete in telecoms, biotech and other fields, which communist leaders see as a path to prosperity and global influence.\n",
      "\t\"Science and technology should be self-reliant as a strategic support for national development,\" said a party statement. It promised to \"accelerate the building of a science and technology power\" but gave no details.\n",
      "\tFive-Year Plans, issued since the 1950s, form the basis of regulation and industry initiatives in an economy where the ruling party still plays a leading role after four decades of market-style reforms. The full plan is due to be released in March. Changes in regulations and plans for individual industries will be announced after that.\n",
      "\tThursday's statement promised to promote \"green and low-carbon development\" and to raise Chinese living standards. It called for unspecified steps to strengthen the 2.3 million-member People's Liberation Army and to \" improve our strategic ability to defend national sovereignty.\"\n",
      "\tChina faces a \"complicated international situation,\" it said, but it made no mention of the coronavirus pandemic or its tariff war with Washington.\n",
      "\tTechnology is a cornerstone of the ruling party's marathon campaign to promote self-sustaining growth based on domestic consumer spending and to build a \"moderately prosperous society.\"\n",
      "\tChina's factories assemble most of the world's smartphones, personal computers and consumer electronics but need U.S., European and Japanese components. Its communist leaders see that as a strategic weakness.\n",
      "\tThursday's statement cited no specific technologies, but leaders are especially worried about China's reliance on U.S. providers of processor chips used in smartphones, electric cars and other technologies central to their development plans.\n",
      "\tSemiconductors are China's biggest single import by value, ahead of crude oil.\n",
      "\tCompanies including telecom equipment giant Huawei Technologies Ltd., China's first global tech brand, are developing chips and other components. But, like their Western and Asian counterparts, none can supply all its own needs.\n",
      "\tPresident Donald Trump's 2018 tariff hikes on Chinese goods over complaints Beijing steals or pressures companies to hand over technology have raised pressure for greater self-reliance.\n",
      "\tLast year, the White House added to that by tightening controls on Chinese purchases of chips and other components.\n",
      "\t\"The trade war and growing tensions with foreign governments have heightened concern about reliance on foreign inputs,\" Julian Evans-Pritchard and Seana Yue of Capital Economics said in a report ahead of Thursday's announcement.\n",
      "\t\"The push for self-sufficiency is increasingly visible,\" they wrote.\n",
      "\tLast year's U.S. curbs cut off access to chips and most other technology for Huawei. American officials say it might facilitate Chinese spying, an accusation the company denies. This year, Washington barred global manufacturers from using U.S. technology to produce chips for Huawei, including those designed by its own engineers. Huawei's revenue still rose 9.9% over a year earlier in the quarter ending in September, but executives say its sales of smartphones and network equipment are likely to suffer.\n",
      "\tIn September, the Commerce Department further obstructed Beijing's efforts to develop its own chipmakers by restricting U.S. technology sales to the biggest, Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp.\n",
      "\tEarlier industrial plans include \"Made in China 2025,\" issued in 2015, which calls for creating global competitors in 10 industries such as electric cars. That triggered an international backlash, as governments complained Beijing might use subsidies and market barriers to promote them, violating its free-trade commitments.\n",
      "\t\"For sectors that are already under U.S. blockades (such as semiconductors), China is likely to double down and strengthen government support,\" said Vincent Zhu of Rhodium Group in a report ahead of the party congress.\n",
      "\tHowever, a \"wish list\" of favoured businesses \"could easily be used as a U.S. `hit list,' further restricting exports of components critical to those industries,\" Zhu wrote. That means Beijing \"will have to think hard before committing to an overt industrial policy,\" he said.\n",
      "\tChinese semiconductor imports in 2020 should exceed $300 billion for a third straight year, according to the deputy chairman of the China Semiconductor Industry Association, Wei Shaojun, cited in Chinese news reports. The association says imports peaked at $312 billion in 2018. Last year's were $304 billion.\n",
      "\tLimits on access to foreign technology could knock as much as 0.5 percentage points off China's economic growth over the next decade, according to UBS economists Ning Zhang and Tao Wang.\n",
      "\tDespite disruptions from trade tension and the pandemic, forecasters say the Communist Party is likely to hit its economic targets from the previous Five-Year Plan.\n",

      "\tTaiwan hit 200 days without any domestically transmitted cases of COVID-19 on Thursday, highlighting the island's continued success at keeping the virus under control even as cases surge in other parts of the world.\n",
      "\tTaiwan's Center for Disease Control last reported a domestic case on April 12. CDC officials noted the milestone and thanked the public for playing a role, while urging people to continue to wear masks and to wash their hands often.\n",
      "\tSince the pandemic began, Taiwan has recorded 553 cases of COVID-19, and just seven deaths. While it has stopped domestic transmission, it continues to record new cases in people arriving from abroad.\n",
      "\tTaiwan has been pointed to as a success story in how to respond to the pandemic, especially considering its close business and tourism ties with China, where the virus first emerged late last year.\n",
      "\tQuestions remain, however, as to whether the island is truly free of the coronavirus. Local media has been paying close attention to reports of people who tested positive for COVID-19 after leaving Taiwan.\n",
      "\tAuthorities said Wednesday that they received notice from Japanese and Thai health authorities that three people who had recently left the island tested positive.\n",
      "\tYet Taiwan is still undoubtable a success in light of the global scale of the pandemic -- more than 44 million reported cases and 1.1 million deaths.\n",
      "\tIts success has in part been attributed to acting very early on.\n",
      "\tTaiwanese officials were checking passengers on flights from Wuhan, the Chinese city where the pandemic began, as early as Dec. 31 for fever and pneumonia symptoms, according to researchers writing in JAMA, a medical journal.\n",
      "\tOn Jan. 20, the government formally initiated the Central Epidemic Command Center to co-ordinate the government response between different departments and branches. The government also communicated effectively about the importance of wearing masks, while trying to prevent panic buying and price-gouging by rationing them.\n",
      "\tThe island was also quick to tighten its borders, suspending flights from Wuhan on Jan. 23, and banning the entry of Chinese nationals who reside in Wuhan.\n",
      "\tTaiwan has a strict 14-day quarantine for all arrivals, whether Taiwanese or foreign.\n",
      "\tProfessionals with technical expertise led the response and messaging, such as Taiwan's former Vice-President Chen Chien-jen, who is a trained-epidemiologist.\n",

      "\tVancouver Island's history is full of tales of women who were influencers, disruptors and trailblazers, but according to archivists at the Royal BC Museum, many of those stories rarely see the light of day.\n",
      "\t\"A lot of women's stories have been overlooked and their roles and perspectives have not been documented,\" says curator Tzu-L Chung. \n",
      "\tAs Women's History Month draws to a close, CTV News went deep into the British Columbia Archives to shine a light on the stories of island women who overcame so much to make their mark. \n",
      "Ellen Neel\n",
      "\tThe reverberations of Ellen Neel's life can be felt any time you see an Indigenous carving, enter a gift shop with Indigenous souvenirs, or see a young First Nations artist pushing the boundaries of their craft. \n",
      "\tBorn in the early 1900s in Alert Bay, Neel's passion for art flourished in the most difficult of settings. \n",
      "\t\"She was in residential school, and that is actually where she learned to carve,\" said Lou-Ann Neel, who is not only a historian with the Royal BC Museum, but also Neel's granddaughter. \n",
      "\n",
      "\tEncouraged to carve traditional poles by her father, at a time when women artists were not considered legitimate, Neel's talent quickly put her ahead of most men in the field. \n",
      "\tHer work would be sought out by art enthusiasts, museums and collectors around the world. \n",
      "\tEven in success, the Vancouver Island born Indigenous artist faced a constant onslaught of racism and sexism as she waded through the male dominated world of art in the mid-1900s. \n",
      "\t\"I have copies of newspaper articles that read, 'Mr. Neel with his wife assisting.' \" said Lou-Ann. \"It was this assumption that my grandfather was actually the carver.\"\n",
      "\tUndeterred, Neel broke barriers as she pushed for organizations like the Hudson's Bay Company to purchase handmade art from Indigenous artists and pay them appropriately. \n",
      "\tShe is considered a major influence in First Nations art being sold in a way which serves not to strip the art from the communities, but to preserve a living culture. \n",
      "Alma Russell\n",
      "\tThe preservation of British Columbia's history as we know it has a lot to do with Victoria's Alma Russell. \n",
      "\tIn the late-1800s, the young woman left the comfort of Vancouver Island and struck out in search of higher education. \n",
      "\tIn New York City, Russell would receive university-level training in library sciences. \n",
      "\tReturning home, Russell lived in rarified air.\n",
      "\tShe was the first person to be hired while having training as a librarian,\" said B.C. Archives curator India Young. \"She is really not just groundbreaking for a woman, but for anyone.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\tRussell became the first person in Western Canada to receive proper librarian training and was instantly hired by the First Provincial Librarian. \"It took decades for her to be offered a full-time job, to be paid adequately,\" said Young. \n",
      "\tFacing the hurdles so many women did in the workplace at the turn of the century, Russell charged on. \n",
      "\tShe was the first person to institute the use of the Dewey decimal system at B.C. libraries, and also created opportunities for rural communities to access books.\n",
      "\tArchivists say she was instrumental in getting literature to places like Duncan, and into the hands of miners working in remote camps. \n",
      "Seto Chang-Ann\n",
      "\tVictoria's Chinatown is known as one of the oldest in North America, but in the early-1900s, as racism towards non-white Canadians ran rampant, it was a rare safe place for the Chinese community.\n",
      "\tInside the small cultural enclave was a woman who strove to educate children and promote the rights of women. \n",
      "\t\"This was one of the first schools in North America to hire female teachers,\" said curator Tzu-L Chung. \n",
      "\tChang-Ann, a Victoria born Chinese-Canadian, and her husband were pivotal in raising money to build the Victoria Chinese Public School. \n",
      "\n",
      "\tThe building is still in operation on Fisgard Street today. \n",
      "\tB.C. historians also believe Chang-Ann was influential in making the school the first in North America to name a woman as a teacher. \n",
      "Alice Ravenhill\n",
      "\tPrim and proper, Alice Ravenhill came from high-society England before moving to Shawnigan Lake. But cultural standing didn't stop her from ruffling feathers as she fought for Indigenous rights. \n",
      "\tIn 1910 , Ravenhill and her family immigrated to Canada. Over the next several decades she would become one of the first authors to document and preserve Indigenous stories from across B.C.\n",
      "\t\"We really have to remember women like that, who did real work,\" said Chung. \n",
      "\tAt a time in Canadian history when the federal government was well know for trying to subvert and disrupt the traditions and lands which First Nations had known for centuries, Ravenhill went into the communities to try and better understand cultural differences. \n",
      "\n",
      "\t\"She actually acknowledged the way the government perceived Indigenous communities,\" said Chung. \"But also put in real efforts to share the Indigenous voices in arts and crafts.\"\n",
      "\tRavenhill is remembered for her unwavering dedication to the historical preservation of these communities, and doing it when it was an unpopular practice. \n",

      "\tCanada coped with nearly four years of Donald Trump rewriting or shredding the international trade rule book. But Canadian hope of a rosy return to rules-based bonhomie with its top trading partner under a Joe Biden presidency might be premature.\n",
      "\tThat warning comes from numerous trade experts, analysts and diplomats who have watched Canadians cope with Trump's profound threats to their economic well-being.\n",
      "\tTrump's protectionist trade disruptions have included threatening to rip up the North American trade deal, insulting Canada during the renegotiation of a new agreement and imposing what were viewed as degrading national-security metals tariffs.\n",
      "\tThe Trudeau government tried to remain civil, but eventually called out the Trump Republicans as America's most protectionist government. Before Trump, however, that honour belonged to another group: the U.S. Democrats.\n",
      "\tBiden would try to restore stability, predictability and respect to Canada-U.S. trade relations, but he is a Democrat, and his party's economic interests will diverge from Canada's, said Lawrence Herman, an international trade lawyer with Toronto's Herman and Associates and a former Canadian diplomat.\n",
      "\t\"It will not all be a return to sweetness and light.\"\n",
      "\tIf Biden wins it will likely mean an end to the persistent threat of the steel and aluminum tariffs that Trump imposed on Canada in 2018, using executive powers under U.S. trade law that gave the president the right to impose them on national-security grounds.\n",
      "\tTrump was, officially, targeting cheap Chinese steel flooding into the U.S. through Canada, imperilling domestic production of an important military commodity. But Trump's commerce secretary made clear at the time the tariffs were being imposed to pressure Canada and speed up the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement.\n",
      "\tTrudeau and his ministers were openly insulted that Canada's longtime ally was labelling Canada as a security threat.\n",
      "\tBut even though Biden is expected to be more respectful of trade laws and practices, Herman said Biden is still beholden to anti-trade sentiment within his own party. Sen. Bernie Sanders, the Vermont socialist who challenged Biden for the Democratic party's presidential nomination, views the international trade regime as a boon for corporations and the bane of rank-and-file workers.\n",
      "\tSanders and fellow presidential aspirant Sen. Elizabeth Warren hold real influence in the Democratic party, as does organized labour, Herman noted.\n",
      "\t\"I don't want to underestimate the importance of just having a much more friendly overall bilateral relationship and a recognition that Canada is an important country and a good friend to the United States,\" said Meredith Lilly, the Simon Reisman chair in international trade at Carleton University's Norman Paterson School of International Affairs.\n",
      "\t\"But on brass-tacks policy items, I don't think that we should be expecting special favours.\"\n",
      "\tBiden is advocating Buy American protectionist policies that could prevent Canadian companies from bidding on U.S. infrastructure projects at the state and municipal levels, she said.\n",
      "\tCanada has worked around the restrictions by having provincial premiers and state governors negotiate reciprocity agreements that allowed companies to bid on projects in each other's jurisdictions, said Colin Robertson, a retired diplomat with extensive U.S. experience and the vice-president of the Canadian Global Affairs Institute.\n",
      "\t\"We'll make that same argument, and I cannot see any good reason why the American governors would not go for it.\"\n",
      "\tThen, there's the controversial Keystone XL pipeline that would carry Alberta oilsands crude through the U.S. Midwest to refineries on the Gulf of Mexico. Trump reversed ex-president Barack Obama's cancellation of the pipeline permit in 2015. Obama acted in the face of widespread concerns from environmental groups that potential spills would cause serious damage.\n",
      "\t\"Trump has approved it, he supports it. Biden has vowed to kill it early in his administration by rescinding the presidential permit, and that, I believe, will be devastating, particularly to Western Canada and the Canadian energy sector,\" David Wilkins, a former U.S. ambassador to Canada for George W. Bush, told a Tuesday video conference hosted by the Canadian Chamber of Commerce.\n",
      "\tDavid MacNaughton, who was Canada's ambassador to Washington for most of the Trump era, told the same forum that the transition away from fossil fuels to clean energy will take a long time so the two countries can still work together constructively.\n",
      "\t\"I would hope that we can find a way to have energy and the environment as a common theme between Canada and the United States. And when the last drop of oil is consumed in the U.S., that it actually comes from Alberta.\"\n",
      "\tIf Trump wins re-election, he will likely extend his use of tariffs and executive orders to sectors beyond manufacturing, including intellectual property, digital trade and patents, said Herman.\n",
      "\tIn January, Heritage Minister Steven Guilbeault hinted that he might require American online streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon to pay sales tax in Canada.\n",
      "\t\"Trump could respond to that with tariffs on Canadian digital services,\" said Herman.\n",
      "\t\"Trump has shown a willingness to use executive powers in a way that no other administration has done.\"\n",
      "\tCanada dodged another major trade bullet with Trump when it managed to negotiate a new North American trade deal with the U.S. and Mexico to replace the much-maligned NAFTA.\n",
      "\tBut there are no guarantees that the new Canada-U.S.-Mexico Agreement, or CUSMA as it is known domestically, would provide any certainty with a second Trump administration, said Lilly.\n",
      "\tTrump backed down on Tuesday from his summer threat to reimpose aluminum sanctions under national-security provisions, which he originally levied despite CUSMA.\n",
      "\tBut Lilly sees future problems in CUSMA's crucial auto-sector chapter that increased the amount of North American content required for new automobiles.\n",
      "\t\"Contrary to what some in the sector have been touting as a real positive, I think that overall, the agreement is going to make the manufacturing of cars in North America more expensive,\" said Lilly.\n",
      "\t\"The auto manufacturers in the United States have heavy incentives to use American labour in North American cars. If they're looking to pay high wages in the auto sector, they're much more likely to relocate those jobs in the United States rather than in Canada.\"\n",
      "\tLilly said the CUSMA won't fully protect Canada because Trump doesn't see his northern neighbour as particularly special.\n",
      "\t\"After four years, I think Canada has come to the conclusion that the United States does not have our back.\"\n",

      "\tU.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Wednesday brought the Trump administration's anti-China campaign to two Indian Ocean island nations considered particularly at risk for what American officials allege is Chinese exploitation. In one significant step, Pompeo announced that the United States would for the first time open an embassy in the Maldives.\n",
      "\tPompeo visited Sri Lanka and the Maldives to press the two countries to be on guard against potential predatory lending and investment by China. He was making the case less than a week before the American election in which President Donald Trump is seeking to paint his rival, former Vice-President Joe Biden, as weak on China and beholden to it.\n",
      "\tEven before Pompeo arrived, China had fired back at the U.S. message, accusing Washington of bullying smaller nations. Pompeo, who will also visit Indonesia, pressed each country to push back against increasing Chinese assertiveness in the Indo-Pacific.\n",
      "\tU.S. officials complain that development and infrastructure projects benefit China more than the presumed recipients -- a refrain Pompeo repeated with Sri Lankan Foreign Minister Dinesh Gunawardena. Pompeo said the country could be \"a beacon\" for freedom and democracy in the region as long as it retained its \"full sovereignty.\"\n",
      "\t\"That is quite a contrast to what China seeks,\" Pompeo said. \"The Chinese Communist Party is a predator. The United States comes in a different way. We come as a friend and a partner.\"\n",
      "\tPresident Gotabhaya Rajapaksa told Pompeo that he is not ready to compromise his country's sovereignty in relations with other nations, the president's office said.\n",
      "\tHe defended Chinese-funded projects, saying Beijing has helped develop his country's infrastructure and that Sri Lanka has not been caught in a \"debt trap\" as a result, it said.\n",
      "\tGunawardena also appeared unwilling to get involved in the spat with China, and said Sri Lanka is willing to co-operate with all friendly countries.\n",
      "\t\"Sri Lanka is a neutral, non-aligned country committed to peace,\" he said. \"We hope to continue in our relations with the United States and with other parties.\"\n",
      "\tEarlier this month, Beijing announced that it would provide Sri Lanka with a $90 million grant to help rural development, after Rajapaksa sought help from a visiting Chinese delegation in disproving a perception that China-funded megaprojects are \"debt traps.\"\n",
      "\tSimilarly, the Maldives, a tiny archipelago nation in the Indian Ocean known for its luxury tourist resorts, is facing major debt of more than $1 billion for Chinese infrastructure projects. President Ibrahim Mohamed Solih has expressed concern about the amount.\n",
      "\tIn a nod to U.S. concerns about Chinese influence, Pompeo announced that the U.S. would open an embassy in the Maldives for the first time since the countries established diplomatic relations in 1966.\n",
      "\tCo-operation between the U.S. and the Maldives has \"taken on new importance as the Chinese Communist Party continues its lawless and threatening behaviour,\" Pompeo said. He accused China of encroaching into sovereign economic zones, \"trashing the environment\" and massive Illegal fishing. \"America is different,\" he said. \"We respect sovereignty.\"\n",
      "\tThe Maldives' foreign minister, Abdulla Shahid, made no mention of China by name but said his country needs \"more flexibility\" in international debt relief and urgent international consensus on climate change, which he called an existential threat to his nation. He also said that security in the Indo-Pacific depends on strengthened co-operation between the Maldives and the United States.\n",
      "\tChina considers Sri Lanka and, to a lesser extent, the Maldives to be a critical link in its massive \"Belt and Road\" global infrastructure building initiative and has provided billions of dollars in loans for projects over the past decade. The projects include a seaport, airport, port city, highways and power stations in Sri Lanka and roads and bridges in the Maldives.\n",
      "\tCritics like the U.S. say that the Chinese-funded projects are not financially viable, and that Sri Lanka and the Maldives will face difficulties in repaying the loans.\n",
      "\tIn 2017, Sri Lanka leased out a Chinese-built port located near busy shipping routes to a Chinese company for 99 years to recover from the heavy burden of repaying the Chinese loan the country received to build it.\n",
      "\tResponding to Pompeo's remarks in Sri Lanka, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said the secretary of state's true intention was to \"let China fall back to an era of poverty and undevelopment, and let the world fall into the abyss of confrontation and division.\"\n",
      "\t\"This is just the biggest threat facing the world today. But regrettably, Pompeo was born in the wrong time. The trend of peace, development, co-operation and win-win in this era is irresistible,\" Wang told reporters at a daily briefing on Wednesday.\n",
      "\tChina will \"continue to work with Sri Lanka to unswervingly expand the strategic co-operation and partnership between the two countries, benefit the two peoples and make our own contributions to regional peace and stability,\" Wang said.\n",
      "\tThe U.S.-China tug-of-war plays out against concerns that the Sri Lankan government is backsliding on democratic reforms. Last week, Parliament by a large majority approved a constitutional amendment concentrating powers under Rajapaksa and reversing efforts a previous government had made to curb authoritarianism.\n",
      "\tWith the change, Rajapaksa will be able to hold ministries, as well as appoint and sack ministers. He will also be the appointing authority of the elections, public service, police, human rights, bribery or corruption investigation commissions.\n",
      "\tIn his meeting with Rajapaska, Pompeo \"stressed the importance of strengthening democratic governance, human rights protections, and of fundamental freedoms to ensure long-term stability and prosperity,\" the State Department said in a statement.\n",
      "\tSri Lanka has been ruled under a powerful executive presidential system since 1978, but a reformist government in 2015 clipped much of the president's powers and gave them over to Parliament and independent commissions, saying successive presidents had been more authoritarian.\n",
      "\tPompeo arrived in Sri Lanka late Tuesday from India, where he and Defence Secretary Mark Esper had stepped up the Trump administration's anti-China message by playing on Indian suspicions about the Chinese to shore up a regional front against Beijing in the Indo-Pacific.\n",
      "\tJust hours before the meetings in New Delhi began, the Trump administration notified Congress of plans for a $2.37 billion sale of Harpoon missile systems to Taiwan -- the second major arms sale in two weeks to the democratic island that Beijing regards as a renegade province. China angrily reacted to the first sale by announcing sanctions on U.S. defence contractors.\n",

      "\tThe popular short-form video app TikTok, still under U.S. government scrutiny for its Chinese ownership, is moving closer to becoming a marketplace for buying stuff.\n",
      "\tCanadian e-commerce platform Shopify said Tuesday it's made a deal with TikTok enabling merchants to create “shoppable” video ads that drive customers to online stores.\n",
      "\tThe partnership was announced Tuesday amid stalled negotiations for Walmart to buy a 7.5 per cent stake in the video app. Walmart's planned investment is part of a government-forced deal that would rescue TikTok from a threatened ban by President Donald Trump and advance Walmart's ambitions for the world of “social commerce.”\n",
      "\t“If you're watching a TikTok video and somebody's got a piece of apparel or an item on it that you really like, what if you could just quickly purchase that item?” Walmart CEO Doug McMillon told CNBC earlier this month. “That's what we're seeing happen in countries around the world. And it's intriguing to us, and we would like to be part of it.”\n",
      "\tByteDance, the Beijing-based company that owns TikTok, already runs a thriving social media marketplace on Douyin, its twin video app for the Chinese market. Buying products through social media websites isn't yet as common in the U.S., though Pinterest and Facebook-owned Instagram have made some inroads and TikTok last year began making it easier for businesses to link to themselves from the app.\n",
      "\tShopify said its merchants will be able to select which product they would like to promote. Then, video ads will be automatically generated that could show up in a TikTok user's video feed and drive customers to Shopify for checkout.\n",
      "\tTikTok said in a prepared statement Tuesday that Ottawa-based Shopify will be a “perfect partner to help us grow and expand our commerce capabilities globally.”\n",
      "\tIt's not clear what the partnership means for TikTok's negotiations with Walmart. Walmart and Shopify are on good terms, having teamed up against Amazon in June on a deal that enables Shopify's small businesses to get listed on Walmart.com.\n",
      "\tTrump said over the summer he would shut down TikTok unless ByteDance sold its U.S. assets to an American company, citing concerns about the potential for the Chinese government to spy on users' data.\n",
      "\tByteDance in September proposed to U.S. authorities a partnership with Walmart, California tech company Oracle and other American investors designed to relieve national security concerns about the app. Trump expressed support for the idea but officials haven't formally approved it.\n",
      "\tTrump's attempt to ban TikTok was also delayed until after next week's U.S. presidential election after the company sued in federal court to halt the order.\n",

      "\tNavy cooks at Canadian Forces Base (CFB) Esquimalt are broadening their food palettes this week during the Navy’s “Food Diversity Week,” which runs from Oct. 26 to Oct. 30.\n",
      "\tIt’s a week-long celebration of diversity and inclusion inspired through food at the base. Cooks from CFB Esquimalt will be learning new dishes and techniques to incorporate into the Navy’s own menu.\n",
      "\t“Food is this universal unifier,” said Captain (Navy) Sam Sader, CFB Esquimalt Base Commander, on Monday. “We see diversity as a strength in the Royal Canadian Navy and we want to be more representative of the diversity in our defence team.”\n",
      "\t“We are more than 7,000 members here at work at Canadian Forces Base Esquimalt and we want to make sure that our Navy menus incorporate some of that diversity,” he said.\n",
      "\tThe week kicked off with traditional Sri Lankan cooking. Two dishes – chicken curry with Sri Lankan roasted curry powder and a beetroot curry – were being taught to the base cooks by Sri Lankan cookbook author Ruwan Samarakoon-Amunugama. Her newly released book, Milk, Spice & Curry Leaves is the first Sri Lankan cookbook to be published in Canada.\n",
      "\t“To be invited here today and to help train some of the cooks for the Royal Canadian Navy has just been a surreal experience,” said Samarakoon-Amunugama on Monday.\n",
      "\t“To know that one day, that those dishes that I’ve trained them to prepare will be served, is a huge honour,” she said.\n",
      "\tThe cookbook author describes Sri Lankan cuisine as a blend of cultures.\n",
      "\t“The flavours are reflective of our colonial past, so (there are) Portuguese, Dutch and English flavours that made their way into the cuisine as well as more modern Asian influences,” she said.\n",
      "\tCFB Esquimalt’s team lead cook for Food Diversity Week was joined by five other members of the navy’s culinary collective to absorb all they could from their guest chef. They say the food didn’t disappoint.\n",
      "\t“It was amazing. The flavours and everything in the cuisine was just unreal,” said Master Sailor Ryan Eves, a CFB Esquimalt Cook.\n",
      "\tEves says he was honoured to be part of the event today and gained a whole new appreciation for Sri Lankan food. He says he looks forward to using what he’s learned in future creations.\n",
      "\t“The herbs, the cooking techniques and everything else; the members will put this into play,” he said. “We can enhance a lot of the curry dishes and stuff that we do now by the way that she showed us and the way that she uses the herbs and spices.”\n",
      "\t“I think overall it will be very beneficial to the military and for the cooks,” said Eves.\n",
      "\tSome of the other cultural cuisines on the menu for this week include Chinese, Lebanese, Greek and Italian.\n",
      "\t“It’s also an opportunity for everyone else to learn through culture because you know you can learn so much through sharing food and coming together over food,” said Captain Sader.\n",
      "\t“We have a very diverse defence team. We want to celebrate that diversity, we want everyone to feel welcome, feel inclusive and be able to share that strength that they bring from their own cultural background to the team here at CFB Esquimalt,” he said.\n",
      "\tSamarakoon-Amunugama says she spent lots of time in the kitchen learning from her mother when she was growing up and hopes to pass on to others an appreciation of Sri Lankan food and culture.\n",
      "\t“I think it’s not only leaning about a new cuisine, but also learning about how to take it home, bring it home and then bring it to the ships or the bases as a way to connect with your families and your community,” she said.  \n",

      "\tStella Su, who lives and works in Shanghai, has used an ATM only once in the past year. Instead of cash, in recent years she has done almost all her business using the digital wallet Alipay --- shopping in a mall, buying stuff online or transferring money to friends.\n",
      "\t\"Now when I go out, I don't even need to carry my wallet, all I need is my phone,\" said Su, one of over a billion Alipay users in China and abroad.\n",
      "\tAlipay, operated by Ant Group, is the world's largest and most valuable financial technology (fintech) company and one of two dominant Chinese digital wallets in China, the other being rival Tencent's WeChat Pay.\n",
      "\tThanks to the huge scale and potential of China's fintech landscape, Ant Group is poised to raise about $34.5 billion in the world's largest share offering, beating Saudi Aramco's previous record of $29.4 billion. Ahead of the IPO, the company will be valued at about $280 billion.\n",
      "\tTo tap both Chinese and global investors, Ant Group is listing its shares both in Shanghai and Hong Kong. It is due to begin trading in Hong Kong on Nov. 5. The Shanghai debut has yet to be announced.\n",
      "\tEven before announcing its IPO plans, Ant Group was the world's most valuable fintech company, with a valuation of $150 billion after a 2018 fundraising round.\n",
      "\t\"Ant Group is much more than PayPal which only processes financial payments. It has a lot of businesses in other areas and with other services that would help 1.3 billion people in China,\" Jackson Wong, asset management director at Amber Hill Capital Ltd., said in an interview. \"We are betting that Ant Group will be able to grow at a very high pace in the future.\"\n",
      "\tAlipay and WeChat Pay have helped make Chinese society virtually cashless, at least in big cities, with consumers and merchants alike relying on digital payments using their phones.\n",
      "\t\"Think of Alipay as Visa, MasterCard, Citibank, FidelityΓÇª all rolled up into one,\" said Shaun Rein, founder and managing director of China Market Research Group in Shanghai. \"On the Alipay platform, you pay for things, you buy insurance, you buy wealth management. Your whole life revolves around Alipay.\"\n",
      "\tWalk into a supermarket in China and one would be hard-pressed to find a customer digging around for loose change to pay for groceries. Instead, cashiers scan a QR code on a customer's smartphone to deduct money from their Alipay or WeChat Pay digital wallets. The transaction takes seconds.\n",
      "\tIn restaurants, groups of friends often split the bill by transferring money to each other using their digital wallets, similar to how the Venmo app is used in the U.S.\n",
      "\t\"Ant Group is so valuable because Alipay is used on a day to day basis by a billion people on all of their purchases,\" said Rein. \"The scale of fintech in China dwarfs the regular financial transaction potential in the United States.\"\n",
      "\tAlipay evolved from e-commerce giant Alibaba, which was founded by Jack Ma in 1999 to help match buyers and sellers in China's fast growing market. When Alibaba launched consumer e-commerce platform Taobao to rival eBay in China, Alipay was introduced as a payments method to boost users' trust in the platform. Today, Alipay's reach extends to almost every aspect of life related to money.\n",
      "\tMa's foresight has made him the wealthiest person in China, with a fortune estimated at $58.8 billion according to the Hurun Research Institute, which follows the country's wealthy.\n",
      "\tAlipay was created in 2004 to serve as an escrow service between buyers and sellers on Alibaba's e-commerce consumer platform Taobao. It held funds from buyers to be released to sellers after goods were received. Alipay's revenue mostly comes from transaction fees charged to merchants. Users can link their bank cards directly to Alipay to top up their wallets, and transfers can also be withdrawn from users' bank accounts.\n",
      "\tAlibaba, which currently owns a third of Ant Group, spun off Alipay in 2011. The company was later rebranded as Ant as the company expanded the range of its financial services.\n",
      "\tOne of those is Zhima Credit -- -a private credit-scoring system that rates the trustworthiness and creditworthiness of its users based on data such as whether users pay their bills on time via Alipay.\n",
      "\tZhima Credit scores can help people take out small loans from Ant Group's consumer credit services Huabei and Jiebei to finance such things as iPhone purchases or school expenses. Such loans are hugely popular in China, where credit card usage is low and most people have no official credit history and are unable to borrow from banks.\n",
      "\tAnt Group's money market fund, called Yu'e Bao --- one of the world's largest --- lets people put idle cash in their Alipay wallets to work and reap returns on investments as small as 100 yuan ($15).\n",
      "\t\"In the past, wealth management products offered by banks had many requirements, maybe a minimum of 50,000 yuan (about $7,500),\" said Chen Zhoumin, who works in a bank in Zhengzhou, a city in central China's Henan province. \"But Alipay has made it very convenient to invest money, because it made wealth management accessible and convenient.\"\n",
      "\tTo compete with Yu'e Bao, banks have begun providing more flexible investment products with lower capital requirements, said Chen, who often invests idle cash in Yu'e Bao since it's easy to do.\n",
      "\t\"Digital wallets like Alipay and WeChat have revolutionized payments in China,\" he said. \"Now, there's also less worry that we might get counterfeit notes, or that our wallets may get stolen or robbed since everything is done digitally now.\"\n",

      "\tEthnic minorities in Britain are paying with their lives after years of government neglect left them uniquely vulnerable to the coronavirus pandemic, according to a report Tuesday by a woman whose son was murdered in a racist attack.\n",
      "\tBlack, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) people are more likely to suffer from obesity, heart disease and diabetes.\n",
      "\tBut pre-existing conditions cannot explain entirely why they have suffered disproportionately, the six-month review by Doreen Lawrence said.\n",
      "\tThe report was commissioned by the main opposition Labour party and is likely to feed into political criticism of the Conservative government's handling of the pandemic, which has left Britain with the highest death toll in Europe.\n",
      "\t\"Black, Asian and minority ethnic people have been overexposed, under-protected, stigmatised and overlooked during this pandemic -– and this has been generations in the making,\" she wrote, highlighting their often low-paid work and poor housing.\n",
      "\t\"The impact of COVID is not random, but foreseeable and inevitable -– the consequence of decades of structural injustice, inequality and discrimination that blights our society.\n",
      "\t\"We are in the middle of an avoidable crisis. And this report is a rallying cry to break that clear and tragic pattern.\"\n",
      "\tLawrence has become a respected figure in campaigns for racial justice in the years since her 18-year-old son Stephen was stabbed to death by a gang of white youths in 1993.\n",
      "\tShe was made a baroness in the upper house of parliament,the House of Lords, in 2013.\n",
      "\tHer report builds on research by government statisticians who found that white Britons are at lower risk of dying from COVID-19 than any other ethnic group, except for people of Chinese heritage.\n",
      "\tBlack Britons are four times more likely to die than white people.\n",
      "\tIf white people were dying at the same rate as black, Britain would have suffered more than 58,000 additional deaths from the disease, the report said.\n",
      "\tThe current official death toll stands at just under 45,000.\n",
      "\tBut citing researchers, the report said: \"Genetics cannot explain why every minority ethnic population, given huge genetic diversity within and between these groups, has a higher risk of death from COVID-19 than the white ethnic population.\n",
      "\t\"Instead, this inequality is likely to be driven by structural and institutional racism... and differential access to healthcare.\"\n",
      "\tThe first 10 hospital doctors to die from the virus were all from BAME backgrounds.\n",
      "\tSubsequent analysis showed that 68 per cent of deaths among staff in the state-run National Health Service (NHS) were from ethnic minorities.\n",
      "\tCiting one survey, the report said 70 per cent of BAME medics in the NHS felt they had been pressured to care for a patient without adequate personal protective equipment, compared to 45 percent of white respondents.\n",
      "\tBut BAME people referenced in the report also complained of unsympathetic treatment by white NHS doctors who had little understanding of their specific medical or cultural needs.\n",
      "\tThe report also cited hostile public attitudes among the majority white population, including racist attacks on Chinese Britons who were blamed after the virus originated in China.\n",
      "\tAnother survey cited showed that nearly 20 per cent of white Britons agreed that either Jews or Muslims were responsible for spreading the virus.\n",
      "\tThe government has commissioned the latest in a long series of reports on racial inequality in Britain, following the publication in 1999 of a landmark study that exposed \"institutional racism\" in London's police force over its botched investigation of the Stephen Lawrence murder.\n",
      "\tBut Doreen Lawrence said the pandemic underlined the need for action now.\n",
      "\t\"We need bold, joined-up policies and an approach that encompasses tackling ethnic disparities, from housing to employment and health,\" she said.\n",
      "\tThere was no immediate response from the government.\n",

      "\tA key ally's reaffirmed support for Malaysia's prime minister offers him a respite after his failed bid to declare a coronavirus emergency, but his political survival still hangs in the balance.\n",
      "\tEight months after taking office, Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin is being challenged by opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim, who says he has majority support to form a new government with defections from Muhyiddin's ruling coalition.\n",
      "\tThe support reportedly comes from the United Malays National Organization, the biggest party in the unelected governing coalition that was angry at being sidelined amid rivalry with Muhyiddin's own Malay party.\n",
      "\tMuhyiddin sought to checkmate his rivals with a proposed coronavirus emergency that would have suspended Parliament and given him uncontested powers -- but he miscalculated.\n",
      "\tThe king stepped out of his largely ceremonial role Sunday to declare Muhyiddin's proposed emergency was unnecessary and existing laws were enough to fight a spike in coronavirus cases. Many Malaysians were angered by Muhyiddin's move, and a senior UMNO official called on him to resign.\n",
      "\tUMNO leaders discussed late Monday whether to abandon Muhyiddin but the party said in a statement later that it would remain in the coalition but demanded respect and better co-operation.\n",
      "\tAnalysts warned the situation is still fluid and Muhyiddin's position remains precarious. He only has a slim two-seat majority in Parliament and unhappy UMNO lawmakers could still shift alliance to Anwar.\n",
      "\tOh Ei Sun, a senior fellow at the Singapore Institute of International Affairs, said more political manoeuvring is expected as Muhyiddin needs to get approval for 2021 budget in Parliament next month. If he is unable to pass the bill, pressure will build for him to resign or call new elections.\n",
      "\t\"Muhyiddin can now cling on to his political survival only at the whims of UMNO, which sees unresolved factional struggles. It would appear that his ship is going down but has not completely capsized yet,\" Oh said.\n",
      "\tMuhyiddin took power in March after withdrawing his party from Anwar's governing alliance that won 2018 polls. He tied up with the corruption-tainted UMNO and other opposition parties to form a Malay-centric government but his administration has been fraught with infighting.\n",
      "\tUMNO, which had ruled Malaysia since independence from Britain in 1957 but was ousted in 2018, has been vexed by its lack of senior Cabinet positions.\n",
      "\tMuhyiddin did away with the deputy premier post and retained key posts such as finance and economic for his party and proxies. His appointments of second-tier UMNO leaders to Cabinet posts have divided UMNO leadership, and the party was further upset by a state leadership tussle after winning a crucial election last month.\n",
      "\tFormer Prime Minister Najib Razak, who remains out of jail while appealing his 12-year sentence for corruption, has voiced support for Anwar -- a key player in the reformist government that ousted Najib in 2018.\n",
      "\tAnwar has not named the lawmakers supporting him for fear they may be bribed or harassed, and there are doubts he can form a coalition as UMNO and a Chinese-dominated party in Anwar's camp are at loggerheads.\n",
      "\tThe king met Anwar earlier this month but has postponed meetings with party leaders to verify Anwar's claim of a majority support. He has also called for support for the budget to cope with the pandemic -- despite his rejection of the emergency plan -- after Malaysia's cases doubled to more than 27,000 in just a few weeks.\n",
      "\tAhmad Fauzi Abdul Hamid, political science professor at Malaysia's University of Science. said Muhyiddin's emergency plan was really an admission of defeat but he received \"an indirect slap on the face\" from the king.\n",
      "\t\"If the budget is not passed, that signifies that his government has lost its majority. (Muhyiddin) will have lost whatever legitimacy he has to lead the government,\" he said.\n",

      "\tThe world's largest fintech company, China's Ant Group, will try to raise nearly US$35 billion in a massive public offering of stock that would shatter records.\n",
      "\tAlibaba-affiliated Ant Group, which operates a suite of financial products including the widely-used Alipay digital wallet in China and one of the world's largest money market funds, will hold dual listings in Shanghai and Hong Kong.\n",
      "\tIts Shanghai stock was priced at 68.8 yuan ($10.26) each, while its Hong Kong stock is priced at 80 Hong Kong dollars apiece ($10.32), according to filings on Monday.\n",
      "\tThe company will raise about $34.5 billion from the share offering, which is expected to surpass oil company Saudi Aramco's $29 billion share sale last year, making Ant Group's offering the biggest in the world.\n",
      "\tAnt Group will list on the Hong Kong stock exchange on Nov. 5, according to an exchange filing. A trading date for Shanghai has not been fixed.\n",
      "\tThe company has its origins in Alipay, which was initially created to serve as an escrow service between buyers and sellers on Alibaba's e-commerce platform. Alipay would hold the money paid by the buyer until the transaction was complete, before releasing the funds to the sellers in order to boost trust on the platform among consumers.\n",
      "\tIn 2011, Alipay was spun off from Alibaba into a separate company. It was later renamed Ant Financial, before its recent name change to Ant Group.\n",
      "\tOver the years, Ant has introduced more financial services, and now operates Alipay as a digital wallet which allows users in China to transfer money to others and pay for purchases both online and offline. Its money market fund Yu'e Bao is also among the world's largest.\n",
      "\tIn recent years, Ant Group has also partnered with digital wallets around the world and expanded its services to merchants to allow Chinese tourists to pay via Alipay abroad. The company has over a billion users globally.\n",
      "\tAhead of the IPO, Ant Group would be valued at about $280 billion. If the company exercises its greenshoe option, which would allow it to sell more shares than initially planned, it could raise another $5.17 billion, taking its valuation to about $320 billion.\n",
      "\tThe company plans to issue up to 1.67 billion shares in both Hong Kong and Shanghai, taking the total number of shares issued to about 3.4 billion.\n",
      "\tAlibaba, which currently owns a third of Ant Group, will subscribe to 730 million shares and will hold a stake of about 32% after the IPO.\n",
      "\tThe pricing announcements for Ant Group's dual IPOs also came days after Alibaba founder Jack Ma called the company's offering a \"miracle\", as it was the first time that such a big listing was priced outside of New York.\n",
      "\t\"We didn't dare think about it five years, or even three years ago,\" Ma said at a financial conference in Shanghai on Saturday.\n",
      "\tMa also criticized banks in China, saying that they were operated like \"pawn shops\" since they typically require one to have sufficient collateral before making loans.\n",
      "\tHe advocated for financial reform, saying that China's relatively young financial system should be driven by technologies such as big data, cloud computing and blockchain, instead of following traditional methods of banking that involves large amounts of red-tape.\n",

      "\tChina has ordered six U.S.-based news media to file detailed information about their operations in China the latest volley in a monthslong battle with the Trump administration.\n",
      "\tA foreign ministry statement issued late Monday demanded that the bureaus of ABC, The Los Angeles Times, Minnesota Public Radio, the Bureau of National Affairs, Newsweek and Feature Story News declare information about their staff, finances, operations and real estate in China within seven days.\n",
      "\tThe announcement came five days after U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said six Chinese media would have to register as foreign missions, which requires them to file similar information with the U.S. government.\n",
      "\tThe six were the third group of Chinese media required to do so this year. Each time, China has responded by forcing a similar number of U.S. media to file about their operations.\n",
      "\tThe ministry statement said China was compelled to take the step \"in response to the unreasonable oppression the Chinese media organizations experience in the United States.\"\n",
      "\tPompeo, in making his announcement, said the targeted Chinese media are state-owned or controlled, and that the U.S. wants to ensure that \"consumers of information can differentiate between news written by a free press and propaganda distributed by the Chinese Communist Party.\"\n",

      "CONTENT : TOKYO -- \n",
      "\tJapan will achieve zero carbon emissions by 2050, Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga declared Monday, outlining an ambitious agenda as the country struggles to balance economic and pandemic concerns.\n",
      "\tThe policy speech at the outset of the parliamentary session was Suga's first since he took office on Sept. 16 after his boss Shinzo Abe resigned over health reasons. It reflects Suga's pragmatic approach to getting things done, though it's unclear he will have the political heft needed to overcome vested interests in weaning this resource-scarce nation from its reliance on imports of oil and gas.\n",
      "\tSuga just returned from a trip last week to Vietnam and Indonesia, where he pushed ahead with Abe's efforts to build closer ties and promote a regional vision for countering growing Chinese influence.\n",
      "\tNow out of Abe's shadow, back home Suga has been pumping out consumer-friendly policies. He has earned a reputation as a cost cutter.\n",
      "\tHe said he intends to make a sustainable economy a pillar of his growth strategy and \"put maximum effort into achieving a green society.\" That includes achieving a carbon-free society by 2050.\n",
      "\tThe European Union and Britain have already set similar targets for net-zero greenhouse gas emissions, and China recently announced it would become carbon-free by 2060. Japan previously targeted a 80% reduction by 2050.\n",
      "\tSuga portrayed the need to shift away from fossil fuels to counter climate change as an opportunity rather than a burden.\n",
      "\t\"Global warming measures are no longer obstacles for economic growth, but would lead to industrial and socio-economic reforms and a major growth,\" he said. \"We need to change our mindset.\"\n",
      "\tJapan's current energy plan, set in 2018, calls for 22-24% of its energy to come from renewables, 20-22% from nuclear power and 56% from fossil fuels such as oil, coal and gas.\n",
      "\tProgress toward reducing reliance on fossil fuels has been hindered due to the prolonged closures of most of Japan's nuclear plants after the meltdown of the Fukushima Dai-Ichi plant due to the 2011 earthquake and tsunami in the northeastern Tohoku region.\n",
      "\tEnergy experts are now discussing revisions to Japan's basic energy plan for 2030 and 2050. The 2050 emissions-free target would require drastic changes and likely prompt calls for more nuclear plant restarts.\n",
      "\tAbout 40% of Japan's carbon emissions come from power companies, and they must use more renewable sources of energy while stepping up development of technologies using hydrogen, ammonia and other carbon-free resources, experts say.\n",
      "\tSuga said he will speed up research and development of key technologies such as next generation solar batteries and carbon recycling. He also promised to reduce Japan's reliance on coal-fired energy by promoting conservation and maximizing renewables, while promoting nuclear energy.\n",
      "\tUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called Japan's announcement that it will achieve net zero emissions by 2050 \"a very significant positive development,\" his spokesman, Stephane Dujarric, said in a statement.\n",
      "\t\"The secretary-general now looks forward to the concrete policy measures that will be proposed and implemented to reach this goal, that can help other countries define their own strategies,\" the statement said.\n",
      "\tEnvironmental groups also welcomed the announcement. \"Carbon neutrality is no longer a lofty, faraway dream, but a necessary commitment,\" in line with international climate change agreements, Jennifer Morgan, executive director of Greenpeace International, said in a statement.\n",
      "\tIn the short term, Japan's top priority is to curb the pandemic while reviving the economy, Suga said.\n",
      "\tTurning to Japan's biggest long-term problem, a low birthrate and shrinking population, Suga reiterated a pledge to provide insurance coverage for infertility treatments. He also said he would promote paternity leaves for working fathers to ease the burden of child-rearing and home-making on working mothers. He promised more help for single-parent households, more than half of which are living in poverty.\n",
      "\tAmong other highlights, Suga said:\n",
      "\tSince taking office Suga has crafted a populist and pragmatic image, winning public support for his relatively modest background and low-profile, hardworking style.\n",
      "\tHe has ordered his Cabinet to step up implementation of pet projects such as lowering cellphone rates and accelerating use of online government, business and medical services.\n",
      "\t\"I will break administrative divisions, vested interests and bad precedents to push for reforms,\" Suga said.\n",
      "\tBut he also said Japanese should try to help themselves before looking to the government for assistance, in line with what experts say is a conservative stance that is unsympathetic to the disadvantaged.\n",
      "\tSuga is best known for his effectiveness in corralling powerful bureaucrats to force through Abe's policies.\n",
      "\tHis hardline approach has sometimes drawn criticism. Earlier this month, he was accused of seeking to muzzle dissent by choosing not to appoint six professors out of a slate of 105 to the state-funded Science Council of Japan.\n",
      "\tThe flap triggered massive protests from academics and took the public support rating for his Cabinet down about 10 points to just above 50%.\n",
      "\tOpposition lawmakers are expected to raise the issue during the 41-day session through Dec. 5.\n",

      "\tChina has rolled out mass COVID-19 testing for nearly 5 million people and imposed lockdown measures in the prefecture of Kashgar in the far western region of Xinjiang, after a single asymptomatic coronavirus case was reported on Saturday.\n",
      "\tThe testing drive has so far identified 137 additional cases -- and all are asymptomatic, according to Xinjiang's regional health commission. This is the highest daily number of asymptomatic COVID-19 cases reported in China in nearly seven months.\n",
      "\tAs of Sunday afternoon, some 2.8 million people have been tested. The government expects to finish testing all of Kashgar's 4.7 million population by Tuesday.\n",
      "\tThe outbreak is Xinjiang's second since China's initial wave of coronavirus infections was brought under control in March.\n",
      "\tHome to 11 million Uyghurs, a predominantly Muslim ethnic minority, the region has been subjected to a sweeping security and religious crackdown in recent years. The U.S. State Department estimates that up to 2 million Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities could have been detained in internment camps.\n",
      "\tDuring China's initial outbreak, Xinjiang was subjected to strict lockdown measures on par with those imposed in the city of Wuhan -- the original epicentre of the virus, despite having reported only some 70 cases and three deaths.\n",
      "\tIn July and August, a cluster of fresh cases in the regional capital of Urumqi brought Xinjiang into a prolonged, stringent lockdown of more than 40 days, drawing backlash from residents on social media.\n",
      "\tMany complained that the restrictions were too strict and unnecessarily wide in scope -- covering cities without any reported cases hundreds of miles away from Urumqi. The lockdown was finally lifted at the end of August, only after no locally transmitted cases had been reported for two weeks.\n",
      "\tThe first new case in Kashgar -- a 17-year-old village girl working in a garment factory -- tested positive during a routine screening on Saturday, according to authorities. More than 800 of her fellow workers at the garment factory all tested negative, so did her parents and brother.\n",
      "\tAll of the 137 additional cases were linked to a factory where her parents worked. Authorities said the girl visited her parents' factory to dine with them in their dormitory on October 17, but did not explain how she got infected or how infections had broken out in that factory.\n",
      "\tKashgar authorities said on Sunday that all schools in the region would be closed until Friday, while shopping malls and supermarkets would remain open.\n",
      "\tA resident in Shufu county, where the latest outbreak occurred, told the state-run Health Times that she was ordered by local officials to get tested for coronavirus and not to leave her home on Saturday morning.\n",
      "\t\"We had no idea what was happening,\" she was quoted as saying. \"News (of the new asymptomatic case) was not announced until the evening, so many of us were very nervous throughout the day.\"\n",
      "\tBy Saturday afternoon, word had spread on Chinese social media that the Kashgar airport had been closed. According to Flight Master, a China-based aviation data provider, 33 flights arriving and departing Kashgar were canceled on Saturday, accounting for nearly half of all scheduled flights.\n",
      "\tOn Sunday, authorities said the airport had resumed operation, but anyone departing Kashgar must present a negative test result for the coronavirus. On Monday, however, Kashgar airport still saw 69 flights cancelled, or more than half the total number of flights scheduled, according to Chinese flight tracker VariFlight.\n",
      "\tSwift and drastic measures such as mass testing, extensive contact tracing and strict lockdown have defined China's response to sporadic local outbreaks since it largely contained the coronavirus midway through this year.\n",
      "\tEarlier this month, the eastern port city of Qingdao tested more than 10 million people in just four days over a dozen locally transmitted cases.\n",
      "\tBut some public health experts have questioned the effectiveness of citywide testing, given that patients are usually identified over a range of time. An infected patient might test negative, then days later test positive -- so hidden cases can't all be caught at once.\n",
      "\t\"This is just a snapshot, so it definitely will miss a lot of positive individuals,\" Dr. Jin Dongyan, a virology professor at the University of Hong Kong, told CNN.\n",
      "\tEven the chief epidemiologist at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention has questioned the necessity of such an exhaustive approach.\n",
      "\t\"From the scientific perspective of the spread of the infectious disease, there is indeed no need to conduct citywide testing,\" Wu Zunyou told the state-run news magazine China Newsweek Saturday.\n",
      "\tHe advised cities to focus testing on the source of the outbreak and radiate to a certain area around it. \"When no more cases can be detected, (the testing drive) can be terminated. There is no need to cover the whole city,\" he said.\n",

      "\tThe all-stock transaction was cast as a $23.6-billion deal by the Calgary-based companies by including the value of Cenovus and net debt, reported at the end of the second quarter as $8.2 billion for Cenovus and $5.1 billion for Husky.\n",

      "\t“When you combine two companies with similar geographies and somewhat similar operations, you're always going to have some overlap ... in this case, there would probably be relatively a little more weight on the head office functions, just because we aren't quite as overlapping in the field,” he said.\n",
      "\tHe added about $200 million in savings will come from sharing technical expertise and the other $600 million through better use of capital by focusing on assets with higher return potential.\n",
      "\tThe combined companies are expected to be able to sustain output at about 750,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day for about $2.4 billion a year, 25 per cent less than required separately, Pourbaix said.\n",
      "\tHusky is controlled by Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-Shing through Hutchison Whampoa Europe Investments SARL, with 40.1 per cent, and L.F. Investments SARL, which holds 29.32 per cent of the company's common shares.\n",
      "\tBoth entities have agreed to support the transaction, which will leave them with about 27.2 per cent of the merged company. They've also agreed to a standstill agreement under which they are subject to certain voting requirements and transfer restrictions for a maximum of five years.\n",
      "\tThe merger combines Cenovus production of about 475,000 boe/d with Husky's 275,000 boe/d and their combined refining and upgrading capacity is expected to total about 660,000 barrels per day (Cenovus 250,000 bpd, Husky 410,000 bpd).\n",
      "\tCenovus owns 50 per cent of two U.S. refineries in Illinois and Texas in partnership with Phillips 66, and Husky owns a refinery in Lima, Ohio, and is a 50-50 partner with BP in a refinery in Toledo, Ohio.\n",
      "\tHusky also has an upgrader and asphalt refinery near Lloydminster on the Alberta-Saskatchewan border - which could be used to process Cenovus bitumen in future - and is repairing a refinery in Wisconsin after a fire in 2018.\n",
      "\tHusky has production from a deepwater gas project offshore China with Chinese partner CNOOC Ltd., produces oil offshore Newfoundland and Labrador and owns a chain of retail fuel stations.\n",
      "\tPeabody said on the call that Husky has decided to cancel spending in 2021 on its partly completed $2.2-billion West White Rose offshore oil project. In September, it said it was reviewing the project while asking for direct investment from the federal government and the province of Newfoundland and Labrador.\n",
      "\tCenovus owns a crude-by-rail terminal northeast of Edmonton.\n",
      "\tThe merged company is expected to break-even on a free funds flow basis at West Texas Intermediate pricing of US$36 per barrel in 2021, and at less than WTI US$33 per barrel by 2023.\n",
      "\tThe transaction has been approved by both boards and is expected to close in the first quarter of 2021, pending shareholder and regulatory approvals.\n",
      "\tHusky shareholders will receive 0.7845 of a Cenovus share plus 0.0651 of a Cenovus share purchase warrant in exchange for each Husky common share.\n",
      "\tThe combined company's board of directors is to be made up of eight Cenovus appointees and four from Husky.\n",

      "\tChina has vowed to retaliate if the U.S. proceeds with the sale of advanced weaponry to Taiwan worth more than a billion dollars.\n",
      "\tThe statement from China's defence ministry gave no specifics, but the development marks a further deterioration in ties between Beijing and Washington that have hit their lowest ebb in decades.\n",
      "\tThe statement issued late Thursday night demanded the cancellation of the sale and an end to all interactions between the U.S. and Taiwanese militaries in order to \"avoid serious repercussions for relations between China and the U.S. and their armed forces and peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait.\"\n",
      "\tFailure to do so would \"compel the Chinese side to fight back resolutely,\" the statement said.\n",
      "\tThe State Department on Wednesday announced it had greenlighted the sale of 135 precision land attack missiles, associated equipment and training to Taiwan to improve its defence capabilities. The package is worth just over a billion dollars, it said in a statement. The missiles are made by Boeing.\n",
      "\tChina regards Taiwan as its own territory to be annexed by force if necessary and Washington maintains only unofficial relations with Taipei in deference to Beijing. However, U.S. law requires the government to ensure Taiwan can maintain a credible defence and recent years have seen an increase in both the quality and quantity of defensive arms sold to the island.\n",
      "\tThose come as China has increased military activity around Taiwan in what it calls a deliberate attempt to force political concessions from the pro-independence administration of President Tsai Ing-wen. The increase in Chinese incursions into Taiwanese airspace and military exercises seen as targeting U.S. and Taiwanese assets add to Beijing's years-long campaign of exerting economic and diplomatic pressure on the island, which has left it with just 15 formal diplomatic allies.\n",
      "\tIn a separate statement issued late Thursday, the Chinese Cabinet's Taiwan Affairs Office demanded Tsai's Democratic People's Party end its \"plotting\" with the U.S. to \"refuse unification through arms.\"\n",
      "\t\"This can only seriously undermine peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait and bring down a terrible disaster on the Taiwanese people,\" the statement said.\n",

      "CONTENT : WASHINGTON -- \n",
      "\tThe facts took a hit right out of the gate Thursday night.\n",
      "\tU.S. President Donald Trump's first line of the night, about COVID-19 deaths, was false and set the tone as he and Democratic rival Joe Biden unleashed a torrent of claims in their last presidential debate.\n",
      "\tTrump misrepresented the reality of the pandemic in myriad and familiar ways, insisting against obvious reality that the pandemic is drawing to a close. He also boasted about \"clean\" facilities at the border for migrant children, ignoring the filthy conditions under which they were held in 2018.\n",
      "\tBiden, at times, was selective on the coronavirus and other matters, at one point stating that no one under Obamacare lost private health coverage. Millions did.\n",
      "\tA look at how some of the statements on the stage in Nashville, Tennessee, compared with the facts:\n",
      "CORONAVIRUS\n",
      "TRUMP: \"We're rounding the turn. We're rounding the corner. It's going away.\"\n",
      "THE FACTS: No, the coronavirus isn't going away. It's coming back. New cases are on the rise toward their summer peak. Deaths have also been increasing.\n",
      "\tAccording to data through Oct. 21 from Johns Hopkins University, the seven-day rolling average for daily new cases in the U.S. rose over the past two weeks from over 42,300 on Oct. 7 to nearly 60,000 on Oct. 21.\n",
      "\tIn that time the seven-day rolling average for daily new deaths in the U.S. rose from 695 to 757.\n",
      "------\n",
      "TRUMP: \"All he does is talk about shutdowns. But forget about him. His Democrat governors Cuomo in New York, you look at what's going on in California, you look at Pennsylvania, North Carolina. Democrats -- Democrats all. They're shut down so tight, and they're dying.\"\n",
      "BIDEN: \"Look at the states that are having such a spike in the coronavirus. They're the red states. They're the states in the Midwest or the states in the Upper Midwest. That's where the spike is occurring significantly.\"\n",
      "THE FACTS: Neither of them is right. Coronavirus isn't a red-state problem or a blue-state problem. It's a public health problem that affects people no matter where they live or what their politics are.\n",
      "\tSome Republican-led states that were quick to reopen saw a surge of virus cases in the summer and are still struggling to get their transmission rates down. Florida's test positivity rate is about 12% currently, a level indicating widespread transmission. South Dakota is approaching 35%.\n",
      "\tDemocratic-led states like New York that were hit hard in the initial wave closed down and got their virus transmission rates down to very low levels. But they're now seeing rebounds in certain local communities, prompting them to target renewed restrictions.\n",
      "\tNevada and Pennsylvania are two states with Democratic governors and high transmission rates at currently 20% and 10% respectively, based on a 14-day trend.\n",
      "------\n",
      "TRUMP on the toll of COVID-19 in the U.S.: \"So as you know 2.2 million people, modeled out, were expected to die.\"\n",
      "THE FACTS: This was his first line in the debate, and it is false. The U.S. death toll from the pandemic was not expected to be that high.\n",
      "\tSuch an extreme projection was merely a baseline if nothing at all were done to fight the pandemic. Doing nothing was never an option and public-health authorities did not expect over 2 million deaths.\n",
      "\tTrump often cites the number to put the reality of more than 220,000 deaths in a better light and to attempt to take credit for reducing projected mortality.\n",
      "\tAt an April 1 briefing, when Trump and his officials discussed an actual projection of 100,000 to 240,000 deaths, the president held out hope of keeping deaths under 100,000. \"I think we're doing better than that.\" He has repeatedly moved the goal posts to make the massive mortality and infection numbers look better.\n",
      "------\n",
      "MIGRANTS\n",
      "TRUMP, speaking about children who were separated from parents at the U.S.-Mexico border: \"They are so well taken care of; they're in facilities that are so clean.\"\n",
      "THE FACTS: Not so.\n",
      "\tAt the height of the family separations in 2018, Border Patrol facilities were cramped well beyond capacity with migrants who were kept in squalid conditions, according to watchdog reports and the lawyers responsible for a federal settlement that governs how children are cared for in immigration custody. Long-term facilities for adults and children were at capacity, meaning the administration held people in the small border stations for much longer than the 72 hours normally allowed by law.\n",
      "\tThe stations are hardly meant for long-term care. Children were not provided hot meals and families slept on the floor on top of Mylar blankets. Flu and sickness ran rampant, and hundreds of small children were kept together without adequate care.\n",
      "------\n",
      "TRUMP, on immigrants who are released from custody in the U.S. to wait out their cases being allowed to stay: \"They say they come back, less than 1% of the people come back. We have to send ... Border Patrol out to find them.\"\n",
      "THE FACTS: That's false. There are far fewer no-shows for immigration hearings among those who are released pending their cases. According to Justice Department Statistics, a majority come back for their hearings.\n",
      "------\n",
      "HEALTH CARE\n",
      "BIDEN: \"Not one single person with private insurance would lose their insurance under my plan, nor did they under Obamacare, they did not lose their insurance, unless they chose they wanted to go to something else.\"\n",
      "THE FACTS: He's wrong about Obamacare.\n",
      "\tThen-President Barack Obama promised if you liked your health insurance, you could keep it under his Affordable Care Act, but that's not what happened for some.\n",
      "\tWhen Obamacare took effect in 2014, several million people lost individual health insurance plans that no longer met minimum standards established by the law. A backlash forced the White House to offer a work-around, but the political damage was done.\n",
      "\tHealth insurance is such a complicated area that almost any action has the potential for unintended consequences.\n",
      "------\n",
      "CLIMATE CHANGE\n",
      "TRUMP: The Paris accord meant \"we were going to have to spend trillions of dollars.... They did a great disservice. They were going to take away our business.\"\n",
      "THE FACTS: The Paris accord, an international agreement that aims to halt the rise in global temperatures, is based on voluntary emission reductions. No nation was forced to do anything.\n",
      "------\n",
      "EXTREMISTS\n",
      "BIDEN: \"He says about the Poor Boys, last time we were on a stage here, said -- I told them to stand down and stand ready. Come on. This guy has a dog whistle as big as a fog horn.\"\n",
      "THE FACTS: That is not exactly what Trump said and that is not the name of the neo-fascist group.\n",
      "\tDuring the last debate, Trump was asked if he would condemn white supremacist and militia groups that have shown up at some protests in the U.S. He said, \"Give me a name\" and Biden chimed in by saying, \"Proud Boys,\" a reference to the far-right extremist group that has shown up at protests in the Pacific Northwest.\n",
      "\t\"Proud Boys, stand back and stand by,\" Trump said. He did not tell them to \"stand ready,\" though it's debatable whether there is a material difference.\n",
      "------\n",
      "TRUMP'S TAXES\n",
      "TRUMP on his taxes: \"They keep talking about $750, which I think is a filing fee. ... Tens of millions of dollars (in income taxes) I prepaid.\" On his China bank account: \"I was a businessman in 2013 and I closed the account in 2015.\"\n",
      "THE FACTS: Trump is not being honest about his taxes.\n",
      "\tReporting by The New York Times, which obtained his tax records, contradicts his claims.\n",
      "\tThe IRS does not charge taxpayers a filing fee, though tax preparation services do. The $750 that Trump paid in 2016 and 2017 in the income taxes was to the federal government, not a tax preparation service.\n",
      "\tIt's not clear what Trump is talking about with regard to prepaying his taxes, but what matters is what he ultimately owed the government. Americans often have their income tax payments deducted from their paychecks. The Times reported that Trump, starting in 2010, claimed and received an income tax refund that totalled $72.9 million, which was at the core of an ongoing audit by the IRS. The Times said a ruling against Trump could cost him $100 million or more.\n",
      "\tNor did Trump close his Chinese bank account, according to Alan Garten, a lawyer for Trump's company. He told the Times that the account remains open, though the company's office in China has been inactive since 2015.\n",
      "------\n",
      "HUNTER BIDEN\n",
      "TRUMP: \"Joe got $3.5 (million) from Russia. And it came through Putin because he was very friendly with the former mayor of Moscow, and it was the the mayor of Moscow's wife. ... Your family got $3.5 million. Someday you're going to have to explain why.\"\n",
      "THE FACTS: There is no evidence of this. Trump is falsely characterizing a recent report by Republican Sen. Ron Johnson, who investigated Biden's son, Hunter, and his business dealings in Ukraine.\n",
      "\tThe report did not allege that Joe Biden himself got $3.5 million or that Russia President Vladimir Putin had anything to do with such a payment. Nor does the report allege that Hunter Biden pocketed the money himself. The report said the sum went instead to an investment firm he co-founded. Hunter Biden's lawyer has said in a statement to reporters that his client had no interest in and was not a founder of the firm.\n",

      "\tChina's foreign ministry said Friday it may decide not to recognize British-issued passports for Hong Kong residents in retaliation for London's moves to open a path to citizenship for those holding the documents.\n",
      "\tMinistry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said that Britain had \"violated its promises\" and \"played up\" the issue of the British National (Overseas) passports.\n",
      "\tBritain said in May that it would allow holders of such passports extended stays and the possibility of citizenship, prompting thousands of Hong Kongers to rush to renew or apply for them as Beijing steps up restriction on political expression.\n",
      "\tHong Kong reverted from British to Chinese rule in 1997 and the sides have increasingly feuded over civil rights in the territory. Britain accuses China of failing to live up to its pledges to maintain freedoms in the special administrative region, while Beijing says London is interfering in its internal affairs.\n",
      "\tDifferences have sharpened since China in June imposed a sweeping national security law on Hong Kong in response to months of anti-government protests last year. London suspended its extradition treaty with the territory and has offered political asylum to persons targeted under the new legislation.\n",
      "\t\"The British side violated its promises, insisted on going its own way and repeatedly played up the issue of BNO Passports,\" Zhao told reporters at a daily briefing.\n",
      "\t\"As the British side violated its commitment first, China will consider not recognizing the BNO Passport as a valid travel document, and reserves the right to take further measures,\" Zhao said.\n",
      "\tMore than 300,000 of Hong Kong's 7 million residents hold BNO passports, according to the U.K., more than double the number four years earlier. Those who qualify can apply for visas enabling them and their immediate family members to live and work in the U.K. and eventually apply for citizenship, the British government says.\n",
      "\tHowever, they must show they have the means to support themselves in the U.K. for six months, and will not be entitled to public support.\n",

      "CONTENT : \n",
      "\n",
      "\tAnyone who ever said, “Is nice,” in a broad unidentifiable accent, or wore a bushy fake moustache or, horror of horrors, donned a fluorescent Mankini Swimsuit Thong for a day at the beach will need no introduction to Borat Sagdiyev.\n",
      "\tFourteen years ago Kazakhstan’s most famous reporter, the comic creation of Sacha Baron Cohen, spawned a million Halloween costumes and ten times that in bad, inappropriate impressions.\n",
      "\tNow, into a world of fake Borats, the real deal returns. “Borat Subsequent MovieFilm,” streaming exclusively on Amazon Prime Video, once again blurs the line between comedy and tragedy, reality and fiction. \n",
      "\tThe new movie begins with a chance for redemption. After the events of the first movie Borat was thrown into prison, an embarrassment to his country and family. His son is so ashamed he changed his name from Sagdiyev to Jeffrey Epstein. Only his daughter Sandra Jessica Parker Sagdiyev (Irina Novak) still talks with the family patriarch. \n",
      "\tThe action begins with Borat being released from prison, cleaned up and once again sent to “Yankeeland” on a mission. His job is to earn the respect of Donald Trump by giving the gift of a monkey to “Vice Premier Pence.” When Borat arrives though, the monkey is gone from its packing crate. In its place is Sandra. “My daughter is here,” Borat reports back to Kazakhstan. “Should I give her as a gift?”\n",
      "\tThus, begin the journey that will see Borat and Sandra meet with a real-life cast of characters that offers cringe worthy insight into Western culture. There’s an Instagram influencer who teaches Sandra to be submissive to increase her appeal to men.\n",
      "\t“You want them to like you so you can get money from them.”\n",
      "\tThen two MAGA men take Borat to a rally where he performs a country song—“Journalists! Who wants to inject them with the Wuhan flu? / Chop them up like the Saudis do.”—that elicits cheers and straight-armed salutes from the crowd. And then there’s a debutant ball “fertility dance” that redefines the term OMG.\n",
      "\tThose scenes are as nervy and squirmy as humour gets but the sequence everyone will be talking about sees a sit-down interview with Donald Trump’s handsy personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani. It begins with Rudy asking, “Did you ever eat a bat?” and goes downhill from there. It is the most outrageous of the film’s several must-be-seen-to-be-believed moments.\n",
      "\tIt’s not often you can describe a comedy as nerve wracking but “Borat Subsequent MovieFilm” is that film.\n",
      "\tBaron Cohen’s audacious work is often hilarious, but it is the danger that comes along with his stunts that pushes the material from funny to fearless. His work is “Candid Camera” with a sharp edge; a cutting satire that mixes real-life undercover reporting with aggressive and often tasteless humour. It is both a high-brow exposé of the dark underbelly of this American election year and a low-brow comedy that will do anything to make you laugh. \n",
      "\tJust like the year it is being released, “Borat Subsequent MovieFilm” is a chaotic, uncomfortable experience. It will make you laugh, but is geared to also make you think. \n",
      "\tCue another round of bad Borat impressions. \n",

      "\tGlen Keane brings 43 years of Disney character animation experience to a new film now streaming on Netflix. From “The Little Mermaid’s” Ariel, “Beauty and the Beast’s main character—the Beast, not the Beauty—to the eponymous folks in “Aladdin,” “Pocahontas” and “Tarzan,” he’s the Disney Legend who created some of the most indelible characters of several eras.\n",
      "\tThis week he turns his eye, as character designer and director, to “Over the Moon,” a fanciful animated musical loosely based on the Chinese legend of Chang’e, starring the voices of Sandra Oh, Phillipa Soo and Ken Jeong.\n",
      "\tThe action begins in modern China, four years after the passing of Fei Fei’s (Cathy Ang) mother. She’s smart, funny and a romantic who believes in the legend her parents told her about Chang’e (Phillipa Soo), the Moon Goddess who yearns to be reunited with her true love. Fei Fei is still grieving her mother’s loss when her father (John Cho) becomes involved with another woman Mrs. Zhong (Sandra Oh) and her 8-year-old child, Chin (Robert G. Chiu).\n",
      "\tTo prove that love is forever and that her father’s affection for Mrs. Zhong is misplaced, Fei Fei concocts a plan. She builds a rocket ship to visit the moon so she can get evidence of Chang’e existence to prove to her father that love burns eternal. Unbeknownst to her Chin stows away on the adventure to the moon that will help her appreciate what she thinks she is missing on Earth.\n",
      "\t“Over the Moon” isn’t a Disney picture, but it feels like one thanks to the Keane touch. The familiar tropes, a deceased parent and adventure, are given a zippy new life with colourful, fun animation and some beautiful sequences like the cross cut between the CGI to the more traditional hand drawn animation in the telling of the legend.\n",
      "\tThere are flashier more fluorescent sequences later on, particularly in the vivid and abstract Lunaria scenes, but the use of an organic style of animation to illustrate a time-honored story is the first of many of the film’s good decisions.\n",
      "\tAlso strong is the voice work. As Fei Fei, Ang is feisty and smart as a self-sufficient youngster on a journey of self-discovery. She is no damsel in distress, just a kid looking to make things right in her world. The supporting cast, like Margaret Cho in a dual role and Ken Jeong as Fei Fei’s sidekick Gobi bring the goods as does Soo, who earned a Tony nomination for her work on Broadway in “Hamilton,” but her work leads to one of the film’s minuses.\n",
      "\tSoo is a great singer, and has one of the movie’s show-stoppers, a Broadway-by-way-of-Beyonce tune called “Ultraluminary,” but each of the songs feels tacked on in an effort to sell soundtrack downloads. A mix of show tunes, K-Pop and pop music, with the exception of “Rocket to the Moon” none of the tunes feel necessary.\n",
      "\t“Over the Moon” is a beautiful movie that celebrates Chinese culture, tells a story of overcoming grief and has some great animation and while the main story beats feel familiar, the high gloss visuals are unpredictable and consistently interesting.\n",
      "\n",
      "\tJonathan Demme's “Stop Making Sense,” his movie of an iconic a 1983 Talking Heads live show is considered one of, if not the greatest concert films of all time. Elegant and exciting, it made everything before it seem old fashioned and everything that came after feel like an imitation.\n",
      "\tWhat “Stop Making Sense” was to the 1980s a new concert film, also starring Talking Heads frontman David Byrne, is to these uncertain times. “American Utopia,” directed by Spike Lee and now playing on HBO Max, is a joyful film about everything from protesting injustice and police brutality to optimism and the celebration of life.\n",
      "\tIt’s got a good message and you can dance to it.\n",
      "\tFilmed during the show’s 2019 Broadway run at New York's Hudson Theatre, the film captures the cerebral but exuberant concert that features Byrne, alongside eleven musicians, all dressed alike in skinny grey suits, and all unfettered from amplifiers and the like.\n",
      "\tWith wireless guitars, keyboards and all manner of other instruments on an empty stage with no other gear or risers, Byrne and Company fill the space with intricate choreography, eclectic songs, new and old, and an uplifting social message of fellowship and faith in humanity. Byrne’s enthusiasm is infectious and Spike Lee, using a combination of you-are-there camera angles, including a beautiful overhead shot, captures the jubilant postmodernist performance in glorious fashion.\n",
      "\tIt is so much more than a Talking Heads greatest hits package. There are familiar songs like “Burning Down the House,” “This Must Be the Place” and “Once in a Lifetime,” but they seamlessly blend with Byrne’s originals, written for his 2018 solo album of the same name.\n",
      "\tHighlights, and there are many, include “Everybody’s Coming to My House,” Byrne’s ode to inclusivity and a potent cover of “Hell You Talmbout,” Janelle Monae’s protest song about police brutality. The latter song, a call and response featuring names the names of African Americans killed by police, is given extra clout by the addition of Spike Lee’s graphics that update the names mentioned in the song to include dozens of others. It is a powerful moment and an urgent call for change.\n",
      "\t“American Utopia” is a gem. A concert film that, like “Stop Making Sense” redefines what live performance can be.\n",
      "\n",
      "\tWhat the new remake of Daphne du Maurier’s “Rebecca,” starring Lily James, Armie Hammer and Kristin Scott Thomas and now streaming on Netflix, lacks in gothic thrills it makes up for in eye candy.\n",
      "\tTaking over as handsome widower Maxim de Winter, the role Laurence Olivier made famous in Alfred Hitchcock’s Oscar winning 1940 film, is Armie Hammer. Max is a charmer, a trust fund aristocrat with a beautiful estate, called Manderley, and a dead wife, named Rebecca.\n",
      "\tOn vacation in Monte Carlo a young woman (Lily James) catches his eye when she is refused service on the balcony of a fancy hotel restaurant. She is not a guest, she’s told, but an employee of a guest and therefore must eat elsewhere, anywhere but among the wealthy tourists enjoying their canapes and champagne. He invites her to join him and a whirlwind romance ensues. When her boss decides it’s time to travel to New York for debutant season, Max asks her to stay with a marriage proposal.\n",
      "\tThey move to Manderley, his family home on the windswept English coast. The sprawling home has been in his family for generations and is so grandly appointed it makes Downton Abbey look like an outhouse. At Manderlay the romance, which blossomed quickly, fades as the specter of Rebecca, the late lady of the estate, hangs heavy over the house and on Max’s mind.\n",
      "\tKeeping Rebecca alive in heart and in mind is Mrs. Danvers (Kristin Scott Thomas), Manderley’s baleful housekeeper. She is not impressed by Max’s naïve new bride who she thinks is trying to take Rebecca’s place.\n",
      "\tCue the dirty tricks, withering glances and gothic tomfoolery.\n",
      "\t“Rebecca,” directed by Ben Wheatley, is undeniably beautiful looking. From its good-looking stars to the sumptuous production design is by Sarah Greenwood, it will make your eyeballs dance. The set decoration at Manderley alone is “Architectural Digest: Baroque Edition” worthy, but this is a movie that wants to appeal to more than just your eye and that’s where it disappoints.\n",
      "\tThe bones of the story seem perfect for a 2020 revisit. du Maurier’s exploration of the power imbalance between a wealthy man and a woman who must fight to find her own sovereignty is timely but undone by a story that never takes hold.\n",
      "\tHammer’s take on Max misses the essential coldness of the character. He’s short tempered, snippy and brusque, but the icy core necessary to freeze out the new Mrs. de Winter is missing. Without that character element his reactions to events don’t bring the friction needed to engage the audience. At the pivotal ballroom scene, where the new bride is (MILD SPOILER ALERT) tricked into making a serious error in judgement, Max seems irked, pouty but the wound that is unintentionally opened doesn’t seem particularly deep. If Max doesn’t care that much, why should we?\n",
      "\tFrom that moment on Wheatley drifts through the story with none of his patented risk taking—think his daring adaptation of J.G. Ballard’s “High-Rise” or his edge-of-your-seat “Kill List”— relying Clint Mansell’s score to provide the emotional highs and lows.\n",
      "\tLike the story’s female protagonist the new version of “Rebecca” is haunted, this time by the ghosts of the story’s previous incarnations.\n",
      "\n",
      "\tThe folk horror of “The Curse of Audrey Earnshaw,” now on VOD, is set in 1973 but feels very much of the moment.\n",
      "\tDivided into chapters like I: The Incantation, II: The Descent, “The Curse of Audrey Earnshaw” builds an atmosphere of dread as it tells the tale of a tiny American community settled by fundamentalist Irish Christians in 1873. Isolated from the modern world, they live a simple agricultural and spiritual life frozen in time at the moment the settlers arrived.\n",
      "\tOf concern inside this closed-off community is a pestilence that kills children, crops and livestock. The villagers think a 1956 eclipse is the source their problems. They see it as sign from God and feel powerless to do anything about it.\n",
      "\tIn that same year a baby was born in secret to Agatha Earnshaw (Catherine Walker), an outcast from the local church. Now, seventeen years later that baby, Audrey (Jessica Reynolds), has come of age. Suspicious eyes are cast at the Earnshaw farm which is unaffected by the plague. As the villagers starve, Agatha’s fields are ripe with crops and healthy livestock, leading the frantic locals to accuse the mother and daughter of witchcraft.\n",
      "\t“The Curse of Audrey Earnshaw” breathes the same air as Ari Aster’s “Midsommar,” Robert Eggers “The Witch” and Robin Hardy’s “The Wicker Man” (not the Nic Cage version). Like those other filmmakers, director Thomas Robert Lee uses isolation as an incubator for hysteria and horror. He takes his time with the story, creating the off kilter, claustrophobic feel that goes a long way to create the necessary dread to make this story work.\n",
      "\tLee also leans on two central performances. As Agatha, Walker is fiercely maternal, a mother with a secret to protect. She is a character straight out of H.P. Lovecraft, one of the movie’s other influences. Knowing, yet unknowable, Walker wears her character like a shroud.\n",
      "\tReynolds brings both innocence and a steely edge to Audrey. As she comes of age, she discovers her power and wields it like a sword, seeking revenge on the townsfolk who treated her mother disrespectfully.\n",
      "\t“The Curse of Audrey Earnshaw” is ripe with tension and bloody practical special effects that should satisfy the genre lover but more than that it mines the very timely idea of isolation. To varying degrees many of us have been cooped up during the pandemic and while this haunting movie takes place in a very specific place, it showcases the dangers inherent in cutting one’s self off from the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "\tFirst, the history. One of the great nautical mysteries dates back to 1872 when a British brig called Dei Gratia came across a ship adrift in choppy seas. They were 400 miles east of the Azores in rough water when they changed course to offer aide to the Mary Celeste, a Genoa, Italy bound ship, now in distress.\n",
      "\tWhat the Dei Gratia boarding party found on board the ship Mary Celeste unnerved them. The cargo load was intact, as was a six-month supply of food and water. What was missing was the crew. Ten souls, lost without a trace.\n",
      "\tThe fate of the Celeste crew has confounded historians for years. A new thriller, “The Haunting of the Mary Celeste,” now on demand and on digital, offers up a supernatural solution for the crew’s disappearance.\n",
      "\tResearcher Rachel (Emily Swallow) has an idea that borders the scientific and the supernatural. It is her hypothesis that there are places on this planet where every now and again there is a rift when the tectonic plates shift. There is a physical change during the event and, like the blowback on a gun that sucks matter into the barrel, the crew members of the Mary Celeste were drawn into the rift, never to be seen again.\n",
      "\tRachel has determined the date of the next rift and is determined to prove her theory. With a small crew on a rented ship owned and operated by Tulls (Richard “Shaft” Roundtree) she sets off, only to have her theory proved in increasingly scary and weird ways.\n",
      "\t“The Haunting of the Mary Celeste” is the kind of straightforward thriller where people optimistically say things like, “Hey Rachel, something’s going to happen tonight. I can feel it,” before everything falls to pieces. With characters straight out of Central Casting, the gruff old sea captain, the hot headed assistant etc, it offers up a soggy sea-bound adventure with very few actual thrills.  \n",

      "\tChinese leader Xi Jinping condemned \"unilateralism, protectionism and extreme egoism\" in a jab at the United States made during a rally Friday to mark the 70th anniversary of China's entry into the 1950-53 Korean War.\n",
      "\tChina refers to the conflict, in which it sent troops to aid North Korean forces against a United Nations coalition led by America, as the \"War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea.\"\n",
      "\tAlthough fighting ended in a stalemate, the war established China as a major player on the world stage and Friday's commemorations closely fit with Xi's drive to promote patriotism and the unquestioned leadership of the ruling Communist Party.\n",
      "\t\"In today's world, the pursuit of unilateralism, protectionism and extreme egoism leads nowhere,\" Xi told an audience of government and party leaders, veterans and family members of those who served in what China calls the Chinese People's Volunteers.\n",
      "\t\"Arrogance, always doing as one pleases, acts of hegemony, overbearance or bullying will lead nowhere,\" Xi said, according to comments released by the official Xinhua News Agency.\n",
      "\tThe anniversary comes as China's relations with the U.S. have sunk to their lowest level in decades as the sides feud over trade, human rights, allegations of spying and Chinese policies regarding Hong Kong, Taiwan and the South China Sea.\n",
      "\tBeijing, meanwhile, remains North Korea's most important diplomatic ally and trading partner, and has pushed back at U.S. efforts to bring economic pressure on Pyongyang to prompt it to end its nuclear weapons and missile programs.\n",
      "\tChinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian reinforced the importance of Friday's anniversary, saying the war's outcome proved that \"justice will prevail and peaceful development is an irresistible historical trend.\"\n",
      "\t\"The great victory ... is of great and far-reaching significance to China and the world,\" Zhao said at a daily briefing.\n",
      "\tU.S. relations with North Korea featured briefly in Thursday's presidential debate, with President Donald Trump saying the Obama administration left him a \"mess\" to deal with in terms of tempering relations with North Korea.\n",
      "\tTrump said he had warded off a war that could have threatened millions of lives, and that former President Barack Obama had told him he viewed potential danger from North Korean leader Kim Jong Un as among the greatest national security threats.\n",
      "\tDemocratic nominee Joe Biden said Trump had \"legitimized\" a \"thug\" by meeting and forging a relationship with Kim.\n",

      "\tNorth Korea didn't immediately react to the U.S. presidential debate.\n",
      "\tMany North Korea watchers say Kim would prefer for Trump be reelected to get a chance to restart stalled nuclear negotiations in exchange for badly needed sanctions relief.\n",
      "\tLast year, the North's state media called Biden a \"rabid dog\" that \"must be beaten to death with a stick,\" after he described Kim as a tyrant. North Korea had once called Trump a \"dotard\" among other crude insults, but halted such rhetoric after Kim entered talks with Trump in 2018 on the fate of his advancing nuclear arsenal.\n",
      "\tDespite the impasse, Kim has not resumed testing major weapons such as intercontinental ballistic missiles in an apparent effort to keep diplomacy with the U.S. alive.\n",
      "\tThe North's state media reported Thursday that Kim paid his respects to Chinese soldiers at a cemetery north of Pyongyang, accompanied by top deputies. Kim said that \"every part of our country is closely associated with the red blood shed by the service personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteers\" and that his government would never forget \"their noble soul and lofty self-sacrificing spirit.\"\n",
      "\tThe visit was Kim's first to the cemetery on the October anniversary of China's entry into the war, adding to speculation that he wishes to strengthen ties with Beijing while preparing for new dealings with the U.S. after the Nov. 3 elections.\n",
      "\tSince taking power in late 2011, Kim has visited the cemetery on only two occasions, in 2013 and 2018, both on the July 27 anniversary of the signing of the 1953 armistice, according to Seoul's Unification Ministry.\n",

      "\tBiotech firm Moderna said Thursday that it had successfully recruited ethnic minorities, older people and those with underlying health issues for its COVID-19 vaccines trial, after it pushed to enrol groups most vulnerable to the virus.\n",
      "\tModerna said it had now signed up all 30,000 participants for the phase-3 trial, and more than 25,000 of them had already received a second dose of the vaccine, four weeks after the first.\n",
      "\tThe firm said it was working \"to develop a vaccine for everyone, including communities that have historically been under-represented in clinical research and are disproportionately impacted by COVID-19.\"\n",
      "\tMore than 7,000 people taking part in the trial are over 65, and more than 5,000 under 65 have high-risk diseases such as diabetes, severe obesity and cardiac disease.\n",
      "\tThe firm said more than 11,000 are \"from communities of color, representing 37 percent of the study population and similar to the diversity of the U.S. at large\" -- 6,000 are Hispanic or Latino, and more than 3,000 are African-American.\n",
      "\tMassachusetts-based Moderna is one of the few companies to have launched a large-scale clinical trial less than 10 months after the genetic sequencing of the novel coronavirus was established.\n",
      "\tSome Chinese, Russian and other Western projects are also in advanced tests, including US firm Pfizer.\n",
      "\tModerna hopes to have sufficient results by the end of November and to then file an emergency authorization request with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\n",

      "\tThe U.S. government says it will distribute the first doses immediately after authorization free of charge.\n",
      "\tHealth Secretary Alex Azar said Wednesday there would be enough doses to vaccinate the \"most vulnerable\" Americans before the end of the year, then the elderly and health workers in January, and all Americans by early April.\n",
      "\tIn the trials, half of the volunteers receive a placebo, and the other half get the vaccine.\n",
      "\tInitial FDA guidance stipulated that if the number of participants in the vaccinated group naturally contracting the virus and falling ill with COVID-19 was at least 50 percent lower than in the placebo group, the vaccine would be declared effective.\n",
      "\tBut on Thursday, a National Institutes of Health official said during a meeting of the FDA's advisory committee on vaccines that they would require a 60 percent efficacy for emergency use.\n",

      "CONTENT : OTTAWA  -- \n",
      "\tWhitehouse Perennials is a breathtakingly beautiful garden and nursery, located just outside Almonte that makes you forget there is a pandemic and washes all other worries away as well.\n",
      "\tThat’s what gardens do.  They create a sense of peace.\n",
      "\tDuring this pandemic, more people have chosen to \"dig into\" gardening and beautify their personal spaces.\n",
      "\tSuzanne Patry started the business 33 years ago and this has been her busiest season yet.\n",
      "\tPatry and her husband, Bruce Trites, have created gardens throughout their Rae Road property to offer a sense of what your garden can look like, over time.\n",
      "\t\"It’s like IKEA for gardeners. You don’t just look at plants on a bench. You see them planted in a garden, in context,\" says Patry.\n",
      "\t\"You can see small garden rooms, collections of plants that look good together.  It’s a way to show people how to combine plants and create their garden.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Whitehouse Perennials is closed for the season but Patry wants to ensure customers, many of them first-time gardeners, have success with the plants they have purchased for years to come.  The winter is when gardeners plan and dream.\n",
      "\tThe ancient Chinese philosopher, Lao Tzu, is quoted as saying:  \"Nature does not hurry, yet everything is accomplished.\"\n",
      "\tPerennial gardeners, in this climate, know they do have to hurry to put their gardens “to bed” for the winter.\n",
      "\tWe asked Suzanne Patry for a \"Put Your Beds To Bed, Garden Primer\":\n",
      "\t\"When customers purchase a plant they frequently ask, 'What do I do with this plant in the fall?' It is an easy question to answer,\" says Patry. \"If I only have to talk about that one plant.  When faced with many different plants there is no simple answer that works for everything in your garden.\"\n",
      "\tPatry explains that Google offers conflicting opinions about what to do in the fall with a garden. \n",
      "\n",
      "\t\"The most contentious debate is about whether to cut a garden down in the fall or leave it until the spring.  Gardeners who do their cleanup in the fall argue that it is easier to weed and mulch once the garden is clean cut. It is also easier to cut the garden down when plant stems are still rigid.”\n",
      "\tAccording to Patry, removing the old foliage eliminates overwintering insects and potential diseases that are transmitted on foliage. \n",
      "\t\"You also avoid the potential problem of your garden starting to grow in the spring up through old foliage, or your spring bulbs spouting through a mess of leaves.  Gardeners who leave their gardens standing until the spring argue that, in a harsh winter with poor snow cover, plant survival will be better when leaves and old stems are left on the bed to provide insulation.”\n",
      "\tWith her three-plus decades of experience, Patry says the debris will also prevent plants from heaving and will stop the growth of plants too early in the season when they could be damaged by late frosts. \n",
      "\t\"Cutting down too early in the fall can also stress plants by forcing them to try to send up new growth.  Leaving plants with seed heads, like coneflowers and ornamental grasses, provides food and shelter for wildlife.\"\n",
      "\tPatry adds that many plants, especially ornamental grasses, are beautiful in the winter when their dried plumes stand out against the snow.\n",
      "\t\"Here at the nursery we have experimented over the years with both approaches and have ended up with a hybrid approach. We leave our ornamental grasses and all the perennials, like Asters, Turtlehead and Anemones that are still blooming, untouched.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\tThis gardener cuts down everything else, carefully paying attention to how close to the ground each plant should be cut. \n",
      "\t\"Plants that die to the ground and come back up from below ground each spring, like Phlox and Asters, are cut with about 15 centimeters of stem left to trap the snow,\" said Patry.\n",
      "\t\"Plants that are very late to emerge in the spring like Butterfly Weed are marked with a tag so that we do not accidentally damage them when we cleaning up or weeding in the spring\", said Patry.\n",
      "\t\"Creeping Phlox, Lavender, Dianthus, and Coral Bells are evergreen and continue to grow in the spring from their old stems and crowns.  We leave them alone and trim them back in the spring when we see where the new growth is emerging.\"\n",
      "\tPatry says, “Herbaceous peonies are cut right down as are daylilies.  We do not add the foliage of the peonies to the compost pile because foliar diseases in peonies are spread through leaves.”\n",
      "\"Semi-evergreen perennials are those that do not die completely to the ground. Russian Sage is a good example of this. It will sprout from part way up the stems, depending on how much snow cover there was over the past winter.\"\n",
      "\"Clematis are cut back in the spring because we find it easier to wait until they are sprouting and then trim them to strong growing shoots.\"\n",
      "Shade Gardens: \"We do not cut anything back in our shade garden. Shade gardens are beautiful in the fall as the foliage goes through so many colour transitions.  There is also likely to be a higher proportion of evergreen plants like Hellebores and Coral Bells in the shade garden. As the leaves fall, we allow them to build up on the beds where they will insulate the plants over the winter.  In the spring, we simply remove all the fallen leaves and all the old foliage, which is now mixed in with the leaves and compost it.  Overwintering pests like slugs and snails are removed with the old foliage. We top up the mulch in the spring once the cleanup is complete.\"\n",
      "\"Pruning shrubs is another task that I am frequently asked about. At this stage in the season, we don't do much pruning except to remove damaged branches.\"\n",
      "Hydangeas:  \"On new plantings of Hydrangeas, that do not yet have sturdy branches, we do remove the flower heads. As the plants age the branches are usually strong enough to support the old flower heads and they do add winter interest.  We also make sure that any new plants have a good layer of mulch around them.  Keep it away from the crowns of the perennials and the woody stems of shrubs and trees where it can cause winter rot.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\t\"If planting has been done late in the season we will put evergreen branches over the plants in late November to catch the snow and add an extra layer of protection. Evergreens, like cedars, that are prone to splitting open from the snow can be wrapped with a light plastic mesh that is designed to hold the branches together.”\n",
      "Young trees are protected up the trunk by a plastic cylinder or wrap that prevent rabbits and mouse from chewing the bark and girdling the tree.\n",
      "\t\"Finally, we take advantage of any sunny days right until freeze up to do as much weeding as we can. Fall weeding is one of the biggest time-savers in the garden. Getting the weeds out before they have had six more months to establish is time well spent,\" said Patry.\n",
      "\tWhen Whitehouse Perennials opens next spring, it’s worth the drive.  If you are fans of day lilies brace yourself for fields of colour, when the countless varieties bloom in July.\n",
      "\tA stunning garden isn’t a reality overnight but with a little planning, some patience, and TLC, the results can be incredibly rewarding. \n",
      "\tSuzanne Patry says:  \"A garden is more than a cart-full of plants.  Gardens need to be planned.  The winter is a great time to do that.\"\n",
      "\tPatry looks forward to next spring when she will work with clients at her garden, to help design theirs.\n",
      "\t\"I have access to a special software, developed by a friend, that enables you to visualize your garden in 3D.  Even the blooms change according to the seasons.  It is truly unbelievable.\"\n",
      "\tUntil then, she hopes these tips will help your garden survive the winter, and flourish when the snow, and ice, recede.\n",

      "CONTENT : LONDON -- \n",
      "\tHuawei's new smartphone has an upgraded camera, its latest advanced chipset and a better battery. What it may not have outside the Chinese tech giant's home market is very many buyers.\n",
      "\tHuawei, which recently became the world's No. 1 smartphone maker, on Thursday unveiled its Mate 40 line of premium phones, a product release that comes at a crucial moment for the company as it runs out of room to manoeuvr around U.S. sanctions squeezing its ability to source components and software.\n",
      "\tThe Mate 40 could be the last one powered by the company's homegrown Kirin chipsets because of U.S. restrictions in May barring non-American companies from using U.S. technology in manufacturing without a license.\n",
      "\tAnalysts say the company had been stockpiling chips before the ban but its supply won't last forever.\n",
      "\t\"This is a major challenge to Huawei and it's really losing its market outside of China,\" said Mo Jia, an analyst at independent research firm Canalys. The latest U.S. restrictions mean it \"100% has closed doors for Huawei to secure its future components.\"\n",
      "\tExecutives said this summer that production of Kirin chips would end in mid-September because they're made by contractors that need U.S. manufacturing technology. In a press preview this week ahead of the Mate 40's launch, staff declined to answer questions on Huawei's ability to source chips. The head of Huawei's consumer business, Richard Yu, referred only briefly to the issue at the end of a virtual launch event Thursday.\n",
      "\t\"For Huawei, nowadays we are in a very difficult time. We are suffering from the U.S. government's third round ban. It's an unfair ban. It makes (the situation) extremely difficult,\" Yu said.\n",
      "\tHuawei, which is also a major supplier of wireless network gear, is facing pressure in a wider global battle waged between the U.S. and China over trade and technological supremacy. The U.S. government's efforts to lobby allies in Europe to not give it a role in new high-speed 5G wireless networks over cybersecurity concerns has been paying off, with countries including Sweden and Britain blocking its gear.\n",
      "\tHuawei phones are not widely available in the U.S., but they're sold in Europe, the Middle East and Asia. The company climbed to the top of the global smartphone rankings this summer, knocking Samsung off top spot by shipping 55.8 million devices in the second quarter to gain a 20% share of the market, according to research firms Canalys and International Data Corp. But the performance was driven by strong growth in China while smartphone sales in the rest of the world tumbled due to the coronavirus pandemic.\n",
      "\tAnalysts say it will be hard for Huawei to remain No. 1.\n",
      "\t\"Huawei's in a tight spot,\" said Ben Wood, chief of research at CCS Insight. Along with the U.S. sanctions, it's also hurt by slumping confidence in the brand that makes retailers less keen to stock its phones. \"And sadly, I don't think you're going to see the Mate 40 performing particularly well outside of China.\"\n",
      "\tHuawei has a small but enthusiastic fan base in Europe, its biggest market outside China. But some users are turned off by the idea of sticking with the brand because of a related problem: recent models like the Mate 40, priced at 899 euros ($1,070) and up, can't run Google's full Android operating system because of an earlier round of U.S. sanctions.\n",
      "\tInstead, they come with a stripped down open source version of Android, which doesn't have Google's Play Store and can't run popular apps like Chrome, YouTube and Search.\n",
      "\tMark Osten, a 29-year-old architect in Preston, England, bought a Huawei P30 last year when the contract on his previous Samsung phone ended.\n",
      "\tHe says the camera is great but hesitates to recommend the brand to others because of the uncertainty.\n",
      "\t\"I just can't imagine life without YouTube or Google,\" said Osten.\n",
      "\tTo make up for losing Google services, Huawei has built its own app store and has been paying developers to create apps for it. Users can request apps that aren't yet available, but it's not something that appeals to Chloe Hetelle, a 35-year-old events organizer in Toulouse, France, who bought a Huawei P20 model two years ago after switching from an iPhone.\n",
      "\t\"I don't want to request apps, I just want to have YouTube,\" said Hetelle. \"I'm not really keen on struggling to get something that I would have easily with another phone.\"\n",

      "\tBeached on the western shores of the Caspian Sea, it looks like a colossal aquatic beast -- a bizarre creation more at home in the deep than above the waves. It certainly doesn't look like something that could ever fly.\n",
      "\tBut fly it did -- albeit a long time ago.\n",
      "\tAfter lying dormant for more than three decades, the Caspian Sea Monster has been on the move again. One of the most eye-catching flying machines ever built, it's completing what could be its final journey.\n",
      "\tIn July of this year after 14 hours at sea, a flotilla of three tugs and two escort vessels maneuvered slowly along the shores of the Caspian Sea to deliver their bulky special cargo to its destination, a stretch of coast near Russia's southernmost point.\n",
      "\tIt's here, next to the ancient city of Derbent, in Russia's republic of Dagestan, that the 380-ton \"Lun-class Ekranoplan\" has found its new, and most likely definitive, home.\n",
      "\tThe last of its breed to sail the waters of the Caspian, \"Lun\" was abandoned after the 1990s collapse of the Soviet Union, condemned to rust away at Kaspiysk naval base, some 100 kilometres (62 miles) up the coast from Derbent.\n",
      "\tBut before it could fade into oblivion, it's been rescued thanks to plans to make it a tourist attraction right at a time when this unusual travel concept could be poised to make a comeback.\n",
      "\tGround Effect Vehicles, also known as \"ekranoplans,\" are a sort of hybrid between airplanes and ships. They move over water without actually touching it.\n",
      "\tThe International Maritime Organization classifies them as ships, but, in fact, they derive their unique high-speed capabilities from the fact that they skim the surface of the water at a height of between one and five metres (three to 16 feet).\n",
      "\tThey take advantage of an aerodynamic principle called \"ground effect.\"\n",
      "\tThis combination of speed and stealth -- their proximity to the surface while flying makes them difficult to detect by radar -- got the attention of the Soviet military, which experimented with several variants of the concept during the Cold War.\n",
      "\tTheir deployment on the vast inland body of water between the Soviet Union and Iran led to them acquiring the nickname \"Caspian Sea Monster.\"\n",
      "\tThe \"Lun\" ekranoplan was one of the last designs to come out of the Soviet ground effect vehicle program. Longer than an Airbus A380 superjumbo and almost as tall, despite its size and weight, the Lun was capable of reaching speeds of up to 550 kilometres per hour (340 mph) thanks to eight powerful turbofans located on its stubby wings.\n",
      "\tThis formidable machine was even able to take off and land in stormy conditions, with waves of up to two and a half meters. Its intended mission was to conduct lightning sea-borne attacks with the six anti-ship missiles it carried in launch tubes placed at the top of its hull.\n",
      "\tThe ekranoplan that has been moved to Derbent is the only one of its class ever completed and entered service in 1987.\n",
      "\tA second Lun, unarmed and assigned to rescue and supply missions, was at an advanced state of completion when, in the early 1990s, the whole program was canceled and the existing Lun withdrawn from service.\n",
      "\tAfter 30-plus years of inaction, getting this sea beast back on the move was no easy task, requiring the assistance of rubber pontoons and a carefully coordinated choreography involving several vessels.\n",
      "\t\"Lun\" will be the star of Derbent's planned Patriot Park, a military museum and theme park that will display different sorts of Soviet and Russian military equipment.\n",
      "\tConstruction of the park is expected to start later in 2020. For the time being, Lun will sit alone on the beach.\n",
      "\tIt looks set to become a new highlight for visitors to Derbent. The city claims to be the oldest continuously inhabited settlement in Russian territory. Its citadel and historical center have been designated by UNESCO as World Heritage Sites.\n",
      "\t\"Lun\" will add to the attractions of a region that, up until the coronavirus pandemic, had seen a number of initiatives to open it up to tourism, including the launch of cruise itineraries in the Caspian Sea.\n",
      "\tWhen it opens, Derbent's Patriot Park won't be the only Russian museum exhibiting an ekranoplan. A much smaller Orlyonok-class ekranoplan can be found at the Russian Navy Museum in Moscow.\n",
      "\tWhile ground effect vehicles fell out of favor in the past few decades, the concept has been experiencing a resurgence of late\n",
      "\tDevelopers in Singapore, the United States, China and Russia are working on different projects that aim to bring ekranoplans back to life, although with rather more peaceful purposes.\n",
      "\tOne of them is Singapore-based Wigetworks, whose AirFish 8 prototype builds upon groundwork done by German engineers Hanno Fischer and Alexander Lippisch during the Cold War.\n",
      "\tWigetworks acquired the patents and intellectual property rights and have set about trying to improve and update those earlier designs to create a modern ground effect vehicle.\n",
      "\tAlso in Asia, Chinese ekranoplan Xiangzhou 1 flew for the first time in 2017, although little is known about this project.\n",
      "\tIn the United States, The Flying Ship Company, a startup backed by private investors, is working on an unmanned ground effect vehicle to move cargo at high speed. Think unmanned delivery drones but over water.\n",
      "\tThe project is at its early stages, although founder and CEO Bill Peterson tells CNN his team is planning to bring this project to fruition within a seven-year timeframe.\n",
      "\tAnd Russia, home of the ekranoplan, hasn't given up on the concept.\n",
      "\tSeveral projects have been touted during the past few years, although none has managed to make it past the design stage yet.\n",
      "\tBeriev, a maker of jet-powered amphibious aircraft, came up with the Be-2500 concept, and, more recently, it has been reported by Russian media that a new-generation military ekranoplan, tentatively named \"Orlan,\" was under consideration.\n",
      "\tAnother, privately funded, project has sprung out of Nizhny Novgorod, an industrial city on the banks of the Volga River closely connected with the origins of ekranoplan technology. RDC Aqualines, which has also offices in Singapore, is developing its own line of commercial ekranoplans able to carry three, eight and 12 passengers, and might possibly expand to more.\n",
      "\tIts designs have caught the eye of a group of entrepreneurs which aims to establish a fast link across the Gulf of Finland, connecting Helsinki to the Estonian capital, Tallinn, in about 30 minutes.\n",
      "\tIt might be that soon you won't need to visit a museum to spot an ekranoplan, after all.\n",

      "\tWhile the world will be closely watching the U.S. election, some countries will be watching more closely than others.\n",
      "\tA number of world leaders have a personal stake in the outcome, with their fortunes depending heavily on the success -- or failure -- of U.S. President Donald Trump.\n",
      "\tPerhaps none has so much riding on a Trump victory as Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. The Israeli leader, who had a rocky relationship with President Barack Obama, has praised Trump as \"the greatest friend\" Israel ever had in the White House.\n",
      "\tTrump has delivered a series of diplomatic gifts to Netanyahu, recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital, withdrawing from Obama's nuclear deal with Iran and offering a Mideast plan that heavily favours Israel over the Palestinians. The White House brokered the establishment of diplomatic ties between Israel and the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain.\n",
      "\tBut Netanyahu's close relationship with Trump -- and more broadly the Republican party and its evangelical Christian base -- has come with a price. It has undercut Israel's traditional bipartisan support in Washington and alienated many Democrats, especially the rising progressive wing, and the largely liberal Jewish American community.\n",
      "\t\"For Netanyahu, a Biden victory would be a disaster,\" said Eytan Gilboa, an expert on U.S.-Israel relations at Israel's Bar Ilan University. He noted that Biden has already promised a different approach to Iran and the Palestinians.\n",
      "\tSidelined and humiliated by Trump, the Palestinians have made no secret about their hopes for a Biden victory.\n",
      "\t\"If we are going to live another four years with President Trump, God help us,\" the Palestinian prime minister, Mohammad Shtayyeh, said last week.\n",
      "\tHere is a look at some of the other world leaders who have a big stake in the U.S. election:\n",
      "\tThe Conservative prime minister's bombastic style and populist instincts have often been compared to Trump's and the two have struck a friendly relationship. Trump has called the British leader a \"great guy.\"\n",
      "\tTrump's enthusiasm for Brexit helped Johnson talk up the prospect of securing a quick U.S. trade deal now that Britain has left the European Union.\n",
      "\tKim Darroch, who was the British ambassador to Washington until 2019, said recently that Johnson would likely be Trump's \"best friend in Europe\" if the president is reelected.\n",
      "\tStill, London and Washington differ on many international issues, and a Biden victory could restore relative normality in trans-Atlantic relations.\n",
      "\tFor the Chinese leader, a second Trump term would bring a continuation of the bruising trade disputes, diplomatic jousting, and near-daily accusations against China on issues from human rights to the environment and the South China Sea.\n",
      "\tTrump's onslaught has offered Xi an opportunity to portray the U.S. as a declining democracy coping with racial unrest and a bungled response to the coronavirus.\n",
      "\tUnder Biden, the U.S. may move closer to its allies and reengage with international organizations that might make demands of China. But Biden would bring a level of predictability and normalcy that Chinese leaders prefer and lessen the chances of outright confrontation.\n",
      "\tThe right-wing populist prime minister and Trump are known for a similar style of leadership deeply rooted in using nationalist sentiments.\n",
      "\tCritics say Trump has looked the other way while Modi carries out a Hindu nationalist agenda at the expense of Indian minorities. A victory could embolden Modi to continue his harshly criticized policies with little scrutiny from Washington.\n",
      "\tIn contrast, Biden and running mate Kamala Harris, whose mother was Indian, have been vocal about India's controversial decision to revoke the Muslim-majority region of Kashmir's semi-autonomy, the state of religious freedom in the country, press freedom violations and a new citizenship law seen as discriminatory toward Muslims.\n",
      "\tSaudi Arabia's King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed, the de facto ruler of the United Arab Emirates, were no big fans of the Obama administration. Their countries welcomed Trump's withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal and the imposing of sanctions that have sent Iran's economy into a freefall.\n",
      "\tTrump also stood by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in the face of sharp criticism after the killing of Washington Post writer Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi agents in late 2018. Trump vetoed a Senate resolution that would have ended U.S. support for the Saudi and UAE-led war in Yemen, which has created the world's most devastating humanitarian crisis.\n",
      "\tThe Mideast monarchs fear Biden could be an extension of the Obama era, with renewed engagement with Iran and greater concern for human rights.\n",
      "\tIran's supreme leader has suffered the equivalent of diplomatic whiplash between the Obama and Trump administrations.\n",
      "\tPeople crowded the streets to praise the 2015 nuclear deal, hoping for normalized ties with the West. Trump's unilateral withdrawal from the deal subsequently led to Iran resuming nuclear activities. Tensions ratcheted up in a series of incidents culminating in with an Iranian missile attack on U.S. forces in Iraq after an American drone strike killed a top Iranian general.\n",
      "\tBiden has said that he's willing to sit back down with Iran if it honours the limits of the nuclear deal. Another Trump term could see tensions again return to a boil.\n",
      "\tRegarded by some as Asia's Trump for his unorthodox political style and brash language, Duterte has nurtured friendly ties with the U.S. leader and even called on American Filipinos to vote for Trump.\n",
      "\tTrump, in contrast to Obama, has not publicly raised alarm over the Philippines' deadly anti-drug crackdown. The tough-talking Duterte once said in a speech that Obama could \"go to hell.\"\n",
      "\tA Biden victory could potentially bring a more adversarial relationship.\n",
      "\tThe embattled Venezuelan president expects no relief no matter who wins the White House.\n",
      "\tAccused of authoritarian rule, Maduro oversees one of history's most abysmal economic collapses, sparking the flight of 5 million Venezuelans from the country.\n",
      "\tTrump has imposed stiff economic sanctions and endorsed opposition politician Juan Guaido. U.S. justice officials also indicted Maduro, labelling him as a narco-terrorist with a $15 million bounty for his arrest.\n",
      "\tBiden has called Maduro a \"dictator\" and vowed to keep up the pressure.\n",
      "\t\"If Trump wins the elections, we'll face him and defeat him,\" Maduro said recently. \"And if Biden wins, we will also take him on and overcome.\"\n",
      "\tBolsonaro has consistently sought to curry Trump's favour, and this week expressed his desire to see him win reelection.\n",
      "\tHis son, Eduardo Bolsonaro, a lawmaker, was photographed wearing a TRUMP 2020 hat, and the American flag has become a fixture at pro-Bolsonaro rallies.\n",
      "\tThe Brazilian president took office with pledges to cut environmental red tape and facilitate development, particularly in the Amazon. Trump has kept silent regarding man-made fires in the Amazon rainforest, in contrast with some of his European counterparts.\n",
      "\tAlready there are signs Biden would be more proactive on pushing Brazil to protect its environment.\n",

      "CONTENT : \n",
      "\tFormer U.S. President Barack Obama delivered a blistering account of his successor's first four years in office on Wednesday in Philadelphia, arguing that President Donald Trump has proved he is \"incapable of taking the job seriously\" and has shown no interest in \"helping anybody but himself and his friends.\"\n",
      "\tThe event is Obama's first stump speech for his former vice president, a welcome sight to Democrats who see the former president as Joe Biden's most potent character witness and a key factor in encouraging Black men, Latinos and younger voters to turn out and vote.\n",
      "\tObama's speech represented his most direct attacks on Trump to date, with the former Democratic leader leveling both substantive critiques -- like questioning Trump's tax policy and handling of the coronavirus pandemic -- and personal barbs, jabbing at shrinking ratings for the President's speeches and town halls.\n",
      "\tThe remarks drilled down on years of Democratic concerns about the President, with Obama arguing Trump's presidency has not only changed the way other countries view the United States but remade the way Americans feel about politics.\n",
      "\t\"I never thought Donald Trump would embrace my vision or continue my polices, but I did hope for the sake of the country, that he might show some interest in taking the job seriously,\" Obama said. \"But it hasn't happened. He hasn't showed any interest in doing the work or helping anybody but himself and his friends.\"\n",
      "\tThe former President directly attacked Trump's handling of the coronavirus, the issue that is dominating the 2020 campaign.\n",
      "\tHenoted that Trump recently said that there is \"not much\" he would change about the US response to the pandemic that has killed over 220,000 people in the United States.\n",
      "\t\"Really?\" Obama asked. \"Not much? Nothing you can think of that could have helped some people keep their loved ones alive?\"\n",
      "\tStanding in front of Lincoln Financial Field for the drive-in rally, Obama said a competent response to the coronavirus would have meant Philadelphia Eagles fans \"would be tailgating here at The Link, instead of watching a speech from your cars.\"\n",
      "\tObama's remarks will undoubtedly anger Trump, who has continued to attack his predecessor even four years removed from his last day in office.\n",
      "\tAfter Obama suggested Trump uses the presidency to boost his own profile, he added, \"Even then, his TV ratings are down. So you know that upsets him.\"\n",
      "\tAnd when he noted that Trump inherited a booming economy from him, Obama added, but \"just like everything else he inherited, he messed it up.\"\n",
      "\tThe speech also showed Obama is closely watching the day-to-day news about Trump, including a Monday report that the President maintains a Chinese bank account.\n",
      "\t\"How is that possible? A secret Chinese bank account,\" Obama asked.\n",
      "\tThen he reflected on the way that conservative media and Trump treated him during his time in office.\n",
      "\t\"Listen, can you imagine if I had had a secret Chinese bank account when I was running for reelection?\" Obama asked. \"You think Fox News might have been a little concerned about that? They would have called me Beijing Barry.\"\n",
      "\tObama also touted Biden and his running mate, California Sen. Kamala Harris, throughout the speech, saying that while he didn't know Biden well when they both served in the Senate, he \"came to admire Joe as a man who has learned early on to treat everyone that he meets with dignity and respect.\"\n",
      "\tObama said Biden would \"never call the men and women of our military suckers and losers,\" citing a bombshell report on Trump from The Atlantic. He said Trump has \"emboldened\" racists. Obama also incredulously recounted instances of Trump retweeting conspiracy theories, indirectly mentioning the false QAnon group that says there is a \"secret cabal running the world.\"\n",
      "\t\"It just won't be so exhausting,\" Obama said of a Biden administration, adding voters are \"not going to have to think about the crazy things ... and that is worth a lot.\"\n",
      "This is a breaking story and will be updated.\n",

      "CONTENT : SAO PAULO  -- \n",
      "\tBrazilian President Jair Bolsonaro on Wednesday rejected the announced purchase of 46 million doses of a potential vaccine against the coronavirus being developed by a Chinese company and tested in a state governed by a political rival, prompting some to question if he was allowing politics to steer public health decisions.\n",
      "\t\"The Brazilian people will not be anyone's guinea pig,\" Bolsonaro said on his social media channels, adding that the vaccine has not yet completed testing, which is the case with all potential vaccines for the virus. \"My decision is to not purchase such a vaccine.\"\n",
      "\tHealth Minister Eduardo Pazuello had announced the purchase Tuesday in a meeting with Sao Paulo Gov. Jo├úo Doria, a foe of Bolsonaro's whose state is participating in the vaccine's development through its Butantan Institute. The cost of the acquisition was estimated at 2 billion reais (US$360 million).\n",
      "\t\"Butantan's vaccine will be Brazil's vaccine,\" Pazuello said.\n",
      "\tA Brazilian Health Ministry document issued Monday and shared by Sao Paulo's government Wednesday confirmed that the ministry had put in writing its intention to buy the doses of the \"Butantan Vaccine-Sinovac/Covid-19\" for an estimated price of US$10.30 each.\n",
      "\tThe document made explicit the purchase was contingent upon the health regulator's approval. Bolsonaro told journalists that protocol will be cancelled.\n",
      "\tClaudio Couto, a political science professor at Getulio Vargas Foundation, a university, felt the president's move had little to do with the virus and was more a way to hurt Doria, who is widely cited as a likely challenger to Bolsonaro's 2022 reelection bid.\n",
      "\t\"His concern is to be a strong candidate for reelection, and that often means giving trouble to his adversaries,\" Couto said.\n",
      "\tBolsonaro and Doria have had an adversarial relationship since the start of the pandemic, with each taking opposite stances regarding stay-at-home recommendations and restrictions on activity. The governor, whose state is Brazil's most populous, heeded the counsel of public health experts and adopted such measures, which the president blasted, arguing the economic fallout could kill more than the disease.\n",
      "\tBrazil has confirmed more than 153,000 deaths from COVID-19, the second most in the world, behind only the U.S. The South American nation has also reported 5.2 million confirmed cases of coronavirus infections, the world's third highest tally.\n",
      "\t\"It isn't ideology, it isn't politics, and it isn't the electoral process that saves. It is the vaccine,\" Doria told reporters in the national capital, Brasilia.\n",
      "\tDuring a brief news conference in the Sao Paulo countryside, Bolsonaro shot back at Doria, accusing the governor of playing politics by hurrying out a vaccine in an effort to buoy his popularity. The president also accused his adversaries, including Doria, of \"promoting a narrative of terrorism since the start of the pandemic.\"\n",
      "\tBrazil has a long tradition of immunization programs. The South American country has a struggling, but universal public health care system, that has been key to stopping outbreaks of measles, yellow fever and other diseases.\n",
      "\tBolsonaro has said no one will be forced to get a coronavirus vaccine. But his comments Wednesday reflected particular skepticism of the vaccine being developed by Chinese pharmaceutical company Sinovac.\n",
      "\tHe has often expressed mistrust of the Asian power, which is Brazil's biggest trading partner, particularly on the campaign trail in 2018. He called China \"heartless\" and said that under his watch it wouldn't be allowed to buy up Brazil.\n",
      "\t\"THE CHINESE VACCINE OF JOAO DORIA,\" Bolsonaro wrote on social media Wednesday. \"For my government, any vaccine, before it is made available to the population, must be PROVEN SCIENTIFICALLY.\"\n",
      "\tDespite that nod to scientific rigour, Bolsonaro for months touted the healing powers of hydroxychloroquine even as studies indicated the anti-malarial drug was ineffective against the coronavirus and caused harmful side effects.\n",
      "\tIn June, Brazil's government announced a deal with Oxford University and pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca to purchase 100 million doses of its potential coronavirus vaccine.\n",
      "\tIt has become common practice for governments to purchase doses of promising coronavirus vaccines, to build a stockpile in case they are proven effective. That investment is usually not refundable if the shot fails.\n",
      "\tEarlier, the executive secretary of Brazil's Health Ministry said in a televised statement that there had been a misunderstanding in the announcement about buying the CoronaVac vaccines.\n",
      "\t\"There is no intention to buy vaccines from China,\" said Antonio Elcio Franco, who added there will be only \"a Brazilian vaccine\" made at the Butantan Institute in Sao Paulo. Those shots, however, would still be based upon Sinovac's research.\n",
      "\tAt least two governors, including Flavio Dino in Maranhao state, said they would fight Bolsonaro's administration if it refused authorization for a vaccine that works, whatever its provenance.\n",
      "\t\"We don't want a new war,\" said Dino, another adversary of the president. \"Governors will go to Congress and to courts to ensure that the population has access to all vaccines that are efficient and safe. Health is a bigger asset than ideological or electoral disputes.\"\n",

      "\tKen Potrock, president of Disneyland Resort, said the state was making \"mandating arbitrary guidelines that it knows are unworkable and that hold us to a standard vastly different from other reopened businesses and state-operated facilities\".\n",
      "\tThailand's decision to begin reopening its tourism industry was also attracting controversy, coming as the country is convulsed by anti-government protests.\n",

      "\tU.S. President Donald Trump spent a decade unsuccessfully pursuing projects in China, operating an office there during his first run for president and forging a partnership with a major government-controlled company, The New York Times reported Tuesday.\n",
      "\tChina is one of only three foreign nations -- the others are Britain and Ireland -- where Trump maintains a bank account, according to a Times analysis of the president's tax records. The foreign accounts do not show up on Trump's public financial disclosures, where he must list personal assets, because they are held under corporate names.\n",
      "\tThe Chinese account is controlled by Trump International Hotels Management LLC, which the tax records show paid US$188,561 in taxes in China while pursuing licensing deals there from 2013 to 2015.\n",
      "\tIn response to questions from The Times, Alan Garten, a lawyer for the Trump Organization, said the company had \"opened an account with a Chinese bank having offices in the United States in order to pay the local taxes\" associated with efforts to do business there. He said the company had opened the account after establishing an office in China \"to explore the potential for hotel deals in Asia.\"\n",
      "\t\"No deals, transactions or other business activities ever materialized and, since 2015, the office has remained inactive,\" Garten said. \"Though the bank account remains open, it has never been used for any other purpose.\"\n",
      "\tGarten would not identify the bank in China where the account is held.\n",
      "\tChina continues to be an issue in the 2020 presidential campaign, from the president's trade war to his barbs over the origin of the coronavirus pandemic. His campaign has tried to portray former Vice-President Joe Biden as misreading the dangers posed by China's growing power. Trump has also sought to tar his opponent with overblown or unsubstantiated assertions about Hunter Biden's business dealings there while his father was in office.\n",
      "\tAs for the former vice-president, his public financial disclosures, along with the income tax returns he voluntarily released, show no income or business dealings of his own in China. However, there is ample evidence of Trump's efforts to do business there.\n",
      "\tAs with Russia, where he explored hotel and tower projects in Moscow without success, Trump has long sought a licensing deal in China. His efforts go at least as far back as 2006, when he filed trademark applications in Hong Kong and the mainland. Many Chinese government approvals came after he became president.\n",
      "\tIn 2008, Trump pursued an office tower project in Guangzhou that never got off the ground. But his efforts accelerated in 2012 with the opening of a Shanghai office, and tax records show that one of Trump's China-related companies, THC China Development LLC, claimed $84,000 in deductions that year for travel costs, legal fees and office expenses.\n",
      "\tThe Times said Trump's tax records show that he has invested at least $192,000 in five small companies created specifically to pursue projects in China over the years. Those companies claimed at least $97,400 in business expenses since 2010, including some minor payments for taxes and accounting fees as recently as 2018, the Times reported.\n",

      "\tThe president of a prominent think tank used a high-level UN Security Council meeting Tuesday to appeal for the release of former Canadian diplomat Michael Kovrig, who has been held by Beijing for nearly two years as part of a diplomatic dispute with Canada.\n",
      "\tAt the end of his briefing on security in the Persian Gulf, International Crisis Group president Robert Malley told the council meeting attended by China's foreign minister that his organization strives to be “an impartial conflict-resolution organization,” and its staff tries to understand the perspectives of all parties.\n",
      "\t“That's what our colleague Michael Kovrig was doing in his work on China's foreign policy,” Malley said.\n",
      "\tKovrig is the International Crisis Group's senior adviser on northeast Asia. He and fellow Canadian Michael Spavor were arrested separately nearly two years ago in apparent retaliation for Canadian authorities having detained Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou, who was wanted in the U.S. on fraud charges.\n",
      "\tMeng, who has denied any wrongdoing, is now facing possible extradition to the U.S. while Chinese authorities have indicted the two Michaels on what many observers believe are trumped-up spying charges.\n",
      "\tMalley said it wasn't the time or place to discuss the former Canadian diplomat's case, “but I cannot conclude without appealing to the Chinese authorities, if they are listening, to understand the mission he was pursuing, end his almost two-year detention, allow him at long last to be reunited with his loved ones and continue his work toward a more peaceful world.”\n",
      "\tThe participants at the virtual council meeting were shown on the screen, and when Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi heard China mentioned he looked up and paid attention. But Wang made no mention of Kovrig in his own speech to the council.\n",
      "\tGerman Ambassador Christoph Heusgen did, echoing Malley's appeal “to liberate Michael Kovrig.”\n",
      "\t“He is not only a member of the International Crisis Group, but a former colleague of ours, a former diplomat,” Heusgen said.\n",

      "\tA question that's been a grey cloud hanging over Sir John A. Macdonald High School in Upper Tantallon, N.S., is about to get more attention: Should the name of the school be changed?\n",
      "\t\"Honestly, it's kind of inappropriate to have the name as it is, considering the history of it,\" said Grade 12 student Eliyana Bugbee. \"I support it being changed.\"\n",

      "\t\"I feel like it's going to be a rough topic for a lot of people to change, but it seems like it might be a good idea in the long run,\" said Grade 12 student Clayton Parker.\n",
      "\tThe topic of changing the name came up earlier in the month at a school advisory council meeting. The Halifax Regional Centre for Education says a final decision on how to go forward is still being determined.\n",

      "\tQueens University in Kingston, Ont., revealed on Tuesday that it would remove his name from its law school building.\n",
      "\tIn Charlottetown, city council made a unanimous decision in June to keep a statue of Sir John A. Macdonald sitting on a bench downtown.\n",
      "\t\"To completely remove a historical record from a public place, we run the risk of just erasing history altogether,\" said University of Ottawa historian Pierre Anctil.\n",
      "\tIt's a debate happening in the Maritimes and across the country and some say the key is finding the line between historical recognition and celebration.\n",
      "\tIn the case of Charlottetown, the council said in keeping the statue it would try to display the history of Sir John A. Macdonald in a proper historical context.\n",

      "\tWireless carriers that plan to use existing telecommunications infrastructure for 5G networks must also rip out any existing gear from Huawei or ZTE Wireless, the Swedish Post and Telecom Authority said.\n",

      "\tSweden is the latest country to prohibit Huawei from playing a role in building 5G networks and its decision is likely to add to tensions between the Chinese government and Western powers. U.S. officials have waged an intense lobbying campaign in Europe to persuade allies to shun the company, saying Huawei could be compelled by China's communist rulers to facilitate cyberespionage.

Klas Friberg, the head of Sweden's domestic security service, known as SAPO, said Tuesday that foreign powers have intensified their intelligence activity in recent years so 5G networks should be built in a secure way from the start.\n",
      "\t\"China is one of the biggest threats to Sweden,\" Friberg said. \"The Chinese state is conducting cyber espionage to promote its own economic development and develop its military capabilities. This is done through extensive intelligence gathering and theft of technology, research and development. This is what we must consider when building the 5G network of the future.\"\n",

      "\tBut for Daryl Mabunga, part of the SislerCREATES animation program, the 2020 school year is exceptional for an entirely different reason.\n",
      "\t\"This whole opportunity is really cool,\" said Mabunga, who is participating in the inaugural \"Orange Tree Project,\" a collaboration between SislerCREATES and Nickelodeon Studios. \"When do you have a chance to talk to these people who are from Nickeloden when you live in Winnipeg, Manitoba?\"\n",
      "\tMabunga is one of a group of students participating in the Orange Tree Project, a learning initiative launched in late September that has animation industry professionals teaching students on the ins-and-outs of the animation industry.\n",
      "\tParticipating students are working in three separate groups, all tasked with developing original story ideas. Each group is being mentored by a Nickelodeon artist throughout the program, which runs until the end of May, and teams will be pitching their story concepts to their Nickelodeon mentors next week.\n",
      "\t\"I just started learning animation about a month ago,\" said Mabunga. \"Before it was just me making my own stories but now I have a whole bunch of new people helping and putting in new ideas.\"\n",
      "\t\"We're creating this thing together so that's really cool.\"\n",
      "\tGetting the Orange Tree Project off the ground is largely thanks to Sisler High School animation teacher and CREATE department head Jamie Leduc, who worked with Nickelodeon to set up the mentorship program.\n",

      "\t\"Watching these students develop their skills over time has been a highlight of my career.\"\n",
      "\tLeduc says the program is keeping students engaged, working ten-to-twelve hours a day on their projects, despite all of the COVID-19-related disruptions this year.\n",
      "\tAnd, while students are learning what they need to create animated works from start to finish, they're also gaining skills applicable to any industry.\n",
      "\t\"I've learned how to communicate with people,\" said Gab Reyes, one of three team leaders in the program, \"Which is especially important during the pandemic with everything online\"\n",
      "\t\"I've learned how important communication is with your teammates, how to arrange things, and how it's okay to have help from other people, as well.\"\n",
      "\tFor Nya Langit's team, the project offers a chance to create stories showcasing underrepresented cultures. Langit and members of her team are Filipino, so they're imbuing elements of Filipino mythology into their story pitch, a culture Langit says isn't often seen in mainstream media.\"\n",
      "\t\"With Asian representation in the media, it's mainly Chinese or Korean or Japanese,\" said Langit. \"I think if we bring in more Southeast Asian (culture) then more people will feel represented.\"\n",
      "\tThe Orange Tree project ends in late May when students will aim to complete three animated short films. The films will then be submitted to various film festivals. \n",

      "\t\"This milestone is a culmination of years of Facebook AI's foundational work in machine translation,\" research assistant Angela Fan said in a blog post.\n",

      "\tThe exchange comes at a moment when ties between the countries are at their lowest point in years, largely due to China' outrage over Canada's detention of a top executive of Chinese telecoms giant Huawei and the subsequent arrest of two Canadians.\n",
      "\tThe new friction arose when China's ambassador to Canada, Cong Peiwu, branded pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong as violent criminals and said if Canada grants them asylum it would amount to interference in China's internal affairs.\n",
      "\t\"If the Canadian side really cares about the stability and the prosperity in Hong Kong, and really cares about the good health and safety of those 300,000 Canadian passport-holders in Hong Kong, and the large number of Canadian companies operating in Hong Kong SAR, you should support those efforts to fight violent crimes,\" Cong said in a video news conference from the Chinese Embassy in Ottawa.\n",
      "\tAsked if his remarks amounted to a threat, Cong replied, \"That is your interpretation.\"\n",
      "\tCanada's deputy prime minister, Chrystia Freeland said in Parliament on Monday that the ambassador's comments \"are not in any way in keeping with the spirit of appropriate diplomatic countries between two countries.\"\n",
      "\tFreeland said Canada will speak out for human rights in China and said Canada will support its citizens living in Hong Kong. \"Let me also reassure the 300,000 Canadians in Hong Kong that a Canadian is a Canadian and we will stand with them.\" Freeland said.\n",
      "\tHer statements came hours after Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian told reporters that his government had complained to Canada over press criticism of Cong's remarks. He said Canadian leaders \"did not verify, but also condoned the anti-China comments spreading across the nation and made groundless accusations against China.\"\n",
      "\tHe didn't specify the media criticism, but the Toronto Sun on Saturday published an editorial calling on Cong to apologize, adding. \"If he won't apologize and retract his threats, boot him back to Beijing.\"\n",
      "\tMeanwhile, Erin O'Toole, the leader of Canada's main opposition Conservative party, said Monday that Cong had threatened Canadians in Hong Kong and called on the envoy to either apologize or leave.\n",
      "\tCherie Wong, the executive director of Alliance Canada Hong Kong, a group that advocates for Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement, called Cong's comment a \"direct threat\" to all Canadians.\n",
      "\t\"It should not be lost on Canadians living in Hong Kong or China, they could be next. Ambassador Cong suggested so himself,\" Wong said.\n",
      "\tProtests against the Hong Kong and mainland Chinese governments swelled last year, and Beijing clamped down on expressions of anti-government sentiment in the city with a new national security law that took effect June 30.\n",
      "\tThe law outlaws subversive, secessionist and terrorist activity, as well as collusion with foreign powers to interfere in the city's internal affairs. The U.S., Britain and Canada accuse China of infringing on the city's freedoms.\n",
      "\tCong also rejected Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's assertion that China is engaging in coercive diplomacy by imprisoning two Canadian men in retaliation for the arrest of a Chinese Huawei executive on an American extradition warrant. The executive, Meng Wanzhou, is living under house arrest in Vancouver while her case wends through a British Columbia court.\n",
      "\tIn December 2018, China imprisoned two Canadian men, Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, and charged them with undermining China's national security. Convicted Canadian drug smuggler Robert Schellenberg was also sentenced to death in a sudden retrial shortly after Meng's arrest.\n",

      "\tThe Indian army said it apprehended a Chinese soldier Monday in the remote Ladakh region, where the two countries are locked in a monthslong military standoff along their disputed mountain border.\n",
      "\tThe soldier, Cpl. Wang Ya Long from China's People's Liberation Army, was apprehended inside Indian-controlled Ladakh's Demchok area and was to be released soon, the army said in a statement.\n",
      "\tIt said the soldier \"had strayed\" across the de facto border along the eastern section of what's known as the Line of Actual Control, a loose demarcation separating Indian- and Chinese-controlled areas.\n",
      "\t\"As per established protocols, he will be returned back to Chinese officials at the Chushul--Moldo meeting point after completion of formalities,\" the statement said.\n",
      "\tChina did not immediately comment on the soldier's apprehension.\n",
      "\tThe high-altitude standoff between the Asian giants began in early May with a fierce brawl, and exploded into hand-to-hand combat with clubs, stones and fists on June 15 that left 20 Indian soldiers dead. China is believed to also have had casualties, but has not given any details.\n",
      "\tChina detained at least 10 Indian soldiers, including four officers, following the deadly brawl. They were returned three days later after intense military and diplomatic negotiations.\n",
      "\tThe Indian army statement Monday said the Indian side had received an inquiry from China's military \"about the whereabouts of the missing soldier.\"\n",
      "\tThe soldier \"has been provided medical assistance including oxygen, food and warm clothes to protect him from the vagaries of extreme altitude and harsh climatic conditions,\" the statement said.\n",
      "\tIndia and China have each stationed tens of thousands of soldiers backed by artillery, tanks and fighter jets and are bracing for a harsh winter in the cold-desert region, where temperatures can fall to minus 50 degrees Celsius (minus 58 Fahrenheit).\n",
      "\tThe nuclear-armed rivals have accused each other of crossing into rival territory and of firing shots for the first time in 45 years.\n",
      "\tThe sides have held several rounds of talks by military, diplomatic and political officials, including negotiations between their foreign ministers and defence ministers in Moscow last month. Although the standoff has persisted, the talks seem to have calmed the situation along the border, with no new military aggression reported for over a month now.\n",
      "\tThe fiercely contested Line of Actual Control separates Chinese-held and Indian-held territories from Ladakh in the west to India's eastern state of Arunachal Pradesh, which China claims in its entirety. It is broken in parts where the Himalayan nations of Nepal and Bhutan border China.\n",
      "\tIndia claims the Chinese-controlled Aksai Chin plateau as part of the Ladakh region.\n",
      "\tAccording to India, the control line is 3,488 kilometres (2,167 miles) long, while China says it is considerably shorter. The line divides the areas of physical control rather than territorial claims.\n",
      "\tRelations between the two countries have often been strained, partly due to their undemarcated border. They fought a border war in 1962 that spilled into Ladakh and ended in an uneasy truce. Since then, troops have guarded the undefined border and occasionally brawled. They have agreed not to attack each other with firearms.\n",
      "\tIndia unilaterally declared Ladakh a federal territory and separated it from disputed Kashmir in August 2019, ending Indian-administered Kashmir's semi-autonomous status. It also vowed to take back the Aksai Chin plateau.\n",
      "\tChina was among the first countries to strongly condemn the move, raising it at international forums including the U.N. Security Council.\n",

      "\tJapanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga, in his first overseas summit since taking office last month, agreed with his Vietnamese counterpart to step up defence and security co-operation in the face of China's expanding influence in the region.\n",
      "\tIn talks in Hanoi on Monday, Suga and Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc set a basic agreement allowing Japan to export defence equipment and technology to Vietnam. Japan has been pursuing such pacts in recent years to bolster ties with Southeast Asia and sustain its own defence industry.\n",
      "\tSuga said his four-day trip to Vietnam and later Indonesia was key to pursuing multilateral economic and security co-operation to counter China's growing power and protect sea lanes in disputed areas of the South China Sea.\n",
      "\t\"Vietnam is crucial to achieving our vision of `the Free and Open Indo-Pacific,' and our valuable partner,\"' Suga told a news conference after his meeting with Phuc. \"Japan, as an Indo-Pacific nation, will continue to contribute to the peace and stability in this region.\"\n",
      "\tSuga said Vietnam, at the centre of the region, was the most suitable destination for his first trip abroad as Japan's leader.\n",
      "\tNeither of the two leaders mentioned China by name in their news conference. Phuc said the peace and stability of the South China Sea should be protected by the rule of law, not unilaterally by force or threats.\n",
      "\t\"Vietnam appreciates that Japan, one of the world's leading powers, is actively contributing its efforts to maintain peace and stability in the region and in the world,\" Phuc said.\n",
      "\tIn a speech later Monday at Vietnam-Japan University, Suga said that Japan's \"Free and Open Indo-Pacific\" concept and \"ASEAN Outlook on the Indo-Pacific,\" formulated by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations in 2019, share values such as rule of law, openness, transparency and freedom.\n",
      "\tSuga expressed strong support for their vision and said together Japan and ASEAN can achieve a peaceful and prosperous future.\n",
      "\t\"Unfortunately in this region, there is a move in the South China Sea that goes against the rule of law and openness stated in this ASEAN Outlook, and Japan strongly opposes any attempt that escalates tensions in the South China Sea,\" Suga said in his speech, hinting at China's growing assertiveness in the area.\n",
      "\tJapan already has defence equipment transfer deals with the U.S., Britain and Malaysia, among other countries. Vietnam is a 12th partner, while Japan is still negotiating deals with Indonesia and Thailand. In its first actual delivery of such exports, Japan in August exported a radar surveillance system to the Philippines.\n",
      "\tDetails of possible equipment sales were not mentioned, but Suga called the agreement \"a major step\" for a bilateral defenceco-operation, saying he expects further developments.\n",
      "\tJapan partially lifted its ban on military equipment and technology transfer in 2014 as part of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's efforts to build Japan's defence capabilities.\n",
      "\tSuga and Phuc signed other agreements to co-operate in a range of economic fields and on anti-terrorism measures.\n",
      "\tThe two sides also agreed to ease entry bans and allow short-term business visits and reopen flights between Vietnam and Japan. Such travel has been very tightly restricted due to the pandemic, but both countries have managed to somewhat stabilize COVID-19 outbreaks.\n",
      "\tSuga also promised to provide support for Vietnamese workers in Japan affected by the pandemic's hit to the economy. Vietnamese accounts for more than half of the foreign workers Japan has accepted in recent years to make up for its declining and aging population.\n",
      "\tJapan is one of Vietnam's top trading partners with two-way trade of $28.6 billion so far this year. Japan is also Vietnam's largest overseas aid donor, providing $23 billion as of 2019 and accounting for more than a quarter of Vietnam's foreign loans.\n",
      "\tThe government has been trying to entice Japanese companies to invest in Vietnam and other Southeast Asian countries to lessen Japan's dependence on manufacturing and other businesses in China.\n",
      "\tOn Monday, Japan and Vietnam agreed on the need to co-operate on diversifying supply chains -- a lesson Japan learned from its dire shortages of surgical masks and protective gowns earlier this year due to heavy dependence on Chinese imports.\n",
      "\tIn August, Vietnam agreed to buy six coast guard patrol boats worth $345 million from Japan. The country is seeking to improve its maritime defences amid China's continuing development and militarization of artificial islands in contested waters of the South China Sea.\n",
      "\tProgress in talks between ASEAN and China over the disputes appears to be at a standstill.\n",
      "\tSuga's predecessor Abe also chose Vietnam as the first country he visited after taking office. Suga is the first foreign head of a state to visit Vietnam since the country closed its borders to contain COVID-19.\n",

      "\tChina's shaky economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic is gaining strength as consumers return to shopping malls and auto dealerships while the United States and Europe endure painful contractions.\n",
      "\tThe world's second-largest economy expanded by 4.9% over a year ago in the three months ending in September, official data showed Monday. Retail spending rebounded to above pre-virus levels for the first time and factory output rose, boosted by demand for exports of masks and other medical supplies.\n",
      "\tThe recovery is broadening out and becoming less reliant on government stimulus, Julian Evans-Pritchard of Capital Economics said in a report. He said growth is \"still accelerating\" heading into the present quarter.\n",
      "\tChina, where the pandemic began in December, became the first major economy to return to growth after the ruling Communist Party declared the disease under control in March and began reopening factories, shops and offices.\n",
      "\tIt is the only major economy that is expected to grow this year while activity in the United States, Europe and Japan shrinks.\n",
      "\tThe Chinese economy expanded by 3.2% over a year earlier in the three months ending in June, rebounding from the previous quarter's 6.8% contraction, its worst performance since at least the mid-1960s.\n",
      "\tThe economy \"continued the steady recovery,\" the National Bureau of Statistics said in a report. However, it warned, \"the international environment is still complicated and severe.\" It said China faces great pressure to prevent a resurgence of the virus.\n",
      "\tAuthorities have lifted curbs on travel and business but visitors to government and other public buildings still are checked for the virus's telltale fever. Travelers arriving from abroad must be quarantined for two weeks.\n",
      "\tLast week, more than 10 million people were tested for the virus in the eastern port of Qingdao after 12 cases were found there. That broke a two-month streak with no virus transmissions reported within China.\n",
      "\tIndustrial production rose 5.8% over the same quarter last year, a marked improvement over the first half's 1.3% contraction. Chinese exporters are taking market share from foreign competitors that still are hampered by anti-virus controls.\n",
      "\tRetail sales rose 0.9% over a year earlier. That was up from a 7.2% contraction in the first half as consumers, already anxious about a slowing economy and a tariff war with Washington, put off buying. Online commerce rose 15.3%.\n",
      "\tIn a sign demand is accelerating, sales in September rose 3.3%.\n",
      "\t\"China's recovery in private consumption is gathering momentum,\" said Stephen Innes of AxiCorp in a report.\n",
      "\tChina has reported 4,634 coronavirus deaths and 85,685 confirmed cases, plus three suspected cases.\n",
      "\tEconomists say China is likely to recover faster than other major economies due to the ruling party's decision to impose the most intensive anti-disease measures in history. Those temporarily cut off most access to cities with a total of 60 million people.\n",
      "\tThe International Monetary Fund is forecasting China's economic growth at 1.8% this year while the U.S. economy is expected to shrink by 4.3%. The IMF expects a 9.8% contraction in France, 6% in Germany and 5.3% in Japan.\n",
      "\tPrivate sector analysts say as much as 30% of China's urban workforce, or up to 130 million people, may have lost their jobs at least temporarily. They say as many as 25 million jobs might be lost for good this year.\n",
      "\tThe ruling party promised in May to spend $280 billion on meeting goals including creating 9 million new jobs. But it has avoided joining the United States and Japan in rolling out stimulus packages of $1 trillion or more due to concern about adding to already high Chinese debt.\n",

      "\tThe threat of a possible snap election will be hovering over Parliament Hill this week as opposition parties resume their fight with the Liberal government over the WE controversy and preparations for the second wave of COVID-19.\n",
      "\tConservative health critic Michelle Rempel Garner on Sunday called for a House of Commons committee to investigate what she suggested was Ottawa's lack of readiness in dealing with the recent resurgence in COVID-19 cases.\n",
      "\tThe request was in relation to a motion that she made to the Commons health committee earlier this month asking for a wide-ranging study on the issue, which is expected to be debated by committee members on Monday.\n",
      "\t\"Today, as businesses are closed and in another series of COVID-related economic shutdowns, we are looking for answers as to why the federal government left Canadians unprepared to deal with this second wave,\" Rempel Garner told a news conference.\n",
      "\t\"That's why this study is so important. Canadians deserve an explanation about why the federal government only has an economic shutdown to rely upon after months, and billions of dollars being spent.\"\n",
      "\tAmong the issues the Tories want studied are Ottawa's efforts to buy personal protective equipment, why rapid COVID-19 tests have not been approved as well as the decision to shutter Canada's pandemic early-warning system last year.\n",
      "\tYet the real drama will surround ongoing opposition efforts to dig into the government's decision in the spring to have WE Charity run a multimillion-dollar federal program for student volunteers during the pandemic.\n",
      "\tThe Conservatives are scheduled to have what is known as an opposition day on Tuesday, and have indicated they plan to raise one of three issues in the House of Commons that will be put to a vote.\n",
      "\tTwo relate to China and are non-binding on the government. One calls for Ottawa to impose sanctions on Chinese officials for recent crackdowns on protesters in Hong Kong, and the other to ban Huawei from Canada's 5G network.\n",
      "\tBut the third, if supported by the three main opposition parties, would roll several committee investigations into the WE deal -- and the charity's payments to members of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's family -- into one special committee.\n",
      "\tRempel Garner was noncommittal on Sunday when asked if the Tories planned to push for what they are describing as an \"anticorruption committee,\" saying the party still has another day to decide.\n",
      "\t\"But one way or the other, we are going to get answers on this issue,\" she added. \"These documents should come to light.\"\n",
      "\tThe comments follow Liberal filibusters on the Commons' ethics and finance committees last week as opposition members tried to resurrect two WE investigations suspended when Trudeau prorogued Parliament in August.\n",
      "\tThe finance committee was tied up for hours Thursday over a Conservative motion denouncing redactions to more than 5,000 pages of WE-related documents released last August.\n",
      "\tThe ethics committee was similarly stalled over a Conservative motion demanding the agency that arranged speaking events for Trudeau, his wife, mother and brother, turn over receipts for all the Trudeaus' paid engagements over the past 12 years.\n",
      "\tThe Liberals have since proposed their own special committee that would examine billions of dollars in federal spending related to COVID-19, which is closer to what the federal NDP have wanted.\n",
      "\tAt the same time, Government House Leader Pablo Rodriguez on Friday suggested that if the Conservatives push ahead with their motion on Tuesday to create a new committee, the Liberals could make the matter a confidence vote.\n",
      "\tThat would mean a possible snap election if the Conservatives, NDP and Bloc Quebecois all supported the Tories' move to create an anticorruption committee, which would also look at what the Tories describe as other \"scandals or potential scandals.\"\n",
      "\tThe other potential scandals include allegations that the husband of Trudeau's chief of staff may have benefited from the government's program for commercial rent relief and improperly lobbied for changes to the emergency wage-subsidy programs -- which federal ethics commissioner Mario Dion has already dismissed as speculative and without evidence.\n",
      "\tThey also include a contract given to former Liberal MP Frank Baylis's company for ventilators not yet approved by Health Canada.\n",
      "\tThe Bloc did not respond to a request for comment on Sunday.\n",
      "\tNDP ethics critic Charlie Angus dismissed Rodriguez's threat, saying it would be \"one of the most irresponsible things anybody's ever done in the history of Canada\" to plunge the country into an election now.\n",
      "\t\"Given the fact that our COVID-19 numbers are going off the charts right now, that the government would even threaten to plunge us into the chaos of an election ... in order to avoid answering questions on the Trudeau relationship with WE, that would be so staggeringly irresponsible, I can't think that he could be serious.\"\n",
      "\tAnd while Angus indicated an openness to the Liberal proposal for a COVID-19 committee, he suggested opposition parties were getting tired and frustrated at what he described as the government's stonewalling over the WE controversy.\n",
      "\t\"The Liberals have said publicly that they're ready to work on establishing the committee,\" he said. \"Everybody's waiting to see if the Liberals are serious. If they're not serious, it's just going to make the opposition party's even more frustrated.\"\n",

      "\tThe law, which will apply to all companies in China, was passed Saturday by the National People's Congress Standing Committee and will take effect on Dec. 1.\n",
      "\tUnder the law, China can take “reciprocal measures” toward countries or regions that abuse export controls and threaten its national security and interests.\n",
      "\tExport controls under the law will apply to civilian, military and nuclear products, as well as goods, technologies and services related to national security. A list of controlled items will be published “in a timely manner” in conjunction with relevant departments, according to the law.\n",
      "\tThe new law allows Beijing to retaliate against the U.S., which in recent months has attempted to block Chinese technology firms such as telecommunications gear supplier Huawei, Bytedance's TikTok app and Tencent's messaging app WeChat on grounds of posing a national security threat, including the data they may possess from operating in the country.\n",
      "\tCompanies and individuals who endanger national security by breaching the new export control law, including those outside of China, could face criminal charges. Violations of the law, such as exporting items without a permit, could result in fines of 5 million yuan (US$746,500), or up to 20 times the business value of the illegal transaction.\n",
      "\tThe new law adds to the growing uncertainty of Bytedance's deal to sell its video app TikTok to U.S. firm Oracle Corp. In August, China added technologies including voice recognition, text analysis and content recommendation to its list of regulated exports.\n",
      "\tPresident Donald Trump had earlier ordered Bytedance to sell its U.S. operations of TikTok to an American firm or face a block in the country.\n",

      "\tDisney+ subscribers who log on to watch classic films like \"Lady and the Tramp\" or \"Peter Pan\" now see stronger advisory messages warning of racist content.\n",
      "\t\"As part of our ongoing commitment to diversity and inclusion, we are in the process of reviewing our library and adding advisories to content that includes negative depictions or mistreatment of people or cultures,\" Disney said in a statement online.\n",
      "\t\"Rather than removing this content, we see an opportunity to spark conversation and open dialogue on history that affects us all,\" it added.\n",
      "\tThe 1955 animated comedy \"Lady and the Tramp\" carries an advisory because of its depiction of Siamese cats in a way that perpetuates anti-Asian stereotypes.\n",
      "\tDisney says the advisory is not new, but it has now been updated and strengthened for this and other films.\n",
      "\tLast year, CNN reported that Disney had issued a warning on some movies, such as \"Dumbo,\" that they featured \"outdated cultural depictions.\"\n",
      "\tAt that time, the description of these films in the streaming service's menu included a warning that \"this program is presented as originally created. It may contain outdated cultural depictions.\"\n",
      "\tNow, once viewers press play, they see the following message, which cannot be fast forwarded: \"This programme includes negative depictions and/or mistreatment of people or cultures. These stereotypes were then and are wrong now. Rather than remove this content, we want to acknowledge its harmful impact, learn from it and spark conversation to create a more inclusive future together.\"\n",
      "\t\"Disney is committed to creating stories with inspirational and aspirational themes that reflect the rich diversity of the human experience around the globe.\"\n",
      "\tViewers are then directed to a page on the company's website headlined \"Stories Matter,\" which explains the revised policy.\n",
      "\tThe site highlights some of the films that carry the advisory, explaining why they have been selected.\n",
      "\tOf the 1970 film \"The Aristocats,\" it says: \"The cat is depicted as a racist caricature of East Asian peoples with exaggerated stereotypical traits such as slanted eyes and buck teeth. He sings in poorly accented English voiced by a white actor and plays the piano with chopsticks. This portrayal reinforces the 'perpetual foreigner' stereotype, while the film also features lyrics that mock the Chinese language and culture.\n",
      "\t\"Dumbo,\" released in 1942, includes a warning because of the crows, which \"pay homage to racist minstrel shows, where white performers with blackened faces and tattered clothing imitated and ridiculed enslaved Africans on Southern plantations.\"\n",
      "\tIt adds: \"The leader of the group in Dumbo is Jim Crow, which shares the name of laws that enforced racial segregation in the Southern United States. In 'The Song of the Roustabouts,' faceless Black workers toil away to offensive lyrics like 'When we get our pay, we throw our money all away.'\"\n",
      "\t\"Peter Pan,\" which hit movie theaters in 1953, \"portrays Native people in a stereotypical manner that reflects neither the diversity of Native peoples nor their authentic cultural traditions.\"\n",
      "\tAmong the other films highlighted are \"The Jungle Book,\" \"Fantasia,\" live-action movie \"The Swiss Family Robinson\" and \"Aladdin,\" which was made as recently as 1992.\n",
      "\tDisney is not the first studio to add an advisory on old titles that feature racist attitudes or other troubling content.\n",
      "\tFor example, Warner Bros., which is owned by CNN's parent company, WarnerMedia, used this advisory on an old \"Tom and Jerry\" release: \"The cartoons you are about to see are products of their time. They may depict some of the ethnic and racial prejudices that were commonplace in American society. These depictions were wrong then and are wrong today. While these cartoons do not represent today's society, they are being presented as they were originally created, because to do otherwise would be that same as claiming these prejudices never existed.\"\n",

      "CONTENT : WASHINGTON, D.C. -- \n",
      "\tThis article was featured in the Nightly Briefing newsletter, CTV News' evening reading recommendation. You can sign up here to receive it each weekday night.\n",
      "\tMore than a hundred kilometres from shore, near the coast of West Africa, I accompanied marine police officers from Gambia as they arrested 15 foreign ships for labour violations and illegal fishing over the course of a week in 2019. All but one of the vessels arrested were from China.\n",
      "\tAt the beginning of that same year, during a month-long voyage on a toothfish longliner headed into Antarctic waters from Punta Arenas, Chile, the only other ships we passed were a dozen rusty Chinese purse seiners that looked barely seaworthy.\n",
      "\tAboard a South Korean squid boat in May 2019, I watched nearly two dozen ships flying Chinese flags make their way single file into North Korean waters, in flagrant violation of United Nations sanctions. They were part of the world's largest fleet of illegal ships: 800 Chinese trawlers fishing in the Sea of Japan, revealed in a recent investigation for NBC.\n",
      "\tAnd this year, more than 340 Chinese fishing vessels appeared just outside the biodiverse and ecologically sensitive Galápagos Marine Reserve. Many of the ships were tied to companies associated with illegal fishing, according to C4ADS, a conflict research firm. Three years prior, a similarly-sized Chinese flotilla arrived in these same waters, and one ship was apprehended with about 300 tons of illegally caught fish, including endangered species, such as scalloped hammerhead sharks.\n",
      "\tWith anywhere from 200,000 to 800,000 boats, some as far afield as Argentina, China is unmatched in the size and reach of its fishing armada. Fuelled primarily by government subsidies, its growth and activities have largely gone unchecked, in part because China itself had historically had few rules governing fishing operations. The dominance and global ubiquity of this fleet raise broader questions about how, why, and at what cost China has put so many boats on the water.\n",
      "\tThe why has long been clear: geopolitical power and food security for China’s 1.4 billion people. As the U.S. Navy has pulled back from the waters of West Africa and the Middle East, China has bolstered its fishing and naval presence. And in places such as the South China Sea and the Arctic’s Northern Sea Route, China has laid claim to prized shipping lanes as well as sub-sea oil and gas deposits.\n",
      "\t“The scale and aggressiveness of its fleet puts China in control,” says Greg Poling, director of the Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, adding that few foreign countries have been willing to push back when China’s fishing boats make incursions into their national waters.\n",
      "\tAs for food security, many of the marine stocks closest to China’s shores have dwindled from overfishing and industrialization, so ships are forced to venture farther to fill their nets.\n",
      " Aerial shot of  crew catching fish, in January 2019, Antarctica. (The Outlaw Ocean Project) \n",
      "\tThe Chinese government says it has roughly 2,600 distant-water fishing vessels, which, according to a recent report by the Stimson Center, a security research group, makes it three times larger than the fleets of the next top four countries—Taiwan, Japan, South Korea, and Spain—combined.\n",
      "\t“Without its massive subsidy schemes, China’s distant water fishing fleet would be a fraction of its current size, and most of its South China Sea fleet wouldn’t exist at all,” Poling says.\n",
      "\tOver the past two decades, China has spent billions of dollars supporting its fishing industry, says Tabitha Grace Mallory, a professor at the University of Washington, who specializes in China’s fishing policies, in email. In 2018, total global fisheries subsidies were estimated to be US$35.4 billion, with China accounting for $7.2 billion of it. The vast majority of that amount went toward what Mallory calls “harmful” subsidies, because they expand rather than contract the size of fishing fleets. This includes those for fuel and for new boats that increase the size of the fleet. Alternatively, a small portion of states subsidies pay for the decommissioning of boats, according to Mallory.\n",
      "\tThe government also helps cover the cost of new engines, of more durable steel hulls for trawlers, and for armed security and medical ships to be stationed at fishing grounds, enabling fishing captains to stay at sea for longer. Chinese fishermen further benefit from government-led fishing intelligence that helps them find the richest waters.\n",
      "\tDaniel Pauly, principal investigator of the Sea Around Us Project at the University of British Columbia’s Institute for the Oceans and Fisheries, explained in email that subsidies have not only increased geopolitical tensions by allowing ships to venture into contested regions.\n",
      "\tPauly said, “They also play a major role in depleting fish stocks as they keep vessels operating that would otherwise be decommissioned.\"\n",
      "\tAs long as fleets are provided financial assistance to overfish, experts say that sustainable fishing is impossible. Already 90 per cent of commercial fish stocks tracked by the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization have been overfished or fully fished—meaning they are past their capacity to sustainably replenish themselves—including the world’s 10 most important commercial species.\n",
      "\tChina is by no means singular when it comes to subsidizing its fishing fleet. More than half of the global fishing industry would be unprofitable at its current scale without government subsidies, according to a 2018 study in Science Advances led by National Geographic Society Explorer-in-Residence Enric Sala.\n",
      "\tJapan spends more in subsidies for fishing on the high seas—the parts of the ocean not under control by any government—than any other country, accounting for about 20 percent of global high seas fishing subsidies—$841 million, Sala’s study shows. Spain accounts for 14 per cent of global fishing subsidies, followed by China at 10 per cent, then South Korea, and the U.S.\n",
      "\tBut when it comes to scale, China is by far the biggest. With more than 800 ships on the high seas, Chinese vessels were responsible for more than 35 per cent of the reported global catch on the high seas in 2014—more than any other country. (Taiwan, with the next highest number of vessels at 593, accounts for about 12 per cent of that catch, and Japan, with 478 ships accounts for less than 5 per cent.)\n",
      " In January 2019, crewmembers on the toothfish longliner sort fish, in Antarctica. (The Outlaw Ocean Project) \n",
      "\tBut subsidies are not just a major reason that the oceans are rapidly running out of fish. In putting too many vessels on the water globally, subsidies can lead to fishing over-capacity, unhealthy competition, territorial disputes, and illegal fishing as captains become desperate to find new, less-crowded fishing grounds.\n",
      "\t“To put it bluntly, this is akin to paying burglars to rob your neighbour’s house,” says Peter Thomson, the UN Secretary-General’s Special Envoy for the Ocean, about the role that subsidies play in encouraging illegal fishing.\n",
      "\tChina ranks as having the world’s worst score when it comes to illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing, according to an index published last year by Poseidon Aquatic Resource Management, a fishery and aquaculture consulting firm.\n",
      "\tStill, China is showing small signs of improvement. Responding to international pressure from ocean conservation groups and foreign governments, the government has begun to tighten control on its fleet in recent years, but conservationists and fisheries experts remain skeptical.\n",
      "\tIn 2016, the government released a five-year plan to cap the number of distant-water fishing vessels to fewer than 3,000 by 2021. It’s unclear whether China has made any progress toward this goal, however, because the government releases little data on ship numbers.\n",
      "\tAnd in June, the Chinese fishing authorities announced they will close squid-catching seasons for Chinese boats in certain South American waters from July to November, citing the need to allow squid populations to replenish. This is the first time China has ever voluntarily closed a fishing season.\n",
      "Chinese pair trawlers anchored in the harbour of Ulleungdo Island in South Korean waters, October 2016, in the Sea of Japan. (The Outlaw Ocean Project)\n",
      "\t“I believe that the Chinese government is serious when they offer to restrict their distant water fleet,” Pauly says. “Whether they can enforce the planned restrictions onto their fleet is another question; indeed, I don’t believe they control their distant-water fleets any more than we control ours in the West.”\n",
      "\tWith a rapidly growing middle class that’s able to afford more seafood, the Chinese government has boosted its aquaculture industry with more than $250 million in subsidies between 2015 and 2019 in an effort to reduce the country’s dependence on wild-caught fish.\n",
      "\tThat move, however, presents a new problem: To fatten up their fish, most fish farms rely on fishmeal, a high-protein powder predominantly made from wild-caught fish from foreign or international waters. Furthermore, aquaculture takes a lot of fishmeal—before a farmed tuna gets to market, for example, it may eat more than 15 times its weight in wild fish in the form of fishmeal.\n",
      "\tOcean conservationists warn that the voracious nature of fishmeal production is accelerating ocean depletion, contributing to illegal fishing, destabilizing the aquatic food chain, and sapping poorer countries’ waters of protein sources needed for local subsistence.\n",
      "\t“Catching large amounts of wild fish to feed a growing demand for farmed fish makes little sense,” Sala says. “A fraction of those wild fish could instead be used to feed people directly, with less impact on ocean life.”\n",
      "\tTo meet the demand for fishmeal and fish oil, Chinese fishing authorities said in 2015 they planned to increase the amount of krill harvested from Antarctic waters from 32,000 metric tons to two million metric tons, though they committed to staying out of “ecologically vulnerable” areas. Krill are a primary food source for whales, and conservationists worry about the knock-on effects of such a high harvest.\n",
      "\tIn addition to the potentially devastating environmental consequences of overfishing and fisheries collapses, so many ships on the sea means more competition for fishing grounds, which can destabilize relationships between countries and lead to violent clashes.\n",
      "\tIn 2016, the South Korean Coast Guard opened fire on two Chinese fishing vessels that had threatened to ram patrol boats in the Yellow Sea. A month earlier, Chinese fishermen rammed and sank another South Korean speedboat in the same area. In the same year, Argentina sank a Chinese boat it claimed was fishing illegally in its waters. Indonesia, South Africa and the Philippines have all had recent run-ins with Chinese fishing fleets. In most of these cases, the Chinese boats were fishing for squid, which represents more than half of the fleet's catch on the high seas.\n",
      "\tOne of the reasons China’s fleet is so bloated is that some of its fishing ships serve purposes other than merely fishing. Part of a so-called “civilian militia,” Poling says, these fishing vessels are dispatched to conflict zones at sea to surveil the waters and occasionally to intimidate and ram fishing or law enforcement boats from other countries. Separate from its subsidies program that supports its distant-water fishing fleet, China has a program that incentivizes boats to operate in disputed waters in the South China Sea as a way to assert China’s claims. They get many of the same benefits as the distant water fleet, plus cash payments because operating in that region is otherwise unprofitable.\n",
      "\tMore than 200 of these militia fishing boats occupy the waters around the South China Sea’s disputed Spratly Islands—an area rich with fish, and possibly oil and natural gas too—to which China, the Philippines, Vietnam, and Taiwan lay claim. Satellite imagery shows that the Chinese fishing boats in the area spend most of their time anchored close together in clusters and are not actually fishing.\n",
      "\t“The only reason that smaller [Chinese] fishermen go out to the Spratlys is because they’re paid to do so,” Poling says.\n",
      "\tThe presence of these fishing vessels has sped the decline of fish around the islands, led to clashes with fishing boats from other countries, and given China cover to build military installations on some of the reefs, further reinforcing its claims to the territory.\n",
      "\tBolstered by subsidies, the Chinese fleet is not only the world’s largest it is also larger than previously recognized. Similarly, the recent discovery of the nearly 800 Chinese trawlers fishing illegally in North Korean waters offers new insight into the disappearance of more than 70 per cent of the squid stock in the Sea of Japan (also known as the East Sea).\n",
      "\tIn sending a previously invisible armada of industrial boats to fish in these banned waters, China has been violently displacing smaller North Korean vessels and spearheading a decline in once-abundant squid stocks. Asked about the findings, documented by novel satellite technology from Global Fishing Watch and confirmed by my 2019 excursion on a South Korean squid boat, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement to NBC that it “conscientiously enforced” the UN Security Council’s North Korea resolutions and has “consistently punished” illegal fishing, but it neither confirmed nor denied the presence of Chinese ships there.\n",
      "\tPartly because they travel in groups and sometimes with armed security, Chinese fishing ships are often aggressive toward competitors or perceived threats. I saw this up close after paying my way onto a South Korean squid ship and heading offshore in the Sea of Japan where I hoped to document the presence of illegal Chinese squidders.\n",
      "\tOur captain was a short and wiry man, roughly 70 years old, with deep-set eyes and skin weathered like an elephant. On the morning of our scheduled departure, the hired crew told the captain that they would not be working the trip. They said they were too nervous about being associated with any reporting related to North Korea and about getting near Chinese fishing ships.\n",
      "\tThe captain said we could still go to sea with just his first mate, but the ship would be tough to manage, dirtier than normal, and we would need to help him when asked.\n",
      "\tStinking of rotten chum and skating-rink slippery from prior catch, the deck of the 60-foot long wooden vessel was a mess. Crew quarters were trashed, and the ship engine conked out on us several hundred miles from shore, leading to a tense two hours until it was fixed.\n",
      "\tShortly after nightfall on our very first day offshore, the blip of a boat appeared on our radar. We raced to catch up with what turned out to be not just one ship but nearly two dozen, all heading single-file from South Korean waters into North Korean waters. All were flying Chinese flags, and none with their transponders turned on, as required in South Korean waters.\n",
      "\tWe followed the boats, filmed them, documented their identification numbers, and after about 45 minutes, we put a drone in the air to get a better look at the ships. In response, one of the Chinese boat captains blared his horn, flashed his lights, and then abruptly cut toward us in a ramming maneouvre—a warning. We stayed our course, but the Chinese ship continued toward us. When it reached within 30 feet of us, we suddenly veered to avoid collision.\n",
      "\tThis was as much as our captain wanted to risk. Deciding it was too dangerous to continue, he turned our ship around and began the eight-hour trip back to port, during which he seemed unusually quiet and slightly rattled. “They are very serious,” he kept murmuring, referring to the Chinese fishermen, who, undaunted, continued heading into North Korean waters.\n",
      "\tClearly, subsidies had not just grown the Chinese fishing fleet into a global force of unprecedented size and geographic reach. They had also instilled a sense of ambition, drive and boldness that few other countries or their fishing captains were willing or able to challenge.\n",

      "CONTENT : DORCHESTER, ONT.  -- \n",
      "\t For me, one of the best things about chasing bats has been that they’ve consistently taken me to places I’d never otherwise see.\n",
      "\tIn late June, that treasure is the sprawling back patio of a lovely bungalow near London, Ont. There’s a ravine just beyond, and as the setting sun casts shadows on the trees, and Cedar Waxwings bound noisily through the air, we set up nets and cameras in anticipation of the headlining act.\n",
      "\tWe’re here following biologist Paul Faure. The owners of this house have told Faure that they’ve seen bats coming out of the attic, from a hole next to the chimney.\n",
      "\tOur plan is to catch these bats, so that Faure can determine what species they are. He keeps a colony of big brown bats in his lab at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ont. If the bats in this house are big browns too, this house might be a good place to get more individuals for his COVID-19 research.\n",
      "\tIt turns out some bats can live with coronaviruses in their bodies without getting sick at all. Understanding why bats fare so differently when faced with viral invaders than humans could be a game changer in the fight against the pandemic that has already claimed more than a million lives worldwide.\n",
      "\tFaure has teamed up with virologists at McMaster to experimentally determine how such a tiny animal could be so powerful against a virus that kills humans so easily.\n",
      "\tLike Faure, I’m also a bat biologist, and like Faure, I’ve travelled the world learning about bats. In fact, I even once caught vampire bats with Faure in Belize. I’ve found bats in the leaves of palm trees in Madagascar, within hollow trees in Costa Rica, over rivers in the Amazon basin, and under road culverts in Panama. It never gets old.\n",
      "\tThere are more than 1,400 species of bats in the world, and getting up close and personal with them – seeing them in their habitats, photographing them, and learning about their elusive behaviours – is a passion that’s driven me for more than 20 years.\n",
      "\tIn 2011, that journey took me to Touming Cave, near the top of Mount Liantai in the Chinese province of Shandong. I was there to see horseshoe bats. The SARS virus, which I knew had originally come from Chinese Horseshoe bats, was a distant memory by that point, so I wasn’t really thinking about coronaviruses at all. In fact, I wasn’t even wearing a face mask.\n",
      "\tKnowing what I know now, that was pretty foolish.\n",
      "\n",
      "\tThis time around, Faure and I are both wearing masks, as are the members of my W5 crew. We don’t wear masks because we fear diseases from these Canadian bats, but because we have to worry that one of us might already have COVID-19.\n",
      "\tAn asymptomatic carrier among us might give the disease to another person, or perhaps even worse, might give the disease to these native bats, thereby establishing a reservoir of the disease in nature. That would be catastrophic for the bats, and for any hope of containing the disease in the future.\n",
      "\tAs the sun finally sets, Faure’s ultrasonic bat detector – a device that listens in on the echolocation calls of bats – starts to chirp, and there’s movement from the chimney.\n",
      "\tFaure and I run over to lift our net into position. With any luck, we’ll have a bat in hand very soon. Our W5 cameraman lifts the camera onto his shoulder and holds his position. In silence, we wait.\n",
      "\tAfter a short time, a bat hits the net and Faure rushes forward to capture it before it gets away.\n",
      "\tLike I said, It never gets old.\n",

      "\tChina is rapidly increasing the number of people receiving its experimental coronavirus vaccines, with a city offering one to the general public and a biotech company providing another free to students going abroad.\n",
      "\tThe city of Jiaxing, south of Shanghai, is offering a vaccine under development by Sinovac, it said in an announcement Thursday. It said high-risk groups, including people who are \"responsible for the basic operations of the city\" will receive priority, but that residents who have emergency needs can also sign up.\n",
      "\tThe vaccine is in the final stage of clinical testing, but has not yet been approved. The city government said it is being provided under an emergency authorization.\n",
      "\tChina National Biotech Group, another Chinese vaccine company, is offering its vaccine free to students who study abroad in a strategy health experts say raises safety and ethical concerns.\n",
      "\tMore than 168,000 people signed up to receive the vaccine via an online survey and more than 91,000 are being considered, CNBG said on its website. That page had been removed by Tuesday.\n",
      "\tChinese drug companies have five vaccines in final stages of testing but none is approved for public use. They are part of a global race to develop a vaccine that, if successful, offers the fledgling Chinese industry the potential for prestige and worldwide sales.\n",
      "\tTop Chinese health officials have promised a vaccine for the general public before the end of this year.\n",
      "\tCNBG's vaccine has already been given to medical workers and employees of Chinese companies being sent abroad under an emergency authorization for people in high-risk categories. It has given the vaccine to 350,000 people outside its clinical trials, a company executive said in September. The trials have about 40,000 people enrolled.\n",
      "\t\"Currently, it seems Chinese students going abroad have a strong desire to take the vaccine,\" a CNBG employee was quoted as saying by a state-owned newspaper, the Paper, based on the survey results in September.\n",
      "\t\"It's very dangerous over there, the town we study in, it's a red danger zone,\" said a student who goes to school in Poland and gave only her surname, Ouyang. She signed up for the CNBG vaccine in September but hasn't heard back yet. \"We all really want this vaccine.\"\n",
      "\tA student who is due to go to Britain said she signed up via the online link after classmates said they received the vaccine.\n",
      "\tThe student, who would give only her English name, Sally, said she started to hear in September that the vaccine was available to people such as her. She said other students said she might need to travel to Beijing, the national capital, or Wuhan, where the outbreak emerged in December, to receive the vaccine.\n",
      "\tIf the vaccine works, it might help protect students going to Europe or the United States, where the pandemic is still raging, medical experts said. But they said developers need to make clear it is unproven and keep track of what happens to people who receive it.\n",
      "\tIf the vaccine doesn't work, then \"this is giving people a false sense of security,\" said Sridhar Venkatapuram, a specialist in bioethics at King's College London's Global Health Institute.\n",
      "\tThe ruling Communist Party declared the coronavirus under control in March but has warned that the risk of a new outbreak is high. Travelers and visitors to public buildings still are checked for signs of infection. Those arriving from abroad are required to be quarantined for two weeks. The country has reported 4,634 deaths and 85,622 confirmed cases.\n",
      "\tThis week, 10 million people were tested in the eastern port of Qingdao after 12 cases were found last weekend, the government said Friday. That ended a nearly two-month period with no local virus transmissions reported within China.\n",
      "\tIt was unclear whether Chinese students were being offered the CNBG vaccine under the same emergency authorization that residents of Jiaxing were.\n",
      "\tThe agency that oversees drug and vaccine approvals, the National Medical Products Administration, did not respond to questions sent by fax. CNBG did not respond to a request for comment.\n",
      "\tThe final stage of clinical trials, conducted on larger groups, is used to find any rare side effects and study the effectiveness of a treatment. The first and second stage trials are meant to determine whether a vaccine or treatment is safe.\n",
      "\t\"The manufacturer has an obligation to obtain follow-up information\" from people who receive a vaccine under emergency use, K. Arnold Chan, a National Taiwan University expert on drug regulation, said in an email.\n",
      "\tFailing to do that \"is irresponsible and not compliant with international standards,\" he wrote.\n",
      "\tMore than 600,000 Chinese students studied abroad before the pandemic, according to Ministry of Education figures. They make up a large share of the foreign student body in the United States, Britain, Australia and some other countries.\n",
      "\tWestern universities are \"not protecting their students,\" Venkatapuram said. \"The company is basically offering its citizens protection going outside of China, which in essence is what any country would ideally be doing.\"\n",

      "\tChina’s Ambassador to Canada Cong Peiwu is denying that his country is engaged in “coercive diplomacy” as Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has suggested, but says that releasing Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou would “simply” help bilateral relations.\n",
      "\t“There is no coercive diplomacy on the Chinese side,” Cong said Thursday, responding to a comment Trudeau made earlier this week.\n",
      "\t\"We will remain absolutely committed to working with our allies to ensure that China's approach of coercive diplomacy, its arbitrary detention of two Canadian citizens, alongside other citizens of other countries around the world, is not viewed as a successful tactic by them,\" Trudeau said on Tuesday.                          \n",
      "\tDuring a press conference reflecting on the 50th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Canada, Cong continuously denied that the detention of Canadians Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor in China was at all related to Canada’s arrest of Meng. \n",
      "\tCanada has called the two Michaels’ detention—which came just days following Meng’s arrest— “arbitrary” but from China’s perspective the arbitrary detention was that of Meng.\n",
      "\tCong said the two cases are “not related,” and urged Canada to “make the right decision” quickly and it would bring Canada-China relations back on good footing. \n",
      "\tCong told reporters that over the last 50 years Canada and China have made “great progress” but that right now the two countries are experiencing “severe difficulties.” \n",
      "\tThe tensions between the two countries have been continuously expressed in the nearly two years it’s now been since Meng was put into custody. She remains on house arrest in Vancouver, where she is waiting for her case to proceed through the court system. \n",
      "\tThe ambassador said Thursday that the U.S. has acted “like a troublemaker,” and Canada “served as an accomplice” in the arrest of Meng. Questions around whether Canada was right to have acted on the December 2018 U.S. extradition request have been raised since it happened. \n",
      "\tLast week, in an interview on CTV’s Question Period, former White House national security adviser John Bolton said it was “true” that U.S. President Donald Trump viewed Canada as a political pawn in trade dealings with China. \n",
      "\tCanadian officials have continually justified the decision as one based in an obligation to uphold the rule of law and bilateral agreements.\n",
      "\tThough, Canada has stated that China has not obeyed the same obligations of upholding conventions that include allowing regular consular access to Canadians detained in China. \n",
      "\tAsked why Kovrig and Spavor were not granted any consular visits or access until this past weekend when Dominic Barton, Canada's ambassador to China was allowed to hold virtual visits with both men, Cong referenced the fact that they have been accused of conducing acts endangering Chinese national security, and cited the COVID-19 pandemic as the reason for their access to the outside world being cut off even further than it was already. \n",
      "\tThe pandemic is a justification Canadian politicians don’t buy, but nevertheless Cong restated that “the only reason that the consular access had been suspended for a while was because of the raging COVID-19.” \n",
      "\t“We are doing what we can within our legal system to ensure their lawful rights. So, we have been honouring the Vienna Convention, and the relevant bilateral agreements between China and Canada,” Cong said. \n",
      "\tHe was unable to provide any additional details or evidence to substantiate China’s charges against the two men, but said the legal process would unfold in due course. \n",
      "\tReflecting on the conditions that the two Michaels have now been in for more than 650 days, Jon Dunbar—a friend of Spavor—said that if anyone could survive in detention, it’s his friend.\n",
      "\t“I've been willing to bet he's getting pretty good at speaking Chinese, and probably any Chinese guards that he interacts with like him. He's just that kind of guy,” Dunbar said in an interview with CTV News. \n",
      "\tHe has been sending his friend books, which he is hopeful have actually gotten into his hands. \n",
      "\tFriends with Spavor since 2006, Dunbar said Spavor has requested “escapist” fiction books and books so he could practice his Korean language skills. \n",
      "\t“I can't imagine what that does to your, you know, your outlook on life and your personality to be in that condition for almost two years,” he said.\n",
      "\tFormer Canadian ambassador to China Guy Saint-Jacques agrees with Trudeau that what China is engaging in, is coercive diplomacy and is putting “all kinds of pressure” on Canada to agree to their request of Meng’s release.\n",
      "\tHe said the only short-term hope for a change is if there is a change in the U.S. presidency after Nov. 3 and Joe Biden would take a different approach in dealing with China, potentially abandoning the case against Meng, though the likelihood of that is uncertain.\n",
      "\t“Otherwise, we have to assume that the extradition process of businessman will drag on for many years. And that means that at some point the Chinese will decide to start the trial of our Canadians… Unless there is a miracle—and I don’t know what it could be at this stage—I think we have to brace ourselves for years of difficult relations and for them to be held in difficult conditions, unfortunately for many years.”\n",

      "\tCyprus' parliamentary speaker has resigned after an undercover news report allegedly caught him on tape promising to help circumvent the country's rules on granting citizenship to foreign investors.\n",
      "\tDemetris Syllouris had initially decided to stay on as speaker but abstain from his duties until investigations ran their course.\n",
      "\tSyllouris, who had a 28-year record of service as a lawmaker, said Thursday he had not wanted to quit because it would appear as if he was guilty.\n",
      "\t\"I maintain my resolute conviction that I did not violate the law in any way,\" he said in a statement.\n",
      "\tThe scandal erupted after news outlet Al Jazeera's investigative unit used hidden cameras to show Syllouris and others promising to a man posing as a representative for the Chinese investor to find ways of skirting Cyprus's rules on buying citizenship.\n",
      "\tUnder Cyprus's \"golden passport\" program, a foreigner can get citizenship by investing at least 2.5 million euros ($2.93 million) in the country. Such programs, which exist in several small EU countries, have raised broad concern about money laundering and other crimes.\n",
      "\tIn the news report, Syllouris allegedly agreed to help the fictitious Chinese man even though he had a money laundering conviction against him.\n",
      "\tThe report caused a public outcry and the Cypriot government announced that the \"golden passport\" program would be scrapped on Nov. 1.\n",
      "\tThe sting also implicated a veteran lawmaker, a high-profile lawyer, real estate agents and others.\n",
      "\tThe lawmaker, Christakis Giovanis, on Tuesday resigned his parliamentary seat and quit his duties as a member of the communist-rooted AKEL party.\n",
      "\tGiovanis and lawyer Andreas Pittadjis strongly denied the allegations, saying they were fully aware that the whole thing was bogus and they only played along to extract more information in order to file a report with Cypriot law enforcement.\n",
      "\tCyprus' attorney-general has ordered an \"in-depth police investigation\" to determine if any criminal acts had been committed.\n",
      "\tPeople took to social media to voice their \"disgust\" and \"shame\" over the news report's revelations. On Wednesday, hundreds demonstrated outside the parliament to call for Syllouris' resignation.\n",
      "\tThe program has attracted many foreigner investors because a Cypriot passport automatically grants its holder access to the entire 27-member European Union. Around 4,000 Cypriot passports have been issued to investors under the program, generating more than 7 billion euros ($8.25 billion).\n",
      "\tThe European Commission said it is looking into launching infringement proceedings against Cyprus.\n",
      "\tThe Cypriot government had defended the program while admitting to \"mistakes\" it said it rectified. New laws tightened the vetting rules and made it easier to revoke citizenship from investors found to have lied about previous criminal convictions.\n",
      "\tBut the investigative report was the coup-de-gras for the program.\n",
      "\tAn independent committee is conducting a probe into thousands of applications that were made since 2007. The investment program had gathered pace after 2013, when a financial crisis nearly brought Cyprus to bankruptcy.\n",

      "\tHong Kong and Singapore plan to open an \"air travel bubble\" that allows residents to travel between the two Asian hubs without requiring quarantine or restrictive control measures, authorities announced on Thursday.\n",
      "\tOpen travel in both the Chinese city and the Southeast Asian country has been suspended for months. When the coronavirus pandemic hit, both governments shut borders and denied entry to most non-residents and short-term visitors. In Hong Kong, returning residents are required to undergo a 14-day quarantine and wear an electronic bracelet to track their location.\n",
      "\tBut both cities have managed to get their COVID outbreaks under control, and reported low numbers of local infections in the past few months -- which is why they agreed in principle to the travel bubble plan during discussions on Wednesday, according to the statement.\n",
      "\t\"This is a milestone in our efforts to resume normalcy while fighting against the long-drawn battle of COVID-19,\" said Edward Yau, Hong Kong's Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development, in the statement.\n",
      "\tOng Ye Kung, Singapore's Minister for Transport, called it a \"significant\" move forward.\n",
      "\t\"It is a safe, careful but significant step forward to revive air travel, and provide a model for future collaboration with other parts of the world,\" he added.\n",
      "\tThere isn't yet a launch date for the travel bubble, but details will be fleshed out in the coming weeks, they said.\n",
      "\tUnder the travel bubble plan, travelers are required to have tested negative for COVID-19 using a \"mutually recognized\" test.\n",
      "\tThere are no restrictions on travel purpose -- visitors can come and go for business, pleasure, study or otherwise. They will fly on designated flights that only serve travel-bubble passengers.\n",
      "\tCritically, travelers will not be subject to any quarantine or stay-home notice requirements, or a controlled itinerary.\n",
      "\tHowever, this all depends on the COVID-19 situation, the statement added -- if the virus numbers shift in either location, the plan could change with it by increasing or decreasing the number of flights, or even suspending the program.\n",
      "\tThe travel bubble and the low COVID-19 cases reflect a remarkable turnaround in both places.\n",
      "\tHong Kong experienced a third wave earlier this summer, with daily new cases leaping from the single digits up to a peak of 149 in July. Restrictions, which had been slowly easing swiftly came back, with public gatherings capped at two people and a brief total suspension of all dine-in services.\n",
      "\tThe restrictions drew public criticism at times -- construction workers and daily laborers, for instance, were photographed crouching by the sidewalk or near public bathrooms with takeout boxes.\n",
      "\tBut the restrictions also appear to have worked: Hong Kong's new case count had dropped back to about a dozen a day by August, and even reached zero on some days.\n",
      "\tEarlier this spring, Singapore struggled to contain soaring infection numbers, with daily cases surpassing 1,000 a day by April. The vast majority of cases occurred in crowded dormitories for migrant workers, many from South and Southeast Asian countries, such as Bangladesh and India.\n",
      "\tAuthorities put the dorms under total lockdown, relocated infected residents, and implemented other measures like mass testing. The outbreak took months to control, and highlighted the migrant workers' poor living conditions before a global audience -- but cases did gradually fall over the summer. By August, daily case numbers were down to the dozens.\n",
      "\tWith the situation stabilized, Singapore has relaxed its restrictions; apart from the Hong Kong travel bubble, it has also agreed to reopen cross-border travel for essential business with Indonesia, and to partially reopen its land border with Malaysia for business travel.\n",

      "CONTENT : SEOUL, KOREA, REPUBLIC OF -- \n",
      "\tPowered by strong support from avid fans, shares of South Korea's Big Hit Entertainment, the company that manages global pop sensation BTS, soared in their trading debut Thursday in Seoul.\n",
      "\tBig Hit's solid debut after an IPO that netted more than US$800 million was widely expected by analysts given the loyalty of the fan base to the seven-member boy band that has been dominating Billboard charts after gathering a huge following around the globe.\n",
      "\tDespite the concert-killing COVID-19 pandemic, Big Hit has prospered thanks to huge demand for its online content, including livestreamed BTS concerts that reportedly attracted more than 1.7 million fans.\n",
      "\tThe company's shares opened at 270,000 won ($236), about double their initial public offering price. They surged 30%, hitting the daily trading limit, before falling back and closing at 258,000 won ($225).\n",
      "\tBig Hit has a tight grip over its revenue streams, with BTS merchandise and other products exclusively sold through its \"Weverse\" e-commerce platform.\n",
      "\tBig Hit raised 926.6 billion won ($841 million) in what was South Korea's largest IPO since 2017.\n",
      "\t\"The company has managed to grow beyond the traditional revenue sources of album sales and concerts and diversify its business through online channels,\" wrote Ahn Jin-ah, an analyst from South Korea's E-Best Investment and Securities, in a report that described Big Hit's stock market entrance as a \"drop of dynamite.\"\n",
      "\tBTS debuted in 2013 and has a legion of global supporters who call themselves the \"Army.\" It became the first K-pop act to top Billboard's Hot 100 chart last month with their first all-English song \"Dynamite.\"\n",
      "\tThe band -- consisting of J-Hope, RM, Suga, Jungkook, V, Jin and Jimin -- has performed in sold-out arenas around the world and was even invited to speak at the UN General Assembly last month.\n",
      "\tBig Hit's stock market debut came just days after Chinese nationalists erupted in anger at BTS after its leader, RM, thanked Korean War veterans for their sacrifices while receiving a reward for promoting U.S.-South Korea relations.\n",
      "\tChinese internet users and state media took RM's comments as a slap at China, whose soldiers fought alongside North Korea against South Korea and U.S.-led allied forces during the 1950-53 war that was halted by an armistice but no peace treaty.\n",
      "\tBTS has yet to respond to the comments.\n",

      "\tCanada's Ambassador to China Dominic Barton was granted virtual consular access to Robert Schellenberg, a Canadian who is facing the death penalty in China, for the first time since January.\n",
      "\tGlobal Affairs Canada confirmed the news in a statement released Wednesday.\n",
      "\t\"Canadian consular officials continue to provide consular services to him and his family,\" the press release read.\n",
      "\t\"Canada continues to call for clemency for Robert Schellenberg, as we do for all Canadians facing the death penalty.\"\n",
      "\tSchellenberg was initially sentenced to 15 years in November 2018 after being convicted of playing a central role in a methamphetamine smuggling operation in China. However, Schellenberg was re-tried the month after Canada arrested Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou.\n",
      "\tAt the January 2019 trial, he was handed the death penalty. Schellenberg has maintained his innocence since his arrest in 2014.\n",
      "\tCanada has condemned the sentencing, with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau accusing China of \"arbitrarily\" applying the death penalty when the news first emerged.\n",
      "\t\"It is of extreme concern to us as a government, as it should be to all our international friends and allies, that China has chosen to arbitrarily apply [the] death penalty,\" Trudeau told reporters in January 2019.\n",
      "\tChinese officials have denied that the hasty retrial has anything to do with Meng's arrest, though Schellenberg's lawyer Zhang Dongshuo said at the time that it was \"unique\" for a retrial to be held so quickly.\n",
      "\tThe Huawei executive at the centre of the tensions between Canada and China was arrested at the behest of the United States, which had requested her extradition. The move put a target on Canada’s back and plunged relations between Canada and China into the deep freeze.\n",
      "\tIn addition to sentencing Schellenberg to death, China also arrested Canadians Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig in what the Canadian government has described as retaliation -- though China insists otherwise.\n",
      "\tBarton was also granted consular access to Spavor and Kovrig on October 9, marking the first time since January that the two men were allowed to speak to Canadian officials.\n",
      "\tIn addition to Spavor and Kovrig’s arrests and Schellenberg’s death penalty sentence, China also briefly banned the import of Canadian beef and pork, blaming it on a banned animal feed additive they claim was found in a shipment of Canadian pork.\n",
      "\tChinese state-run media has also ridiculed the idea that Meng would be dealt with by an independent judiciary, and Trump has further fuelled Chinese conspiracy theories about political motivations behind Meng's arrest with his comments about potential intervention.\n",
      "\tMeanwhile, Canada has been forced to fiercely defend the independence of its judiciary, despite Chinese pressure for Meng to be returned to home soil — pressure that resulted in what Canadian officials have called the arbitrary detention of the two Canadians in China.\n",

      "CONTENT : TORONTO -- \n",
      "\tCanada is considered one of the top countries in the world when it comes to internet freedom, even as overall digital freedom is experiencing a dramatic erosion globally as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, according to a new report.\n",
      "\tCanada scored 87 out of 100, behind only Iceland and Estonia, on internet freedom in the report published by Freedom House, a U.S.-based research think tank.\n",
      "\tThe score is based on nine key factors, including whether information and communications technology networks are deliberately disrupted, whether laws or directives have been passed that would increase censorship, punishment or surveillance and restrict anonymity, and whether users have been arrested, imprisoned, physically attacked or killed.\n",
      "Germany and the U.K. round up the top five, with scores of 80 and 78 respectively. The United States had a score of 76, with the heaviest deduction coming from the report’s measure on violations of user rights.\n",
      "\tCanada, which also has a “global freedom” score of 98 out of 100, has one of the most open internet environments in the world, the report said, with most of the population able to access reliable and affordable internet access. Canada also has strong laws in place that allow free expression for users and press freedom, according to the report, which acknowledged the country’s failures and shortcomings when it comes to its Indigenous population and other vulnerable groups.\n",
      "\tThe Freedom on the Net 2020 report, written by Adrian Shahbaz, Allie Funk and a network of more than 70 researchers, assessed 65 countries and found that internet users in China, which had a score of 10, had the least amount of freedom for the sixth year running. China's crackdown on protests in Hong Kong and the implementation of the sweeping, vague and broadly defined national security law set an example for other countries. The law allows authorities to take action against any kind of speech or expression it considers an offence.\n",
      "\tChina’s internet controls have inspired countries including Russia to institute regulatory policies that would allow the country to cut off global access during “national emergencies”. Last year, Iran’s government cut off its connection to the rest of the world amid police violence against protestors.\n",
      "\tOverall, the report found that government authorities in many parts of the world have restricted the public’s access to information as a result of the pandemic, with some states spreading false or misleading information to suppress and divert attention from their poor handling of the pandemic, placing the blame on marginalized groups, the report says. New technologies, once considered too intrusive, are now being used by some countries under the guise of the pandemic to justify expanding government surveillance powers, in a way that lacks “transparency, independent oversight and avenues for redress,” researchers said.\n",
      "PANDEMIC CENSORSHIP\n",
      "\tIn many parts of the world, government censorship and crackdowns on free speech have accelerated during the pandemic, preventing users from accessing accurate and factual information, the authors wrote. This access is especially critical for staying informed as well as staying connected during isolation and distancing. But the report found that government authorities have taken actions that put politics above public health, from blocking legitimate websites to completely shutting down internet service for some parts of the population. China’s early coverage of the outbreak in China was heavily criticized due to the government’s effort to control the flow and content of information.\n",
      "\t“Moderators censored millions of pieces of content containing over 2,000 keywords related to the pandemic on the leading communication platform WeChat and the live-streaming platform YY, affecting both criticism of the Chinese Communist Party and innocuous questions or observations about the virus,” the authors said, adding that online outlets had strict orders on how and what to report.\n",
      "\tBeijing set an example for countries including Bangladesh, Egypt, Venezuela, and Belarus, where news and information were censored or blocked, or governments made false claims about the virus and how to defend against the virus. Zimbabwe enacted a law against “false” information on the pandemic with penalties of up to 20 years in prison, while India and Hungary detained citizens for comments online that question or criticize government policies on the pandemic.\n",
      "\tAltogether during the pandemic, the report found that 45 countries had arrested or detained internet users for COVID-19-related speech, 28 countries censored websites or social media posts, 20 countries implemented new laws or expanded existing laws that restricted online speech, and 13 countries imposed some level of internet shutdown.\n",
      "\tNew state powers implemented during emergencies typically do not ease once the original threat has passed, the report warned, pointing to the militarization of law enforcement and the normalization of mass surveillance by governments around the world following the 9/11 attacks.\n",
      "TOMORROW’S SURVEILLANCE STATE\n",
      "\tThe surveillance and crackdown during the pandemic is laying a “dangerous foundation” for surveillance state in the future, the report said, noting that many of the changes that give governments more power come with few checks and balances, if any.\n",
      "\tSmartphone apps collect biometric and geolocation data to facilitate contact tracing and enforce quarantine requirements, but some of these apps lack proper independent oversights that would safeguard users against abuse by governments and private companies, the authors wrote.\n",
      "\tCanada and the United States are among the countries that have launched privacy-by-design contact tracing apps. Privacy by design is a global engineering framework developed by Ann Cavoukian, a former privacy commissioner for Ontario, that incorporates privacy considerations through the entire development process of a technical system.\n",
      "\tCanada’s COVID Alert app, for example, is voluntary and is designed to alert users when they’ve been in close contact with a positive COVID-19 case through random codes and does not identify the user or track their location. Privacy experts who have assessed the app says it has met all privacy and security concerns.\n",
      "\tBut many other countries have taken a different route.\n",
      "\t“Police and private companies are accelerating the rollout of advanced technologies to monitor citizens in public, including facial recognition, thermal scanning, and predictive tools,” they wrote. “These systems have been deployed with little scrutiny or resistance.”\n",
      "\tThe authors cautioned that some of the information being collected could have serious long-term consequences beyond the pandemic in terms of how the information collected could be abused and result in discrimination, such as access to certain health and other public services.\n",
      "\tOverall, at least 54 countries have introduced smartphone apps that offer minimal protections against abuse. There are dozens of contract tracing apps in China, for example, that collect personal data easily accessible by authorities. With the government monitoring public and online spaces, using big data analysis, contact tracing apps, and facial recognition, the country has the most “comprehensive and draconian approach,” to the pandemic, according to researchers. Data terminals are also installed at high traffic locations including train stations and hotels which collect details on an individual’s movements.\n",
      "\tSaudi Arabia has an app that comes with a mandatory bluetooth bracelet for example, and it is reportedly testing a contract-tracing tool created by the same company that provides software to the Saudi government to monitor critics including activists and journalists, like Washington Post’s Jamal Khashoggi, who was killed inside a Saudi consulate in Istanbul in 2018, the authors said.\n",
      "\tSweeping surveillance collection has not been limited to more authoritarian governments either. South Korea’s efforts to contain its outbreak have allowed the government to pull information from credit cards, phone location tracking, and security cameras. The law does come with a sunset clause that requires all pandemic-related data to be immediately destroyed once the “relevant tasks have been completed”.\n",
      "\tEven in the U.S., where location data is anonymized and being collected by various levels of government, the authors caution that records can be “deanonymized” when aggregated with other datasets and analyzed through big-data tools.\n",
      "POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS\n",
      "\tPolicymakers and private sector operators should take steps to ensure a reliable and diverse information space, protect human rights from intrusive surveillance, and promote internet freedom, the authors wrote in a series of recommendations issued as part of the report.\n",
      "\tRecommendations include not banning social media and messaging platforms, ensuring all users have equal access to internet, being transparent and fair when moderating content, not to shut down the internet or ban internet services, implementing strong data privacy legislation and laws that would restrict new surveillance technologies, and ensuring that surveillance programs meant to assist with controlling the pandemic meet human rights standards and have independent oversight.\n",
      "\tThe authors also recommended that policymakers work to include meaningful oversight measures for technology companies, and implement export restrictions on censorship and surveillance technologies.\n",
      "\tMore broadly, educating the public about digital literacy, raising awareness and conducting research on new surveillance technologies, censorship, how content can be manipulated, how to report false content and letting friends and family be aware as well, are also important components to fostering internet freedom, the report said.\n",
      "\t“Civil society organizations should educate netizens about how to spot disinformation and misinformation on social media, addressing topics such as altered content, so-called deepfake videos...inadequate citation,” the authors said.\n",

      "\tPandemic restrictions saw an unprecedented fall in greenhouse gas emissions in the first half of 2020 -- larger than during the 2008 financial crisis and even the Second World War -- experts said Wednesday.\n",
      "\tAs governments ordered lockdowns to try to crush the first wave of COVID-19, CO2 emissions from transport, power and aviation plummeted, the international team of researchers said.\n",
      "\tUsing data including hourly electricity production, vehicle traffic from more than 400 cities worldwide, daily passenger flights and monthly production and consumption figures, they determined that the year-on-year emissions drop of 8.8 per cent was the largest in modern history.\n",
      "\tThey suggested some fundamental steps that could be taken to \"stabilise the global climate\" as countries look to recover from the economic shock of the pandemic.\n",
      "\tThey noted however that emissions had rebounded to their usual levels by July 2020, when most nations had eased lockdown measures.\n",
      "\tZhu Liu from the Department of Earth System Science at Tsinghua University in Beijing said the study was the most accurate yet undertaken on the pandemic's effect on emissions.\n",
      "\t\"We were able to get a much faster and more accurate overview, including timelines that show how emissions decreases have corresponded to lockdown measures in each country,\" said Zhu, lead author of the study published in Nature Communications.\n",
      "\tThe team found that CO2 emissions from transport decreased by 40 per cent in the first half of 2020, and power production and industry emissions fell 22 per cent and 17 per cent respectively.\n",
      "\tWith more people working from home, the study showed a perhaps surprising three percent fall in residential emissions -- something researchers attributed to an abnormally warm winter leading to lower heating consumption.\n",
      "\tIn April, when restrictions on movement and workplaces were at their height, total emissions dropped a whopping 16.9 per cent compared with the same month in 2019.\n",
      "\t\"Overall, the various outbreaks resulted in emissions drops that we only see on a short-term basis on holidays such as Christmas or the Chinese Spring Festival,\" said Zhu.\n",
      "\tAn international plan to limit global warming outlined in the 2015 Paris climate deal aims to cap temperature rises well below 2 C compared with pre-industrial levels.\n",
      "\tThe accord envisages a safer limit of 1.5 degrees of warming -- something the United Nations says would take an annual 7.7 per cent reduction in emissions this decade to achieve.\n",
      "\tThe authors of Wednesday's study agreed with the writers of similar research released in August claiming that the 2020 emissions dip was unlikely to ease the climate emergency in the long term.\n",
      "\tThey said nothing less than a \"complete overhaul\" of the industry and commerce would keep a handle on global warming.\n",
      "\t\"While the CO2 drop is unprecedented, decreases of human activities cannot be the answer,\" said Wednesday's co-author Hans Joachim Schellnhuber, founding director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research.\n",
      "\t\"We need structural and transformational changes in our energy production and consumption systems.\"\n",

      "\tA French museum won backing from scholars on Tuesday for its decision to halt an exhibition about Mongol leader Genghis Khan because of a censorship attempt by the Chinese government.\n",
      "\tThe history museum in the western French city of Nantes announced Monday that it was delaying the opening of the exhibition about the legendary founder of the 13th-Century Mongol Empire by more than three years.\n",
      "\tPreparations for the show, planned in collaboration with the Inner Mongolia Museum in Hohhot, China, ran into trouble after the Chinese Bureau of Cultural Heritage pushed for changes to the original project plan, \"including notably elements of biased rewriting of Mongol culture in favour of a new national narrative,\" the Nantes museum said.\n",
      "\tThe Chinese authorities demanded that certain words, including \"Genghis Khan,\" \"Empire\" and \"Mongol\" be removed from the exhibition, and later asked for control over exhibition texts, maps, brochures and communication, the museum said.\n",
      "\tThe dispute coincides with a tougher Chinese line against ethnic Mongols, who account for about 6.5 million of China's 1.4 billion inhabitants and mostly live in the northern province of Inner Mongolia.\n",
      "\tThe province has seen weeks of protests and school boycotts over a policy requiring schools to teach politics, history, and literature in Mandarin rather than the local language.\n",
      "\t\"The Chinese regime bans historical narratives that don't match its official narratives. And tries to do the same abroad,\" tweeted Valerie Niquet, an Asia specialist at France's Foundation for Strategic Research.\n",
      "\tAntoine Bondaz, a research fellow at the foundation, also backed the museum's decision on Twitter, calling the reported Chinese demands \"crazy\".\n",
      "\t\"The Nantes museum and Hohhot museum had good working relations until Beijing changed its policies and tried to impose its narrative abroad,\" he added.\n",
      "\tThe \"hardening this summer of the Chinese government's position towards the Mongol minority\" prompted the halt of the exhibition, the museum said.\n",
      "\t\"We decided to stop this production in the name of the human, scientific and ethical values that we defend,\" museum director Bertrand Guillet said in a statement.\n",
      "\tThe show, which was to open next week, had already been pushed back to the first half of 2021 because of the coronavirus crisis.\n",
      "\tBut the museum said it was now \"forced to delay this exhibition until October 2024\".\n",
      "\tThis would give it time to build a new exhibition, featuring works from European and American collections.\n",

      "\tChina, Russia and Cuba won seats on the UN's premiere human rights body Tuesday despite opposition from activist groups over their abysmal human rights records, but another target, Saudi Arabia, lost.\n",
      "\tRussia and Cuba were running unopposed, but China and Saudi Arabia were in a five-way race in the only contested race for seats on the Human Rights Council.\n",
      "\tIn secret-ballot voting in the 193-member UN General Assembly on that race, Pakistan received 169 votes, Uzbekistan 164, Nepal 150, China 139 and Saudi Arabia just 90 votes. In 2016, the Saudis won a seat with 152 votes.\n",
      "\tDespite announced reform plans by Saudi Arabia, Human Rights Watch and others strongly opposed its candidacy saying the Middle East nation continues to target human rights defenders, dissidents and women's rights activists and has demonstrated little accountability for past abuses, including the killing of Washington Post columnist and Saudi critic Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul two years ago.\n",
      "\tSarah Leah Whitson, executive director of Democracy for the Arab World Now, the organization founded by Khashoggi, said despite hundreds of millions of dollars spent by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin on public relations \"to cover his grotesque abuses, the international community just isn't buying it.\"\n",
      "\t\"Unless Saudi Arabia undertakes dramatic reforms to release political prisoners, end its disastrous war in Yemen and allow its citizens meaningful political participation, it will remain a global pariah,\" Whitson said.\n",
      "\tUnder the Human Rights Council's rules, seats are allocated to regions to ensure geographical representation.\n",
      "\tExcept for the Asia-Pacific contest, the election of 15 members to the 47-member Human Rights Council was all but decided in advance because all the other regional groups had uncontested slates.\n",
      "\tFour countries won four Africa seats: Ivory Coast, Malawi, Gabon and Senegal. Russia and Ukraine won the two East European seats. In the Latin American and Caribbean group, Mexico, Cuba and Bolivia won the three open seats. And Britain and France won the two seats for the Western European and others group.\n",
      "\t\"Saudi Arabia's failure to win a seat on the Human Rights Council is a welcome reminder of the need for more competition in UN elections,\" Human Rights Watch's UN director, Louis Charbonneau, said after the results were announced,\n",
      "\t\"Had there been additional candidates, China, Cuba and Russia might have lost too,\" he said. \"But the addition of these undeserving countries won't prevent the council from shining a light on abuses and speaking up for victims. In fact, by being on the council, these abusers will be directly in the spotlight.\"\n",
      "\tCharbonneau earlier criticized UN member states, including Western nations, saying: \"They don't want competition. ... Essentially these are backroom deals that are worked out among the regional groups.\"\n",
      "\tLast week, a coalition of human rights groups from Europe, the United States and Canada called on UN member states to oppose the election of China, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Cuba, Pakistan and Uzbekistan, saying their human rights records make them \"unqualified.\"\n",
      "\t\"Electing these dictatorships as UN judges on human rights is like making a gang of arsonists into the fire brigade,\" said Hillel Neuer, executive director of UN Watch.\n",
      "\tThe Geneva-based rights organization published a 30-page joint report with the Human Rights Foundation and the Raoul Wallenberg Center for Human Rights evaluating candidates for council seats. The report lists Bolivia, Ivory Coast, Nepal, Malawi, Mexico, Senegal and Ukraine -- all winners -- as having \"questionable\" credentials due to problematic human rights and UN voting records that need improvement. It gave \"qualified\" ratings only to the United Kingdom and France.\n",
      "\tHuman Rights Watch pointed to an unprecedented call by 50 UN experts on June 26 for \"decisive measures to protect fundamental freedoms in China,\" warning about its mass rights violations in Hong Kong and Tibet and against ethnic Uighurs in the Chinese province of Xinjiang as well as attacks on rights defenders, journalists, lawyers and government critics. Their call was echoed by over 400 civil society groups from more than 60 countries.\n",
      "\tOf the four winners of seats in the Asia-Pacific group, China got the lowest vote -- 139 compared to 180 votes when it won a seat in 2016.\n",
      "\tThe rights group said Russia's military operations with the Syrian government \"have deliberately or indiscriminately killed civilians and destroyed hospitals and other protected civilian infrastructure in violation of international humanitarian law,\" and noted Russia's veto of UN Security Council resolutions on Syria, including blocking Damascus' referral to the International Criminal Court.\n",
      "\tThe Geneva-based Human Rights Council can spotlight abuses and has special monitors watching certain countries and issues. It also periodically reviews human rights in every UN member country.\n",
      "\tCreated in 2006 to replace a commission discredited because of some members' poor rights records, the new council soon came to face similar criticism, including that rights abusers sought seats to protect themselves and their allies.\n",
      "\tThe United States announced its withdrawal from the council in June 2018 partly because it considered the body a forum for hypocrisy about human rights, though also because Washington says the council is anti-Israel.\n",
      "\tU.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Tuesday's election of China, Russia and Cuba and last year's election of Venezuela -- \"countries with abhorrent human rights records\" -- further validate the U.S. withdrawal from the council. He said the U.S. has taken its own actions to punish \"human rights abusers in Xinjiang, Myanmar, Iran, and elsewhere.\"\n",
      "\tIsrael's UN Ambassador Gilad Erdan called on all democracies on the council \"to immediately resign from this shameful and anti-Semitic body.\"\n",
      "\tHuman Rights Council spokesman Rolando Gomez said when the newly elected members start their three-year terms in January, 119 of the 193 UN member States will have served on the council, reflecting its diversity and giving the council \"legitimacy when speaking out on human rights violations in all countries.\"\n",
      "\t\"If a State thinks they can conceal the human rights violations they may have committed, or escape criticism by sitting on the Human Rights Council, they are greatly mistaken,\" Gomez said.\n",

      "\tOttawa police are investigating two hate-motivated incidents targeting Asian men in the past week.\n",
      "\tThe first incident, on Thursday, happened outside a restaurant on Strandherd Drive around 8 p.m.\n",
      "\tThe complainant was eating when he noticed a white Chevrolet Equinox pulling up next to his vehicle, which was parked out front. The driver, described as a 45-60 year old white man, began spitting all over the complainant’s vehicle. When confronted by the complainant, the man drove off, police said.\n",
      "\tIn the second incident, on Friday, the complainant was entering a store at the Rideau Centre when a man told him “being forced to wear a mask makes me want to kill Asians.”\n",
      "\tThe victim, photojournalist Justin Tang, tweeted about the incident.\n",
      "\t\t\tI just got my first COVID related death threat. To my face. For being Asian. In Ottawa. Outside the Rideau Centre. I guess it only took 8 months for that to happen.\n",
      "\tIn that case, the suspect is described as a white man in his 40s, five-foot-10, with a thin build and brown hair.\n",
      "\t“The Ottawa Police is aware of similar incidents in other jurisdictions,” police said. “In partnership with the community, the Service takes these incidents very seriously and they will be fully investigated.”\n",
      "\tData from law enforcement and Chinese-Canadian groups has shown an increase in anti-Asian hate incidents in Canada since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n",

      "\tChinese nationalists erupted in anger at South Korean boy band BTS after its leader thanked Korean War veterans for their sacrifices.\n",
      "\tThe singer, who goes by RM, made the remark in a recorded acceptance speech for an award from the Korea Society for promoting U.S.-Korean relations.\n",
      "\t“We will always remember the history of pain that our two nations shared together and the sacrifices of countless men and women,” RM said in the speech, which included no mention of China.\n",
      "\t“After 70 years, the world we are living in is much closer than before. Boundaries in many aspects are getting more blurred,” RM said. “As members of the global community, we should build a deeper understanding and solidarity to be happier together.”\n",
      "\tChinese internet users and state media took RM's comments as a slap at China, whose soldiers fought alongside North Korean forces during their failed attempt to annex South Korea in the 1950-53 war. They accused RM of ignoring the role played by China in the war, which Chinese Communist Party propaganda blames on the United States, instead of North Korean leader Kim Il Sung's attack on South Korea.\n",
      "\t“Before, I thought some BTS songs were pretty good. Now, they seem to be covered in excrement,” said a commenter on the microblog service Sina Weibo. “Insulting China is absolutely not allowed.”\n",
      "\tAn account titled “BTS Insults China” had been viewed more than 4.5 million times, according to Sina Weibo.\n",
      "\t“Many Chinese netizens pointed out that the speech plays up to U.S. netizens, but the country played the role of aggressor in the war,” said an article in the Global Times newspaper, controlled by the Chinese Communist Party.\n",
      "\tThe attacks reflect Beijing's assertiveness abroad and enduring Chinese sensitivity about the Korean Peninsula.\n",
      "\tAsked about the controversy, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesman, Zhao Lijian, said, “What I want to say is that it should be our common pursuit to take history as a mirror, face the future, cherish peace and promote friendship.”\n",
      "\tThe ruling party uses the entirely state-controlled press to whip up anger against foreign companies, celebrities or governments that take steps Beijing dislikes.\n",
      "\tLast year, Chinese state TV suspended broadcasts of National Basketball Association games after the general manager of the Houston Rockets expressed support for anti-government protesters in Hong Kong. Broadcasts resumed this week.\n",
      "\tIn 2017, Beijing destroyed South Korean retailer Lotte's business in China after the company sold land to South Korea's government to install an anti-missile system opposed by Chinese leaders.\n",
      "\tSince the war, Beijing has helped prop up isolated North Korea with gifts of oil and other aid to maintain a buffer between China and U.S.-allied South Korea.\n",
      "\tOnline Chinese fan groups demanded an apology from BTS and called for boycotts of an upcoming album and promotional events.\n",
      "\tBTS-related products were missing this week from the online stores of Samsung Electronics and sports brand FILA on Chinese e-commerce websites including Alibaba Group's TMall and JD.com.\n",
      "\tGlobal brands have tried to distance themselves from politically touchy issues, especially Taiwan, the self-ruled island claimed by Beijing as part of its territory, and Hong Kong, the scene of pro-democracy protests.\n",
      "\tIn 2016, Hong Kong singer Denise Ho said cosmetics giant Lancome cancelled a concert to distance itself from her pro-democracy activism.\n",
      "\tThe same year, Taiwan-born Korean pop singer Chou Tzu-yu apologized for shaking a Taiwanese flag on South Korean TV after criticism by China.\n",
      "\tBTS has yet to respond, but South Korean fans reacted angrily.\n",
      "\t“BTS fans are from all over the world, so China's bullying will be known to all countries that took part in the Korean War,” said Johnny Kim, a South Korean engineer.\n",
      "\tThe row comes ahead of Thursday's stock market debut of BTS's management company, Big Hit Entertainment.\n",
      "\tHong Kong's most prominent dissident, Joshua Wong, weighed in, criticizing Beijing for “provoking groundless rage and division.”\n",
      "\t“There are still many Korean War veterans around the world, including those from the United States, so it's not reasonable for China to pick a fight over this,” said Min-seong Lee, a student in Seoul.\n",

      "\tCyprus on Tuesday scrapped a lucrative program granting citizenship to wealthy investors amid new allegations that a top state official and a veteran lawmaker were implicated in attempts to bypass strict vetting rules and issue a passport to a fictitious investor with a supposed criminal record.\n",
      "\tCyprus government spokesman Kyriakos Koushos said the Cabinet accepted a recommendation by the minsters of the interior and finance to cancel altogether the \"golden passport\" program that has netted billions of euros over several years.\n",
      "\tKoushos said the decision was based on the Cyprus Investment Program's \"long-standing weaknesses, but also the abuse\" of its provisions.\n",
      "\tHe said the government would in due course look at different ways of attracting foreign investment.\n",
      "\tThe allegations surfaced in an hour-long undercover report by Al Jazeera's investigative unit that used hidden cameras to show Parliamentary Speaker Demetris Syllouris and lawmaker Christakis Giovanis pledging \"full support\" to granting a passport to a fictitious Chinese investor, despite a money laundering conviction against him.\n",
      "\tThe report also showed lawyer Andreas Pittadjis, real estate agents and others outlining to a man posing as a representative for the Chinese investor different ways to skirt background checks, including a name change or granting citizenship through his wife.\n",
      "\tBoth Pittadjis and Giovanis strongly denied the allegations, saying they were fully aware that the approach was bogus and that they only played along to extract more information from the \"representative\" in order to file a report with Cypriot law enforcement authorities.\n",
      "\tEuropean Commission spokesman Christian Wigand said the bloc's executive body is looking into launching infringement proceedings against Cyprus.\n",
      "\t\"We watched in disbelief how high-level officials were trading European citizenship for financial gains,\" Wigand told reporters in Brussels. European Commission \"President (Ursula) von der Leyen was clear when saying European values are not for sale.\"\n",
      "\tWigand said the Commission had frequently raised concerns about such investor citizenship schemes and also directly with Cypriot authorities.\n",
      "\tOutraged Cypriots took to social media to heap scorn on the officials, with many calling for Syllouris' resignation.\n",
      "\tIn a statement on Tuesday, Syllouris said that he would step back from his duties as of next week until an investigation is completed. He apologized for the \"unfortunate picture\" and upheaval that the \"staged and fragmented\" report gave and which allowed his reputation and that of the institution of House Speaker to be sullied.\n",
      "\tThe program has attracted many foreigner investors because a Cyprus passport automatically grants its holder citizenship access to the entire 27-member European Union. Around 4,000 Cypriot passports have been issued to investors under the program, generating more than 7 billion euros ($8.25 billion).\n",
      "\tThe Cyprus government has conceded that \"mistakes\" were made and has beefed up eligibility criteria in recent years. The most recent changes that lawmakers approved in August include new anti-money-laundering vetting rules and making it easier to revoke the citizenship of investors involved in or convicted of a serious crime.\n",
      "\tDespite the stricter rules, the program continued to be hounded by allegations of corruption, kickbacks and favouritism.\n",
      "\tCyprus' Audit Office last month urged lawmakers to rethink legislation that empowered the government to grant citizenship to investors' family members.\n",
      "\tCyprus Security and Exchange Commission recommended last month that authorities revoke citizenship from seven individuals who submitted forged documents in their application.\n",
      "\tAn independent committee has been set up to probe thousands of applications that were made since 2007. The investment program had gathered pace after 2013, when a financial crisis nearly brought Cyprus to bankruptcy.\n",

      "\tChina's vehicle sales including trucks and buses accelerated in September as the industry's biggest global market recovered from the coronavirus pandemic, an industry group reported Tuesday.\n",
      "\tSales rose 17.4% over a year earlier to 2.6 million vehicles, up from August's 11.6% growth, according to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers.\n",
      "\tIt said SUV sales set a new monthly record and purchases of other passenger vehicles also rose but gave no details.\n",
      "\tIn the first nine months of the year, sales declined 6.9% from a year earlier to 17.1 million, CAAM said. That was an improvement over the 9.7% contraction for the first eight months.\n",
      "\tAuto sales already were suffering before China closed factories and dealerships in February to fight the coronavirus. Consumers are uneasy about slowing economic growth and a trade war with Washington.\n",
      "\tLast year's sales fell 9.6% in the second straight annual decline.\n",
      "\tThat hurts global automakers that are looking to China to propel sales growth.\n",
      "\tIt also squeezes cash flow at a time when global and Chinese brands are spending billions of dollars to develop electric vehicles under pressure to meet government sales quotas.\n",

      "\tTokyo has lodged protests to Beijing over the entry of Chinese coast guard ships into Japan's territorial waters off disputed East China Sea islands and their refusal to move out for a third day Tuesday, Japanese officials said.\n",
      "\tThe two Chinese ships entered the Japanese-claimed waters Sunday morning, appearing to approach a Japanese fishing boat carrying three crew members. They have remained there, ignoring repeated warnings and exit demands by the Japanese side, Japanese coast guard officials said.\n",
      "\tChinese coast guard vessels routinely violate territorial waters around the Japanese-controlled southern islands of Senkaku, which China calls Diaoyu and also claims.\n",
      "\tChief Cabinet Secretary Katsunobu Kato said Tuesday that it was \"extremely regrettable\" that the two Chinese coast guard ships were still in Japanese waters. Japan \"strictly protested\" to the Chinese side and demanded that the Chinese ships immediately move out of Japanese waters, Kato said.\n",
      "\tHe said Japan would firmly defend its territorial waters, land and airspace \"with a sense of urgency.\"\n",
      "\tJapanese coast guard officials said the fishing boat with the three crew members was safely protected, but declined to give any other details.\n",
      "\tChina's \"continuous attempt to change the status quo by force\" in the East China Sea where Chinese warships routinely operate and its repeated intrusion into the Japanese waters despite Tokyo's protests is intolerable, Defence Minister Nobuo Kishi said.\n",
      "\t\"But when it comes to the situation surrounding the Senkaku islands, we have to respond calmly in order not to escalate tensions,\" he said. \"We urge China to use self-restraint on any action that would escalate tensions.\"\n",
      "\tThe Japanese government says Japan has had ownership of the islands since the late 1890s under international law. Tokyo also says Beijing started claiming its ownership around 1970 when possible undersea oil deposits near the islands were reported.\n",
      "\tJapan sees China's military development and increasingly assertive stance in the East and South China seas as a major security threat. Japan's military invasion of China in the 1930s and 1940s remains a sore spot between the two sides.\n",
      "\tAt a daily briefing Tuesday in Beijing, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian reasserted China's claim to the islands.\n",
      "\t\"Diaoyu island and its affiliated islands are China's inherent territory,\" Zhao said. \"It is China's inherent right to carry out maritime patrols to enforce the law in the waters surrounding the Diaoyu islands, which Japan should earnestly respect.\"\n",

      "\tRoasted your first-ever turkey this weekend? Or even just did something as simple as coming up with a grocery list—for the first time?\n",
      "\tIf so, that squares with what Quebec researchers say is a wider change in how people in the province, including many men, are approaching cooking.\n",
      "\tThe pandemic is bringing old-school meal planning and home cooking to many Quebecers who weren’t in the habit of doing either, according to data from the first wave’s lockdown.\n",
      "\t“The results show that a large majority of behaviors have significantly changed,” the researchers wrote in a paper published last week.\n",
      "\tAmong the biggest changes, people are increasingly planning out their grocery shopping, spending more time cooking meals, and wasting less food, they found.\n",
      "\tThe paper, whose lead author is Jacinthe Cloutier of Université Laval, came out of a survey conducted in late May of 1,143 adults in Quebec. The respondents were roughly evenly split between men and women, and different age groups and regions were represented.\n",
      "\tThey were asked about 13 different habits around cooking and meals and reported, as a group, big changes in nine of those habits.\n",
      "TWO-THIRDS OF QUEBECERS SPENDING MORE TIME COOKING\n",
      "\tFor example, 61 per cent said they had increased the amount of time spent planning meals and doing grocery shopping.\n",
      "\tForty per cent said they were sticking more strictly to those shopping plans, keeping to what was on their lists.\n",
      "\tIn one dramatic number, 67 per cent of Quebec respondents said they were spending more time cooking. \n",
      "\tThe study’s authors noted that another study from this year, which looked at American and Chinese citizens, found that people reported using cooking as a way to relax or relieve stress.\n",
      "\tOn top of those changes, 63 per cent of the Quebecers surveyed reported they’d cut down on food waste, including by using leftovers more often.\n",
      "\tPerhaps less surprisingly, 76 per cent of respondents said they were making fewer visits to the grocery store, while 27 per cent had increased their online grocery shopping.\n",
      "MEN ESPECIALLY HEADING INTO THE KITCHEN\n",
      "\tThose most likely to change their habits were men, people active in the workforce and people in Quebec regions less affected by COVID-19 at the time, the researchers found.\n",
      "\t“It seems that there are more men increasing their time spent planning and preparing meals,” the researchers wrote. \n",
      "\tMen were also more likely than women to report buying less food in bulk and wasting less food. \n",
      "\t“The results of the present study suggest that when men are more involved in various food tasks, there is less waste,” the researchers noted, citing several studies that support the fact that women remained largely responsible for food management and preparation within the home before the pandemic.\n",
      "\tOne group was largely unchanged in their habits: the elderly. “This could also signify that they already had good practices before the context of spring 2020,” the researchers noted, pointing to research showing that older adults already wasted less food. \n",
      "LOSS OF INCOME IS A FACTOR\n",
      "\tOverall, the findings seem to show that when people are kept home, their food habits improve, the authors said. Changing these kinds of habits can lead to better “food literacy,” they said.\n",
      "\tStill, it’s not all good news, they noted. One major reason for many people’s changing habits was not just confinement at home, but the loss of income during the pandemic and worries about shrinking food budgets.\n",

      "\tChina on Monday denied that two Canadian citizens held for almost two years had been \"arbitrarily\" detained in response to Canada's arrest of an executive of technology giant Huawei.\n",
      "\tForeign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian's denial came days after China granted consular access to Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor for the first time since January. Canada's government on Saturday issued a statement saying it remains \"deeply concerned by the arbitrary detention by Chinese authorities\" of the two, and called for their immediate release.\n",
      "\tZhao said China \"firmly opposes the erroneous statements made by Canada\" and reiterated its claim that Kovrig and Spavor were \"suspected of engaging in activities that endanger China's national security.\"\n",
      "\t\"The Chinese judicial organs handle the case independently according to law. So the label of arbitrary detention cannot be pinned to the Chinese side,\" he told reporters at a daily briefing.\n",
      "\tCanadian attempts to enlist other countries in pressuring China are \"completely futile and will only backfire,\" Zhao said. On Saturday, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and U.S. President Donald Trump discussed Kovrig's and Spavor's cases in a phone call and Trudeau expressed thanks for U.S. support.\n",
      "\tDespite its disavowals of any connection, Beijing has repeatedly tied the detentions to the arrest of Meng Wanzhou, Huawei's chief financial officer and the daughter of the company's founder. The U.S. is seeking her extradition on fraud charges and the case is before Canadian courts.\n",
      "\t\"What Canada did in the case of Meng Wanzhou was arbitrary detention,\" Zhao said.\n",
      "\tBilateral ties have suffered as China has upped its demands that Canada release Meng, who was detained during a stopover in Vancouver in December 2018 and is currently living in one of her mansions in the city while fighting extradition.\n",
      "\tKovrig, a former diplomat, and Spavor, an entrepreneur, were detained days later. Neither had been permitted visits from consular officials amid the coronavirus pandemic.\n",

      "\tChina has been largely coronavirus free since mid-August, with all cases reported by the country imported from elsewhere. But as of October 11, Qingdao has reported a dozen locally transmitted cases, all of which have been linked to a hospital treating imported infections, the city's Municipal Health Commission said in a statement Monday.\n",
      "\tMass testing has already been carried out at the Qingdao Chest Hospital, which has been placed on lockdown, with 114,862 people, staff and patients, having tested negative as of Monday.\n",

      "\tThose responses have been successful in keeping China's overall infection rate low since the country's initial outbreak was suppressed in March. That has enabled life to return to relative normality, with more than 600 million tourists traveling this month for Golden Week, a national holiday around the Mid-Autumn Festival.\n",
      "\tThe cluster in Qingdao, a city on the eastern coast home to numerous beaches and popular with tourists, will raise fears of a potential spike in cases related to the holiday.\n",

      "\tChina can no longer credibly use the \"excuse\" of COVID-19 to continue keeping Canadian diplomats from visiting Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, the Conservative foreign affairs critic says.\n",
      "\tConservative MP Michael Chong also says this past week's virtual consular visits to Kovrig and Spavor should have happened much sooner.\n",
      "\t\"COVID-19 is an excuse that doesn't hold water,\" Chong said in an interview Sunday.\n",
      "\t\"The economy in China has largely reopened,\" he added. \"A direct in-person visit should have already taken place a long time ago with appropriate social distancing.\"\n",
      "\tKovrig and Spavor have been in prison in China since December 2018 in what is widely seen as retaliation for Canada arresting Chinese high-tech executive Meng Wanzhou on an American extradition warrant.\n",
      "\tDominic Barton, Canada's ambassador to China, had internet-based visits with Spavor on Friday and Kovrig on Saturday.\n",
      "\tIt was the first contact Canadian diplomats have had with the two men since in-person visits in mid-January.\n",
      "\tThe Chinese government has said it can't allow in-person visits to prisons because of concerns around COVID-19. The federal government has been pushing China since the spring for an alternative form of access in order to check on the welfare of the two men.\n",
      "\t\"There was absolutely no reason that virtual access couldn't have been offered by China even during the height of the pandemic, and no justification for denying in-person visits after China emerged from lockdown during the summer,\" said David Mulroney, a former Canadian ambassador to China.\n",
      "\t\"This is simply more cruel treatment by China, with the expectation that we will be grateful even for even a half-hearted effort on their part. We shouldn't fall into that trap.\"\n",
      "\tForeign Affairs Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne pressed for virtual access in his own in-person meeting with his Chinese counterpart, Wang Yi, when the two crossed paths in Rome in August.\n",
      "\tUp until January, Canadian diplomats had been able to visit the two men approximately once a month.\n",
      "\tChong reiterated past Conservative criticism of the government's handling of relations with China, saying its approach has lacked coherence, and that Canada should impose targeted sanctions on the people responsible for the imprisonment of the two men.\n",
      "\tBut Chong said he is seeing signs of the government taking a firmer stand against China recently with tougher rhetoric this past week from Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan and Bob Rae, Canada's ambassador to the United Nations.\n",
      "\t\"I think the Liberal government's finally responding to the pressure that the Conservatives have been putting on them,\" said Chong.\n",
      "\tSajjan accused China of engaging in \"hostage diplomacy\" in an online panel discussion, while Rae ripped into his Chinese counterpart in a meeting of the UN General Assembly on Friday for saying that Canada was bullying the People's Republic.\n",
      "\tRae said Meng was living under \"house arrest\" while Spavor and Kovrig \"have been living in terrible conditions, without consular access, without any humane treatment whatsoever.\"\n",
      "\t\"This is something which we shall never forget,\" Rae added.\n",
      "\t\"If you think that insulting us or insulting my country or insulting anyone is going to help in resolving the situation, you're sadly mistaken.\"\n",
      "\tChampagne, too, has ramped up his public criticism of China's human rights record on a number of issues: Beijing's crackdown on dissent in Hong Kong and the forced detention Uighur Muslims in the country's Xinjiang province.\n",
      "\tIn a recent interview prior to the virtual visits with Kovrig and Spavor, Champagne said Canada would continue to push back against Beijing by working with allies.\n",
      "\t\"We need to act together, and we need to be strong together to face what we have seen, a coercive type of diplomacy by China,\" the minister said.\n",
      "\tChampagne said it was significant that the case of the \"two Michaels\" was raised in China's recent summit with the European Union, including in its final communique.\n",
      "\tPrime Minister Justin Trudeau also thanked U.S. President Donald Trump for America's \"ongoing support\" in the effort to free Kovrig and Spavor during a Saturday phone call.\n",

      "\tTaiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen said Saturday she has hopes for less tensions with China and in the region if Beijing will listen to Taipei's concerns, alter its approach and restart dialogue with the self-ruled island democracy.\n",
      "\tSpeaking at Taiwan's National Day celebrations on Saturday, Tsai took note of recent remarks by Chinese leader Xi Jinping in a video message to the U.N. General Assembly that China would never seek hegemony, expansion or to establish a sphere of influence.\n",
      "\t\"As countries in the region and around the world are now concerned about China's expanding hegemony, we hope this is the beginning of genuine change,\" Tsai said in her annual address at the Presidential Office in downtown Taipei.\n",
      "\tIf Beijing can \"heed Taiwan's voice, change the way it handles cross-strait relations, and jointly facilitate cross-strait reconciliation and peaceful dialogue, I believe that regional tension can surely be resolved,\" Tsai said.\n",
      "\tChina's ruling Communist Party claims the self-governing island as Chinese territory to be annexed by force if necessary. Beijing cut contacts with Tsai's government following her election to a first term in 2016 and has steadily increased diplomatic, military and economic pressure on the island of 23 million people to compel her to endorse its contention that Taiwan and the mainland constitute a single Chinese nation, which it refers to as the \"1992 Consensus.\"\n",
      "\tIn Beijing, a spokesperson for the Cabinet's Taiwan Affairs Office responded to Tsai's address by renewing China's demand for concessions and accusing her of \"disrupting the exchanges and co-operation\" between the sides, according to state broadcaster CCTV.\n",
      "\tZhu Fenglian also accused Tsai of \"deliberately misleading the people of Taiwan\" and \"warning the Taiwan authorities to adhere to the 1992 Consensus.\"\n",
      "\tTsai, of the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party, was reelected by a wide margin this spring, and especially since September, China has been sending warplanes and ships into areas under Taiwanese control, prompting the island's air force to scramble its jets at a faster tempo than before.\n",
      "\t\"For some time now, harassment by air and sea from the other side has raised tensions in the Taiwan Strait,\" Tsai said, adding that Taiwan would neither show weakness nor \"act rashly.\"\n",
      "\t\"We are committed to upholding cross-strait stability, but this is not something Taiwan can shoulder alone; it is the joint responsibility of both sides,\" she said. \"As long as the Beijing authorities are willing to resolve antagonisms and improve cross-strait relations, while parity and dignity are maintained, we are willing to work together to facilitate meaningful dialogue.\"\n",
      "\tShe said such an approach was built on a cross-party consensus, a nod to the main opposition Nationalist Party, which although formally advocating unification with China has been downplaying that stance in a bid to stem electoral losses.\n",
      "\tChina's campaign of isolation has seen Taiwan excluded from international gatherings and reduced its number of diplomatic allies to just 15, even while it enjoys strong informal support from the U.S., Japan and other major democracies.\n",
      "\tTsai also praised Taiwan's success in containing the coronavirus outbreak and outlined steps taken to boost its high-tech economy and the military.\n",
      "\tHer speech was bookended by displays of troops and civilian defence forces, as well as bands and dance performances in front of invited guests and members of the public in front of the presidential building that dates from Taiwan's time as a Japanese colony from 1895 to 1945.\n",
      "\tFollowing World War II, Taiwan was handed over to the Republic of China run by Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalists, who moved to the island in 1949 ahead of the Communist takeover of the mainland.\n",
      "\tOct. 10 National Day dates from the start of a 1911 rebellion against the Qing, China's last empire, that led to the establishment of the Republic of China, which remains Taiwan's formal name.\n",

      "\tFormer White House National Security Adviser John Bolton says it was \"true\" that U.S. President Donald Trump viewed Canada as a political pawn in trade dealings with China — though he said the president was the only one in Washington who viewed it that way.\n",
      "\tBolton made the comment in response to a question from CTV Question Period Host Evan Solomon, airing Sunday.\n",
      "\tTensions between Canada and China plunged into a deep freeze following Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou's arrest in December 2018. Canadian authorities arrested Meng in Vancouver after the United States requested her extradition.\n",
      "\tMeng's lawyers have been arguing that Trump poisoned the extradition case when he said he would \"certainly intervene\" if he thought it were necessary in order to secure a trade deal with China.\n",
      "\tDuring the interview, Solomon asked Bolton whether the extradition case shows Canada was being used as a \"political pawn\" in the trade issue between the two giants.\n",
      "\t\"Within the whole U.S. government, that was true in the mind of one person, one person only: Donald Trump,\" said Bolton in response.\n",
      "\t\"A Canadian court, after extensive proceedings, has agreed that our extradition request has met the dual criminality standard that's a prerequisite for extradition…there's only one person in the United States, I think, who doesn't understand that and I think in a few months he won't be president anymore.\"\n",
      "\tAs the extradition case has continued to play out in Canadian courts, Canada has paid the price in the form of much chillier relations with China.\n",
      "\tCanada's arrest of the executive infuriated China, which subsequently arrested Canadians Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig in what the Canadian government has described as retaliation -- though China insists otherwise. China also briefly banned the import of Canadian beef and pork, blaming it on a banned animal feed additive they claim was found in a shipment of Canadian pork.\n",
      "\t\"The U.S. asked for the extradition of Meng Wanzhou when she landed in Vancouver about almost two years ago, [and] Canada’s been going through the extradition proceedings. How did China behave? They seized [two] Canadian citizens in China for no reason at all, not even having a good pretext to detain them,\" Bolton said.\n",
      "\tChinese state-run media has also ridiculed the idea that Meng would be dealt with by an independent judiciary, and Trump has further fuelled Chinese conspiracy theories about political motivations behind Meng's arrest with his comments about potential intervention.\n",
      "\tMeanwhile, Canada has been forced to fiercely defend the independence of its judiciary, despite Chinese pressure for Meng to be returned to home soil — pressure that resulted in what Canadian officials have called the arbitrary detention of the two Canadians in China.\n",
      "BOLTON WORRIES ABOUT TRUMP TAKING 'REVENGE' IF HE LOSES ELECTION\n",
      "\tDuring the interview with Solomon, Bolton also expressed concerns about what could happen if Trump fails in his bid for a second term.\n",
      "\t\"This has been his focus, I think, during the entire first term of his presidency — not policies, but doing things that will get him reelected. And now, obviously, the pressure is on,\" Bolton said.\n",
      "\tThe president's former national security adviser said as the election draws nearer, the \"likelihood of defeat\" is becoming clear to Trump.\n",
      "\t\"In our long transition period before January the 20th, if he loses, I do worry about what steps he might take for revenge or just out of reaction to being a loser — which he hates to be,\" Bolton said.\n",
      "\t\"I think that the transition period in a time of defeat could also be very troubling.\"\n",
      "\tBolton also said the country will need to be \"very careful\" about the transition of power in light of comments Trump has made.\n",
      "\t\"I think what Trump has said, for example, that he couldn't lose unless there were fraud I think that's very dangerous…he could easily lose in a completely free and fair election, so if he's trying to lay the basis to do something illicit, I'm very troubled by that,\" Bolton said.\n",
      "\tDuring a debate with Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden last week, both men were asked whether they would urge their supporters to stay calm, not engage in civil unrest, and commit to a peaceful transition of power.\n",
      "\tTrump would not commit clearly to accepting the result. Instead, he encouraged his backers to be \"poll watchers\" and cast doubt on the validity of the election due to the number of mail-in ballots anticipated.\n",
      "\tPrime Minister Justin Trudeau reacted to this issue on Thursday, saying Canada is \"going to be prepared for various eventualities\" of the election.\n",
      "\tHe added that he is \"certainly hopeful that all will proceed smoothly.\"\n",
      "\tMeanwhile, Bolton has his own hope for the outcome of the November election.\n",
      "\t\"I definitely believe Trump should be a one-term President,\" Bolton said.\n",
      "\t\"I don't think he governs with any philosophy, or strategy, or policy. I've described life inside the White House as like living inside a pinball machine that hasn’t gotten better with age. I believed, when I took on the job as National Security Adviser, that the gravity of the job, the weight of his responsibilities, would have an effect on him. That turned out to be completely wrong.\"\n",
      "'HE JUST LIKES THEM' SAYS BOLTON OF TRUMP'S APPROACH TO TARIFFS\n",
      "\tBolton also shared details of the rationale behind Trump's approach to slapping tariffs on Canada, noting that \"there is no strategy\" and that Trump \"just likes\" tariffs.\n",
      "\tThe comment comes after Trump cited national security as the rationale behind hitting Canada with steel and aluminum tariffs in May 2018, in the middle of new NAFTA negotiations. The tariffs remained in place for a year, during which time Canada fired back with dollar-for-dollar countermeasures on American steel, aluminum, and a surtax on other goods.\n",
      "\tTrump also threatened to slap tariffs on aluminum imports coming from Canada this summer, but reneged on the decision at the eleventh hour as Canada was poised to unveil its countermeasures.\n",
      "\tWhen Solomon pressed Bolton on what the strategy was behind these moves, the former national security adviser said \"there is no strategy.\"\n",
      "\t\"I know this sounds counterintuitive, but Trump likes tariffs. He just likes them, because he can impose them without having to get consent of Congress under various provisions in our trade laws,\" Bolton said.\n",
      "\tHe said that Trump thinks the United States is \"constantly taken advantage of,\" which Bolton noted there might be some legitimacy to, as he said the U.S. trade negotiators \"haven't been the most astute.\"\n",
      "\t\"He wants to show that he can respond strongly. But it has nothing to do with strategy, and it has a lot to do, I think, with him showing how assertive he is.\"\n",

      "\tForeign Affairs Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne said Friday he deplores a statement by Azerbaijan's president that a military solution is the only way to solve his country's current crisis with Armenia.\n",
      "\tThe renewed fighting in the decades-old conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia in the Nagorno-Karabakh region entered its ninth day Friday and will be a key focus of Champagne's second overseas trip in less than two months.\n",
      "\tFriday's announcement of a four-country European tour appeared to underscore Champagne's commitment to project Canada as a defender of human rights while forging alliances with trusted, longtime allies.\n",
      "\tAlong with his British counterpart, Dominic Raab, Champagne has called for a ceasefire in the conflict, saying a negotiated settlement is the only way to end the heavy shelling by warplanes, drones and artillery that has seen both sides trade allegations of indiscriminately attacking civilians.\n",
      "\tOn Friday, Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev said in an address to his country that the conflict is now being settled by military means and political means will have to follow.\n",
      "\t\"I would deplore anyone who thinks that the use of force is the best way to resolve the current conflict. Quite the opposite,\" Champagne said Friday in a conference call from Ottawa.\n",
      "\t\"Conflicts are resolved around the negotiating table, not on the battlefield.\"\n",
      "\tChampagne also spoke Friday to his Turkish counterpart, Mevlut Cavusoglu, days after Canada suspended military exports to the NATO ally. Champagne said he reiterated the public allegations that a targeting sensor made by southern Ontario company is being used in Azerbaijani fighter jets to pummel Armenian targets.\n",
      "\tChampagne has suspended export permits to Turkey, pending the outcome of an investigation into whether the Canadian technology is being used in the skies above Nagorno-Karabakh.\n",
      "\tTurkey is an ally of Azerbaijan, and denies sending its warplanes to the conflict. Champagne would not say whether he learned any more about any potential support or military role Turkey might be playing in the fighting in the conversation with Cavusoglu.\n",
      "\t\"My key message was stay out of the conflict,\" Champagne said.\n",
      "\t\"I certainly urged my Turkish counterpart to play a role in de-escalation, staying out of the conflict, and encouraging Azerbaijan to come back to the negotiating table because we both agreed that there's no military solution to this conflict.\"\n",
      "\tChampagne departs Sunday on a trip that will take him to Greece, Austria, Belgium and Lithuania. He will meet the exiled opposition leader of Belarus as well as hold talks on the fighting between Azerbaijan and Armenia.\n",
      "\tHe will cap the trip with a stop in Vilnius, where he will meet with Belarusian opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, where she is seeking refuge after what Champagne has said was a fraudulent election victory by the authoritarian leader of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, this past summer.\n",
      "\tBessma Momani, an international affairs expert at the University of Waterloo, said there's only so much diplomacy foreign ministers can do behind a computer screen, so Champagne's desire to travel is understandable.\n",
      "\tMomani said it is also smart for Canada to find allies to work on issues in tandem, whether it is the renewed violence between Azerbaijan and Armenia, or its near two-year dispute with China. That has included the imprisonment of two Canadian men in what is viewed as clear retaliation for Canada's arrest of a leading Chinese high-tech executive on an American extradition warrant.\n",
      "\tIn Vienna, Champagne will meet with representatives of the secretary-general of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, which is calling for peaceful negotiations between Azerbaijan and Armenia.\n",
      "\tChampagne will likely find it difficult to make meaningful progress on that issue \"unless they can get regional actors from Turkey, Russia, Iran, and Israel, who are all operating in this conflict, to the table,\" said Momani.\n",
      "\tChampagne also joined Raab recently to impose sanctions that directly target Lukashenko, his family and his ministers, after their violent crackdown against massive protests in Belarus following Tikhanovskaya's defeat in the August election.\n",
      "\tTikhanovskaya, 37, is a political neophyte who challenged Lukashenko after her husband, who planned to challenge the presidency, was jailed. She is a former English teacher who managed to connect with Belarusians fed up with Lukashenko's authoritarian rule, and a declining economy in the face of the pandemic.\n",
      "\tMomani said Champagne's meeting with her will highlight the sanctions he imposed on Belarus with Britain as Lukashenko digs in, hoping the world will abandon \"the nascent democratic social movement\" that is opposing him.\n",
      "\t\"While Tikhanovskaya is just a figurehead, meeting with her is an opportunity for Canada to demonstrate some support to the embattled Belarusian opposition.\"\n",
      "\tIn Brussels, Champagne's meetings will include face-to-face talks with his European Union counterpart, Josep Borrell and NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg.\n",
      "\tIn Athens, Champagne will meet with more NATO allies: Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis and his foreign minister, Nikos Dendias.\n",

      "\tA man from Singapore was sentenced to 14 months in prison Friday for spying by passing to the Chinese government valuable, but unclassified, military and political information that he had duped Americans into giving him.\n",
      "\tJun Wei Yeo admitted participating in an elaborate ruse under the direction of Chinese intelligence operatives that recruited unsuspecting U.S. government employees into writing reports that he said would be sent to clients in Asia. The reports were instead transmitted to the Chinese government as part of what the Trump administration has alleged is a broader effort by China to steal American secrets, including cutting-edge research, for Beijing's economic gain.\n",
      "\tProsecutors allege that Yeo, also known as Dickson Yeo, was motivated not only by greed -- he was paid for his work -- but also by a shared desire with China's Communist government to weaken the global standing of the United States. Over the course of multiple years, according to the Justice Department, he passed along reports on a military aircraft program, U.S. troop withdrawal in Afghanistan and on a Cabinet member, who was not identified in court papers.\n",
      "\t\"It was a not one-off lapse in judgment that we're talking about here,\" said Assistant U.S. Attorney Erik Kenerson. The prosecutor said Yeo \"worked for a hostile power on our soil to collect nonpublic information of interest to that power.\"\n",
      "\tThe Justice Department believes Yeo was arrested before he was able to obtain any classified information, though prosecutors say he was preparing to receive some soon before he was taken into custody.\n",
      "\tThe 14-month sentence imposed by U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan during a virtual hearing in Washington was two months shorter than the punishment recommended by prosecutors, and took into account Yeo's co-operation with the government as well as the coronavirus pandemic that has ravaged the U.S. prison system.\n",
      "\tYeo, who was arrested in November 2019 after an interview with the FBI, will receive credit for the jail time he has already served, meaning he should be released in a matter of weeks. He will be deported after the completion of his sentence.\n",
      "\tYeo said he was eager to return home to his family in Singapore. \"I take full responsibility for what I have done,\" Yeo said.\n",
      "\t\"I am sympathetic to China's position,\" he told the judge, \"but it was not my intention to harm anyone.\"\n",
      "\tYeo was a doctoral candidate at a Singapore university when prosecutors say he was recruited by intelligence operatives after a 2015 trip to Beijing to give a presentation on the political situation in southeast Asia.\n",
      "\tWorking under the operatives' direction over the next several years, the Justice Department alleges, he concocted a fake consulting company that shared its name with a prominent U.S. consulting company and used a professional networking site to target and recruit Americans whose jobs he thought would give them access to information that China could use to its advantage.\n",
      "\tIn addition, prosecutors say, he advertised fake job postings and collected hundreds of resumes from would-be applicants, most of whom were military and government personnel. He passed along the promising resumes to a Chinese handler.\n",
      "\tOne of his recruits, a civilian who worked for the Air Force and had a high-level security clearance, provided information about the implications of the Japanese purchasing military aircraft from the U.S. that Yeo then turned into a report for his Chinese intelligence contacts. Another recruit, a State Department employee who prosecutors say confided to feeling dissatisfied at work and having financial problems, wrote at Yeo's direction a report on a Cabinet member, court documents say.\n",
      "\tProsecutors said they would have sought a harsher sentence for Yeo, who pleaded guilty to acting as an agent of a foreign government, but for his co-operation. He was approached by the FBI at an airport last November, and though he initially declined an interview request and headed toward boarding his flight, he changed his mind and returned to the agents to agree to be questioned.\n",
      "\t\"Mr. Yeo, while he was still free to leave the United States, agreed to co-operate with the United State and within hours was completely truthful with the government about what was going on,\" said Michelle Peterson, his federal defender.\n",

      "\tU.S. and Russian negotiators have agreed in principle to continue freezing their nuclear warhead stockpiles in a bid to salvage their last remaining arms control pact before it expires next year, a person familiar with the talks said Friday.\n",
      "\tThe person said it's not yet clear if the agreement for a freeze will succeed or translate into an extension of the New START treaty that expires in February. But, if it works, the person said an agreement could be announced before the Nov. 3 presidential election with an eye toward extending the accord and eventually bringing China into it, a longtime Trump administration demand.\n",
      "\tThe person said President Donald Trump and Russian leader Vladimir Putin have signed off on the freeze, but negotiators still need to iron out details, including compliance and verification issues. The person spoke to reporters after the last round of U.S,-Russia arms control talks in Helsinki this week.\n",
      "\tThe person, who was not authorized to discuss the negotiations publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity, said follow-up discussions between Washington and Moscow would take place next week. The Russians have been told that if a freeze is not agreed to in the coming weeks, the United States may harden its conditions.\n",
      "\tWord of a potential freeze comes as Trump is seeking foreign policy victories during a difficult reelection campaign against former Vice-President Joe Biden, who has vowed to extend New START even without Chinese participation.\n",
      "\tAn announcement ahead of the election could raise eyebrows, coming as U.S. intelligence officials say Russia favours Trump and has been working to denigrate Biden.\n",
      "\tThe person familiar with the negotiations said Nov. 3 was not a drop-dead date for a freeze agreement with Russia and stressed that the Trump administration would continue to negotiate no matter what the result of the election. But the person said the U.S. would be looking for additional Russian concessions should negotiations drag out beyond the vote.\n",
      "\tCurrently, the U.S. envisions a broad cap on nuclear warheads under which the numbers of multiple weapons systems could be adjusted with some flexibility, according to the person.\n",
      "\tAfter the last talks in Helsinki on Monday, lead U.S. negotiator Marshall Billingslea, Trump's special envoy for arms control, said the meeting had yielded \"important progress.\"\n",
      "\tThat meeting was a follow up to earlier discussions between Billingslea and his Russian counterpart, Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov, in Vienna and talks between the U.S and Russian national security advisers in Geneva.\n",
      "\tBut Russia has had a more skeptical view of the talks, with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on Monday accusing Washington of \"unilateralism.\" He said the New START treaty would likely cease to exist because the conditions the U.S. has put forward for extending it \"don't take into account our interests or the experience of many decades when arms control has existed to mutual satisfaction.\"\n",
      "\tRussian diplomats have repeatedly emphasized that Moscow considers the limits on launch platforms -- missiles, bombers and submarines -- much more important than the restrictions on the number of warheads. Russia likely would be unwilling to accept a separate freeze on the number of warheads unless it is part of a full-fledged deal.\n",

      "CONTENT : TAIPEI, TAIWAN  -- \n",
      "\tChina, which has at least four coronavirus vaccine candidates in the last stage of clinical trials, said Friday it is joining an international initiative to distribute COVID-19 vaccines to countries worldwide known as COVAX, a move that may help the country find an international market for its coronavirus shots.\n",
      "\tThe country signed an agreement with Gavi, the co-leader of the project, on Thursday, China's foreign ministry said. Initially, China did not agree to join the alliance, after missing an early deadline to join in September.\n",
      "\t\"We are taking this concrete step to ensure equitable distribution of vaccines, especially to developing countries, and hope more capable countries will also join and support COVAX,\" ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said in a statement. She added later at a daily news briefing that many Chinese vaccine companies expressed a willingness to join the partnership and that China would buy vaccines for about 1% of its population through COVAX.\n",
      "\tThe exact terms of the agreement and how China will contribute are not yet clear. Countries can choose to buy vaccines to cover up to 50% of their population but many developed countries are using COVAX as a type of insurance policy to obtain extra doses on top of any bilateral deals signed with pharmaceutical companies.\n",
      "\tChinese leader Xi Jinping previously said the country would make the vaccine a global public good and would distribute its shots in Africa -- but only after China's own immunization program had been completed.\n",
      "\tThe World Health Organization, which also leads COVAX, welcomed the announcement, saying in a statement that \"the number of countries joining the COVAX facility grows every day, and we are pleased to see China formally join.\"\n",
      "\tThe initiative is designed so that richer countries agree to buy into potential vaccines and help finance access for poorer ones, but critical questions remain about how its goal will be carried out. Many countries including Britain, the U.S., France, Germany, and others have directly negotiated their own deals with pharmaceutical companies to receive billions of doses, meaning that the vast majority of the world's vaccine supply next year is already reserved.\n",
      "\tSome experts point out that without significant efforts to quickly boost manufacturing capacity globally, Chinese vaccine producers may offer the best chance to supply the developing world. China's decision to join COVAX might give the country an opportunity to sign multimillion dollar deals that Gavi and partners will need to enter to secure billions of vaccine doses.\n",
      "\tThe United States, the world's largest economy, declined to join under President Donald Trump, saying COVAX was \"influenced by the corrupt WHO and China.\" China has the second-largest economy in the world.\n",
      "\t\"China joining COVAX serves a dual purpose of filling the leadership vacuum left by the United States in terms of global public health, and in terms of securing a future vaccine for its population,\" said Natasha Kassam, a research fellow at the Lowy Institute in Australia.\n",
      "\tA successful vaccine candidate from China could help it repair its reputation abroad. A recent survey conducted by the Pew Research Center found that negative views of China have risen sharply in 2020 in some countries. Views in democratic countries have hardened after the coronavirus outbreak was first discovered in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, and a majority of respondents said China handled the outbreak poorly. Many criticized China for obfuscating early reports of COVID-19.\n",
      "\tChina has been eager to reshape the narrative, calling the virus a common challenge facing humanity, and even questioning its origin. Earlier, as the pandemic spread around the world, it sent medical teams and supplies to affected countries. More recently, it has signed agreements with developing nations such as Indonesia and the Philippines to provide priority access to one of its vaccine candidates and offered a $1 billion loan to countries in Latin America.\n",
      "\tWhat remains to be seen is how China will engage with the alliance, said Dr. Gagandeep Kang, the vice chair of the Board of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, or CEPI, which is also involved in leading COVAX. Most countries are entering COVAX to try to get access to vaccines that aren't being manufactured domestically, she said.\n",
      "\tChina could be trying to ensure that the vaccines it is developing find a global platform. \"For China it could be across the spectrum. To have their vaccines participate in the provision of vaccines (to other countries), and for access to vaccines,\" said Kang, who is also a microbiologist at the Christian Medical College in the Indian city of Vellore.\n",
      "\tChinese pharmaceutical company Sinovac, for example, recently said it wants to provide its vaccine to the world, including the U.S. and countries in Europe with stringent regulations that have prevented previous Chinese vaccines from being sold.\n",
      "\tCOVAX plans to buy 2 billion doses of a vaccine by the end of 2021, although it remains unknown whether the successful vaccine will require one or two doses.\n",
      "\tTo date, China has not yet published any late-stage information about any of its vaccine candidates, despite starting to use some more broadly in targeted populations. Without that data, it is unclear how safe and effective any of the experimental Chinese vaccines are.\n",

      "\tAlthough more buttoned-up on the stage than his boss, Vice-President Mike Pence nevertheless echoed many of President Donald Trump's falsehoods Wednesday in the one and only debate with Democratic rival Kamala Harris.\n",
      "\tPence muddied the reality on the pandemic, asserted Trump respects the science on climate change when actually the president mocks it, overstated the threat of voting fraud and misrepresented the Russia investigation in the Salt Lake City debate.\n",
      "\tHarris got tangled in tax policy at one point and misleadingly suggested that Trump branded the coronavirus a hoax.\n",
      "\tAltogether, the debate wasn't the madhouse matchup of Trump vs. Joe Biden last week. But there were plenty of distortions. A sampling:\n",
      "PENCE: \"Joe Biden wants to go back to the economic surrender to China, that when we took office, half of our international trade deficit was with China alone. And Joe Biden wants to repeal all of the tariffs that President Trump put into effect to fight for American jobs and American workers.\"\n",
      "THE FACTS: The tariffs were not the win claimed by Pence.\n",
      "\tFor starters, tariffs are taxes that consumers and businesses pay through higher prices. So Pence is defending tax increases. The tariffs against China did cause the trade deficit in goods with China to fall in 2019. But that's a pyrrhic victory at best as overall U.S. economic growth slowed from 3% to 2.2% because of the trade uncertainty.\n",
      "\tMore important, the Trump administration has not decreased the overall trade imbalance. For all trading partners, the Census Bureau said the trade deficit was $576.9 billion last year, nearly $100 billion higher than during the last year of Barack Obama's presidency.\n",
      "\t------\n",
      "HARRIS, on Trump's tax cuts: \"On Day 1, Joe Biden will repeal that tax bill.\"\n",
      "THE FACTS: No, that's not what Biden proposes. He would repeal some of it. Nor can he repeal a law on his own, much less on his first day in office. Harris also said Biden will not raise taxes on people making under $400,000. If he were to repeal the Trump tax cuts across the board, he would be breaking that promise.\n",
      "\t------\n",
      "PENCE, on the Sept. 26 Rose Garden event after which more than 11 attendees tested positive for COVID-19: \"It was an outdoor event, which all of our scientists regularly and routinely advise.\"\n",
      "THE FACTS: His suggestion that the event followed public-health safety recommendations is false. The event, introducing Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett, drew more than 150 people and flouted safety recommendations in multiple ways. And it was not all outside.\n",
      "\tThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says large gatherings of people who have travelled from outside the area and aren't spaced at least 6 feet apart pose the greatest risk for spreading the virus.\n",
      "\tThat's exactly the type of high-risk event the White House hosted.\n",
      "\tGuests were seated close together, not 6 feet apart, in rows of chairs outside. Many were captured on camera clapping backs, shaking hands and talking, barely at arm's length.\n",
      "\tThe CDC also \"strongly encourages\" people to wear masks, but few in the Rose Garden wore them. There was also a private reception inside the White House following the Rose Garden ceremony, where some politicians, including North Carolina Republican Sen. Thom Tillis, who has since tested positive, were pictured not wearing masks.\n",
      "\t------\n",
      "HARRIS on the virus: \"The president said it was a hoax.\"\n",
      "THE FACTS: That's misleading.\n",
      "\tShe's referring to a Feb. 28 campaign rally in South Carolina in which Trump said the phrases \"the coronavirus\" and \"this is their new hoax\" at separate points. Although his meaning is difficult to discern, the broader context of his words shows he was railing against Democrats for their denunciations of his administration's coronavirus response.\n",
      "\t\"Now the Democrats are politicizing the coronavirus,\" he said at the rally. \"You know that, right? Coronavirus. They're politicizing it.\" He meandered briefly to the subject of the messy Democratic primary in Iowa, then the Russia investigation before returning to the pandemic. \"They tried the impeachment hoax. ... And this is their new hoax.\"\n",
      "\tAsked at a news conference the day after the rally to clarify his remarks, Trump said he was not referring to the coronavirus itself as a hoax.\n",
      "\t\"No, no, no.\" he said. \"`Hoax' referring to the action that they take to try and pin this on somebody, because we've done such a good job. The hoax is on them, not -- I'm not talking about what's happening here. I'm talking what they're doing. That's the hoax.\"\n",
      "\t------\n",
      "PENCE: \"The both of you repeatedly committed to abolishing fossil fuel and banning fracking. President Trump has made clear we're going to continue to listen to the science\" on climate change.\n",
      "THE FACTS: Pence is correct when he says Harris supported banning fracking, incorrect when he says Biden does, and false when he says Trump follows the science on climate change.\n",
      "\tAt a CNN climate change town hall for Democratic presidential candidates last year, Harris said, \"There's no question I'm in favour of banning fracking. Starting with what we can do from Day One on public lands.\" Now, as Biden's running mate, she is bound to his agenda, which is different.\n",
      "\tBiden has an ambitious climate plan that seeks to rapidly reduce use of fossil fuels. He says he does not support banning hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, however, and says he doubts such a ban is possible.\n",
      "\tAs far as Trump and climate change, Trump's public comments as president all dismiss the science on climate change -- that it's caused by people burning fossil fuels, and it's worsening sharply. As recently as last month, Trump said, \"I don't think science knows\" what it's talking about regarding global warming and the resulting worsening of wildfires, hurricanes and other natural disasters. He's ridiculed the science in many public comments and tweets.\n",
      "\tHis regulation-cutting has eliminated key Obama-era efforts to reduce fossil fuel emissions.\n",
      "\t------\n",
      "PENCE: \"President Trump and I have a plan to improve health care and to protect preexisting conditions for all Americans.\"\n",
      "THE FACTS: No, there is no clear plan. People with preexisting conditions are already protected by the Obama-era Affordable Care Act, and if the Trump administration succeeds in persuading the Supreme Court to overturn it, those protections will be jeopardy.\n",
      "\tTrump has signed an executive order declaring it the policy of the U.S. government to protect people with preexisting conditions, but Trump would have to go back to Congress to work out legislation to replace those in \"Obamacare.\"\n",
      "\tVarious Republican approaches offered in 2017 would have undermined the protections in the ACA, and Trump has not offered details of how his plan would work. Although Trump has been in office nearly four years, he has yet to roll out the comprehensive health proposal he once promised.\n",
      "\t------\n",
      "PENCE: \"He suspended all travel from China, the second-largest economy in the world. Joe Biden opposed that decision, he said it was xenophobic and hysterical.\"\n",
      "THE FACTS: Trump's order did not suspend \"all travel from China.\" He restricted it, and Biden never branded the decision \"xenophobic.\" Dozens of countries took similar steps to control travel from hot spots before or around the same time the U.S. did.\n",
      "\tThe U.S. restrictions that took effect Feb. 2 continued to allow travel to the U.S. from China's Hong Kong and Macao territories for months. The Associated Press reported that more than 8,000 Chinese and foreign nationals based in those territories entered the U.S. in the first three months after the travel restrictions were imposed.\n",
      "\tAdditionally, more than 27,000 Americans returned from mainland China in the first month after the restrictions took effect. U.S. officials lost track of more than 1,600 of them who were supposed to be monitored for virus exposure.\n",
      "\tBiden has accused Trump of having a record of xenophobia but not explicitly in the context of the president's decision to limit travel from China during the pandemic. Trump took to calling the virus the \"China virus\" and the \"foreign virus\" at one point, prompting Biden to urge the country not to take a turn toward xenophobia or racism in the pandemic.\n",
      "\t------\n",
      "HARRIS, on the effects of the pandemic: \"One in five businesses, closed.\"\n",
      "THE FACTS: That's not accurate, as of now. We don't know yet how many businesses have permanently closed -- or could do so in the months ahead.\n",
      "\tWhat we do know is that the National Federation of Independent Business said in August that 1 in 5 small businesses will close if economic conditions don't improve in the next six months.\n",
      "\tMany small businesses survived in part through the forgivable loans from the Payroll Protection Program. Larger employers such as Disney and Allstate insurance have announced layoffs, as have major airlines. Restaurants that survived the pandemic with outdoor eating will soon face the challenge of cold weather. So it's too soon to tell how many businesses have closed or will.\n",
      "\t------\n",
      "PENCE, on the conclusions of special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation: \"It was found that there was no obstruction, no collusion. Case closed. And then Senator Harris you and your colleagues in the Congress tried to impeach the president of the United States over a phone call.\"\n",
      "THE FACTS: That's a mischaracterization of Mueller's nearly 450-page report and its core findings.\n",
      "\tMueller did not absolve the president of obstructing the investigation into ties between Trump's 2016 campaign and Russia. Instead, his team examined roughly a dozen episodes in which the president sought to exert his will on the probe, including by firing his FBI director and seeking the ouster of Mueller himself. Ultimately, Mueller declined to reach a conclusion on whether Trump had committed a crime, citing Justice Department policy against indicting a sitting president. But that's different than finding \"no obstruction.\"\n",
      "\tMueller also didn't quite find \"no collusion.\" His investigation identified multiple contacts between Russians and Trump associates and outlined sweeping Russian interference that he said the Trump campaign welcomed and expected to benefit from. Mueller said that he did not have enough to establish a criminal conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia; collusion is not a precise legal term.\n",
      "\t------\n",
      "PENCE: \"President Trump and I are fighting every day in courthouses to prevent Joe Biden and Kamala Harris from changing the rules and creating this universal mail-in voting that will create a massive opportunity for voter fraud.\"\n",
      "THE FACTS: Pence is vastly overstating the potential for fraud with mail-in ballots, just as Trump frequently does.\n",
      "\tBroadly speaking, voter fraud has proved exceedingly rare. A 2017 report from the Brennan Center for Justice ranked the risk of ballot fraud at 0.00004% to 0.0009%, based on studies of past elections. A panel commissioned by the Trump administration to explore the issue uncovered no evidence to support claims of widespread voter fraud.\n",
      "\tTrump and his allies have tried to argue that absentee balloting is fine -- when someone has to request a ballot as opposed to automatically getting one in the mail -- while universal mail-in balloting is open to fraud because all the state's registered voters receive a ballot through the mail. It's true that some election studies have shown a slightly higher incidence of mail-in voting fraud compared with in-person voting, but the overall risk is extremely low.\n",
      "\tThere is ongoing litigation in several states over a host of election issues, including absentee ballots. States nationwide expect a surge in mail-in voting due to the ongoing risk posed by the coronavirus.\n",
      "\tFive states routinely send ballots to all registered voters, allowing them to choose to vote through the mail or in person. In November, four other states -- California, New Jersey, Nevada and Vermont -- and the District of Columbia will be adopting that system, as will almost every county in Montana.\n",

      "\tA group of Chinese-Canadian veterans and their families are calling on B.C. to rename the Pattullo Bridge replacement so the province can stop honouring a former premier with a record of racist beliefs.\n",
      "\tIt’s time to move on from the era of Thomas “Duff” Pattullo, who attempted to block Chinese-Canadian recruits in the Second World War on the grounds that were they to fight, they would have a better chance at getting Canadian citizenship, said King Wan, president of Chinese-Canadian veterans group Pacific Unit 280.\n",
      "\t“The name of the bridge now is for a premier in B.C. who was anti-immigrant and anti-Asian,” Wan told CTV News.\n",
      "\t“It’s a new bridge. A new beginning. A new era. It’s time for a name change.\"\n",
      "\tThe Pattullo Bridge crosses from New Westminster to Surrey and has been carrying commuters since it opened to traffic in November 1937. It cost $4 million and was named for the premier of the day, Duff Pattullo, who expanded the role of government during the Great Depression.\n",
      "\tThat was only two years before Canada joined the war effort after the German invasion of Poland in September 1939.\n",
      "\tAround 600 Chinese-Canadians volunteered to fight, including Douglas Jung. The government of the day held that he was not a citizen despite being born in Victoria. He believed his sacrifice would pay dividends for the Chinese-Canadian community.\n",
      "\t“Some of us realized that unless we volunteered to serve Canada during its hour of need, we would be in a difficult position to ask for our rights,” Jung says in a documentary, “I am the Canadian Delegate.”\n",
      "\tJung was recruited for a secret mission, Operation Oblivion, where they prepared to be dropped behind Japanese enemy lines.\n",
      "\t“They took a huge leap of faith that Canada was worth dying for,” recalled his son, Arthur Calderwood.\n",
      "\tBut to some politicians of the day, their presence was a problem. Pattullo took steps to block more Chinese-Canadian recruits, records say.\n",
      "\t“Duff Pattullo had written a letter to Prime Minister Mackenzie King advising against allowing Chinese Canadians into the armed forces,” says the account in the book Celebration: Chinese Canadian Legacies in British Columbia.\n",
      "\t“Letting Chinese Canadians serve would undermine justifications for denying them the same rights as other Canadians,” it reads.\n",
      "\tPattullo also told King about his views of Jews, the book Raincoast Jews says.\n",
      "\t“In a meeting between Mackenzie King and the Premier of B.C., T.D. Pattullo, Pattullo advised Mackenzie King that although B.C. had no objections to taking in refugees, Jews were not wanted in the province,” the book says.\n",
      "\tSome six million Jews were killed across German-occupied Europe between 1941 and 1945.\n",
      "\tIt doesn’t make sense to honour someone who took steps to deny access to B.C. based on race, Calderwood said.\n",
      "\t“We should not honour politicians who are openly racist because there are other people in our history that we should honour,” he said.\n",
      "\tBoth of B.C.’s major parties agreed the new bridge should have a new name – but no names were on offer yet.\n",
      "\t“It’s a new bridge. It’s perfectly logical to consider a new name,” said the NDP candidate running for re-election in Vancouver-Fairview, George Chow.\n",
      "\tHis rival, B.C. Liberal candidate David Grewal, said his grandfather’s experience in Vancouver as a 14-year-old immigrant in 1934 from the Punjab in India shouldn’t be repeated.\n",
      "\t“I have intimate knowledge of how that’s affected my family in particular,” Grewal said. “The fact that we’re building a new bridge means we have to look to the future and put those negative undertones from our past behind us.”\n",
      "\tThe new bridge is expected to cost $1.4 billion and will be a project by the provincial government.\n",

      "CONTENT : OTTAWA -- \n",
      "\tCanada's defence minister described China's continued detention of two Canadians as \"hostage diplomacy\" on Wednesday and urged the NATO military alliance to keep tabs on the increasingly assertive Asian giant.\n",
      "\tHarjit Sajjan made the comments during a wide-ranging panel discussion hosted by Slovakian think tank Globsec, nearly two years after Chinese authorities first detained former diplomat Michael Kovrig and entrepreneur Michael Spavor.\n",
      "\tThe two were arrested separately shortly after Canadian authorities in Vancouver detained Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer of Chinese telecom giant Huawei, who is wanted in the United States on fraud charges.\n",
      "\tMeng, who has denied any wrongdoing, is now facing possible extradition to the U.S. while Chinese authorities have indicted the detained Canadians on what many observers believe are trumped-up spying charges.\n",
      "\tSajjan raised the cases of Kovrig and Spavor, whose access to Canadian consular officials has been limited and who are reportedly being kept in cells where the lights are never turned off, in response to a question about the security threat posed by China.\n",
      "\t\"I would be remiss if I didn't take this opportunity to talk about our two Canadians who have both been arbitrarily detained in China,\" he said during a panel discussion that also included his counterparts from Slovakia and Latvia.\n",
      "\t\"This type of hostage diplomacy is not what good rules-based-order nations do. So if you want to be part of the global rules-based order, we need to have greater predictability. And these are the types of things that go against the norm.\"\n",
      "\tThe minister went on to thank NATO allies for supporting Ottawa's calls for Beijing to release the two Canadians. Their cases, along with the detention of Meng in Vancouver since December 2018, has become the focal point for relations between Canada and China.\n",
      "\tWhile Sajjan suggested Canada and China continue to enjoy a strong relationship \"when it comes to some aspects of our trade,\" he cited Beijing's actions in the South China Sea as one example where it poses a security challenge.\n",
      "\tChina has been greatly expanding its military presence and claims of territory in the South China Sea despite opposition from of its neighbours as well as international rulings against some of its claims.\n",
      "\t\"These are some of the things that we will continue to monitor, and we need to monitor in NATO,\" Sajjan said.\n",
      "\t\"That's why we always talk about NATO needs to look 360. This is not just about being reactionary to a problem. It's about making sure any nation out there sees the collective will of what NATO brings to the table and that's that strong message of defence and deterrence.\"\n",

      "CONTENT : \n",
      "\tThe scene at the Great Wall of China this past week would have been unthinkable just months ago.\n",
      "\tPhotos of the tourist attraction in Beijing last weekend show massive crowds crammed along the winding wall, pressed together in close quarters and squeezing past each other through narrow doorways. Most are wearing face masks -- but a number of people, including young children, pulled their masks down to their chin, and a few seem to have foregone masks entirely.\n",
      "\tIt's Golden Week -- an eight-day national holiday, one of China's busiest annual travel periods, and a major test for the country as it emerges from the coronavirus pandemic.\n",
      "\tChina's official reported virus numbers have stayed low since the spring. There have been a few flare-ups, including a cluster in Beijing in June, but these were met with immediate lockdown measures and mass testing, and the outbreaks were contained within a few weeks.\n",
      "\tWith close to zero local transmissions, people flocked to bus stations, airports and transit hubs to travel around the country for the holiday, which kicked off on October 1. Local authorities competed to attract tourists, with provincial and municipal governments issuing travel vouchers and tourist attractions offering free or discounted tickets.\n",
      "\tThe Great Wall has geared up for the rush of tourists as well. The most popular section of the wall -- the Badaling section -- reopened at the end of March, albeit with new restrictions like requiring visitors to reserve tickets in advance.\n",
      "\tIn a notice released on September 29, the Badaling Special Administrative Region Office -- a government agency that manages the Great Wall -- warned visitors to continue following restrictions during the holiday season.\n",
      "\tThese restrictions include social distancing by keeping one meter of distance between each other. \"It is strictly forbidden to gather together,\" the notice said. Earlier guidelines on the Great Wall website reminded tourists to wear their face masks throughout their entire visit, and urged them to \"obey the guidance and management of the museum staff.\"\n",
      "\tNeither of these restrictions seemed to be closely followed this week as bare-faced tourists crowded together on the wall.\n",
      "\tNormally, more than 10 million people visit the Great Wall every year. The Badaling section, notoriously overcrowded with both local and international tourists, is so popular that officials instituted a cap of 65,000 visitors per day as of June 2019.\n",
      "\tWhen the section reopened in March, new restrictions capped the number of daily visitors at 30 per cent its usual capacity. Ahead of the Golden Week celebrations, authorities raised that cap to 75 per cent of normal capacity, meaning a daily limit of 48,750 visitors.\n",
      "\tOn October 3, tickets for the Badaling section sold out entirely by early morning, according to Chinese state-run news agency Xinhua.\n",
      "\tThe Golden Week holiday -- the longest in China along with the Lunar New Year holiday -- has traditionally seen middle-class Chinese travel abroad in large numbers. But this year, visa restrictions, quarantine requirements, a lack of international flights and the ongoing danger of Covid-19 means that Chinese travelers are looking domestically for travel instead.\n",
      "\tIn just the first four days of the holiday, 425 million domestic tourist trips were taken in China -- generating more than $45 billion in tourism revenue, according to data from the Ministry of Culture and Tourism.\n",
      "\t\"We have seen more tourists this year than in previous years. The number of daily tourists has doubled since we exempted the entrance fee,\" said an employee at Wuhan's Yellow Crane Tower attraction last week, according to state-run media Global Times.\n",
      "\tThis week's relaxed restrictions and flouting of social distancing rules are in stark contrast to the anxiety that overshadowed China's last major travel period -- the Lunar New Year holiday in late January, as the coronavirus outbreak swept through Wuhan.\n",
      "\tOn January 23, two days before Lunar New Year's Day, the Chinese government locked down Wuhan -- but by then, the virus had already spread across and beyond the country, as hundreds of millions of Chinese people traveled for the holiday.\n",
      "\tAs more information emerged about the virus, Chinese transit hubs emptied; those still traveling were typically decked out in full protective gear, including plastic gloves, ponchos, helmets, face coverings and goggles.\n",
      "\tThe sense of imminent danger has largely faded now, said Chen Qianmei, a 29-year-old from the southern city of Guangzhou, who flew to Shanghai last week for the holiday.\n",
      "\t\"I think China has (the virus) under pretty good control,\" she told CNN. \"I'm wearing masks and bringing alcohol wipes with me to clean my hands, especially before eating -- although in Shanghai, few people wear masks now.\"\n",

      "\tThe Nobel Prize in chemistry went to two researchers Wednesday for a gene-editing tool that has revolutionized science by providing a way to alter DNA, the code of life -- technology already being used to try to cure a host of diseases and raise better crops and livestock.\n",
      "\tEmmanuelle Charpentier of France and Jennifer A. Doudna of the United States won for developing CRISPR-cas9, a very simple technique for cutting a gene at a specific spot, allowing scientists to operate on flaws that are the root cause of many diseases.\n",
      "\t\"There is enormous power in this genetic tool,\" said Claes Gustafsson, chair of the Nobel Committee for Chemistry.\n",
      "\tMore than 100 clinical trials are underway to study using CRISPR to treat diseases, and \"many are very promising,\" according to Victor Dzau, president of the National Academy of Medicine.\n",
      "\t\"My greatest hope is that it's used for good, to uncover new mysteries in biology and to benefit humankind,\" said Doudna, who is affiliated with the University of California, Berkeley, and is paid by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, which also supports The Associated Press' Health and Science Department.\n",
      "\tThe prize-winning work has opened the door to some thorny ethical issues: When editing is done after birth, the alterations are confined to that person. Scientists fear CRISPR will be misused to make \"designer babies\" by altering eggs, embryos or sperm -- changes that can be passed on to future generations.\n",
      "\tMuch of the world became aware of CRISPR in 2018, when Chinese scientist He Jiankui revealed he had helped make the world's first gene-edited babies, to try to engineer resistance to infection with the AIDS virus. His work was denounced as unsafe human experimentation, and he has been sentenced to prison in China.\n",
      "\tIn September, an international panel of experts issued a report saying it is too soon to try such experiments because the science isn't advanced enough to ensure safety.\n",
      "\t\"Being able to selectively edit genes means that you are playing God in a way,\" said American Chemical Society President Luis Echegoyen, a chemistry professor at the University of Texas El Paso.\n",
      "\tDr. George Daley, dean of Harvard Medical School, said: \"New technology often presents this dichotomy -- there is immense potential for human benefit, especially for disease treatment, but also the risk of misapplication.\"\n",
      "\tHowever, scientists universally praised the great potential that gene editing has for patients now.\n",
      "\t\"There's no aspect of biomedical research that hasn't been touched by CRISPR,\" which has been used to engineer better crops and to try to cure human diseases including sickle cell, HIV infection and inherited forms of blindness, said Dr. Kiran Musunuru, a genetics expert at the University of Pennsylvania who is researching it for heart disease.\n",
      "\tDoudna said CRISPR also has the potential to be used to engineer plants to store more carbon or to withstand extremes of climate change, giving researchers a chance to \"address urgent problems humanity is facing.\"\n",
      "\tIt's the fourth time in the 119-year history of the prizes that a Nobel in the sciences was given exclusively to women.\n",
      "\tCharpentier, the 51-year-old leader of the Max Planck Unit for the Science of Pathogens in Berlin, said that while she considers herself first and foremost a scientist, \"it's reflective of the fact that science becomes more modern and involves more female leaders.\"\n",
      "\t\"I do hope that it will remain and even develop more in this direction,\" she said, adding that it is \"more cumbersome to be a woman in science than to be a man in science.\"\n",
      "\tThree times a woman has won a Nobel in the sciences by herself; this is the first time an all-female team won a science prize. In 1911, Marie Curie was the sole recipient of the chemistry award, as was Dorothy Crowfoot Hodgkin in 1964. In 1983, Barbara McClintock won the Nobel in medicine.\n",
      "\tThe breakthrough research done by Charpentier and Doudna was published in 2012, making the discovery very recent compared with a lot of other Nobel-winning research, which is often honoured only after decades have passed.\n",
      "\tDr. Francis Collins, who led the drive to map the human genome, said the technology \"has changed everything\" about how to approach diseases with a genetic cause.\n",
      "\t\"You can draw a direct line from the success of the human genome project to the power of CRISPR-cas to make changes in the instruction book,\" said Collins, director of the U.S. National Institutes of Health, which helped fund Doudna's work.\n",
      "\tThe Broad Institute, jointly run by Harvard and MIT, has been in a court fight with the Nobel winners over patents on CRISPR technology, and many other scientists did important work on it, but Doudna and Charpentier have been most consistently honoured with prizes for turning it into an easily usable tool.\n",
      "\tFeng Zhang, the Broad scientist most known for that work, made no comment on the awards, but the Broad's director, Eric Lander, messaged congratulations on Twitter to the winners. Another Broad gene editing scientist, David Liu, noted on Twitter that the winners' seminal research paper in 2012 has been cited more than 9,500 times, or about once every eight hours.\n",
      "\tThe Nobel comes with a gold medal and 10 million kronor (more than $1.1 million), courtesy of a bequest left more than a century ago by the prize's creator, Alfred Nobel, the inventor of dynamite.\n",
      "\tOn Monday, the Nobel in medicine was awarded for the discovery of the liver-ravaging hepatitis C virus. Tuesday's prize in physics honoured breakthroughs in understanding black holes. The prizes in literature, peace and economics will be awarded in the coming days.\n",
      "\t------\n",

      "\tGordon said she has turned to exercise in the past to help improve her own mental health. She decided to run every day during the month of September and donate money for every kilometre. She’s been documenting her journey on Instagram using the hashtag #andreasrunformentalhealth\n",
      "\tGordon said she also started an online fundraiser  to help those in the community who are struggling. So far $10,000 has been raised. Money will go towards the Canadian Mental Health Association and Centre for Suicide Prevention.\n",
      "\t“I want to provide people with the opportunity to go seek help when they need it,” said Gordon.\n",
      "\tAccording to the Calgary Counselling Centre, depression is the second leading cause of suicide.\n",
      "\t“It's very very treatable but over half of the people that are struggling will never reach out for assistance,” said Cathy Keogh, Director of Counselling, Calgary Counselling Centre.\n",
      "\tKeogh said depression is a complex mental disorder impacting one in five women and one in 10 men. The largest growing community is young people between the ages of 10 and 24.\n",
      "\tSigns of depression vary but can include; disturbed sleep, changes in appetite, sadness, irritability and isolation.\n",
      "\tThis week, Calgary Counselling Centre is running the 14th annual National Depression Screening Day, offering a free, anonymous, online depression screening test. The test screens for signs of depression symptoms and then lets you know if further evaluation is recommended. It will be available in five languages: English, French, Spanish, Punjabi, and Chinese.\n",

      "\tThe Australian government on Tuesday announced plans to cut income taxes, create jobs for young people and stimulate business investment with a raft of pandemic measures that would create a record 214 billion Australian dollar (US$153 billion) deficit in the current fiscal year.\n",
      "\tTreasurer Josh Frydenberg announced his annual budget plans for the year that started on July 1, with economic forecasts based on an assumption that a COVID-19 vaccine will be available next year.\n",
      "\tBut the Treasury Department has warned that economic realities could be \"substantially different\" from its forecasts without a vaccine.\n",
      "\tNet debt will increase to 703 billion Australian dollars ($503 billion), or 36% of gross domestic product, at the end of the current fiscal year and peak at 44% of GDP in mid-2024 when debt will exceed 966 billion Australian dollars ($691 billion).\n",
      "\t\"This is a heavy burden, but a necessary one to responsibly deal with the greatest challenge of our time,\" Frydenberg told Parliament.\n",
      "\tAt its peak, net debt as a share of the Australian economy would be half the current proportion in Britain, a third of the share in the United States and a quarter of the Japanese proportion, Frydenberg said.\n",
      "\tMore than 11.5 million taxpayers among the Australian population of 26 million people would gain an income tax cut back-dated to July 1, according to plan. It needs Parliament's endorsement.\n",
      "\tMore than 7 million would receive a tax cut of more than 2,000 Australian dollars ($1,430) a year. The tax cuts would cost Australia's coffers more than 50 billion Australian dollars ($36 billion) over four years.\n",
      "\tThe government is also offering a \"JobMaker hiring credit\" to encourage businesses to hire younger Australians. Young people have suffered most from job losses created by the pandemic.\n",
      "\tBusinesses that provide a job to an unemployed person under 30 years old would be gjven 200 Australian dollars ($145) a week for up to a year. The payment would be half that if the employee is aged between 30 and 35. The employees must be given at least 20 hours of work a week.\n",
      "\tThe government expects JobMaker would support 450,000 young employees.\n",
      "\tTo boost business investment, the vast majority of companies would be allowed to write off the full value of eligible assets against their tax debt.\n",
      "\t\"It will dramatically expand the productive capacity of the nation and create tens of thousands of jobs,\" Frydenberg said.\n",
      "\tLoss-making businesses would also be able to claim pandemic losses against profits they made as far back as 2018-2019, generating tax refunds for many.\n",
      "\tFrydenberg said he will introduce into Parliament on Wednesday a bill that would make his proposed income tax cuts and business tax breaks law.\n",
      "\t\"I want these measures to be implemented as fast as possible,\" he said.\n",
      "\tThe government expects the Australian economy will shrink by 1.5% in the current fiscal year before expanding by 4.75% in 2021-22.\n",
      "\tUnemployment is expected to peak at 8% in the December quarter before receding to 5.5% in 2023-24.\n",
      "\tIn August, the official unemployment rate was 6.8%. The government estimates it would already be 12% if the government had not paid employers 101 billion Australian dollars ($72 billion) to keep 3.5 million people in jobs during the pandemic.\n",
      "\tAround 10% of Australian workers have lost their jobs or remain employed through the government subsidy despite working no hours.\n",
      "\tThe government forecasts that the annual deficit would shrink to 112 billion Australian dollars ($80 billion) in 2021-22 and continue downward to 2024.\n",
      "\tThe budget forecasts assume that a COVID-19 vaccination program was \"fully in place by late 2021\" in Australia and pandemic restrictions continue to ease.\n",
      "\tBut the outcomes could be much different if that is not the case, the budget documents said.\n",
      "\t\"The range of possible outcomes for GDP and unemployment in particular is substantially wider than normal,\" the Treasury department said. \"This translates into a higher than usual degree of uncertainty for the estimates.\"\n",
      "\tEarly in 2019, the government forecast a 7 billion Australian dollar ($5 billion) surplus in the year that ended on June 30, 2020. That would have been Australia's first surplus in 12 years.\n",
      "\tBut the pandemic turned that result into a 85 billion Australian dollar ($61 billion) deficit.\n",
      "\tThe pandemic has caused shortages of in supply chains and highlighted the decline in Australia's manufacturing industries that have failed to compete against Chinese imports.\n",
      "\tThe government plans to invest 1.3 billion Australian dollars ($930 million) in areas of national manufacturing priority, including medical products, defence and the space industry.\n",

      "\tThe head of emergencies at the World Health Organization said Monday the agency's \"best estimates\" indicate roughly 1 in 10 people worldwide may have been infected by the coronavirus -- more than 20 times the number of confirmed cases -- and warned of a difficult period ahead.\n",
      "\tDr. Michael Ryan, speaking to a special session of the WHO's 34-member executive board focusing on COVID-19, said the figures vary from urban to rural areas, and between different groups, but that ultimately it means \"the vast majority of the world remains at risk.\" He said the pandemic would continue to evolve, but that tools exist to suppress transmission and save lives.\n",
      "\t\"Many deaths have been averted and many more lives can be protected,\" Ryan said. He was flanked by his boss, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who minutes earlier led a moment of silence to honour victims, as well as a round of applause for the health workers who have strived to save them.\n",
      "\tRyan said southeast Asia faced a surge in cases, Europe and the eastern Mediterranean were seeing an increase, while the situations in Africa and the Western Pacific were \"rather more positive.\" Overall, though, he said the world was \"heading into a difficult period.\"\n",
      "\t\"The disease continues to spread. It is on the rise in many parts of the world,\" Ryan told attendees from governments who make up the executive board and provide much of the WHO's funding. \"Our current best estimates tell us that about 10 per cent of the global population may have been infected by this virus.\"\n",
      "\tThe estimate -- which would amount to more than 760 million people based on a current world population of about 7.6 billion -- far outstrips the number of confirmed cases as tallied by both the WHO and Johns Hopkins University, now more than 35 million worldwide. Experts have long said that the number of confirmed cases greatly undershoots the true figure.\n",
      "\tRyan did not elaborate on the estimate. Dr. Margaret Harris, a WHO spokeswoman, said it was based on an average of antibody studies conducted around the world. She said the estimated 90 per cent of people remaining without infection means the virus has \"opportunity\" to spread further \"if we don't take action to stop it\" such as by contact-tracing and tracking of cases by health officials.\n",
      "\tTedros, during his remarks, said: \"What we have learned in every region of the world is that with strong leadership, clear and comprehensive strategies, consistent communication, and engaged, empowered and enabled population, it's never too late ... Every situation can be turned around -- and hard-won gains can be easily lost.\"\n",
      "\t\"The pandemic underlines the fundamental importance of investing in public health and primary health care,\" said Tedros, wearing a stylish black, red and yellow mask. Tedros had not worn a mask during scores of COVID-19 press conferences he led at WHO headquarters this year.\n",
      "\tThe comments came during a special session of the executive board to consider the follow-up to its previous meeting, in May, that passed a resolution to look into the world's -- and WHO's -- response to the pandemic, among other things.\n",
      "\tThe two-day meeting is the first by the executive board since the Trump administration set off a one-year countdown this summer toward pulling the United States out of the WHO next July. President Donald Trump, who himself has been infected by COVID-19, has repeatedly accused the WHO of being too accepting of China's explanations of its handling of the outbreak in Wuhan late last year.\n",
      "\tOn a far more conciliatory tone, Assistant Secretary of Health Brett Giroir, the U.S. representative on the board, told the meeting by videoconference that the United States \"looks forward to working together to defeat this pandemic and move our people and economics back to normalcy.\"\n",
      "\tGiroir also pressed WHO -- albeit gently -- to clear up its relationship with the Chinese government. He said a \"key mandate\" from the resolution in May was its call for a joint mission involving the WHO, the World Organization for Animal Health, and the U.N.'s Food and Agricultural Organization to look into the animal origins of the virus and its transmission to humans.\n",
      "\tA two-person advance team for that mission has visited China, but a fuller mission isn't ready. Giroir said it was \"critical\" that WHO member states receive regular and timely updates about the mission and its \"terms of reference\" -- an allusion to working guidelines that detail just how much access the mission's members will have in China.\n",
      "\tChinese board member Zhang Yang, speaking by videoconference, said China has been \"transparent and responsible\" and has been fulfilling its responsibilities under the resolution. She said it had been communicating regularly with the WHO and keeping up its financial commitments to the U.N. agency.\n",
      "\tBoard member Clemens Auer of Austria lamented a \"political weakening\" of the WHO, citing the \"potential withdrawal of a strong WHO member state\" -- an allusion to the U.S. He appealed for a \"retreat session\" for board members, saying it should be an \"active\" body -- not a \"ceremonial\" one. U.S. representative Giroir expressed support for that idea.\n",

      "\tIn the midst of the summer scramble to get courses online at Memorial University in St. John's, Sonja Knutson realized there were political implications to remote learning she hadn't considered.\n",
      "\tA Memorial student living in Iran couldn't buy an e-book for a course because Iranians don't have access to major credit cards, Knutson, director of the university's office for international students, said. The student dropped the course.\n",
      "\tKnutson and her colleagues realized there could be a host of similar problems involving Memorial's international students, many of whom are taking courses remotely because of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n",
      "\tThe school's efforts to ensure a smooth transition to remote learning had a political blind spot, she said in a recent interview. \"The same curriculum that we could deliver privately in the classroom is now going to be subject to monitoring in countries around the world.\"\n",
      "\tShe said she flagged the issue to university officials, who sent a memo to instructors before classes began encouraging them to offer alternative course content for students who live in \"authoritarian\" states.\n",
      "\t\"This is not a call to censor the course material or guide assessments: critically exploring issues and topics deemed by authoritarian states as problematic are a keystone of the role that a university plays in supporting a democratic society and developing engaged citizens,\" the memo said.\n",
      "\tRui Hou, an expert in surveillance and authoritarian politics, said when he was at Queen's University, a few of his colleagues faced similar issues with international students.\n",
      "\tNow a postdoctoral fellow at the Munk School of Global Affairs' Asian Institute, Hou said his Queen's colleagues were asking him to help them provide course material to students in China.\n",
      "\tChina monitors its citizens' use of the internet and blocks content from sites such as Facebook and YouTube. Sensitive material such as nudes or violence is also blocked.\n",
      "\tHou suggests professors upload PDFs to their university's online learning systems for students to download directly, but notes that video will still be a challenge -- China's firewall system makes internet download speeds excruciatingly slow.\n",
      "\tProfessors, he said, should not encourage their students in China to use virtual private networks, which are encyrpted internet connections. VPNs, Hou explained, have a complicated legal status in the country, though he said he doesn't know of any students being punished for using one.\n",
      "\t\"It is not wise to adjust the course materials for Chinese students,\" he said in an email. Instead, he said, teachers should be very clear about what's in the course so students can assess the risk themselves.\n",
      "\tProfessors who teach social movements can't avoid including material on the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests in Beijing and the ensuing massacre, he explained. The Chinese state violence in 1989 is \"100 per cent sensitive content in China's censorship policy.\"\n",
      "\t\"In this way, instructors of different courses may find they are influenced by China's censorship on different levels.\"\n",
      "\tThe University of Toronto and the University of British Columbia also sent memos to instructors before the school year began. The University of Toronto asked its faculty to share a message with students explaining that online course material can violate local law.\n",
      "\tUBC encouraged instructors to include a statement on their course syllabi explaining the material could contain content that is censored by \"non-Canadian governments.\"\n",
      "\t\"This may include, but is not limited to, human rights, representative government, defamation, obscenity, gender or sexuality, and historical or current geopolitical controversies,\" the statement said. It asks students to consider postponing the course until they are back in Canada.\n",

      "\t“We'll be having Thanksgiving supper at the house this year instead of out in the field, so that's always nice,” said Todd Lewis, who farms more than 4,000 hectares near Regina.\n",
      "\tLewis has more to be thankful for than a comfortable seat at a good meal. After a couple of tough years with late rains and early snows, 2020's warm, dry autumn has put him and his fellow farmers in a sweet spot -- a decent, above-average crop safely in the bin with high ratings for quality and prices looking up.\n",
      "\t“It has been pretty positive,” Lewis said. “With the quality of the crop, we're going to have a pretty good marketing year ahead of us.”\n",
      "\tEverything in farming varies from place to place. But Statistics Canada says that on the whole, this has been a good year in agriculture.\n",
      "\tOverall wheat yields are forecast to be up about six per cent to about 34 million tonnes. Canola, Canada's second-largest crop, is expected to come in just under the five-year average at 19 million tonnes.\n",
      "\tYields of other important crops such as barley, oats, lentils and corn are all forecast to rise this year.\n",
      "\tAnd while many farmers at this time last year still had crops in the field -- some shrouded under unseasonal snow -- 2020 harvests are finishing early.\n",
      "\tIn Manitoba, about 80 per cent of grains and oilseeds have been taken in. About 90 per cent of Saskatchewan's crop has been combined, well ahead of the five-year average of 67 per cent for this time of year.\n",
      "\tIt's the same in Alberta, where more than two-thirds of the harvest is complete, up from the five-year average of less than half.\n",
      "\tAnd much of that crop is grading high, which will fetch better prices from buyers.\n",
      "\t“The crop does appear to be fairly high-quality,” said Dane Froese of Manitoba Agriculture, who said most of his province's harvest will be graded No 1 or 2.\n",
      "\t“It's very good quality,” said Lewis. He said his lentils and durum -- a type of wheat used for pasta -- are graded No. 2 and all his canola will be top grade.\n",
      "\tPrices vary from place to place and change over time, so it's hard to fix how much cash farmers will have after they truck their crops to the terminal, but things are looking good right now.\n",
      "\t“I'm seeing a lot of positives,” said J.P. Gervais of the Farm Credit Corp. in Saskatchewan.\n",
      "\tCanola prices are edging back up, with futures prices up about 10 per cent recently due to strong Chinese demand for oilseeds.\n",
      "\t“Wheat has been a bit of a mixed performance, but now it's moving up above the five-year average, said Gervais.\n",
      "\t“Futures contracts in the U.S. are higher than they were a year ago, two years ago. I think it's a very positive picture right now.”\n",
      "\tLewis is just happy to be doing something else this month other than harvesting.\n",
      "\t“In the last 10 years, it's been more than normal that we're still combining after Oct. 21,” he said.\n",
      "\t“This is pretty unusual.”HARVEST\n",

      "\tU.S. President Donald Trump has been the world's biggest driver of COVID-19 misinformation during the pandemic, a study from Cornell University said Thursday.\n",
      "\tA team from the Cornell Alliance for Science evaluated 38 million articles published by English-language, traditional media worldwide between January 1 and May 26 of this year.\n",
      "\tThe database they used aggregates coverage from countries such as the United States, Britain, India, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand and other African and Asian nations.\n",
      "\tThey identified 522,472 news articles that reproduced or amplified misinformation related to the coronavirus pandemic, or what the World Health Organization has called the \"infodemic.\"\n",
      "\tThese were categorized into 11 main sub-topics, ranging from conspiracy theories to attacks on top scientist Anthony Fauci to the idea that the virus is a bioweapon unleashed by China.\n",
      "\tBut the most popular topic by far was what the study authors termed \"miracle cures,\" which appeared in 295,351 articles -- more than the other 10 topics combined.\n",
      "\tThe authors found that comments by President Trump drove major spikes in the \"miracle cures\" topic, led by his April 24 press briefing where he mused on the possibility of using disinfectants inside the body to cure the coronavirus.\n",
      "\tSimilar spikes were seen when he promoted unproven treatments like hydroxychloroquine.\n",
      "\t\"We conclude therefore that the president of the United States was likely the largest driver of the COVID-19 misinformation 'infodemic,'\" the team wrote.\n",
      "\tSarah Evanega, who led the study and is director of the Cornell Alliance for Science, said: \"If people are misled by unscientific and unsubstantiated claims about the disease, they may be less likely to observe official guidance and thus risk spreading the virus.\"\n",
      "\tCo-author Jordan Adams, a data analyst at Cision Insights that provided the database, added: \"One of the more interesting aspects of the data collection process was discovering the staggering amount of misinformation coverage directly linked to the public comments of a small number of individuals.\"\n",
      "\tAfter miracle cures, the second-most prevalent misinformation topic was that the pandemic was created to advance a \"new world order.\"\n",
      "\tNext came the claim that the pandemic was a hoax for political gain by the U.S. Democratic Party, followed by conspiracies alleging the virus was a bioweapon released by a laboratory in Wuhan, China.\n",
      "\tConspiracy theories linking the pandemic to philanthropist Bill Gates came next, then the hoax that COVID-19 symptoms are caused by 5G phone networks, anti-Semitic conspiracy theories and the notion that the virus is a form of population control.\n",
      "\tAttacks on U.S. government scientist Fauci, references to the debunked \"Plandemic\" video, and blaming the virus on Chinese people consuming bat soup rounded off the list.\n",
      "\tThe study's authors found there was some effort to correct the misinformation in the form of fact-checking articles, which appeared 183,717 times during the period studied.\n",
      "\tThey also tracked how the stories were shared on social media, finding that the posts elicited 36 million engagements, three-quarters of them on Facebook. \n",
      "\tThe research was partly funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.\n",

      "CONTENT : PORT ALICE -- \n",
      "\tNeucel Specialty Cellulose's bankruptcy will cost the province an additional $9 million to decommission the abandoned pulp mill in Port Alice.\n",
      "\tPricewaterhouseCoopers (PWC) has been managing the process since it was appointed as receiver earlier this year. It has already spent $5 million and told the court it would need a total of $17 million to manage the site until March 31, 2021.\n",
      "\tMill operations were stopped, supposedly temporarily, in 2015; Neucel left a handful of staff on site until early 2019 when it shut the doors for good, laying off remaining staff.\n",
      "\tThe company dissipated with several million dollars of debt owed to the province and local municipality, as well as millions of litres of hazardous waste. Letters and bills for clean up and unpaid taxes sent by the province went unanswered, leading the court to grant a bankruptcy order.\n",
      "\tIn April, B.C.'s Supreme Court approved PWC to borrow up to $8 million to decommission the abandoned mill. Now it has approved a total of $17 million, which will cover costs until March 2021.\n",
      "\tThis is on top of the more than $13 million owed to the province, $1.8 million owed to the Village of Port Alice and hundreds of thousands in debts to other creditors. Fulida Holdings, a large private Chinese textiles company, bought Neucel in 2011, and is listed as the largest creditor being owed $235 million.\n",
      "\tIn its report to the court, PWC detailed what has been done so far, and everything that still needs to be dealt with to de-risk the site.\n",
      "\tThe mill covers approximately 40 acres of land, including the wharf and effluent treatment systems and all the production equipment. The substation that produced hydro power for the mill was built on mill property; there are several landfills, some without permits, and millions of litres of untreated waste water to be dealt with.\n",
      "\tThe most expensive cost so far are PWC's fees, totalling $1.4 million, followed by $1 million to manage effluent and $850,000 to transport the hazardous waste. Going forward, PWC expects the effluent management to cost more than $6 million. This includes dealing with the spent sulfite liquor, known as red liquor, that began to collapse and risked leaking into the ground.\n",

      "\tNews that the world's most powerful man was infected with the world's most notorious disease drew instant reactions of shock, sympathy, undisguised glee and, of course, the ever-present outrage and curiosity surrounding everything about U.S. President Donald Trump.\n",
      "Trump's announcement Friday, on Twitter, that he and first lady Melania Trump tested positive for the coronavirus, and the deep uncertainty that accompanied it, flashed across screens large and small, upending countless plans and sparking comment everywhere from presidential offices to the thousands looking to weigh in on social media.\n",
      "\tThe positive test reading for the leader of the world's largest economy adds more uncertainty to investors' worries, especially about its effect on the Nov. 3 election between the Republican president and Democrat Joe Biden. U.S. stock futures and most world markets fell on the news as did the price of oil.\n",
      "\tWorld leaders were quick to weigh in, with official sympathy from the top and something approaching schadenfreude elsewhere. Trump joins a growing list of the powerful who have contracted the virus, including many who were skeptical of the disease.\n",
      "\t\"I hope that your inherent vitality, good spirits and optimism will help you cope with the dangerous virus,\" Russian President Vladimir Putin wrote in a direct message to Trump released by the Kremlin.\n",
      "World Health Organization director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus tweeted \"My best wishes to President @realDonaldTrump and @FLOTUS for a full and speedy recovery.\" The Trump administration in July formally notified the United Nations of its withdrawal from WHO, although the pullout won't take effect until next year. Trump claims the UN health agency is in need of reform and is heavily influenced by China.\n",
      "Italian right-wing opposition leader Matteo Salvini tweeted: \"In Italy and in the world, whoever celebrates the illness of a man or of a woman, and who comes to wish the death of a neighbour, confirms what he is: An idiot without soul. A hug to Melania and Donald.\"\n",
      "\tBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who was hospitalized for a week in April after he contracted COVID-19, wished Trump a \"speedy recovery.\"\n",
      "\tDr. Bharat Pankhania, who advises Johnson's government on communicable disease control, said he hopes that Trump's positive test sends a message to the president and other leaders.\n",
      "\t\"We need politicians, especially politicians like President Trump who has a lot of power and influence, to take this seriously and to support their scientists and clinicians in leading the outbreak management, rather than have political influence in trying to deny that this virus is in circulation and drag your feet around control measures because it suited your agenda.\"\n",
      "\tTokyo Gov. Yuriko Koike, speaking at a weekly news conference, did not mention Trump's reluctance to wear masks when asked about his infection, but she said the news \"reminded me of how widely masks are worn in Japan.\"\n",
      "\tMajor media across the globe also played up the announcement, with bulletins crawling across TV screens in Seoul, Tokyo, Taipei, Dubai and Beijing.\n",
      "\t\"To say this potentially could be a big deal is an understatement,\" banking and financial service Rabobank said in a commentary. \"Anyway, everything now takes a backseat to the latest incredible twist in this U.S. election campaign.\"\n",
      "\tChina's official Xinhua News Agency flashed the news, and an anchor on state broadcaster CCTV announced it; there was no immediate comment from the government Friday, the second day of an eight-day national holiday.\n",
      "\tThe positive test result for Trump and his wife was the most searched topic in China on the widely used social media app Weibo a few hours after the announcement, with most comments mocking or critical.\n",
      "\tOne user darkly joked that Trump had finally tweeted something positive.\n",
      "\tThe Chinese government has bristled at Trump's attempts to blame China, where the disease emerged, for the pandemic and called for global co-operation in fighting it, a message that has resonated with the public.\n",
      "\tHu Xijin, the outspoken editor of the state-owned Global Times newspaper, tweeted in English that \"President Trump and the first lady have paid the price for his gamble to play down the COVID-19.\"\n",
      "\tMultiple Arab news media outlets on Friday continuously broadcast footage of Trump and his wife after the virus announcement.\n",
      "\tAl-Arabiya, a Saudi-owned satellite channel based in Dubai, cut to a long live shot of the White House. Qatari state-owned Al Jazeera channel brought in four commentators to discuss the \"prevailing state of uncertainty\" in the United States, questioning whether Trump could effectively steer a reelection campaign and run the country from quarantine.\n",
      "\tIranian state television announced Trump had the virus, an anchor breaking the news with an unflattering image of the U.S. president surrounded by what appeared to be giant coronaviruses. U.S.-Iran ties have suffered since Trump unilaterally withdrew the United States from Tehran's nuclear deal with world powers and reimposed crushing sanctions.\n",
      "\tSocial media platforms were ablaze with quick reaction.\n",
      "\tWould Trump blame the Chinese? Would he thumb his nose at his critics and enemies by breezing through the quarantine without serious symptoms, tweeting away from the White House? Would he become gravely ill, or worse, and, if he did, what would that mean for the U.S. election, one of the most contentious in recent history? What would it mean for U.S. leadership during tumultuous times?\n",
      "\tWhile the uncertainty seemed palpable on a scroll through various social media in an array of languages, many comments seemed to revel in the announcement.\n",
      "\t\"Here comes a chance for him to actually try out his idea of injecting disinfectant into himself and fighting back (against allegations that) it was fake news!\" tweeted Hiroyuki Nishimura, a Japanese internet entrepreneur, referring to an idea Trump floated earlier this year for treatment.\n",
      "\tKeio University economics professor Masaru Kaneko tweeted that populist leaders like British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro \"got infected because they tended not to take the coronavirus seriously. The two other leaders seriously tackled (the virus) after they got infected themselves. Will the United States follow their examples?\"\n",
      "\tAnd the satirical Australian news site, the Betoota Advocate, posted a story with this headline: \"Trump Family Records More Cases Of Community Transmission Than Entire State Of Queensland.\"\n",
      "\t \n",
      "\t\t\tTonight, @FLOTUS and I tested positive for COVID-19. We will begin our quarantine and recovery process immediately. We will get through this TOGETHER!\n",
      "\t\t\tMy best wishes to President @realDonaldTrump and @FLOTUS for a full and speedy recovery. https://t.co/6OUZT20huK\n",
      "\t\t\tIn Italia e nel mondo, chi festeggia la malattia di un uomo o di una donna, chi arriva ad augurare la morte del prossimo, si conferma quello che è: un cretino senz’anima. Un abbraccio a Melania e Donald #Trump. @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS pic.twitter.com/xRd6HssS93\n",
      "\t\t\tMy best wishes to President Trump and the First Lady. Hope they both have a speedy recovery from coronavirus.\n",
      "\t\t\tPresident Trump and the first lady have paid the price for his gamble to play down the COVID-19. The news shows the severity of the US’ pandemic situation. It will impose a negative impact on the image of Trump and the US, and may also negatively affect his reelection.\n",

      "CONTENT : DETROIT -- \n",
      "\tWhen U.S. President Donald Trump refused to outright condemn white nationalists in this week's presidential debate and urged his supporters to monitor polling sites, Portia Roberson was reminded of earlier eras when Black Americans were intimidated at the polls to deter them from voting.\n",
      "\tRoberson, a 51-year-old Black woman who lives in Detroit, found the comments chilling -- but also felt a renewed resolve to vote.\n",
      "\tFor many Black Americans and other people of colour, Trump's comments in his debate with Democratic challenger Joe Biden were a harsh reminder that the nation has yet to fully grapple with systemic racism laid bare this year by protests against police killings of Black people, the coronavirus pandemic, and the resulting economic fallout.\n",
      "\tBut they were also a call to action.\n",
      "\t\"I hope that we take some of that frustration, anger and sadness that we've all been feeling for the better part of 2020, and use it to motivate ourselves to go to the polls and make sure we vote and vote for candidates who really reflect what Black folks need in this country,\" said Roberson, CEO of the Detroit non-profit Focus: Hope.\n",
      "\tTrump tried to walk back his debate comments on Wednesday, but the moment when he told one far-right group to \"stand back and stand by\" had already been cemented in the minds of many Americans, experts and activists say. A day after the debate, the president said he didn't know the group but that it should \"let law enforcement do their work.\"\n",
      "\tDuring the debate, he also urged his \"supporters to go into the polls and watch very carefully because that's what has to happen.\"\n",
      "\tEric Sheffield, a Black real estate developer in Atlanta whose parents hail from the Deep South, said Trump's comments reminded him of the Jim Crow era.\n",
      "\t\"I hear the ghost of voter suppressionists past,\" said Sheffield, 52. \"It's the same soup. It's just warmed over now.\"\n",
      "\tIt's not just Black Americans who took notice -- and umbrage -- at the president's debate comments. Similar concerns are also reverberating among Americans from other backgrounds, said Anna Mach, a biracial Filipino American woman who is a master's student at the University of Denver.\n",
      "\t\"I'm disgusted and angry and terrified by those comments,\" Mach, 22, said. \"But I'm not surprised.\"\n",
      "\tSince the coronavirus, which first flared in China, spread to the United States, Mach said she's seen a surge in hate directed toward Asian Americans. Trump himself has been criticized for referring to COVID-19 as the \"Chinese virus.\"\n",
      "\t\"I'm worried there will be more hate crimes from white supremacists,\" she said.\n",
      "\tOn Thursday, when asked for a definitive statement on whether the president denounces white supremacism, White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany said that Trump had said the day before: \"I have always denounced any form of that.\"\n",
      "\tSome organizations are working to transform the fears elicited by Trump's comments into votes.\n",
      "\tThe New Georgia Project has identified about 600,000, Black, Latino, Asian American and young voters that it wanted to encourage to vote in November, said CEO Nse Ufot. She said that doesn't include an additional 90,000 Black voters who live in Georgia's \"rural Black belt\" who didn't vote in 2016 and who they're also trying to reach.\n",
      "\t\"The debate was not about communicating his (Trump's) vision for America,\" Ufot said. \"It was about making it super unpleasant and awful and distasteful and to encourage people to withdraw from the process, and we won't let that happen.\"\n",
      "\tDr. Elvin Geng, a professor at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis helped establish Asian Americans Against Trump, which has been funding digital and print ads in Asian-language media outlets in battleground states.\n",
      "\tGeng hopes younger Asian Americans who don't support Trump will talk to their relatives who do about their thinking and maybe change some minds.\n",
      "\t\"In many realms ... immigrants do look to their kids for what they think, how to think about what's happening in America,\" Geng said.\n",
      "\tWhile Trump's comments -- and his record on race -- may have unsettled many Americans, for some Black people they evoke a particularly dark history.\n",
      "\tThe rhetoric conjured up memories of Southern segregationists and voter intimidation tactics for the Rev. Wendell H. Paris, 75, who was involved in voting rights work in the 1960s including registration drives in Alabama and the Selma-to-Montgomery march.\n",
      "\t\"Whenever you hear him say, `law and order,' that's coded language,\" said Paris. \"We have reverted back to the racial situation of the 1950s and the 1960s.\"\n",
      "\tEven after the Voting Rights Act in 1965 offered greater protections, Paris recalled the way white deputies in uniform would show up at voting precincts in mostly Black areas to watch over voters -- which had the effect of intimidating them given the history of racist mistreatment.\n",
      "\tBecause of that history, University of Michigan political science professor Vincent Hutchings said he believes Trump's comments are stirring legitimate concerns that overzealous supporters will cause trouble at polling sites, particularly in Black communities.\n",
      "\t\"What sorts of things would represent violations or fraud?\" Hutchings asked. \"It's very murky and so, as a consequence, people have to exercise their own discretion, and when that happens, all bets are off, so it is certainly dangerous in that regard.\"\n",
      "\tChicago resident Cynthia Bell, who said the debate \"broke my heart,\" has decided to vote early out of concern over potential intimidation at the polls.\n",
      "\t\"How is this possible in this day and age?\" asked Bell, who manages a senior centre in her mostly Black community. \"What have we gotten ourselves into?\"\n",

      "\tMillions of distressed Indian manufacturers and traders are counting on the eagerly-awaited October-December festive season to rescue them from their coronavirus catastrophe.\n",
      "\tBut spending may be the last thing on the minds of many Indians who have lost their jobs or businesses in the pandemic downturn, and pressure is building for Prime Minister Narendra Modi to do more to regain the momentum of growth that, at 8.2 per cent in 2016-17, made India one of the fastest growing major economies.\n",
      "\tThe Hindu Dussehra, Diwali and Durga Puja celebrations that extend through the Christmas and New Year holidays are an occasion to splurge on big ticket items like gold, homes and cars as well as clothing, smartphones and electronics.\n",
      "\tThis year will likely lack the customary pomp and show, given the need for masks and social distancing with the pandemic still raging and no vaccine yet available.\n",
      "\tThe government began easing a stringent two-month-long lockdown in June, but business still is only a quarter to a fifth of usual and customers are scarce, said Praveen Khandelwal, general secretary of the Confederation of All India Traders.\n",
      "\tIn August, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced US$1.46 trillion in infrastructure projects to boost the sagging economy and allocated $2 billion to upgrading the country's overwhelmed health system.\n",
      "\tThat followed a 1.7 trillion rupees ($22 billion) economic stimulus package announced in March, including delivering rations of grain and lentils for 800 million people, some 60 per cent of the world's second-most populous country.\n",
      "\tOther subsidies included a meagre cash grant of 6,000 rupees ($80) a year each for 86 million poor farmers and free cooking gas cylinders for 83 million poor women until the end of September.\n",
      "\tThe economy still contracted an unprecedented 24 per cent in the April-June quarter, with another downturn forecast for July-September.\n",
      "\tThe government needs to do more, said Nobel laureate Abhijit Banerjee, such as direct cash transfers for the poor and others severely affected by the prolonged lockdown. India's pandemic assistance has amounted to only about 1 per cent of its GDP, he said, compared with the U.S.'s package in March of about 10 per cent of its GDP.\n",
      "\tThe crisis is far from over: India's coronavirus caseload jumped from 1 million in mid-July to 6.3 million in less than three months and the number of fatalities is approaching 100,000.\n",
      "\tModi's administration is hard strapped to push out more stimulus, however, given the financial demands of dealing with the pandemic on top of military tensions with China along a disputed border in the mountainous Ladakh region, where both sides have amassed tens of thousands of troops.\n",
      "\tDefence analysts estimate India may need up to 1 billion rupees ($13 million a day to run its military machine at an altitude of 16,000 feet (4,875 metres) if the two countries fail to defuse their months-long faceoff.\n",
      "\tThe lockdown imposed in late March cost more than 10 million impoverished migrant workers their jobs in the cities. Many made grueling journeys back to their hometowns and villages. Now they face the ordeal of trying to get back to their factory jobs.\n",
      "\t\"There is almost no work,\" said Ram Ratan, 46, who was working in a printing company before he returned to his home village in April. \"We keep roaming around, looking for some steady work, but most factories don't let us in.\"\n",
      "\tMansoor Ansari is among hundreds of workers who wait every day on what is called a \"labour roundabout,\" in an industrial area, hoping to get picked up by employers.\n",
      "\tBefore the pandemic lockdown, Ansari had a steady job at a garment factory in the industrial town of Manesar near New Delhi, earning $200 a month, he said. He was able to pay rent and send money to his wife and five children in a village in eastern Bihar state.\n",
      "\tAs Ansari's factory shut down, he joined a caravan of workers who walked several miles before jumping on to overcrowded flatbed trucks to get home.\n",
      "\tUnable to find work there, and digging himself deeper into debt, after restrictions were lifted Ansari joined the legions of workers returning to Manesar.\n",
      "\tDeshraj, who uses one name, lost his job as a waiter at a roadside eatery in Surat, a city in western India known for diamond cutting and polishing, in the spring and resumed farming in his home village. But unusually heavy rains in April damaged the crop.\n",
      "\t\"This is a common story in villages where crops have been destroyed by unseasonal rains, leading people to commit suicide,\" said Raja Bhaiya, who runs a non-governmental organization to help farmers.\n",
      "\tCompared to the scale of need, government relief has been \"meagre,\" Raghruram Rajan, former governor of the Reserve Bank of India, said in a Linked In post. He likened such help to a tonic.\n",
      "\t\"When the disease is vanquished, it can help a patient get out of her sickbed faster,\" Rajan said. \"But if a patient has atrophied, a stimulus will have little effect.\"\n",
      "\tThe government maintains that the worst is behind.\n",
      "\tAgriculture overall is growing at a 3.4 per cent pace. With good monsoon rains, India might attain a record of 301 million metric tons of food-grain output, including wheat, rice, oil seeds, lentils and mustard, in the 2020-21 financial year --- 4 million metric tons more than in 2019-20.\n",
      "\tKey sectors such as coal, oil, gas, steel and cement have ben recovering gradually, said the government's chief economic advisor, Krishnamurthy Subramanian.\n",
      "\t\"In a V-shaped recovery, it is possible that the slope (of rise) actually may not always be the same exactly as that of the fall, which is a drastic one,\" he said.\n",
      "\tOne other bright spot: Domestic brands are getting a boost from a trend to boycott inexpensive Chinese-made statues of Hindu deities, festive LED lights and electronics that have flooded the market, in favour of locally made products, said Khandelwal.\n",
      "\tFor India's nearly 70 million traders, who employ about 400 million people, an upturn could not come fast enough. They are keeping their finger crossed and trying not to let their hopes get too high as the festive season approaches.\n",
      "\tSanyam Jain, 24, and his brother Ankit Jain, 31, owned three clothing shops in New Delhi and its suburbs, each store averaging more than $25,000 in monthly before the lockdown.\n",
      "\tThey've shut one store and would be happy to sell even half of their inventory this year.\n",
      "\t\"The government hasn't given us any relief at all,\" said Ankit Jain said.\n",
      "\tSales usually pick up 20-25 per cent during the holidays, said Nitin Makkar, who runs a store in Noida on the outskirts of New Delhi, the capital. \"I have no such hopes this time as people may restrict themselves to buying essentials and avoiding luxurious items.\"\n",

      "CONTENT : TORONTO -- \n",
      "\tIn the wake of the news that a young actress from Markham, Ont., will be breaking down barriers in the world of superhero TV as Ms. Marvel, a Muslim superhero, local comic book fans are celebrating.\n",
      "\tIn Heroes World, a comic book shop that has stood in Markham for almost 20 years, Marvel fan Zahra Rizvi told CTV News she was delighted to hear that someone with the same background as hers will finally play a superhero on screen.\n",
      "\t“It means a lot,” Rizvi said. “And now the women in my family, the little girls growing up, can see that, and I think it'll make a big difference.”\n",
      "\tRizvi is the daughter of Pakistani immigrants, just like Iman Vellani, the 18-year-old from Markham who’s been reportedly picked to play Ms. Marvel in a new Disney+ series, based on the breakthrough comic book character, Kamala Khan.\n",
      "\tDeadline broke the news on Wednesday. Neither Disney or Marvel has officially confirmed the casting.\n",
      "\tThe character was first created in 2013, and was the first Muslim character to star in her own Marvel comic book. She has the power to alter her shape and size as Ms. Marvel, able to extend her arms and expand her fists to superhuman proportions in battle.\n",
      "\tThe upcoming show on Disney+ will mark the first time that she’s been portrayed by an actor in a TV show, although the character appeared recently as a central character in the Marvel Avengers video game that came out this month.\n",
      "\tAndre Greenidge, one of the owners of Heroes World, says it’s all part of an overdue effort to add more diversity to the superhero universe.\n",
      "\t“So people growing up, young kids, can say, ‘Hey, not only is that character cool, but that character looks like me and I can see myself in that character,’” Greenidge told CTV News.\n",
      "\tAfter the news of Vellani’s casting broke, many celebrities tweeted out their support.\n",
      "\tKumail Nanjiani, a Pakistani American actor who stars in the upcoming superhero movie The Eternals, tweeted out, “I just saw they cast Ms. Marvel and legit got teary eyed.\n",
      "\t“Congratulations Iman Vellani! Your work is going to mean so much to so many people, myself included. I can’t wait.”\n",
      "\t\t\tI just saw they cast Ms. Marvel and legit got teary eyed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\t\t\tCongratulations Iman Vellani! Your work is going to mean so much to so many people, myself included. I can’t wait.\n",
      "\tActress Mindy Kaling added, “What a joy in these trying times to see that #MsMarvel (a Pakistani American teen superhero!) has cast its lead role, a young actress named Iman Vellani! I can’t wait to see the show!”\n",
      "\tShe ended her tweet with a string of emoji hearts, and the hashtag “#RepresentationMatters”.\n",
      "\t\t\tWhat a joy in these trying times to see that #MsMarvel (a Pakistani American teen superhero!) has cast its lead role, a young actress named Iman Vellani! Congrats to you! I can’t wait to see the show! ❤️❤️❤️❤️#RepresentationMatters\n",
      "\tAs the Marvel on-screen universe expands, it’s looking more and more like the real one.\n",
      "\tVellani is one of several Canadians recently cast in Marvel roles. Toronto’s Simu Liu will play Shang-Chi, Marvel’s first Chinese superhero, in a film slated for release in 2021.\n",
      "\tAnd Tatiana Maslany, who hails from Regina and is known for her Emmy award-winning run as the central character in the sci-fi thriller Orphan Black, is set to play She-Hulk in an upcoming TV series for Disney+.\n",
      "\t\"It's great, especially at this time, just to see local talent coming from Canada,” Greenidge said.\n",
      "\tFor Rizvi, knowing someone from her town will be playing this pivotal role makes it even more special.\n",
      "\t“I feel that's wicked, because she's local, and you just feel a little bit of a sense of pride,” Rizvi said. “She's Canadian.” \n",

      "CONTENT : LONDON -- \n",
      "\tWikiLeaks founder Julian Assange will likely spend the rest of 2020 inside a British prison cell before finding out whether he can be sent to the United States to face espionage charges, the judge in his extradition hearing said Thursday.\n",
      "\tAfter hearing nearly four weeks of evidence at London's Old Bailey courthouse, District Judge Vanessa Baraitser said she would deliver her decision on whether to grant a U.S. extradition request for Assange at 10 a.m. on Jan. 4. Assange is fighting extradition.\n",
      "\tThe judge's ruling won't necessarily end the proceedings. Whichever side loses is expected to appeal. There's also the possibility of a change in U.S. policy should Joe Biden defeat President Donald Trump in the Nov. 3 U.S. presidential election.\n",
      "\t\"Unless any further application for bail is made, and between now and the 4th of January, you will remain in custody for the same reasons as have been given to you before,\" Baraitser told Assange, who was sitting behind a security screen at the back of the hearing courtroom.\n",
      "\tThe judge previously denied Assange bail over fears he is a flight risk. Assange jumped bail in 2012 when he sought asylum at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, where he stayed for seven years before being evicted and arrested. He has been in custody at Belmarsh prison in London since April 2019 and is expected to appear in court via video link every 28 days between now and the Jan. 4 ruling.\n",
      "\tU.S. prosecutors have indicted the 49-year-old Assange on 17 espionage charges and one charge of computer misuse over WikiLeaks' publication of secret American military documents a decade ago largely relating to the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.\n",
      "\tFollowing the adjournment on Thursday, Stella Moris, Assange's fiancee and the mother of his two young children, said, \"Julian and I would like to thank everyone for the kindness that has been shown over the past few weeks.\"\n",
      "\t\"It's a fight for Julian's life, a fight for press freedom and a fight for the truth,\" Moris said outside the court.\n",
      "\tNow that lawyers have finished presenting evidence, Assange's defence team has asked for another four weeks to submit its closing argument. That will be followed two weeks later by the closing argument of the lawyers prosecuting on behalf of the U.S. government.\n",
      "\tThe judge has an abundance of evidence to trawl through in a hearing that was delayed by the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. Except for an early virus exposure scare and occasional outbursts from the usually face-masked Assange, the hearing proceeded smoothly.\n",
      "\tThe charges against Assange carry a maximum sentence of 175 years in prison. Lawyers acting on behalf of the U.S. government say Assange committed serious crimes that put people's lives in danger, allegations his fiancee disputed.\n",
      "\t\"Under oath, the prosecution concedes that it has no evidence that a single person has ever come to any physical harm because of these publications,\" Moris said. \"Let me repeat that: there is no evidence that a single person has ever come to any physical harm because of these publications.\"\n",
      "\tAssange's defence team argued he is entitled to First Amendment protections for the publication of leaked documents that exposed U.S. military wrongdoing and that the extradition request was politically motivated.\n",
      "\tThe London court heard from an array of witnesses, who pronounced on issues of huge importance and substance, such as the freedom of the press and government-sanctioned torture.\n",
      "\t\"Julian Assange's actions, which have been characterized as criminal, are actions that expose power to sunlight,\" renowned U.S. linguist and scholar Noam Chomsky said.\n",
      "\tOther witnesses relayed more shadowy -- and sometimes comic -- matters of intrigue during his time at WikiLeaks and at the Ecuadorian Embassy,\n",
      "\tAccording to one witness, Assange \"binge-watched\" the suicide of the former Bosnian Croat general, Slobodan Praljak, at a U.N. court three years ago.\n",
      "\tDefence lawyers said Assange was suffering from wide-ranging mental health issues, including suicidal tendencies, that could be exacerbated if he is placed in inhospitable prison conditions in the U.S. They said Assange's mental health deteriorated while he took asylum inside the embassy and that he was diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder.\n",
      "\tHis legal team argued that Assange would very likely face solitary confinement in the U.S. immediately that would put him at a heightened risk of suicide. They also said that if convicted, Assange would most likely be sent to the notorious ADX Supermax prison in Colorado, a facility labeled by a former warden as a \"fate worse than death\" and inhabited by the likes of Unabomber Ted Kaczynski and Mexican drug lord Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman.\n",
      "\tLawyers acting on behalf of the U.S. government argued that Assange's mental state was not as poor as described and said he wouldn't be subject to improper conditions before or after any trial.\n",
      "\tAssange has attracted the support of high-profile figures, including actress Pamela Anderson and rapper M.I.A. The dissident Chinese contemporary artist Ai Weiwei also staged a silent protest outside the court.\n",
      "\tDaniel Ellsberg, perhaps the most famous whistleblower in living memory, argued that they had \"very comparable political opinions.\"\n",
      "\tThe 89-year-old, widely credited for helping to bring about an end to the Vietnam War through his leaking of the so-called Pentagon Papers in 1971, said the American public \"needed urgently to know what was being done routinely in their name, and there was no other way for them to learn it than by unauthorized disclosure.\"\n",
      "\tThere are clear echoes between Assange and Ellsberg, who leaked over 7,000 pages of classified documents to the press, including The New York Times and The Washington Post. He was subsequently put on trial on 12 charges in connection with violations of the Espionage Act, which were punishable by up to 115 years in prison. The charges were dismissed in 1973 because of government misconduct against him.\n",
      "\tAssange will be hoping that developments within the U.S. government over the coming weeks will lead to a similar outcome for him -- before any judgment from the London court.\n",

      "\tU.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Vatican officials discussed their differences over China on Thursday, the Vatican said, a day after tensions over the Holy See's outreach to Beijing spilled out in public.\n",
      "\tPompeo spent 45 minutes in the Apostolic Palace with his Vatican counterpart, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, and the Vatican foreign minister, Archbishop Paul Gallagher.\n",
      "\tVatican spokesman Matteo Bruni said both sides \"presented their respective positions\" about relations with China in a climate of \"respect, openness and cordiality.\"\n",
      "\tThe State Department's deputy spokesperson, Cale Brown, said the men \"discussed the importance of defending religious freedom and other human rights issues, and expressed particular concern about the situation in China.\"\n",
      "\tPope Francis declined to meet with Pompeo, to avoid any suggestion of political favouritism ahead of November's U.S. presidential election, Vatican officials said. Pompeo met with Francis last October, and it would have been unusual for him to have gotten another audience so soon, even without an impending election.\n",
      "\tPompeo's visit got off on a sour note, as far as the Vatican was concerned, after he penned an essay last month for a conservative magazine suggesting that the Vatican had compromised its moral authority by signing the 2018 nominations agreement with Beijing.\n",
      "\tHis article greatly irritated the Vatican, which saw it as interference in the church's internal affairs for the sake of scoring domestic political points.\n",
      "\tA State Department official, speaking to reporters on condition of anonymity, sought to tamp down the tensions Thursday, noting that the U.S. has good relations with many Catholic institutions, including charities.\n",
      "\tAnother U.S. official, similarly speaking on condition of anonymity due to being unauthorized to discuss the private conversation, also sought to smooth over the dispute, saying the Holy See had a history of promoting religious freedom.\n",
      "\t\"The Vatican's playing the long game when it comes to human rights and religious liberty,\" the official said.\n",
      "\t\"Tactical agreements and tactical differences will come and go,\" the official continued. \"But the broader strategic vision, the United States and the Vatican, are in lockstep and have been for four generations and will be for generations to come.\"\n",
      "\tPompeo was in Rome to participate in a conference on religious freedom organized by the U.S. Embassy to the Holy See, and to meet with Italian and Vatican officials.\n",
      "\tDuring the Wednesday conference, Pompeo urged the Holy See to join the United States in denouncing violations of religious freedom in China, part of the broader U.S. campaign to criticize Beijing's crackdown on religious and ethnic minorities.\n",
      "\tGallagher, the Vatican foreign minister, was in the audience at the time of his speech and didn't refer at all to China in his remarks.\n",
      "\tThe Vatican is seeking to extend its accord with China, which envisages a process of dialogue in selecting bishops. It signed it in 2018 in hopes it would help unite China's Catholics, who for seven decades have been split between those belonging to an official, state-sanctioned church and an underground church loyal to Rome.\n",
      "\tThe Vatican has defended the accord against criticism the pope sold out the underground faithful, saying the deal was necessary to prevent an even worse schism in the Chinese church.\n",
      "\tThe Vatican has rarely, if ever called out China for its crackdown on religious and ethnic minorities and other human rights abuses, and it has stayed mum during months of protests in Hong Kong. It similarly rarely criticizes Russia, for fear of harming relations with the Russian Orthodox Church.\n",
      "\tPompeo started his day Thursday visiting the Rome-based Sant'Egidio Community, a Catholic charity active in caring for refugees in Italy and providing HIV-AIDS care in Africa. Arriving at Sant'Egidio's headquarters, Pompeo praised the group's efforts as \"the Lord's work.\"\n",

      "\tMore than 600 million trips will be taken during the holiday, down 20 percent from a year ago, Ctrip estimated, but they will still force the state railway to lay on 1,000 extra trains a day.\n",
      "\tAround 108 million passengers will take trains during the eight-day holidays -- around 13.5 million a day.\n",
      "\tThey are likely to bring much-needed spending to far-flung parts of China -- last year, travellers spent US$9.5 billion during the Golden Week.\n",
      "\tMany will take luxury holidays at home, travel operator Quanar said, amid global travel restrictions.\n",
      "\tBut the absence of their tourist dollars this year will leave regional nations -- from Thailand to Cambodia -- wincing from the economic pain caused by the prolonged closure of borders.\n",

      "\tThe once eerily empty streets in the city's financial district are packed, previously deserted malls are full of shoppers and ice rinks have filled with children learning to skate again.\n",
      "\tChinese retail sales edged back to growth in August for the first time since the pandemic struck, signalling a rebound for the world's second-largest economy.\n",

The U.S. and Britain accuse China of infringing on the city's freedoms, and the U.S. has imposed sanctions on government officials in Hong Kong and China over the law.\n",
      "\tAt a National Day reception, Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam said \"stability has been restored to society while national security has been safeguarded\" under the new law.\n",
      "\tLam also accused some foreign governments of holding \"double standards\" and levelling unjustified accusations against the authorities who implement the new law.\n",

      "\tOne by one, leaders and ministers from over 100 nations admitted Thursday that 25 years after the adoption of a road map to achieve equality for women not a single country has reached that goal -- and many warned that instead of progress there is now push back. French President Emmanuel Macron put it bluntly, \"women's rights are under attack.\"\n",
      "\tAddressing a high-level meeting to commemorate the landmark 1995 UN women's conference in Beijing, Macron said it's no secret that the 150-page blueprint to realize gender equality approved by 189 nations in the Chinese capital \"would have no chance of being adopted\" in 2020.\n",
      "\tSo \"this is no time for commemoration or self-congratulation,\" he warned, because progress achieved by women \"is being undermined, even in our democracies.\"\n",
      "\tThe Beijing declaration and platform called for bold action in 12 areas for women and girls, including combating poverty and gender-based violence, ensuring all girls get an education and putting women at top levels of business and government, as well as at peacemaking tables. It also said, for the first time in a UN document, that women's human rights include the right to control and decide \"on matters relating to their sexuality, including their sexual and reproductive health, free of discrimination, coercion and violence.\"\n",
      "\tMacron said in his prerecorded speech that progress is being undercut \"starting with the freedom for women to control their own bodies, and in particular the right to abortion.\" And he cited continuing inequalities in schooling, pay, domestic work, and political representation.\n",
      "\tUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has attributed gender inequality to \"centuries of discrimination, deep-rooted patriarchy and misogyny.\"\n",
      "\tIn today's more divided, conservative and still very male-dominated societies, he said, \"we have seen around the world a pushback against gender equality and women's rights.\"\n",
      "\t\"Now is the time to push back against the pushback,\" he declared.\n",
      "\tFiji's Prime Minister Voreqe Bainimarama called it \"a sad testament to the human condition\" that the world is still struggling to achieve the right of women and girls to live free from violence, go to school, participate fully in decision-making affecting their lives and earn equal pay for work of equal value.\n",
      "\t\"The second-class status of women is deeply engrained in many societies, and it takes time and effort to root it out,\" he said.\n",
      "\tThe head of the UN agency charged with promoting gender equality said there has been progress, but not enough and too slow.\n",
      "\tUN Women's Executive Director Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka pointed to 131 countries that enacted legislation to advance gender equality in the last 10 years, the prosecution of gender-related crimes during conflicts, increased school enrolment of girls, and advances in maternal health.\n",
      "\tBut she also stressed significant \"push back\" on reproductive rights and other issues in developed countries, including the United States, and in the European Union. In Africa and Asia, she said, there are governments \"that have not felt any pressure\" to move forward on gender equality.\n",
      "\tWhen the United Nations was founded in 1945 on the ashes of World War II, Mlambo-Ngcuka said, not a single woman was a head of state or government. At the time of the Beijing conference in 1995, there were 12 female leaders, and today there are 22 women leaders among the 193 UN member nations.\n",
      "\t\"Women are now calling for a leapfrog to 50 per cent representation, or parity in all spheres, including Cabinets, corporate boards, and throughout the economy, including women as beneficiaries of COVID-19 fiscal stimulus packages, engagement in all peace processes, and closing the digital divide,\" Mlambo-Ngcuka said.\n",
      "\tSecretary-General Guterres said the coronavirus pandemic has hit women and girls the hardest and warned: \"Unless we act now, COVID-19 could wipe out a generation of fragile progress towards gender equality.\"\n",
      "\tSigrid Kaag, the Netherlands' overseas trade minister, said the disproportionate impact of the pandemic on women and girls \"adds on to an already growing push back against women's rights and girls' rights, and gender equality around the world.\"\n",
      "\t\"There is more gender-based violence,\" she said. \"More women and girls losing their livelihoods, and more girls are sadly not returning to school.\"\n",
      "\tIn her prerecorded speech, German Chancellor Angela Merkel spoke about being in that small group of women world leaders today and recalled Britain's first female prime minister, Margaret Thatcher, saying 26 years ago when she was a minister of education and science that \"No woman in my time will be prime minister.\"\n",
      "\tLooking back at the Beijing conference, Merkel said its platform and declaration remain \"an important cornerstone for the implementation of women's rights around the world\" -- and 25 years after their adoption \"equality should be a given.\"\n",
      "\t\"But we still have a long way to go,\" she said, stressing that equality is a question that women and men can only resolve together, and only \"if society, business and governments pull in the same direction.\"\n",
      "\t\"Get on board!\" Merkel urged. \"Let's work together to really target the Beijing goals! The faster the better.\"\n",
      "\tThe landmark Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing was the largest-ever formal gathering of women, though hundreds of men were among the 17,000 participants at the official meeting that adopted the roadmap to gender equality. Some 30,000 people, the vast majority women, attended a parallel NGO forum outside the capital.\n",
      "\tIran's Vice-President for Women and Family Affairs Masoumeh Ebtekar told the virtual meeting that she was the head of her country's delegation at Beijing and witnessed how women from all nations tried to improve the platform for action.\n",
      "\t\"We have not achieved on many of those areas and have retreated in some like war, poverty and disease,\" she said. \"The struggle against inequality and racism is ongoing and has emerged as a major issue in the Western Hemisphere.\"\n",
      "\tChina's President Xi Jinping called for redoubled efforts \"to promote gender equality and advance the global cause of women's development.\" He said China will donate another $10 million to UN Women in the next five years, and he proposed that world leaders hold another meeting on gender equality and the empowerment of women in 2025.\n",
      "\tAt Thursday's meeting, there were 167 scheduled speakers, each expected to give a three-minute address. But General Assembly President Volkan Bozkir said many prerecorded speeches, because of the pandemic, were longer. The result was that only 115 nations got to speak before the meeting ended.\n",
      "\tBozkir said there would not be another day for speeches, but the UN would post those that weren't heard.\n",
      "\tAmong the countries unable to give their speeches were the United States, Japan, Mexico, United Kingdom, Russia, Lebanon, Libya, Syria and Afghanistan.\n",
      "\tThe United States was a key player in drafting the Beijing declaration and platform, but as late as Thursday morning the UN speakers list had no name for the speaker from the Trump administration. By mid-morning, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos was added, at number 138, and her video address was posted on YouTube.\n",
      "\tDeVos praised the \"incredible gains\" for American women since the Beijing conference and denounced \"evil regimes\" elsewhere that deny women's rights and freedoms, singling out Venezuela, Cuba, Iran and \"the worst violator of all,\" China.\n",
      "\tShe accused the Chinese Communist Party of killing \"millions of baby girls\" since 1995 and attacking Uighurs and other minorities, forcing women to have forced sterilizations and abortions, and urged the United Nations \"to stop ignoring and enabling these attacks.\"\n",

      "CONTENT : WASHINGTON -- \n",
      "\tU.S. President Donald Trump unleashed a torrent of fabrications and fear-mongering in a belligerent debate with Joe Biden, at one point claiming the U.S. death toll would have been 10 times higher under the Democrat because he wanted open borders in the pandemic. Biden preached no such thing.\n",
      "\tTrump barreled into the debate Tuesday night as unconstrained by the facts as at his rallies, but this time having his campaign opponent and even the Fox News moderator, Chris Wallace, calling him out in real time, or trying. Biden stumbled on the record at times as the angry words flew from both men on the Cleveland stage.\n",
      "\tIn just one detour from reality, Trump asserted that the U.S. armed forces will be delivering hundreds of thousands of COVID-19 vaccine doses to the public as soon as a vaccine is available. The Pentagon says there is no such plan for national vaccine distribution by military personnel.\n",
      "\tA look at how some of the candidates’ statements from Cleveland stack up with the facts in the first of three scheduled presidential debates for the Nov. 3 election:\n",
      "TRUMP: “Well, we’re going to deliver it right away. We have the military all set up. Logistically, they’re all set up. We have our military that delivers soldiers and they can do 200,000 a day. They’re going to be delivering ... it’s all set up.”\n",
      "THE FACTS: This is not true.\n",
      "\tThe Pentagon says in a statement that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is responsible for executing the plan to distribute vaccines to the public when the time comes. The Defense Department is helping in the planning but, with perhaps some exceptions in remote areas, is not going to be delivering, as Trump claimed.\n",
      "\t“Our best military assessment is that there is sufficient U.S. commercial transportation capacity to fully support vaccine distribution,” the department’s statement says. “There should be no need for a large commitment of DOD units or personnel to support the nationwide distribution of vaccines. Any DOD required support would be by exception.”\n",
      "\t___\n",
      "TRUMP, addressing Biden on U.S. deaths from COVID-19: “If you were here, it wouldn’t be 200,000 people, it would be 2 million people. You didn’t want me to ban China, which was heavily infected. ... If we would have listened to you, the country would have been left wide open.”\n",
      "THE FACTS: The audacious claim that Biden as president would have seen 2 million deaths rests on a false accusation. Biden never came out against Trump’s decision to restrict travel from China. Biden was slow in staking a position on the matter but when he did, he supported the restrictions. Biden never counseled leaving the country “wide open” in the face of the pandemic.\n",
      "\tTrump repeatedly, and falsely, claims to have banned travel from China. He restricted it.\n",
      "\tThe U.S. restrictions that took effect Feb. 2 continued to allow travel to the U.S. from the Chinese territories of Hong Kong and Macao. The Associated Press reported that more than 8,000 Chinese and foreign nationals based in the two locales entered the U.S. in the first three months after the travel restrictions were imposed.\n",
      "\tAdditionally, more than 27,000 Americans returned from mainland China in the first month after the restrictions took effect. U.S. officials lost track of more than 1,600 of them who were supposed to be monitored for virus exposure.\n",
      "\tDozens of countries took similar steps to control travel from hot spots before or around the same time the U.S. did.\n",
      "\t___\n",
      "TRUMP: “The (Portland, Oregon) sheriff just came out today and he said I support President Trump.”\n",
      "THE FACTS: That is false. The sheriff of Multnomah County, Oregon — where Portland is located — said he does not support Trump.\n",
      "\tThe sheriff, Mike Reese, tweeted, “As the Multnomah County Sheriff I have never supported Donald Trump and will never support him.”\n",
      "\tPortland has been a flashpoint in the debate over racial injustice protests in the U.S. Police and federal agents have repeatedly clashed with demonstrators gathered outside the downtown federal courthouse and police buildings. Some protesters have thrown bricks, rocks and other projectiles at officers. Police and federal agents responded by firing tear gas, rubber bullets and other non-lethal ammunition to disperse the crowds.\n",
      "\t___\n",
      "BIDEN: “There was a peaceful protest in front of the White House. What did he do? He came out of his bunker, had the military do tear gas.”\n",
      "THE FACTS: It was law enforcement, not the military, that used chemical irritants to forcefully remove peaceful protesters from Lafayette Square outside the White House on June 1.\n",
      "\tAnd there is no evidence Trump was inside a bunker in the White House as that happened. Secret Service agents had rushed Trump to a White House bunker days earlier as hundreds of protesters gathered outside the executive mansion, some of them throwing rocks and tugging at police barricades.\n",
      "\t___\n",
      "TRUMP: “Drug prices will be coming down 80 or 90%.”\n",
      "THE FACTS: That’s a promise, not a reality, and it’s a big stretch.\n",
      "\tTrump has been unable to get legislation to lower drug prices through Congress. Major regulatory actions from his administration are still in the works, and are likely to be challenged in court.\n",
      "\tThere’s no plan on the horizon that would lower drug prices as dramatically as Trump claims.\n",
      "\tPrescription drug price inflation has been low and slow during the Trump years, but it hasn’t made a U-turn and sped off in the other direction. Prices have seesawed from year to year.\n",
      "\tLooking back at the totality of Trump’s term, from January 2017, when he was inaugurated, to the latest data from August 2020, drug prices went up 3.6%, according to an analysis by economist Paul Hughes-Cromwick of Altarum, a nonprofit research and consulting organization.\n",
      "\tHughes-Cromwick looked at figures from the government’s Bureau of Labor Statistics, which measures prices for a set of prescription medicines, including generics and branded drugs.\n",
      "\tWhen comparing prices in 2019 with a year earlier, there indeed was a decline. Prices dropped by 0.2% in 2019, a turnabout not seen since the 1970s. But that’s nowhere near close to 80% or 90%.\n",
      "\tFrom August of last year to this August, prices rose by 1.4%.\n",
      "\t___\n",
      "TRUMP, criticizing Barack Obama and Biden for leaving federal judicial vacancies unfilled before they left office in January 2017: “When you leave office you don’t leave any judges. You just don’t do that. They left 128 openings. And if I were a member of his party ... I’d say if you left us 128 openings, you can’t be a good president, you can’t be a good vice president.”\n",
      "THE FACTS: That’s misleading. Trump does have a stronger record than Obama in picking federal judges, but it isn’t due to complacency from the Obama administration. Instead, unprecedented lack of action by the Republican-controlled Senate on Obama’s judicial nominees in his last two years in office left Trump more vacancies to fill.\n",
      "\tOf the 71 people whom Obama nominated to the district courts and courts of appeals in 2015 and 2016, only 20 were voted on and confirmed, said Russell Wheeler, an expert on judicial nominees at the Brookings Institution. Trump entered office in January 2017 with more than 100 vacancies on the federal bench, about double the number Obama had in 2009.\n",
      "\tTrump has been aided by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who has pushed through Trump’s nominations of appeals court judges in particular, as well as two Supreme Court justices. McConnell has pledged to have a Senate vote on Trump’s third nominee to the high court, Amy Coney Barrett, while Democrats say the seat should be filled by the winner of the election.\n",
      "\t___\n",
      "TRUMP: Dr. Anthony Fauci “said very strongly, ‘masks are not good.’ Then he changed his mind, he said, ‘masks, good.’”\n",
      "THE FACTS: He is skirting crucial context. Trump is telling the story in a way that leaves out key lessons learned as the coronavirus pandemic unfolded, raising doubts about the credibility of public health advice.\n",
      "\tEarly on in the outbreak, a number of public health officials urged everyday people not to use masks, fearing a run on already short supplies of personal protective equipment needed by doctors and nurses in hospitals.\n",
      "\tBut that changed as the highly contagious nature of the coronavirus became clear, as well as the fact that it can be spread by tiny droplets breathed into the air by people who may not display any symptoms.\n",
      "\tFauci of the National Institutes of Health, along with Dr. Robert Redfield of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Dr. Stephen Hahn of the Food and Drug Administration and Dr. Deborah Birx of the White House coronavirus task force, all agree on the importance of wearing masks and practicing social distancing. Redfield has repeatedly said it could be as effective as a vaccine if people took that advice to heart.\n",
      "\t___\n",
      "TRUMP, on coronavirus and his campaign rallies: “So far we have had no problem whatsoever. It’s outside, that’s a big difference according to the experts. We have tremendous crowds.”\n",
      "THE FACTS: That’s not correct.\n",
      "\tTrump held an indoor rally in Tulsa in late June, drawing both thousands of participants and large protests.\n",
      "\tThe Tulsa City-County Health Department director said the rally “likely contributed” to a dramatic surge in new coronavirus cases there. By the first week of July, Tulsa County was confirming more than 200 new daily cases, setting record highs. That’s more than twice the number the week before the rally.\n",
      "\t___\n",
      "TRUMP, addressing Biden: “You didn’t do very well on the swine flu. H1N1. You were a disaster.”\n",
      "THE FACTS: Trump frequently distorts what happened in the pandemic of 2009, which killed far fewer people in the United States than the coronavirus is killing now. For starters, Biden as vice president wasn’t running the federal response. And that response was faster out of the gate than when COVID-19 came to the U.S.\n",
      "\tThen, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s flu surveillance network sounded the alarm after two children in California became the first people diagnosed with the new flu strain in this country.\n",
      "\tAbout two weeks later, the Obama administration declared a public health emergency against H1N1, also known as the swine flu, and the CDC began releasing anti-flu drugs from the national stockpile to help hospitals get ready. In contrast, Trump declared a state of emergency in early March, seven weeks after the first U.S. case of COVID-19 was announced, and the country’s health system struggled for months with shortages of critical supplies and testing.\n",
      "\tMore than 200,000 people have died from COVID-19 in the U.S. The CDC puts the U.S. death toll from the 2009-2010 H1N1 pandemic at about 12,500.\n",
      "\t___\n",
      "BIDEN: Trump will be the “first (president) in American history” to lose jobs during his presidency.\n",
      "THE FACTS: No, if Trump loses reelection, he would not be the first president in U.S. history to have lost jobs. That happened under Herbert Hoover, the president who lost the 1932 election to Franklin Roosevelt as the Great Depression caused massive job losses.\n",
      "\tOfficial jobs records only go back to 1939 and, in that period, no president has ended his term with fewer jobs than when he began. Trump appears to be on track to have lost jobs during his first term, which would make him the first to do so since Hoover.\n",
      "\t___\n",
      "TRUMP, on the prospect of mass fraud in the vote-by-mail process: “It’s a rigged election.”\n",
      "THE FACTS: He is exaggerating threats. Trump’s claim is part of a months-long effort to sow doubt about the integrity of the election before it’s even arrived and to preemptively call into question the results.\n",
      "\tExperts have repeatedly said there are no signs of widespread fraud in mail balloting, as have the five states that relied exclusively on that system for voting even before the coronavirus pandemic. Trump’s own FBI director, Chris Wray, said at a congressional hearing just last week that the bureau has not historically seen “any kind of coordinated national voter fraud effort in a major election, whether it’s by mail or otherwise.”\n",
      "\tWray did acknowledge voter fraud at the local level “from time to time,” but even there, Trump appeared to paint an overly dire portrait of the reality and he misstated the facts of one particular case that received substantial attention last week following an unusual Justice Department announcement.\n",
      "\tTrump said nine military ballots found discarded in a wastebasket in Luzerne County, Pennsylvania, were all marked for him. Though that’s consistent with an initial statement the Justice Department made, officials later revised it to say seven of the nine ballots had Trump’s name.\n",
      "\t___\n",
      "TRUMP: “I’m the one who brought back football. By the way, I brought back Big Ten football. It was me and I’m very happy to do it.”\n",
      "THE FACTS: Better check the tape. While Trump had called for the Big Ten conference to hold its 2020 football season, he wasn’t the only one. Fans, students, athletes and college towns had also urged the conference to resume play.\n",
      "\tWhen the Big Ten announced earlier this month that it reversed an earlier decision to cancel the season because of COVID-19, Trump tweeted his thanks: “It is my great honor to have helped!!!”\n",
      "\tThe conference includes several large universities in states that could prove pivotal in the election, including Pennsylvania, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio and Wisconsin.\n",
      "\t___\n",
      "BIDEN, on Supreme Court nominee Barrett: “She thinks that the Affordable Care Act is not constitutional.”\n",
      "THE FACTS: That’s not right.\n",
      "\tBiden is talking about Trump’s pick to replace the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Barrett has been critical of the Obama-era law and the court decisions that have upheld it, but she has never said it’s not constitutional. The Supreme Court will hear arguments in the case Nov. 10, and the Trump administration is asking the high court to rule the law unconstitutional.\n",
      "\t___\n",
      "TRUMP: “You said you went to Delaware State, but you forgot the name of your college. You didn’t go to Delaware State. ... There’s nothing smart about you, Joe.”\n",
      "THE FACTS: Trump is quoting Biden out of context. The former vice president, a graduate of the University of Delaware, did not say he attended Delaware State University but was making a broader point about his longstanding ties to the Black community.\n",
      "\tTrump is referring to remarks Biden often says on the campaign, typically when speaking to Black audiences, that he “goes way back with HBCUs,” or historically Black universities and colleges. Biden has spoken many times over the years at Delaware State, a public HBCU in his home state, and the school says that’s where he first announced his bid for the Senate – his political start.\n",
      "\t“I got started out of an HBCU, Delaware State — now, I don’t want to hear anything negative about Delaware State,” Biden told a town hall in Florence, South Carolina, in October 2019. “They’re my folks.”\n",
      "\tBiden often touts his deep political ties to the Black community, occasionally saying he “grew up politically” or “got started politically” in the Black church. In front of some audiences, he’s omitted the word “politically,” but still with a clear context about his larger point. The statements are all part of a standard section of his stump speech noting that Delaware has “the eighth largest Black population by percentage.”\n",
      "\tA spokesman for Delaware State University, Carlos Holmes, has said it took Biden’s comments to refer to his political start. Holmes said Biden was referring to the support he received from the school when he announced his bid for the U.S. Senate on the school’s campus in 1972.\n",
      "\tBiden’s broader point is to push back on the idea that he’s a Johnny-come-lately with the Black community or that his political connections there are owed only to being Obama’s vice president.\n",
      "\t___\n",
      "BIDEN: “The fact of the matter is violent crime went down 17%, 15%, in our administration.”\n",
      "THE FACTS: That’s overstating it.\n",
      "\tOverall, the number of violent crimes fell roughly 10% from 2008, the year before Biden took office as vice president, to 2016, his last full year in the office, according to data from the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting program.\n",
      "\tBut the number of violent crimes was spiking again during Obama and Biden’s final two years in office, increasing by 8% from 2014 to 2016.\n",
      "\tMore people were slain across the U.S. in 2016, for example, than at any other point under the Obama administration.\n",
      "\t___\n",
      "TRUMP: “If you look at what’s going on in Chicago, where 53 people were shot and eight died. If you look at New York where it’s going up like nobody’s ever seen anything … the numbers are going up 100, 150, 200%, crime, it’s crazy what’s going on.”\n",
      "THE FACTS: Not quite. The statistics in Chicago are true, but those numbers are only a small snapshot of crime in the city and the United States, and his strategy is highlighting how data can be easily molded to suit the moment. As for New York, Trump may have been talking about shootings. They are up in New York by about 93% so far this year, but overall crime is down about 1.5%. Murders are up 38%, but there were 327 killings compared with 236, still low compared with years past. For example, compared with a decade ago, crime is down 10%.\n",
      "\tAn FBI report released Monday for 2019 crime data found that violent crime has decreased over the past three years.\n",

      "\t\"Chaos, interruptions, personal attacks and insults,\" one outspoken Chinese newspaper editor said of the U.S. presidential debate. An Australian counterpart said it was \"swamped\" by the \"rancor engulfing America.\"\n",
      "\tThe first debate pitting U.S. Republican President Donald Trump against Democratic challenger Joe Biden was not a highlight of political oratory in the eyes of many overseas.\n",
      "\tYet interest ran high for its potential impact on what may be the most consequential U.S. election in years, now just over a month away.\n",
      "\tObservers looked for possible impact on financial markets and currencies, although the reaction was muted overall. Share prices slipped further in Japan and the dollar weakened against the Japanese yen and the euro, while U.S. futures were lower, auguring a weak opening on Wall Street.\n",
      "\tThe debate itself went as expected, said Jeffrey Halley, a senior market analyst at Oanda.\n",
      "\t\"Markets have remained calm as no policy surprises have emerged from the debate so far,\" he said. \"My initial thoughts are the debate will not move the needle on the Democrat lead in the national polls.\"\n",
      "\tThe greater worry is over how tight the race might be and whether a delay in election results might prove disruptive, said Stephen Innes of AxiCorp.\n",
      "\t\"A highly polarized and possibly legally contested U.S. election is just around the corner,\" Innes said. \"With mail-in votes likely to be too high (and potentially questioned), there is a chance that we still will not know the result by Inauguration Day with constitutional chaos ensuing.\"\n",
      "\tHu Xijin, editor of China's nationalistic Communist Party tabloid Global Times, offered his opinion on the newspaper's official microblog, writing that the \"chaos, interruptions, personal attacks and insults\" on display were a reflection of America's \"overarching division, anxiety and the accelerating erosion of the system's original advantages.\"\n",
      "\t\"I used to admire this kind of televised debate in American politics, but I have much more mixed feelings when watch it again now,\" wrote Hu, who personally and through his paper routinely attacks American policies.\n",
      "\t\"Indeed, the overall image of the United States is growing more and more complicated in my eyes,\" Hu wrote.\n",
      "\tThe editor-at-large of the newspaper The Australian, Paul Kelly, described the debate as a \"spiteful, chaotic, abusive, often out-of-control brawling encounter with both candidates revealing their contempt for each other.\"\n",
      "\t\"The rancour engulfing America swamped the first Trump-Biden debate,\" Kelly wrote.\n",
      "\tWhile Trump surely energized his base, he \"never landed a political knock-out blow,\" and Biden occasionally faltered but \"showed he could fight,\" he wrote, adding, \"America faces a dangerous several weeks.\"\n",
      "\tA columnist for the newspaper, Peter Hoysted, called the debate a \"shout-athon\" and a \"verbal shambles\" that reflected American political life and the \"yawning gap between the left and right.\"\n",
      "\tTim Wilson, a lawmaker in Australia's conservative government, was frustrated by the debate's lack of policy focus.\n",
      "\t\"For most part, it was a slanging match between President Trump and Vice-President Biden. I've got to say, I thought it was pretty unedifying in terms of a discussion, not just about the future of America, but ultimately because of the might of the United States, about the rest of the world as well,\" Wilson told Australian Broadcasting Corp.\n",
      "\tAmanda Wishworth, a lawmaker in Australia's centre-left Labor Party, said, \"A lot of people would be scratching their heads, especially here from Australia, where, believe it or not, our politics is a little bit more gentle than the U.S. of A.\"\n",
      "\tForeign policy issues were largely absent from the debate, although Trump slung accusations that China had paid Biden's son Hunter for consulting work and Biden attacked Trump's trade deals with China for failing to deliver benefits.\n",
      "\tTrump also repeatedly blamed China for the coronavirus pandemic that has killed more than 1 million people globally and laid waste to economies in the U.S. and other nations. Trump also said he reduced the threat to the U.S. by banning travel from China, although in fact he only restricted it.\n",
      "\tIn the Mideast, the largely domestic debate drew raised eyebrows when Biden at one point said \"inshallah\" as Trump hedged on saying when he would release his tax returns. \"Inshallah\" in Arabic means \"God willing.\" It also can be used in a way to suggest something won't ever happen. Al-Arabiya, a Saudi-owned satellite channel based in Dubai, and The National, a state-linked newspaper in Abu Dhabi, both published articles noting Biden's use of the word.\n",
      "\tA Emirati political scientist, Abdulkhaleq Abdulla, wrote on Twitter that he saw the debate as a \"tumultuous verbal battle.\"\n",
      "\t\"How did America reach this level of political decline?\" he wrote.\n",

      "\tA Calgary man is facing charges in an incident police are calling a hate crime, captured on video.\n",
      "\tMark John Koop, 39, has been charged with mischief to property and causing a disturbance.\n",
      "\tThe investigation started after Otis Chan said a man launched into a verbal tirade at him, while he was sitting in his vehicle in an empty Inglewood parking lot around 9:30 a.m. Monday, finishing some paperwork.\n",
      "\t“F* you, you F*ing Chinaman, you need to go back to your country. I looked at him and said, I’m just here doing my job. That’s when the gentleman replied that all you F*ing Chinamen are taking our jobs,” said Chan, who is Canadian-born Chinese.\n",
      "\tChan drove away and parked several blocks down 9th Avenue S.E. and the man followed. He spat on his vehicle several times and kicked the side mirror, which Chan recorded.\n",
      "\t“it’s extremely upsetting considering this guy’s a complete stranger,” said Chan. “What happens if he does this to another Asian person or immigrant where they cannot speak English. They can't defend themselves, or they can't even speak up.”\n",
      "\t“I don’t want the next generation to grow up thinking stuff like this is okay. It’s not okay,” said Chan. “In this day and age that we live in, its all about diversity.”\n",
      "\tCalgary police were able to make an arrest with assistance of business owners in the area.\n",
      "\t“This incident has been investigated as a hate crime,” said Sr. Constable Craig Collins, Hate Crime Coordinator, with the Calgary Police Service Diversity Unit.\n",
      "\tAccording to Calgary police, hate-motivated crimes are any criminal offence, like assault, theft, vandalism or any other crime, where the offender was motivated by bias, prejudice or hate that is based on one of nine personal characteristics of the victim.\n",
      "\tThe hate motivation is considered by the courts after a person is found guilty of the crime. If the judge decides during sentencing that hate was a motivation for the offence, it is an aggravating factor that can add to the convicted person's sentence.\n",
      "\t“We take these investigations very seriously. We do rely on citizens of Calgary to bring this information forward to us,” said Collins. “These offences have a larger impact into that community so it isn’t just one person that’s affected it has a wider message which is why we take it really seriously. We put a lot of time and resources into making sure that we investigate it properly.”\n",
      "\tCollins said since 2016, Calgary police have seen an increase in hate crimes. In 2015 there were 50 reported cases, in 2018 there were 87. Collins said a number of factors play into that, including encouraging people to come forward and report the incidents to police.\n",
      "\tCollins said the public is urged to report the incident to police instead of using social media first.\n",
      "\tCollins said free speech is not an absolute right.\n",
      "\t“There comes a point where your opinion of free speech will get checked. To walk out and target somebody because of their colour or their sexuality and use offensive language or disturb the peace, you are going to find someone like me knocking on your door and taking them to court so you can explain those actions to the courts,\" said Collins.\n",
      "\t\"Ultimately,\" Collins added,  \"it's the court's decision to decide whether those actions are free speech or whether you cross the line and if you did then there’s a penalty.\"\n",
      "\tChan said he is relieved there are charges.\n",
      "\t“It actually feels really good and I hope this person gets the help he needs,” said Chan.\n",

      "\tThe dissident Chinese contemporary artist Ai Weiwei staged a silent protest outside London's Old Bailey court on Monday against the possible extradition of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange to the United States, where he is wanted on an array of espionage charges.\n",
      "\tThe court, meanwhile, heard that Assange, if convicted in the U.S., could end up spending the rest of his life imprisoned in the federal Supermax prison in Florence, Colorado. The facility is home to Unabomber Ted Kaczynski, Mexican drug lord Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman, 1993 World Trade Center mastermind Ramzi Yousef and Zacarias Moussaoui, the only man ever convicted in a U.S. court for a role in the Sept. 11 attacks.\n",
      "\tAi, who visited Assange at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London where he was holed up for seven years until April 2019 and subsequently at Britain's Belmarsh high security prison, said the authorities have a responsibility to protect the freedom of the press.\n",
      "\t“He is prepared to fight, but this is not fair to him,” he said. “Free him, let him be a free man.”\n",
      "\tU.S. prosecutors have indicted the 49-year-old Assange on 17 espionage charges and one charge of computer misuse over WikiLeaks' publication of secret American military documents a decade ago. The charges carry a maximum sentence of 175 years in prison.\n",
      "\tAs well as arguing that the extradition would pose a threat to Assange's life, his defence team say that Assange is a journalist and entitled to First Amendment protections for the publication of leaked documents that exposed U.S. military wrongdoing in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n",
      "\t“He truly represents a core value of why we are free - because we have freedom of the press.,” Ai said. “We need a lot of protesting, and it can take any form. I'm an artist, if I cannot use my art, it's very limited, then I'd rather just be silent.”\n",
      "\tAssange's father, John Shipton, was also protesting outside the court.\n",
      "\t“Ai Weiwei is an artist of gigantic international standing, he stands alongside Julian to give the fight international meaning,” he said.\n",
      "\tAi, 63, is one of the world's most successful artists, famous around the world for his installations of bicycles and sunflower seeds. In his native China, he was alternately encouraged, tolerated and harassed, spending time in detention and being barred for years from leaving the country. He was arrested at Beijing's airport in April 2011 and held for 81 days without explanation during a wider crackdown on dissent. He is now based in Berlin and in the U.K.\n",
      "\tOn Monday, the court heard from two witnesses who said Assange would face intolerable conditions if extradited.\n",
      "\tIt is widely mooted that Assange would be moved to the pre-trial facilities at Alexandria Detention Center in Virginia if extradited. Other recent high-profile federal defendants there include President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign chairman Paul Manafort and Chelsea Manning, the former intelligence analyst who leaked a trove of documents to WikiLeaks and who tried to take her own life earlier this year at the facility.\n",
      "\tYancey Ellis, a Virginia-based lawyer who has had clients at the facility, said Assange would likely be put into an administrative segregation unit for months or even years that would be akin to “solitary confinement.”\n",
      "\tAnd Joel Sickler, who heads the Justice Advocacy Group, said Assange would face “no meaningful interaction” in pre-trial confinement in a cell the size of “a parking space.”\n",
      "\tSickler, who has decades of experience in the field of the U.S. prison system, also said Assange would face the “real risk” of special administrative measures, or SAMs, being imposed on him by the U.S. Attorney General if convicted. The imposition of such measures could further curtail Assange's links and communications to the outside world as well as his movements within prison.\n",
      "\tSickler said it was highly likely that Assange could be sent to the Supermax facility in Colorado. The prison, also known as ADX, is so secure, remote and austere it has been dubbed the “Alcatraz of the Rockies.”\n",
      "\t“Should Mr. Assange be sent to ADX he will almost certainly spend all his time in ADX in solitary,” Sickler said in written testimony to the court. “While conditions at a penitentiary are severe, nothing compares to the near permanent solitary life of an inmate at ADX.”\n",
      "\tAssange's lawyers have argued that their client could very well try to kill himself if extradited to the U.S., while those acting on behalf of the U.S. government have sought to show that his mental state is not as bad as claimed and that he wouldn't be subjected to improper conditions.\n",
      "\tAssange's extradition hearing, which was delayed by the coronavirus pandemic, is due to end this week.\n",

      "\tA Chinese company is entering the global race to help defeat the coronavirus, promising its testing machine will return results faster than a lab and more reliably than at-home screening kits.\n",
      "\tThe Flash 20 \"is currently the fastest machine in the world for PCR tests for the new coronavirus\", says Sabrina Li, founder of the company Coyote.\n",
      "\tPCR tests are the industry standard and a major weapon against a pandemic that has now killed more than a million people and eviscerated the global economy.\n",
      "\tAs governments scramble to develop adequate response systems, Li is targeting global sales.\n",
      "\tAlready used at hospitals and airports in China, the contraption can process four samples in one go and deliver results in just half an hour.\n",
      "\tIt has been certified by the European Union and Australia, and Coyote is seeking similar status from the United States and World Health Organization.\n",
      "\tTesting has been hailed as one of the best weapons to contain the pandemic and other researchers are also on the quest to find the fastest method.\n",
      "\tOn Monday US President Donald Trump announced the distribution of 150 million rapid coronavirus tests that can deliver a result in 15-30 minutes.\n",
      "\tDifferent to PCR tests, these rapid diagnostic kits offer a quick turnaround, but are less sensitive and more likely to return false negatives.\n",
      "\tThe makers of the Flash 20 say their machine, about the size of a printer, is not only fast but extremely reliable.\n",
      "\tPast experience with major disease outbreaks helped Coyote respond quickly this time around, the company said.\n",
      "\tThe SARS epidemic of 2003-2004 jolted China's biotechnology sector and led to a great \"reorganisation\" in the way the industry works, Zang Yuepeng, Coyote's technical manager responsible for the Flash 20, told AFP.\n",
      "\tSo when COVID-19 emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year, Coyote was able to design the machine and \"very quickly put this product on the market\".\n",
      "\tBetween February and July, 500,000 tests were carried out in China by the authorities using the Flash 20, and the results were 97 percent the same as those returned by conventional PCR testing in a lab.\n",
      "\tThe company can currently produce only 500 a month but is hoping to double that number by the end of the year.\n",
      "\tThe main challenge, Coyote said, will be making enough machines to meet what it hopes will be huge demand.\n",

      "\tIn June, China suspended poultry imports from a Tyson Foods plant in the United States because of concerns about an outbreak of coronavirus at the facility.\n",
      "\tLast month, a batch of frozen chicken wings imported from Brazil tested positive for coronavirus in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen, one of multiple incidents in which the virus had been detected on food products.\n",
      "\tThose incidents sparked increased screening of imported foods nationwide, and heightened scrutiny of products coming from places badly stricken by the pandemic, such as Brazil.\n",
      "\tAs of Sept. 7, China had suspended imports from dozens of food companies across at least 19 countries and regions where workers have been infected with coronavirus, according to state media.\n",
      "\tLast week, China's General Administration of Customs announced \"emergency precautionary measures\" against a Norwegian company after a frozen seafood package tested positive for the virus.\n",
      "\tOn Saturday, customs officials said that samples taken from the outer packaging of imported Russian aquatic products in Shandong province tested positive for coronavirus, while on Friday China Customs said the inner packaging of a batch of frozen fish from Brazil also tested positive for the virus.\n",
      "\tChina's National Health Commission said Monday there had been no new locally transmitted virus cases in the past 24 hours, or any new deaths connected to the pandemic.\n",
      "According to a tally by Johns Hopkins University, there have been 90,483 confirmed cases of coronavirus in China and 4,739 deaths. The vast majority of cases were detected in the early stages of the pandemic, with the number of new infections below 500 since early March.\n",

      "\tKhieng Phearum, a spokesman for Preah Sihanouk province, said the 42-year-old man was arrested late Sunday after authorities determined that he was illegally keeping 281 small and big jars presumed to be legally protected antiquities at his home.\n",
      "\tThe man, who was still being interrogated on Tuesday, is an expert diver and had been spotted in the area of an underwater shipwreck in the Gulf of Thailand off the coastal city of Sihanoukville from which the pottery is believed to have been retrieved, Khieng Phearum said,\n",

      "\tA kindergarten teacher who poisoned 25 children, killing one of them, after an argument with a rival staff member has been sentenced to death by a court in central China.\n",
      "\tIn its official ruling Monday, the Jiaozuo Intermediate People's Court in Henan province described killer Wang Yun's motives as \"despicable\" and \"vicious.\" \"She should be punished severely in accordance with the law,\" the ruling said.\n",
      "\tThe court heard that in the lead-up to the poisoning, Wang had quarreled with another teacher at the Jiaozuo kindergarten over how best to handle the students.\n",
      "\tThen, on the morning of March 27, 2019, Wang added nitrite to porridge supplied by the school and intended for the other teacher's students. Wang had previously bought the nitrite online.\n",
      "\tAccording to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, nitrite is toxic and a likely carcinogen used in fertilizers, food preservation and even munitions and explosives. At high levels, it can stop the human body from properly absorbing oxygen.\n",
      "\tWang had previously been caught trying to poison her husband, surnamed Feng, in February 2017 after an argument. On that occasion, Wang poured nitrite into a glass used by Feng, causing minor injuries.\n",
      "\tAt the time of the 2019 kindergarten poisoning, one parent told China's state-run tabloid Global Times he had received a call from the kindergarten saying his child had vomited and fainted. When he arrived, his child was unconscious.\n",
      "\t\"The vomit was all over (their) pants. There were other children who were also throwing up, and they looked pale,\" the father, surnamed Li, said.\n",
      "\tWang's sentence comes amid fresh allegations of the mistreatment of children at a kindergarten in northern China.\n",
      "\tEight parents claimed to have found unknown needle marks on their children's heads and bodies after they returned from Zhaojun Dingqi Kindergarten in Hohhot, in the autonomous region of Inner Mongolia, state media Xinhua said.\n",
      "\tAccording to Xinhua, when asked about the needle holes, the children told their parents that their teacher stabbed them with \"toothpicks\" and \"red needles\" for not behaving in class -- and ordered them to not tell their families.\n",
      "\tIn a statement, the Xincheng district police said three women had been detained on suspicion of \"torturing children under their guardianship,\" although the case remains under investigation.\n",
      "\tThe Dingqi kindergarten said in a statement that while the school apologized for the concern and worry caused to parents, it had not yet found any evidence to substantiate the claims.\n",
      "\t\"At present, (we) have cooperated with the police to provide relevant surveillance footage and equipment, and cooperated with the investigation by the public security department,\" the statement said.\n",
      "\tIn November 2017, a Beijing kindergarten teacher was sentenced to 18 months in prison for piercing four children in her class with needles. Police said the teacher, surnamed Liu, was using the needles to \"tame\" children, according to state-run tabloid Global Times.\n",

      "\tThe departing U.S. ambassador on Tuesday defended a tough approach to China that has riled relations between the world's two largest economies, saying the Trump administration has made progress on trade and that he hopes it will extend to other areas.\n",
      "\tTerry Branstad, the longtime Iowa governor who was chosen by U.S. President Donald Trump to be envoy to China, said the Trump administration is seeking the same treatment for American companies and individuals in China that their Chinese counterparts get in America.\n",
      "\t\"I think in the area of trade, we've got their attention and we're making progress,\" he said in an interview at the U.S. Embassy in Beijing. \"I hope we can in the other (areas), in terms of the treatment of our media, the treatment of our diplomats.\"\n",
      "\tBranstad is returning to Iowa this weekend after three years and three months as ambassador in Beijing, the longest he and his wife have lived outside of his home state. No successor has been named.\n",
      "\tAfter launching a trade war in 2018 and seeking to restrict Chinese telecom giant Huawei on national security grounds, the Trump administration has further ramped up pressure on China this year.\n",
      "\tIt imposed restrictions on Chinese diplomats and journalists; closed the Chinese consulate in Houston and repeatedly criticized China on multiple fronts, from its handling of COVID-19 to its military moves in the South China Sea and its human rights record in Hong Kong and the Xinjiang region, home to a largely Muslim population.\n",
      "\tChina has rebuked the U.S. and responded in kind, closing a U.S. consulate in the southwestern city of Chengdu. With almost daily heated exchanges, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi has said that ties face their gravest challenge since the normalization of relations in 1979.\n",
      "\tBranstad downplayed such fears, noting the relationship has weathered ups and downs in the past. He conceded, though, that there is concern that pressure on China could lead to a downward spiral of growing restrictions.\n",
      "\t\"The unfortunate thing is we're trying to rebalance the relationship so we have fairness and reciprocity, but every time we do something, they keep it unbalanced,\" he said.\n",
      "\tBranstad, who travelled widely in China during his stint, complained about needing to get government approval for every visit. He asked to go to Tibet three times before his visit last year. Once there, though, he said he had open exchanges with students and teachers. Elsewhere, his experience varied.\n",
      "\tHe cited the so-called phase one trade deal, reached in January, and China's agreement to list fentanyl as a controlled substance as positive developments. The U.S. has been trying to reduce the flow of the opioid from China.\n",
      "\tOn trade, China promised to strengthen protection of foreign technology rights and trade secrets. China has made similar promises in the past, and companies say they are waiting to see how the commitments are carried out.\n",
      "\tBranstad has longstanding ties to Chinese leader Xi Jinping and was initially seen as someone who could soothe relations. He came to China as Iowa governor in 1984 after signing a sister-state agreement with Hebei province, and he met Xi the following year when the then-county level Communist Party official visited Iowa as head of an agricultural delegation.\n",
      "\tWhile the U.S.-China relationship has become fraught, Branstad maintained that such long-term ties remain valuable. He said he has met Xi several times since arriving in China in 2017, including a private family dinner in early 2018 that included Branstad's daughter and grandchildren.\n",
      "\t\"I think he still has very good feelings about me and about Iowa and the way we treated him,\" Branstad said. \"And, you know, I found in this culture, personal relationships are important. And yet I represent the United States.\"\n",
      "\tBranstad blamed the coronavirus for souring the relationship, saying that Xi had assured Trump the outbreak was under control when in fact it wasn't. China has been criticized for covering up the crisis in the initial days, though praised for its strict measures to stem the spread later.\n",
      "\t\"0bviously, that's had a lot to do with, I think, the president's feelings towards China,\" Branstad said.\n",
      "\tTrump has blamed China for the pandemic, which some analysts see as an attempt to deflect blame from his handling of the crisis ahead of a tough re-election battle in November.\n",
      "\tBranstad expects to campaign in Iowa for Trump and other Republican candidates. He said he would focus in part on what the administration has done in China and the need to maintain a relationship but insist on fairness.\n",
      "\t\"I've never lost an election and it's still in my blood,\" the 73-year-old political veteran said.\n",

      "\tThe worldwide death toll from the coronavirus has eclipsed 1 million, nine months into a crisis that has devastated the global economy, tested world leaders' resolve, pitted science against politics and forced multitudes to change the way they live, learn and work.\n",
      "\t\"It's not just a number. It's human beings. It's people we love,\" said Dr. Howard Markel, a professor of medical history at the University of Michigan who has advised government officials on containing pandemics and lost his 84-year-old mother to COVID-19 in February.\n",
      "\t\"It's our brothers, our sisters. It's people we know,\" he added. \"And if you don't have that human factor right in your face, it's very easy to make it abstract.\"\n",
      "\tThe bleak milestone, recorded on Monday in the U.S. by Johns Hopkins University, is greater than the population of Jerusalem or Austin, Texas. It is 2 1/2 times the sea of humanity that was at Woodstock in 1969. It is more than four times the number killed by the 2004 earthquake and tsunami in the Indian Ocean.\n",
      "\tEven then, the figure is almost certainly a vast undercount because of inadequate or inconsistent testing and reporting and suspected concealment by some countries.\n",
      "\tAnd the number continues to mount. Nearly 5,000 deaths are reported each day on average. Parts of Europe are getting hit by new outbreaks, and experts fear a second wave in the U.S., which accounts for about 205,000 deaths, or 1 out of 5 worldwide. That is far more than any other country, despite America's wealth and medical resources.\n",
      "\t\"I can understand why ... numbers are losing their power to shock, but I still think it's really important that we understand how big these numbers really are,\" said Mark Honigsbaum, author of \"The Pandemic Century: One Hundred Years of Panic, Hysteria and Hubris.\"\n",
      "\tThe global toll includes people like Joginder Chaudhary, who was his parents' greatest pride, raised with the little they earned farming a half-acre plot in central India to become the first doctor from their village.\n",
      "\tAfter the virus killed the 27-year-old Chaudhary in late July, his mother wept inconsolably. With her son gone, Premlata Chaudhary said, how could she go on living? Three weeks later, on Aug. 18, the virus took her life, too. All told, it has killed more than 96,000 in India.\n",
      "\t\"This pandemic has ruined my family,\" said the young doctor's father, Rajendra Chaudhary. \"All our aspirations, our dreams, everything is finished.\"\n",
      "\tWhen the virus overwhelmed cemeteries in the Italian province of Bergamo last spring, the Rev. Mario Carminati opened his church to the dead, lining up 80 coffins in the centre aisle. After an army convoy carted them to a crematory, another 80 arrived. Then 80 more.\n",
      "\tEventually the crisis receded and the world's attention moved on. But the pandemic's grasp endures. In August, Carminati buried his 34-year-old nephew.\n",
      "\t\"This thing should make us all reflect. The problem is that we think we're all immortal,\" the priest said.\n",
      "\tThe virus first appeared in late 2019 in patients hospitalized in the Chinese city of Wuhan, where the first death was reported on Jan. 11. By the time authorities locked down the city nearly two weeks later, millions of travellers had come and gone. China's government has come in for criticism that it did not do enough to alert other countries to the threat.\n",
      "\tGovernment leaders in countries like Germany, South Korea and New Zealand worked effectively to contain it. Others, like U.S. President Donald Trump and Brazil's Jair Bolsonaro, dismissed the severity of the threat and the guidance of scientists, even as hospitals filled with gravely ill patients.\n",
      "\tBrazil has recorded the second most deaths after the U.S., with about 142,000. India is third and Mexico fourth, with more than 76,000.\n",
      "\tThe virus has forced trade-offs between safety and economic well-being. The choices made have left millions of people vulnerable, especially the poor, minorities and the elderly.\n",
      "\tWith so many of the deaths beyond view in hospital wards and clustered on society's margins, the milestone recalls the grim pronouncement often attributed to Soviet dictator Josef Stalin: One death is a tragedy, millions of deaths are a statistic.\n",
      "\tThe pandemic's toll of 1 million dead in such a limited time rivals some of the gravest threats to public health, past and present.\n",
      "\tIt exceeds annual deaths from AIDS, which last year killed about 690,000 people worldwide. The virus's toll is approaching the 1.5 million global deaths each year from tuberculosis, which regularly kills more people than any other infectious disease.\n",
      "\tBut \"COVID's grip on humanity is incomparably greater than the grip of other causes of death,\" said Lawrence Gostin, a professor of global health law at Georgetown University. He noted the unemployment, poverty and despair caused by the pandemic, and deaths from myriad other illnesses that have gone untreated.\n",
      "\tFor all its lethality, the virus has claimed far fewer lives than the so-called Spanish flu, which killed an estimated 40 million to 50 million worldwide in two years, just over a century ago.\n",
      "\tThat pandemic came before scientists had microscopes powerful enough to identify the enemy or antibiotics that could treat the bacterial pneumonia that killed most of the victims. In the U.S., the Spanish flu killed about 675,000. But most of those deaths did not come until a second wave hit over the winter of 1918-19.\n",
      "\tUp to now, the disease has left only a faint footprint on Africa, well shy of early modeling that predicted thousands more deaths.\n",
      "\tBut cases have recently surged in countries like Britain, Spain, Russia and Israel. In the United States, the return of students to college campuses has sparked new outbreaks. With approval and distribution of a vaccine still probably months away and winter approaching in the Northern Hemisphere, the toll will continue to climb.\n",
      "\t\"We're only at the beginning of this. We're going to see many more weeks ahead of this pandemic than we've had behind us,\" Gostin said.\n",

      "\tA federal judge on Sunday postponed a Trump administration order that would have banned the popular video sharing app TikTok from U.S. smartphone app stores around midnight.\n",
      "\tA more comprehensive ban remains scheduled for November, about a week after the presidential election. The judge, Carl Nichols of the U.S District Court for the District of Columbia, did not agree to postpone the later ban.\n",
      "\tThe ruling followed an emergency hearing Sunday morning in which lawyers for TikTok argued that the administration's app-store ban would infringe on the company's First Amendment rights and do irreparable harm to the business.\n",
      "\tEarlier this year, President Donald Trump declared that TikTok was a threat to national security and that it must either sell its U.S. operations to U.S. companies or be barred from the country.\n",
      "\tTHIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP's earlier story follows below.\n",
      "\tLawyers for TikTok pleaded with a U.S. federal judge on Sunday to delay the Trump Administration's ban of the popular video sharing program from app stores set to take effect at the end of the day, arguing the move would infringe on First Amendment rights and do irreparable harm to the business.\n",
      "\tThe 90-minute hearing came after President Donald Trump declared this summer that TikTok was a threat to national security and that it either sold its U.S. operations to U.S. companies or the app would be barred from the country.\n",
      "\tTikTok, owned by Chinese company ByteDance, is scrambling to firm up a deal tentatively struck a week ago in which it would partner with tech company Oracle and retailer Walmart and that would get the blessing of the Chinese and American governments. In the meantime, it is fighting to keep the app available in the U.S.\n",
      "\tThe ban on new downloads of TikTok, which has about 100 million users in the U.S, was delayed once by the government. A more comprehensive ban is scheduled for November, about a week after the presidential election. Judge Carl Nichols of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia said he would make a decision by late Sunday, leaving TikTok's fate hanging.\n",
      "\tIn arguments to Judge Nichols, TikTok lawyer John Hall said that TikTok is more than an app but rather is a \"modern day version of a town square.\"\n",
      "\t\"If that prohibition goes into effect at midnight, the consequences immediately are grave,\"' Hall said. \"It would be no different than the government locking the doors to a public forum, roping off that town square\" at a time when a free exchange of ideas is necessary heading into a polarized election.\n",
      "\tHall called the ban \"punitive,\" noting that this is \"just a blunt way to whack the company now while doing nothing to achieve the stated objective of the prohibition. \"\n",
      "\tTikTok lawyers also argued that a ban on the app would stop tens of thousands of potential viewers and content creators every month and would also hurt its ability to hire new talent. In addition, Hall argued that a ban would prevent existing users from automatically receiving security updates, eroding national security.\n",
      "\tJustice Department lawyer Daniel Schwei sought to undercut TikTok lawyers' argument, saying that Chinese companies are not purely private and are subject to intrusive laws compelling their co-operation with intelligence agencies. The Justice Department has also argued that economic regulations of this nature generally are not subject to First Amendment scrutiny. Plaintiffs can't claim a First Amendment right in hosting TikTok itself as a platform for others' speech because merely hosting a platform is not an exercise of the First Amendment, the Justice Department contends.\n",
      "\t\"This is the most immediate national security threat,\" argued Schwei. \"It is a threat today. It is a risk today and therefore it deserves to be addressed today even while other things are ongoing and playing out.\"\n",
      "\tSchwei also argued that TikTok lawyers failed to prove it would suffer irreparable business harm.\n",
      "\tThe Justice Department laid out its objections to TikTok's motion for a temporary injunction in a brief under seal, but it was unsealed in redacted form to protect confidential business information.\n",
      "\tTrump set the process in motion with executive orders in August that declared TikTok and another Chinese app, WeChat, as threats to national security. The White House says the video service is a security risk because the personal information of its millions of U.S. users could be handed over to Chinese authorities.\n",
      "\tTrump has said he would approve a proposed deal in which Oracle and Walmart could initially own a combined 20% of a new U.S. entity, TikTok Global. Trump also said he could retract his approval if Oracle doesn't have \"total control.\"\n",
      "\tThe two sides of the TikTok deal have also appeared at odds over the corporate structure of TikTok Global. ByteDance said last week that it will still own 80% of the U.S. entity after a financing round. Oracle, meanwhile, put out a statement saying that Americans \"will be the majority and ByteDance will have no ownership in TikTok Global.\"\n",
      "\tChinese media have criticized the deal as bullying and extortion, suggesting that the Chinese government is not happy with the arrangement. ByteDance said Thursday it has applied for a Chinese technology export license after Beijing tightened control over exports last month in an effort to gain leverage over Washington's attempt to force an outright sale of TikTok to U.S. owners.\n",
      "\tChina's foreign ministry has said the government will \"take necessary measures\" to safeguard its companies but gave no indication what steps it can take to affect TikTok's fate in the United States.\n",
      "\tTikTok is suing the U.S. government over Trump's Aug. 6 executive order, saying it is unlawful. So are resulting Commerce Department prohibitions that aim to kick TikTok out of U.S. app stores and, in November, essentially shut it down in the U.S., it claimed.\n",
      "\tThe Chinese firm said the president doesn't have the authority to take these actions under the national-security law he cited; that the ban violates TikTok's First Amendment speech rights and Fifth Amendment due-process rights; and that there's no authority for the restrictions because they are not based on a national emergency.\n",

      "\tNew infection control restrictions in Europe stirred anger and frustration on Sunday as around the world the global coronavirus toll inched towards one million dead.\n",
      "\tDemonstrators in Madrid complained that new lockdowns to confront mounting case numbers were discriminatory as they mostly hit poorer districts.\n",
      "\tAnd in France, authorities tried to soothe the pain of a shutdown for bars and restaurants in the Mediterranean city of Marseille that has owners up in arms.\n",
      "\tSaturday saw a 10,000-strong anti-lockdown demonstration in central London that was broken up by police.\n",
      "\tWorldwide at least 999,068 people had died of the coronavirus by around 1600 GMT from among almost 33 million infections, according to an AFP tally from official sources.\n",
      "\tBut there were glimmers of positive news, as residents of the Chinese city of Wuhan -- where the virus emerged last year -- reported a hesitant return to normality, while the French Open got underway at Roland Garros in Paris.\n",
      "\tIn Australia, Victoria Premier Daniel Andrews said Melbourne residents would be free from Monday to leave their homes for work, exercise, shopping for essentials, or providing care after active cases in the state fell below 400 for the first time since June 30.\n",
      "\tThe relaxation of the curfew, imposed on August 2, comes after 16 new infections and two deaths were reported Sunday.\n",
      "\tPeople will still be confined to within five kilometres of their homes, and fines for breaching other restrictions will be increased to almost Aus$5,000 (US$3,515).\n",
      "\tProtesters in the Spanish capital hit the streets a day before a partial lockdown is extended beyond the 850,000 people already covered.\n",
      "\tThey complained that the 37 districts already affected are mainly low-income areas, with one brandishing a sign calling the policy \"not lockdown but segregation\".\n",
      "\t\"It makes no sense that you can go to work in a wealthier area but can't go have a drink,\" 27-year-old electrician Marcos Ruiz Guijarro told AFP.\n",
      "\t\"Infections are rising everywhere, the rules should be the same for everyone.\"\n",
      "\tIn Marseille, authorities backed down over a plan to close bars and restaurants in the whole region around the French port city and nearby Aix-en-Provence after an outcry from the hospitality industry and local politicians.\n",
      "\tThe southern region is a particular hotspot in France, which has seen new cases mount sharply in recent weeks, topping 16,000 daily on Thursday and Friday.\n",
      "\tInstead only the two cities themselves will be affected by the closures, set to last initially until October 11.\n",
      "\tNevertheless, landlords will respond with \"physical and legal actions in the coming hours and days,\" said Bernard Marty of the local hotel federation.\n",
      "\tIn the U.K., thousands of demonstrators against infection control measures and potential coronavirus vaccines were driven from central London's Trafalgar Square on Saturday by police with batons, who said they had failed to take precautions like maintaining distancing and arrested 10 people.\n",
      "\tFaced with a mounting second wave, Britain has imposed a ban on gatherings of more than six people and ordered pubs and restaurants to close at 10 p.m. in a bid to slow the spread of the virus, which has claimed 42,000 lives in the country so far -- making it the worst-affected nation in Europe.\n",
      "\tIn New York state -- once the epicentre of the U.S. outbreak -- new infections rose for the first time since June to above 1,000 a day, local officials said.\n",

      "\t\"They are potent tools to save the life of every citizen,\" he said.\n",
      "\tHealth ministry figures showed that the total number of cases had risen to 5,992,532.\n",
      "\tIndia is expected to overtake the United States -- which has reported more than seven million cases so far -- as the worst-hit country in the next few weeks.\n",
      "\tIn Paris, a limited number of spectators will watch live tennis for the first time in months as the French Open starts -- four months later than scheduled.\n",
      "\tIt will be an eerily unfamiliar tournament as a resurgence of the virus means only 1,000 spectators will be allowed into the grounds each day.\n",
      "\tFor residents of Wuhan, where the coronavirus first emerged late last year, life is already back to normal.\n",
      "\tThere have been 50,340 confirmed cases and 3,869 deaths in Wuhan, according to the official figures -- the majority of mainland China's toll -- but no new infections since May.\n",
      "\tFamilies are once again packing amusement parks, and shopping streets were full over the weekend -- although residents remained cautious.\n",

      "CONTENT : NEW YORK  -- \n",
      "\tAt a University of Maryland lab, people infected with the new coronavirus take turns sitting in a chair and putting their faces into the big end of a large cone. They recite the alphabet and sing or just sit quietly for a half hour. Sometimes they cough.\n",
      "\tThe cone sucks up everything that comes out of their mouths and noses. It's part of a device called \"Gesundheit II\" that is helping scientists study a big question: Just how does the virus that causes COVID-19 spread from one person to another?\n",
      "\tIt clearly hitchhikes on small liquid particles sprayed out by an infected person. People expel particles while coughing, sneezing, singing, shouting, talking and even breathing. But the drops come in a wide range of sizes, and scientists are trying to pin down how risky the various kinds are.\n",
      "\tThe answer affects what we should all be doing to avoid getting sick. That's why it was thrust into headlines a few days ago when a U.S. health agency appeared to have shifted its position on the issue, but later said it had published new language in error.\n",
      "\tThe recommendation to stay at least 6 feet (2 metres) apart -- some authorities cite about half that distance -- is based on the idea that larger particles fall to the ground before they can travel very far. They are like the droplets in a spritz of a window cleaner, and they can infect somebody by landing on their nose, mouth or eyes, or maybe being inhaled.\n",
      "\tBut some scientists are now focusing on tinier particles, the ones that spread more like cigarette smoke. Those are carried by wisps of air and even upward drafts caused by the warmth of our bodies. They can linger in the air for minutes to hours, spreading throughout a room and build up if ventilation is poor.\n",
      "\tThe potential risk comes from inhaling them. Measles can spread this way, but the new coronavirus is far less contagious than that.\n",
      "\tFor these particles, called aerosols, \"6 feet is not a magic distance,\" says Linsey Marr, a leading researcher who is studying them at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg. But she says it's still important to keep one's distance from others, \"the farther the better,\" because aerosols are most concentrated near a source and pose a bigger risk at close range.\n",
      "\tPublic health agencies have generally focused on the larger particles for coronavirus. That prompted more than 200 other scientists to publish a plea in July to pay attention to the potential risk from aerosols. The World Health Organization, which had long dismissed a danger from aerosols except in the case of certain medical procedures, later said that aerosol transmission of the coronavirus can't be ruled out in cases of infection within crowded and poorly ventilated indoor spaces.\n",
      "\tThe issue drew attention recently when the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention posted and then deleted statements on its website that highlighted the idea of aerosol spread. The agency said the posting was an error, and that the statements were just a draft of proposed changes to its recommendations.\n",
      "\tDr. Jay Butler, CDC's deputy director for infectious disease, told The Associated Press that the agency continues to believe larger and heavier droplets that come from coughing or sneezing are the primary means of transmission.\n",
      "\tLast month Butler told a scientific meeting that current research suggests aerosol spreading of the coronavirus is possible but it doesn't seem to be the main way that people get infected. Further research may change that conclusion, he added, and he urged scientists to study how often aerosol spread of the coronavirus occurs, what situations make it more likely and what reasonable steps might prevent it.\n",
      "\tMarr said she thinks infection by aerosols is \"happening a lot more than people initially were willing to think.\"\n",
      "\tAs a key piece of evidence, Marr and others point to so-called \"superspreader\" events where one infected person evidently passed the virus to many others in a single setting.\n",
      "\tIn March, for example, after a choir member with coronavirus symptoms attended a rehearsal in Washington state, 52 others who had been seated throughout the room were found to be infected and two died. In a crowded and poorly ventilated restaurant in China in January, the virus evidently spread from a lunchtime patron to five people at two adjoining tables in a pattern suggesting aerosols were spread by the air conditioner. Also in January, a passenger on a Chinese bus apparently infected 23 others, many of whom were scattered around the vehicle.\n",
      "\tButler said such events raise concern about aerosol spread but don't prove it happens.\n",
      "\tThere could be another way for tiny particles to spread. They may not necessarily come directly from somebody's mouth or nose, says William Ristenpart of the University of California, Davis. His research found that if paper tissues are seeded with influenza virus and then crumpled, they give off particles that bear the virus. So people emptying a wastebasket with tissues discarded by somebody with COVID-19 should be sure to wear a mask, he said.\n",
      "\tScientists who warn about aerosols say current recommendations still make sense.\n",
      "\tWearing a mask is still important, and make sure it fits snugly. Keep washing those hands diligently. And again, staying farther apart is better than being closer together. Avoid crowds, especially indoors.\n",
      "\tTheir main addition to recommendations is ventilation to avoid a buildup of aerosol concentration. So, the researchers say, stay out of poorly ventilated rooms. Open windows and doors. One can also use air-purifying devices or virus-inactivating ultraviolet light.\n",
      "\tBest of all: Just do as much as you can outdoors, where dilution and the sun's ultraviolet light work in your favour.\n",
      "\t\"We know outdoors is the most spectacularly effective measure, by far,\" says Jose-Luis Jimenez of the University of Colorado-Boulder. \"Outdoors it is not impossible to get infected, but it is difficult.\"\n",
      "\tThe various precautions should be used in combination rather than just one at a time, researchers say. In a well ventilated environment, \"6 feet (of separation) is pretty good if everybody's got a mask on\" and nobody stays directly downwind of an infected person for very long, says Dr. Donald Milton of the University of Maryland School of Public Health, whose lab houses the Gesundheit II machine.\n",
      "\tDuration of exposure is important, so there's probably not much risk from a short elevator ride while masked or being passed by a jogger on the sidewalk, experts say.\n",
      "\tScientists have published online tools for calculating risk of airborne spread in various settings.\n",
      "\tAt a recent meeting on aerosols, however, Dr. Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association, noted that preventive steps can be a challenge in the real world. Keeping apart from other people can be difficult in homes that house multiple generations. Some old buildings have windows that were \"nailed shut years ago,\" he said. And \"we have far too many communities where they simply don't have access to clean water to wash their hands.\"\n",
      "\tIt might seem strange that for all the scientific frenzy to study the new coronavirus, the details of how it spreads can still be in doubt nine months later. But history suggests patience.\n",
      "\t\"We've been studying influenza for 102 years,\" says Milton, referring to the 1918 flu epidemic. \"We still don't know how it's transmitted and what the role of aerosols is.\"\n",

      "\tAfter the first shot, he had no reaction. But Kan Chai felt woozy following the second dose of a COVID-19 vaccine approved for emergency use in China.\n",
      "\t\"When I was driving on the road, I suddenly felt a bit dizzy, as if I was driving drunk,\" the popular writer and columnist recounted in a webinar earlier this month. \"So I specially found a place to stop the car, rest a bit and then I felt better.\"\n",
      "\tHis is a rare account from the hundreds of thousands of people who have been given Chinese vaccines, before final regulatory approval for general use. It's an unusual move that raises ethical and safety questions, as companies and governments worldwide race to develop a vaccine that will stop the spread of the coronavirus.\n",
      "\tChinese companies earlier drew attention for giving the vaccine to their top executives and leading researchers before human trials to test their safety and efficacy had even begun. In recent months, they have injected a far larger number under an emergency use designation approved in June, and that number appears poised to rise.\n",
      "\tA Chinese health official said Friday that China, which has largely eradicated the disease, needs to take steps to prevent it from coming back. But one outside expert questioned the need for emergency use when the virus is no longer spreading in the country where it was first detected.\n",
      "\tIt's unclear exactly who and how many people have been injected so far, but Chinese vaccine makers have offered some clues. State-owned Sinopharm subsidiary CNBG has given the vaccine to 350,000 people outside its clinical trials, which have about 40,000 people enrolled, a top CNBG executive said recently.\n",
      "\tAnother company, Sinovac Biotech Ltd., has injected 90% of its employees and family members, or about 3,000 people, most under the emergency-use provision, CEO Yin Weidong said. It has also provided tens of thousands of rounds of its CoronaVac to the Beijing city government.\n",
      "\tSeparately, the Chinese military has approved the use of a vaccine it developed with CanSino Biologics Inc., a biopharmaceutical company, in military personnel.\n",
      "\t\"The first people to have priority in emergency use are the vaccine researchers and the vaccine manufacturers because when the pandemic comes, if these people are infected then there's no way to produce the vaccine,\" Yin said.\n",
      "\tNow, large Chinese firms including telecom giant Huawei and broadcaster Phoenix TV have announced they're working with Sinopharm to get the vaccine for their employees.\n",
      "\tSeveral people who say they work in \"front-line\" organizations have said on social media that their workplaces have offered vaccinations for about 1,000 yuan ($150). They declined to comment, saying they would need permission from their organizations.\n",
      "\tIn an established but limited practice, experimental medications have been approved historically for use when they are still in the third and last phase of human trials. Chinese companies have four vaccines in phase 3 -- two from Sinopharm, and one each from Sinovac and CanSino.\n",
      "\tThe Chinese government referenced the World Health Organization's emergency-use principles to create its own through a strict process, National Health Commission official Zheng Zhongwei said at a news conference Friday.\n",
      "\tHe said there have been no serious side effects in the clinical trials.\n",
      "\t\"We've made it very clear that the COVID-19 vaccine we put into emergency use are safe,\" Zheng said. \"Their safety can be ensured but their efficacy is yet to be determined.\"\n",
      "\tUnder the emergency rule, high-risk personnel such as medical and customs workers and those who have to work overseas are given priority access, he said. He declined to provide exact numbers.\n",
      "\t\"In China's case, the pressure in preventing imported infections and domestic resurgence is still huge,\" Zheng said.\n",
      "\tBut Diego Silva, a lecturer in bioethics at the University of Sydney, said that giving vaccines to hundreds of thousands outside of clinical trials doesn't have \"scientific merit\" in China, where there are currently very few locally transmitted cases, and incoming arrivals are quarantined centrally.\n",
      "\t\"If it's in the U.S. where the virus is still raging that's a bit different, but in a country like China it doesn't seem to make sense to me,\" he said. \"Because there's not enough of the virus in China locally to deduce anything, you're introducing a whole host of others factors\" by injecting people outside of trials.\n",
      "\tZheng said that all those injected under emergency use are being closely tracked for any adverse health effects.\n",
      "\tKan Chai, the columnist, wrote in an article posted online in September that despite initial hesitation, he decided to sign up after he heard a state-owned company was looking for volunteers.\n",
      "\tHe didn't say whether his was an emergency-use case, but the timing of his vaccination suggests it was. He took the first dose in late July, when the emergency inoculations were getting started and the trials were all but over.\n",
      "\t\"I'm willing to be a little white mouse, and the biggest reason is because I have trust in our country's vaccination technology,\" he said.\n",
      "\tHis real name is Li Yong, but his 1.65 million followers on the Twitter-like social platform Weibo know him better by his pen name, which means \"10 years of chopping wood.\" He declined an interview request.\n",
      "\tHe described taking the vaccine in a public webinar hosted by 8am HealthInsight, a popular health media outlet. It's unclear why he qualified to receive it.\n",
      "\tScant information is publicly available about the program's scope, size, and scientific merit. CNBG and parent Sinopharm declined to comment. Zheng, the National Health Commission official, did not know about the Kan Chai case.\n",
      "\tWhile emergency use may be the right path, Chinese companies are not being transparent about issues such as informed consent, said Joy Zhang, a professor who researches the ethical governance of emerging science at University of Kent in Britain.\n",
      "\tZhang said that she could not find any relevant information on the Sinopharm website, and aside from reports published in international medical journals, there is little else made public.\n",
      "\tShe said relatively more information is publicly available about other trials such as one run by Oxford University and AstraZeneca. The trial was halted after a participant developed severe neurological side effects, and only resumed after clinical data was submitted to an independent review board.\n",
      "\tChina has a troubled past with vaccines, with various scandals over the past two decades.\n",
      "\tThe most recent case was in 2018, when Changsheng Biotechnology Co. came under investigation for falsifying records and making ineffective rabies vaccines for children.\n",
      "\tIn 2017, Wuhan Institute of Biological Products Co., a CNBG subsidiary behind one of the vaccines in phase 3 trials, was found to have made defective diphtheria vaccines that were ineffective.\n",
      "\tPublic anger over the case prompted an overhaul of a vaccine punishment law in 2019. The country tightened supervision over the vaccine development and distribution process, and increased penalties for fabricating data.\n",
      "\tThose concerns seem to be of the past. Guizhen Wu, the chief biosafety expert for China's Center for Disease Control, said a vaccine could be ready for the general public in China as early as November. She said she took an experimental vaccine back in April.\n",
      "\tAn overseas employee at a Chinese state-owned company, who spoke on condition of anonymity because she wasn't authorized to speak with the media, said she decided to sign up last week.\n",
      "\tShe said she isn't worried because a vaccine is a government priority, so authorities will keep a close watch on the process.\n",

      "\tFuture moon explorers will be bombarded with two to three times more radiation than astronauts aboard the International Space Station, a health hazard that will require thick-walled shelters for protection, scientists reported Friday.\n",
      "\tChina's lander on the far side of the moon is providing the first full measurements of radiation exposure from the lunar surface, vital information for NASA and others aiming to send astronauts to the moon, the study noted.\n",
      "\tA Chinese-German team reported on the radiation data collected by the lander -- named Chang'e 4 for the Chinese moon goddess -- in the U.S. journal Science Advances.\n",
      "\t\"This is an immense achievement in the sense that now we have a data set which we can use to benchmark our radiation\" and better understand the potential risk to people on the moon, said Thomas Berger, a physicist with the German Space Agency's medicine institute.\n",
      "\tAstronauts would get 200 to 1,000 times more radiation on the moon than what we experience on Earth -- or five to 10 times more than passengers on a trans-Atlantic airline flight, noted Robert Wimmer-Schweingruber of Christian-Albrechts University in Kiel, Germany.\n",
      "\t\"The difference is, however, that we're not on such a flight for as long as astronauts would be when they're exploring the moon,\" Wimmer-Schweingruber said in an email.\n",
      "\tCancer is the primary risk.\n",
      "\t\"Humans are not really made for these radiation levels and should protect themselves when on the moon,\" he added.\n",
      "\tRadiation levels should be pretty much the same all over the moon, except for near the walls of deep craters, Wimmer-Schweingruber said.\n",
      "\t\"Basically, the less you see of the sky, the better. That's the primary source of the radiation,\" he said.\n",
      "\tWimmer-Schweingruber said the radiation levels are close to what models had predicted. The levels measured by Chang'e 4, in fact, \"agree nearly exactly\" with measurements by a detector on a NASA orbiter that has been circling the moon for more than a decade, said Kerry Lee, a space radiation expert at Johnson Space Center in Houston.\n",
      "\t\"It is nice to see confirmation of what we think and our understanding of how radiation interacts with the moon is as expected,\" said Lee, who was not involved in the Chinese-led study.\n",
      "\tIn a detailed outline released this week, NASA said the first pair of astronauts to land on the moon under the new Artemis program would spend about a week on the lunar surface, more than twice as long as the Apollo crews did a half-century ago. Expeditions would last one to two months once a base camp is established.\n",
      "\tNASA is looking to put astronauts on the moon by the end of 2024, an accelerated pace ordered by the White House, and on Mars sometime in the 2030s.\n",
      "\tThe space agency said it will have radiation detectors and a safe shelter aboard all Orion crew capsules flying to the moon. As for the actual landers, three separate corporate teams are developing their own craft with NASA oversight. For the first Artemis moon landing, at least, the astronauts will live in the ascent portion of their lander.\n",
      "\tThe German researchers suggest shelters built of moon dirt -- readily available material -- for stays of more than a few days. The walls should be 80 centimetres (about 2 1/2 feet) thick, they said. Any thicker and the dirt will emit its own secondary radiation, created when galactic cosmic rays interact with the lunar soil.\n",
      "\t\"So in this sense -- I think the walls of European Castles would be too thick!\" Berger wrote in an email.\n",

      "\tChina appeared to be expanding its network of secret detention centres in Xinjiang, where predominantly Muslim minorities are targeted in a forced assimilation campaign, and more of the facilities resemble prisons, an Australian think-tank has found.\n",
      "\tThe Australian Strategic Policy Institute used satellite images and official construction tender documents to map more than 380 suspected detention facilities in the remote Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, highlighting internment camps, detention centres and prisons that have been newly built or expanded since 2017.\n",
      "\tThe report builds on evidence that China has made a policy shift from detaining Uighurs and other largely Muslim minorities in makeshift public buildings to constructing permanent mass detention facilities.\n",
      "\tThis is despite Chinese state news agency Xinhua reporting late last year that \"trainees\" attending \"vocational education and training centres\" meant to deradicalize them had \"all graduated.\"\n",
      "\tRegional government chairman Shohrat Zakir was quoted as saying foreign media reports of 1 million or 2 million people attending these centres were fabricated, though he would not provide any figures.\n",
      "\tPredominantly Muslim minorities in the Xinjiang region have been locked in camps as part of a government assimilation campaign launched in response to decades of sometimes violent struggle against Chinese rule. Though officials described the camps as \"boarding school-like\" facilities meant to provide free job training, former detainees say they were subjected to brutal conditions, political indoctrination, beatings, and sometimes psychological and physical torture.\n",
      "\tUnder the assimilation drive, the state has forced Uighurs to get sterilizations and abortions, an Associated Press investigation found, and in recent months, has ordered them to drink traditional Chinese medicines to combat the coronavirus.\n",
      "\tAustralian Strategic Policy Institute researcher Nathan Ruser wrote in the report released late Thursday: \"Available evidence suggests that many extrajudicial detainees in Xinjiang's vast `re-education' network are now being formally charged and locked up in higher security facilities, including newly built or expanded prisons, or sent to walled factory compounds for coerced labour assignments.\"\n",
      "\tAt least 61 detention sites had undergone new construction and expansion work in a year to July 2020, the report said. These included at least 14 facilities still under construction this year.\n",
      "\t\"Of these, about 50% are higher security facilities, which may suggest a shift in usage from the lower-security, 're-education centres' toward higher-security prison-style facilities,\" Ruser wrote.\n",
      "\tAt least 70 facilities appeared to have lesser security by the removal of internal fencing or perimeter walls, the report said.\n",
      "\tThese included eight camps that showed signs of decommissioning, and had possibly been closed. Of the camps stripped of security infrastructure, 90 per cent were lower security facilities, the report said.\n",
      "\tThe think-tank 's findings align with AP interviews with dozens of relatives and former detainees that indicate many in the camps have been sentenced in secret, extrajudicial trials and transferred to high-security prisons for things like having contact with people abroad, having too many children and studying Islam. Many others deemed less of a risk, like women or the elderly, have been transferred to a form of house arrest or forced labour in factories.\n",

      "\tIOC President Thomas Bach delivered a pep talk to Japanese government officials and local organizers on Thursday that included suggestions that \"hundreds of millions\" of doses COVID-19 vaccines would be available before the postponed Olympics open in July.\n",
      "\tBach was speaking from Switzerland in an on-line gathering of officials in Japan during the first of two days of meetings focused on how to pull off the delayed Tokyo Games.\n",
      "\tBach pointed out that major sports events like the Tour de France have been held with limited fans and without the vaccine. But he said a vaccine -- or vaccines -- could be ready for Tokyo, although he gave few details.\n",
      "\t\"We have very encouraging news about the development of a vaccine -- and not only a vaccine, but vaccines,\" he said.\n",
      "\tBach added that the International Olympic Committee was in contact with the World Health Organization and other \"experts\" and unnamed pharmaceutical companies. He said they were \"unanimous\" in saying that a vaccine will be available at the beginning of next year.\n",
      "\t\"In the first couple months of next year we will have different vaccines.\" Bach said. \"They will be available in very considerable doses.\"\n",
      "\tBach said this could amount to \"hundreds of millions of doses being available already in the first half of the next year.\"\n",
      "\tA handful of vaccines already are in final testing in the United States and other countries, and hopes are high they might be ready by the end of the year. Bach has previously said he was also in contact with Chinese pharmaceutical company Sinovac.\n",
      "\tBach did not tackle the big ethical question: Should young, healthy athletes be a priority for a vaccine, ahead of health workers and vulnerable populations? And will athletes want to take a vaccine, fearing they might fall ill days before competing?\n",
      "\tSpeaking for about 15 minutes, Bach tried to assure Japanese organizers -- and the Japanese public and sponsors who have been skeptical that the games will happen -- that planning is on track.\n",
      "\tDomestic sponsors have contributed $3.3 billion to the local operating budget, and polls suggest many are reluctant to renew their contracts.\n",
      "\tSurveys have shown a majority of Japanese companies and the public don't think the Olympics will happen next year -- or should happen.\n",
      "\tBack repeated several times that next year's games have to be \"fit for the post-Corona world.\" He said the Tokyo Olympics were the \"best prepared\" in history, but that will not be enough.\n",
      "\t\"We cannot just repeat the great work you have been doing, or copying it and slightly adapting it. We have to adapt it to this new world,\" Bach said.\n",
      "\tHe also said the IOC and local organizers would not be rushed to reveal details of exactly how the Tokyo Olympics will take place. He said many scenarios were in play, and might be up until the opening ceremony.\n",
      "\t\"Nobody can expect from us that we know already exactly what needs to be done in 10 months from now,\" he said. \"This work will continue until the day of the opening ceremony because it is new for all of us.\"\n",
      "\tHe also pointed out that many countries are in different stages of COVID-19, and in the reliability of their testing.\n",
      "\t\"This is not only about the conditions in Japan and the conditions for travel to Japan,\" he said. \"This also concerns the conditions in the 205 other national Olympic committees.\"\n",
      "\tThe two-day meeting this week come as Japan's Kyodo news agency has reported more details about the bribery scandal that seemed to have helped Tokyo land the Olympics in 2013. It forced the resignation last year of Tsunekazu Takeda, the president of the Japanese Olympic Committee.\n",

      "\tThe talks, proposed by South Korea, were the first contact in nine months between leaders of the two countries. Relations between Japan and South Korea deteriorated to their worst levels in years under Suga's predecessor, Shinzo Abe, a military hawk viewed by some as not apologetic enough over Japan's colonial rule of the Korean Peninsula from 1910-1945.\n",
      "\t\"I told President Moon that relations between the two countries are in a very severe condition right now and we should not leave this unresolved,(asterisk) Suga told reporters. \"Japan and South Korea are extremely important neighbours to each other. In dealing with North Korea and other issues, I believe Japan-South Korea and Japan-U.S. co-operation are crucial.\"\n",
      "\tTheir current dispute stems from South Korea's demands for compensation for Korean labourers abused by Japanese companies during the Second World War. South Korea's Supreme Court in 2018 ordered Japanese companies to compensate the aging Korean plaintiffs. Japan insists that all compensation matters were settled under a 1965 treaty.\n",
      "\tThe dispute spilled over into trade and military issues, complicating co-operation between the two key American allies. Moon accused Abe's government of weaponizing trade to retaliate over the legal dispute.\n",
      "\tSuga did not give any details Thursday about steps Japan would take to improve the relationship. He appeared to indicate Japan's position on the compensation was unchanged and he put the burden of easing tensions on South Korea.\n",
      "\t\"Based on Japan's consistent positions on the various problems, I plan to continue to strongly urge South Korea to take appropriate actions,\" Suga said.\n",
      "\tAsked if there was any sign of a thaw, Suga declined to comment.\n",
      "\tSuga took office last week after Abe stepped down due to poor health.\n",
      "\tHe has been holding telephone talks with other global leaders, including a call with U.S. President Donald Trump on Sunday. A call with Chinese President Xi Jinping is expected Friday.\n",
      "\tSuga, who was Abe's chief cabinet secretary, is largely expected to carry on Abe's diplomatic and security policies.\n",

      "CONTENT : FRANKFURT -- \n",
      "\tVolkswagen is unveiling a battery-powered sport-utility vehicle that is headed for global markets including the United States and China, as the company takes a major step forward in its campaign to make electric cars a mass-market choice.\n",
      "\tThe ID.4 combines the battery drive favoured by environmental rules in Europe and China with the compact SUV design that has drawn many consumers away from hatchbacks and sedans.\n",
      "\tThe new model comes close on the heels of the German company's first vehicle built on its electric-only platform, the ID.3 compact, that went on sale in September. The ID.3 is not, however, coming to the United States, where larger vehicles such as SUVs increasingly rule the market.\n",
      "\tThe ID.4 is by contrast \"designed as a world car,\" according to Volkswagen brand head Ralf Brandstaetter. It will launch in the U.S. early next year, with Volkswagen offering three years free unlimited charging on 470 stations belonging to the Electrify America fast-charging network.\n",
      "\tThe company says prices start at $39,995 before the potential $7,500 U.S. federal tax credit. The first edition will have range of 250 miles, charging to full in 7 1/2 hours at home, or up to 80% in 38 minutes at a fast-charging station. Volkswagen says eventually it will have a lower-cost $35,000 version with less range.\n",
      "\tScott Keough, CEO of Volkswagen in America, said Tesla's all-electric Model Y, which now starts at $49,990, is a competitor, but Volkswagen sees most of its customers coming from conventional compact SUVs such as the Toyota RAV4 and Honda CR-V. \"The opportunity is to get people flipping from ICEs (internal combustion engines) to this car,\" he said.\n",
      "\tThe compact SUV segment is the largest part of the U.S. new vehicle market with 4 million sold every year, Keough said.\n",
      "\tAt first, U.S. versions of the ID.4 will be rear-drive and imported to the U.S. from Germany, but Volkswagen's factory in Chattanooga, Tennessee, will begin building it toward the fall of 2022, he said.\n",
      "\tVolkswagen says the ID.4 will have great handling and will be faster from zero to 60 mph (96.6 kilometres per hour) than gas engine competitors. It expects the rear-drive version to get there under eight seconds and the all-wheel-drive version under six.\n",
      "\tThe company's goal is to broaden electric cars' appeal beyond \"first adopters\" to buyers simply looking for affordable transportation.\n",
      "\tVolkswagen hopes car buyers will be attracted by the advantages that come from designing a car as an electric vehicle from the ground up. Putting the battery flat below the passenger space gives the ID.4 about the same interior space as that of the longer Volkswagen Tiguan SUV, while the lower centre of gravity makes for better handling.\n",
      "\tThe new vehicle underlines the sharp turn the company has made after its 2015 scandal over diesel cars that for years were rigged to cheat on emissions tests so they could pollute more than U.S. rules allowed.\n",
      "\tOnly last week the company announced it had completed three years of monitoring as part of its guilty plea with the U.S. Justice Department. Under independent monitor Larry D. Thompson Volkswagen had to come up with a uniform ethics code and an expanded whistle-blower system. The company has also paid more than 30 billion euros ($35 billion) in fines and civil settlements. Former CEO Martin Winterkorn faces a criminal trial in a German court and has been indicted in the U.S., though he cannot be extradited under German law.\n",
      "\tThe push into electric cars is to a great extent being driven by regulation. The European Union is from 2021 requiring car makers' fleets to have lower levels of carbon dioxide, the primary greenhouse gas that causes global warming. The race to comply with the rules - or face fines that could run thousands of euros per vehicle sold - has seen companies launch more electric vehicles with better prices and longer range. The European market share jumped to 7.2% in the third quarter from 2.4% a year ago, despite the overall slump in sales due to the coronavirus recession.\n",
      "\tThe Chinese government is also making a regulatory push for more alternative propulsion vehicles. Uptake in the U.S. has been slower as regulatory pressure has been weaker.\n",
      "\tStephanie Brinley, principal analyst at research firm IHS Markit, said the vehicle is \"very significant for Volkswagen as it tries to move forward and transition from traditional engines to a more electric vehicle lineup.\"\n",
      "\tShe cautioned that the transition to significant electric sales will take decades. \"This is the beginning of a very long journey for them.\"\n",
      "\tConsumers are getting more choice, with 18 electric models available in 2018 growing to 120 by 2025. And that will help push electrics to a 9% market share by 2025: \"For the electric vehicle market to really find the success that we expect it will, it needs to make that trip over to people who are less aggressive about change and are willing to try it anyway.\"\n",

      "\tEurope surged past five million cases of the new coronavirus on Wednesday as France and Spain prepared tighter restrictions in an attempt to curb rising levels of infections in their capital cities.\n",
      "\tWorldwide nearly 32 million people have been infected and more than 971,000 have died since the virus emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan in late 2019 and spread across the globe.\n",
      "After appearing to bring cases mostly under control with economically devastating lockdowns, Europe now faces a resurgence, forcing governments to consider reintroducing tough measures.\n",
      "\tMore than half of Europe's infections have been recorded in Russia, followed by Spain, France and the United Kingdom.\n",
      "\tThe 380,000 cases reported in the past week represent the highest number in the region since the start of the pandemic.\n",
      "\tThe French government was preparing on Wednesday to announce stricter anti-virus measures for Paris, sources told AFP, as national infections have rocketed since lockdown was lifted -- sometimes surging past 10,000 a day.\n",
      "\tPresident Emmanuel Macron had said new curbs would be announced on Wednesday and sources said they could include a ban on alcohol sales after 8:00 pm and restrictions on social gatherings, as well as speeded up testing.\n",
      "\t\"We are calling on people to be vigilant, we will have to live with this virus for a while,\" said Anne Souyris, deputy Paris mayor. \"The object is to protect yourself while shaping a social life.\"\n",
      "\tThe Madrid region, the heart of an explosion of infections in Spain, has already locked down roughly 850,000 people and plans to extend the measures on Friday.\n",
      "\tBritain has already announced fresh steps to try to allay the rising toll.\n",
      "\t\"To help contain the virus, office workers who can work effectively from home should do so,\" the government said on Tuesday, despite fears of a devastating economic impact.\n",
      "\tNew rules come into force for pubs and other hospitality venues on Thursday, forcing them to close early, and plans to allow fans back into sporting events have been ditched.\n",
      "\tBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson warned the new restrictions could last up to six months and called for a collective effort to \"get through this winter together\".\n",
      "\tHis scientific advisors had said the United Kingdom could see a devastating 50,000 coronavirus cases a day by mid-October if no action is taken.\n",
      "\tThe World Health Organization reported late on Monday that almost two million infections were recorded around the globe in the week to September 20.\n",

      "\tTrump has repeatedly played down the seriousness of the coronavirus crisis.\n",
      "\tThe pandemic is taking a heavier toll on employment than previously feared, the United Nations said on Wednesday, with hundreds of millions of jobs lost and workers suffering a \"massive\" drop in earnings.\n",
      "\tThe International Labour Organization (ILO) found that by mid-year, global working hours had declined 17.3 percent compared with last December -- equivalent to nearly 500 million full-time jobs.\n",
      "\t\"The impact has been catastrophic,\" ILO chief Guy Ryder told reporters in a virtual briefing.\n",
      "\tIn a rare glimmer of hope, Saudi Arabia announced that it would gradually resume the year-round umrah pilgrimage for Muslims from October 4.\n",

      "\tThey also honored the medical community and countless voices who are working to end injustice, according to representatives for the couple. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are alumni of TIME magazine's Time 100 list, having been named in 2018.\n",
      "\tHarry and Meghan called on viewers around the world to act with compassion in both the physical and digital worlds, use their voices, be engaged within their communities and the civic process, and care for one another, according to their representatives.\n",
      "\t\"When one person buys into negativity online, the effects are felt exponentially. It's time to not only reflect, but act,\" said Harry in his video remarks.\n",
      "\t\"As we approach this November, it's vital that we reject hate speech, misinformation, and online negativity. What we consume, what we are exposed to, and what we engage with online, has a real effect on all of us,\" he said.\n",
      "\t\"Every four years, we're told, 'This is the most important election of our lifetime.' But this one is,\" said Meghan. \"When we vote our values are put into action, and our voices are heard.\"\n",
      "\t\"Seeing our world through the lens of community is so important. Because we need to redraw the lines of how we engage with each other -- both online and off,\" she added.\n",
      "\t\"Tonight reminds us of how important it is to watch out for each other, to care for each other, and to inspire each other,\" said Harry.\n",

      "\tSenior military commanders from India and China have agreed to not add more troops along their fast-militarizing disputed border in the mountainous Ladakh region where the two Asian giants are locked in a bitter months-long standoff, the sides said late Tuesday.\n",
      "\tThe joint statement released after talks said the two sides also agreed to \"strengthen communication on the ground\" and \"avoid misunderstandings and misjudgments\" along the lengthy contested border known as the Line of Actual Control. However, it did not mention any breakthrough during the talks about their forces disengaging from the standoff as they had earlier committed.\n",
      "\tThe standoff in the cold desert of Ladakh began in May and escalated in June to the deadliest violence between the two sides in decades -- a clash on a high ridge in which soldiers used clubs, stones and their fists. Twenty Indian soldiers were killed and dozens of others were injured. China is believed to have also suffered casualties but did not provide any details.\n",
      "\tThe rival countries have amassed tens of thousands of soldiers, backed by artilleries, tanks and fighter jets in the Ladakh area following the deadly standoff.\n",
      "\tAfter that clash, the two countries partially disengaged from the site in Ladakh's Galwan Valley and at least two other places, but the crisis has continued in at least three other areas, including the glacial Pangong Lake.\n",
      "\tIn recent weeks, the world's two most populous nations have accused each other of sending soldiers into each other's territory in the Pangong area and firing warning shots for the first time in 45 years, raising the spectre of a full-scale military conflict.\n",
      "\tDespite several rounds of talks by military, diplomatic and political officials, including negotiations between the two countries' foreign and defence ministers in Moscow this month, the border tensions have persisted.\n",
      "\tThe commanders held discussions on Monday for about 14 hours.\n",
      "\tThe statement issued by the defence ministries of the two sides Tuesday said they have agreed to \"stop sending more troops to the frontline.\" It said the two countries will hold a seventh round of military commander-level talks \"as soon as possible\" and \"jointly safeguard peace and tranquility in the border area.\"\n",
      "\tThe statement said the commanders agreed to \"earnestly implement the important consensus reached by the leaders of the two countries.\"\n",
      "\tMonday's military-level talks came less than two weeks after the two nations' foreign ministers met on Sept. 10 and agreed that their troops should disengage from the tense border standoff, maintain proper distance and ease tensions.\n",
      "\tThe foreign ministers did not set a timeline for disengagement, nor did Tuesday's statement mention one.\n",
      "\tMilitary experts have repeatedly warned that any mistake or miscalculation from either side could have disastrous consequences.\n",
      "\tNeither India and China have provided much information, but media in the two countries, India especially, have extensively covered the escalating tension, which has dramatically changed their bilateral relations. Long wary of economic domination by China, India has in recent weeks banned Chinese cellphone apps including TikTok and taken other steps to rein in Chinese influence.\n",
      "\tRelations between the two countries have often been strained, partly due to their undemarcated border. They fought a border war in 1962 that spilled into Ladakh and ended in an uneasy truce. Since then, troops have guarded the undefined border while occasionally brawling. The two countries have agreed not to attack each other with firearms.\n",
      "\tThe fiercely contested control line separates Chinese- and Indian-held territories from Ladakh in the west to India's eastern state of Arunachal Pradesh, which China claims in its entirety. It is broken in parts where the Himalayan nations of Nepal and Bhutan border China.\n",
      "\tAccording to India, the de facto border is 3,488 kilometres (2,167 miles) long, while China says it is considerably shorter. As its name suggests, it divides the areas of physical control rather than territorial claims.\n",

      "\tFacebook says it has removed a small network of fake accounts and pages that originated in China and focused on disrupting political activity in the U.S. and several other countries.\n",
      "\tThe U.S.-focused activity was just a \"sliver\" of the accounts' overall activity and gained almost no following, Facebook said. Their primary focus was Southeast Asia, including the Philippines.\n",
      "\tIn the U.S, the accounts posted material both in support of and against presidential candidates Pete Buttigieg, Joe Biden and President Donald Trump.\n",
      "\tFacebook did not link the network directly to the Chinese government. It said the people behind the network tried to conceal their identity and location via virtual private networks and other methods.\n",
      "\tU.S. intelligence officials have identified China as one of several countries, along with Russia and Iran, who they say could look to interfere in the 2020 election. In an August public assessment, the country's chief counterintelligence official, William Evanina, said officials had determined that Beijing regards Trump as unpredictable and wants to see him lose to Biden.\n",
      "\tThe statement said that China had been expanding its influence operations ahead of the 2020 election to \"shape the policy environment in the United States\" and had been weighing the pros and cons of taking more aggressive action.\n",
      "\tNotably, though, the intelligence assessment was more specific in its characterizations of Russian interference in the election, saying that Moscow was using a range of measures to denigrate Biden and that Kremlin-linked actors were propping up Trump's candidacy on social media and Russian interference.\n",
      "\tThe question of which country poses the biggest threat to election security has emerged as a politically fraught issue. Trump and several senior administration officials have repeatedly insisted that China is more aggressive, even though that characterization is not in line with the August intelligence assessment. After FBI Director Chris Wray outlined the threat of Russian interference last week and warned of its ongoing danger, Trump harangued him on Twitter by calling China a \"FAR greater threat than Russia, Russia, Russia.\"\n",
      "\tFacebook said the network focused mainly on Southeast Asia, where it posted in Chinese, Filipino and English about global news and current events. These included Beijing's interests in the South China Sea, Hong Kong, support for Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte and his daughter's potential run in that nation's 2022 presidential election, and criticism of Rappler, an independent news organization in the Philippines.\n",
      "\tFacebook also removed a second network originating in the Philippines. These accounts posted in Filipino and English about local news and events including domestic politics, military activities against terrorism, a pending anti-terrorism bill, criticism of communism, youth activists and opposition, the company said.\n",

      "\tTikTok says a video of a man apparently taking his own life that circulated on its platform was spread deliberately by a group of users working together.\n",
      "\tThe company found evidence of a \"co-ordinated attack\" when it investigated why the video was suddenly appearing on the popular short-video sharing app, a TikTok executive told a British parliamentary committee Tuesday.\n",
      "\tTikTok scrambled earlier this month to remove clips of the man shooting himself with a gun, raising concerns about the platform's ability to stop harmful content from reaching its users, many of whom are teens.\n",
      "\tTheo Bertram, TikTok's European director of public policy, said there was a huge spike in the number of clips uploaded to TikTok about a week after the original video was livestreamed on Facebook.\n",
      "\t\"There's evidence of a co-ordinated attack,\" Bertrand said. \"Through our investigations, we learned that groups operating on the dark web made plans to raid social media platforms including TikTok, in order to spread the video across the internet. What we saw was a group of users who were repeatedly attempting to upload the video to our platform.\" The dark web is a part of the internet accessible only through anonymity-providing software.\n",
      "\tThe users were \"splicing it, editing it and cutting it in different ways\" and then making new accounts to help spread it, he said.\n",
      "\tTikTok users usually look through their own feed or use hashtags to find videos. But these users were clicking on account profiles, apparently anticipating that they would be posting the suicide clip, which is an unusual way to find videos, Bertram said. He gave few other details.\n",
      "\tThe company wrote Monday to nine other tech platforms proposing that they warn each other about violent and graphic content on their own services.\n",
      "\tBertram's comments came as TikTok said in its latest transparency report that it took down 104.5 million videos for violating its guidelines or terms of service during the first six months of the year. That's less than 1% of the total number of videos uploaded for that period.\n",
      "\tTikTok's Chinese owner, ByteDance, is fighting pressure in some of its major markets. In the U.S., TikTok faces a ban later this month from smartphone app stores, followed by a broader ban in November unless ByteDance can persuade U.S. officials it can resolve national security concerns.\n",

      "\tCherry Lin wistfully strokes a babygrow, fretting it may be too small for a son she is yet to meet -- one of hundreds of Chinese mothers estranged from babies born to commercial surrogates overseas after the coronavirus forced border closures.\n",
      "\tChina banned all forms of surrogacy –- both commercial and altruistic -- in 2001 due to concerns poor women were being exploited.\n",
      "But for US$35-75,000 couples can seek women abroad, from Laos and Russia, to Ukraine, Georgia and the U.S., to carry their babies.\n",
      "\tThe system has been tipped into chaos by the pandemic, which has seen borders closed, flights cancelled and visas pulled, creating a 'pile-up' of newborns waiting to be picked up by their biological Chinese parents.\n",
      "\tIt has also revived the black market for surrogacy inside China.\n",
      "\t'Baby dens' with dozens of newborns in orphanages or apartments have been found as the backlog builds, according to surrogacy agencies in Russia and Ukraine.\n",
      "\t\"I can't sleep at night thinking my baby is stuck in an orphanage,\" Lin, who opted for surrogacy after suffering several miscarriages, told AFP from southern city of Chengdu.\n",
      "\tHer baby was born in St Petersburg in June, three months after Russia closed its border with China to curb the spread of the coronavirus.\n",
      "\t\"We don't know how long we have to wait,\" she concedes.\n",
      "\tRising incomes, high rates of infertility and the desire for older couples -- well past their reproductive age -- to have a son after China scrapped its one-child rule in 2016 has fuelled the demand for foreign surrogates.\n",
      "\tLin, a 38-year-old lawyer, and her husband travelled to Russia last year for IVF and to sign a contract with a surrogacy company.\n",
      "\tOnce the pregnancy was confirmed she shopped for baby products, and even took an infant first aid course.\n",
      "\tBut her plans unravelled as the virus swept the globe, dropping her into \"a nightmare\", where she receives fragments of her newborn's first weeks through photos and video clips sent by the surrogacy agency.\n",
      "LOSING PRECIOUS TIME\n",
      "\tChina's foreign ministry and the Russian embassy in Beijing did not respond to AFP queries about what they were doing to help Chinese parents bring their babies home.\n",
      "\tAnd there are no official figures on how many Chinese babies born to surrogates are stranded abroad.\n",
      "\tBut a video posted in June by surrogacy service BioTexCom in Ukraine showing rows of babies in cribs in a hotel pointed to the scale of the crisis.\n",
      "\tNearly half of the 46 babies belonged to Chinese clients, a BioTexCom spokesperson told AFP.\n",
      "\tAuthorities have since issued special permits for biological parents to claim their children despite border closures.\n",
      "\tBut that is not enough for Li Mingxia, whose son was born in May in Kiev.\n",
      "\tQuarantine requirements and infrequent flights means she is still unlikely to reach him until late November.\n",
      "\t\"I will miss the first six months of his life,\" Li explains, adding: \"I can't get that back.\"\n",
      "\tMost babies born abroad do not have birth certificates since their parents are unable to travel to take the DNA tests needed to prove parentage.\n",
      "\tRussian and Ukrainian police have also started raiding the baby dens -- apartments where five or six undocumented babies are being looked after by one nanny -- amid fears of human trafficking, Russian state media reported.\n",
      "\t\"When the police find several Chinese babies without any identification papers, living in a house with a stranger it looks like you are selling babies for organ harvesting,” according to Dmitriy Sitzko, China Marketing Manager for Vera Surrogacy Center in Saint Petersburg, who worked with Lin.\n",
      "\tLin's agency found a spot at a state-run orphanage to care for her baby for free.\n",
      "\tBut some agencies in Russia charge parents anywhere between 7,000 to 21,000 yuan ($1,000 to $3,000) per month, Sitzko said.\n",
      "\tNearly one in four couples of reproductive age in China suffer from infertility, according to the Global Burden of Disease study published in medical journal The Lancet in 2017.\n",
      "\tSome studies have linked high levels of pollution to declining male fertility, while women are choosing to delay motherhood due to the high costs of living, restrictive maternity policies, and high childcare costs.\n",
      "\tSurrogacy is sometimes chosen when fertility treatments, such as IVF, don't work for the couple or if they are unable to carry a child.\n",
      "\tStars such as Elton John, Cristiano Ronaldo, Nicole Kidman, and Kim Kardashian West, have said they used surrogates to expand their families, raising the profile of the practice -- but it remains controversial.\n",
      "\tThe UN has warned commercial surrogacy risked turning children into \"commodities\" and called for better regulation in places where it is legal.\n",
      "\t\"There is no right to have a child under international law. Children are not goods or services that the State can guarantee or provide. They are human beings with rights,\" Maud de Boer-Buquicchio, Special Rapporteur on the sale and sexual exploitation of children, said in a 2018 report.\n",
      "\tOnly a handful of countries allow international surrogacy.\n",
      "\tAFP interviews with 15 surrogacy service providers found it costs about $35,000 - $50,000 for surrogacy in Ukraine and Georgia, $73,000 in Russia and $200,000 in California, one of the few US states where it is legal.\n",
      "\tRussia and former soviet countries including Ukraine, Georgia and Belarus are the top destinations for Chinese couples looking for a birth mother.\n",
      "\tThe sector was displaced from Asia, with Laos the only remaining nation to allow international surrogacy after Thailand and India -- long time hotspots -- banned it.\n",
      "\tEven in Russia and Ukraine a backlash against foreign surrogacy is building with politicians and activists warning that women and children are being exploited by wealthy foreigners.\n",
      "\tBut as global travel restrictions have brought the industry to a halt, people are instead turning to the local black market.\n",
      "\tShenzhou Zhongtai, an agency in the southern city of Gaungzhou, told AFP that it costs 600,000 yuan ($87,000) for \"successful transplanting and delivery.\"\n",
      "\t\"Add another 200,000 yuan (about $30,000) for sex selection, and another 200,000 yuan for Dragon and Phoenix twins,\" an agent said -- referring to a package that allowed couples to have a boy and a girl.\n",
      "\tArmy officers, communist party cadres or judges who can't travel abroad because of their sensitive jobs are the main clients for China's underground surrogacy agencies that go unpunished because of their official connections.\n",
      "\t\"If there are any legal problems, we can fix it,\" said Ye Danni, an agent for Laos Baby International Reproductive Clinic that had to pause their operations abroad due to travel restrictions.\n",
      "\tLin, who gave up her law practice to have a baby, says she was too afraid to turn to the Chinese black market -- but the pandemic has made her rue that choice.\n",
      "\tShe says: \"If I'd taken that risk, I'd be holding my baby today.\"\n",

      "\tA New York police officer who rose through the ranks of the department is accused of using his position in the department's community affairs unit to give Chinese officials access to NYPD officials and offered insider information about its operations, according to a criminal complaint.\n",
      "\tThe officer, Baimadajie Angwang, 33, was arrested Monday, according to the U.S. Attorney's office for the Eastern District of New York. Federal prosecutors in Brooklyn charged him with acting as a foreign agent without notifying American authorities, wire fraud and making false statements, according to a complaint. They also charged him with obstruction of an official proceeding -- prosecutors claim he lied on a national security clearance form that granted him a \"secret\" security clearance.\n",
      "\tCNN has reached out to an attorney for Angwang for comment on the charges. He had his first court appearance Monday.\n",
      "\tAngwang, who joined the department in 2016, is part of the NYPD's community affairs unit based in Queens. He is currently suspended; the NYPD did not respond when asked whether he is suspended with pay.\n",
      "\tA complaint unsealed Monday alleges Angwang \"used his official position in the NYPD to provide (Chinese) Consulate officials access to senior NYPD officials through invitations to official NYPD events.\" He's also accused of telling a consulate official he could provide non-public information about the NYPD's internal operations.\n",
      "\tAngwang is a former Marine who served in Afghanistan in 2013, according to his service record. Since 2014, he has served as a U.S. Army Reservist, where he is a staff sergeant working as a civil affairs specialist. According to the criminal complaint, his duties with the Army Reserve include \"advising the command on the tactical and operational deployment\" of civil affairs teams, and he holds a \"secret\" level security clearance.\n",
      "\tProsecutors say in the complaint that an investigation revealed Angwang allegedly acted at the direction and control of Chinese officials to report on activities of ethnic Tibetans in the New York City area to the consulate, and helped spot and assess potential Tibetan intelligence sources.\n",
      "\tProsecutors allege that since 2018, Angwang has maintained a relationship with at least two Chinese officials stationed at the consulate in New York. He allegedly received tasks from and reported back to them, even referring to one of the officials repeatedly as \"Boss.\"\n",
      "\tA naturalized U.S. citizen, Angwang came to the United States from China on a cultural exchange visa, overstayed his second visa and eventually applied for asylum in the United States, claiming he was \"arrested and tortured\" in the People's Republic of China due in part to his Tibetan ethnicity, according to the complaint.\n",
      "\t\"Let them know you have recruited one in the police department,\" Angwang allegedly told a Chinese consulate official in a November 2018 call, according to the complaint.\n",
      "\tThe Chinese consulate in New York issued a statement Tuesday, describing its work as \"above board and beyond reproach.\"\n",
      "\t\"The staffs of the Chinese Consulate General in New York have always been fulfilling duties in accordance with international law and the law of the United States,\" the statement said. \"They have been conducting normal exchanges with various sectors of society in its consular district, and have been committed to promoting friendly communication and exchanges between the Chinese people and the people from all works of life in its consular district.\"\n",
      "\tAngwang remained in federal custody Monday, after his attorney John Carman said at his initial appearance he would consent to an order of detention, but may consider applying for bail.\n",
      "\tAssistant Attorney General for National Security John Demers said in a statement that Angwang's arrest was a warning to state and local officials that they are not immune to the threat of Chinese espionage.\n",
      "\t\"According to the allegations, the Chinese government recruited and directed a U.S. citizen and member of our nation's largest law enforcement department to further its intelligence gathering and repression of Chinese abroad,\" Demers said.\n",
      "\tAccording to the complaint, after Angwang received a promotion, he allegedly told a Chinese consulate official that meant he could \"provide NYPD information to the Consulate.\"\n",
      "\tWhen the NYPD asked Angwang to take part in a TV interview for a media outlet that is critical of Chinese government, Angwang sought permission from a Chinese consulate official, who told him he \"absolutely shouldn't do it,\" the complaint states.\n",
      "\tNYPD Commissioner Dermot Shea, in a statement to CNN, said, \"As alleged in this federal complaint, Baimadajie Angwang violated every oath he took in this country. One to the United States, another to the U.S. Army, and a third to this Police Department.\n",
      "\t\"From the earliest stages of this investigation, the NYPD's Intelligence and Internal Affairs bureaus worked closely with the FBI's Counterintelligence Division to make sure this individual would be brought to justice.\"\n",
      "\tAngwang is also accused of obstructing an \"official proceeding\" -- his Department of Defense national security background investigation.\n",
      "\tWhen filling out forms as part of his U.S. Army Reserve service, Angwang allegedly gave false answers to questions, including one that asked whether he or any member of his immediate family had contact with a foreign government, its establishment or representatives. He answered \"no\" to that question in 2019.\n",
      "\tCNN has reached out to the U.S. Army Reserve for comment.\n",
      "\tThe wire fraud charge stems from allegations that Angwang and his wife have received \"multiple substantial wire transfers from\" a bank account in China in his brother's name, and from an individual from an account at the Bank of China in New York, totaling about US$120,000.\n",

      "\tRen, 69, was convicted of corruption, bribery, embezzlement of public funds and abuse of power, the Beijing No. 2 Intermediate People's Court announced on its social media account. It cited Ren as saying he wouldn't appeal.\n",
      "\tThe former chairman and deputy party secretary of Huayuan Group was expelled from the ruling party in July.\n",
      "\tIn a commentary that circulated on social media, Ren criticized a Feb. 23 video conference with 170,000 officials held early in the pandemic at which Xi announced orders for responding to the disease.\n",
      "\tRen didn't mention Xi's name but said, \"standing there was not an emperor showing off his new clothes but a clown who had stripped off his clothes and insisted on being an emperor.\"\n",
      "\tRen criticized propaganda that portrayed Xi and other leaders as rescuing China from the disease without mentioning where it began and possible mistakes including suppressing information at the start of the outbreak.\n",
      "\t\"People did not see any criticism at the conference. It didn't investigate and disclose the truth,\" Ren wrote, according to a copy published by China Digital Times, a website in California. \"No one reviewed or took responsibility. But they are trying to cover up the truth with all kinds of great achievements.\"\n",
      "\tRen had an early military career and his parents were both former high officials in the Communist party. Some called him a princeling, a term for offspring of the founders of the communist government, a group that includes Xi.\n",
      "\tHe appeared to have crossed a political line by criticizing Xi's personal leadership.\n",

      "\tThe United Nations marked its 75th anniversary Monday with its chief urging leaders of an increasingly polarized, go-it-alone world to work together and preserve the organization's most important success since its founding: avoiding a military confrontation between the major global powers.\n",
      "\tSecretary-General Antonio Guterres' appeal for a revival of multilateralism -- the foundation of the United Nations -- was echoed by leaders of countries large and small, rich and poor.\n",
      "\tBut despite largely positive speeches, it was clear that challenges lie ahead in collaborating to beat back the coronavirus pandemic, end numerous smaller conflicts from the Middle East to Africa, and achieve U.N. goals to eradicate extreme poverty and preserve the environment by a 2030 target.\n",
      "\t\"Today, we have a surplus of multilateral challenges and a deficit of multilateral solutions,\" the U.N. chief said, stressing that COVID-19 has \"laid bare the world's fragilities,\" which can only be addressed together.\n",
      "\t\"Climate calamity looms, biodiversity is collapsing, poverty is rising, hatred is spreading, geopolitical tensions are escalating, nuclear weapons remain on hair-trigger alert,\" Guterres said.\n",
      "\tAppealing for a new multilateralism that draws on civil society, cities, businesses, local authorities and young people, Guterres said \"no one wants a world government -- but we must work together to improve world governance.\"\n",
      "\tThe United Nations marked its actual 75th anniversary -- the charter's signing in San Francisco on June 26, 1945 -- at a scaled-down event.\n",
      "\tMonday's mainly virtual official commemoration was a sobering assessment of the state of the world, the impact of the 193-member world body over seven decades and the struggles ahead. Some leaders appeared in native dress and in unusual settings, adding some colour to prerecorded speeches.\n",
      "\tThe commemoration was suspended with 58 countries waiting to speak, primarily because many leaders spoke far longer than the three minutes they were allotted. No date was set to hear the remaining speakers.\n",
      "\tAs a sign of the commemoration's importance, heads of government like Chinese President Xi Jinping and French President Emmanuel Macron spoke. U.S. President Donald Trump was first on the list of 182 speakers, but he didn't offer remarks.\n",
      "\tIn a snub to the United Nations, the United States instead was represented by its acting deputy U.N. ambassador, Cherith Norman Chalet. The White House had no immediate comment.\n",
      "\t\"In many ways, the United Nations has proven to be a successful experiment,\" Chalet said. But for too long, she added, it has resisted \"meaningful reform,\" lacked transparency and been \"too vulnerable to the agenda of autocratic regimes and dictatorships.\"\n",
      "\tChina's Xi urged U.N. members to recommit to multilateralism and \"work to promote a community with a shared future for mankind.\"\n",
      "\t\"Unilateralism is a dead end,\" he said. \"No country has the right to dominate global affairs, control the destiny of others or keep advantages in development all to itself. Even less should one be allowed to do whatever it likes and be the hegemon, bully or boss of the world.\"\n",
      "\tMacron said the United Nations has remained true to its promises made three-quarters of a century ago: \"To save future generations from the scourge of war, to assert human rights and the equality of nations, and to promote social progress in greater freedom.\"\n",
      "\tBut he warned that \"our common home is in disarray, just like our world.\"\n",
      "\t\"Faced with the health emergency, faced with the climate challenge, faced with the decline in rights,\" Macron said, \"it is here and now that we have to act, with those who want to and with those who can, by exploiting all possible spaces for co-operation.\"\n",
      "\tGuterres and many others said the founding of the United Nations in 1945 and the commitment to co-operation after two world wars and the Holocaust produced results.\n",
      "\t\"Never in modern history have we gone so many years without a military confrontation between the major powers,\" the secretary-general said. \"This is a major achievement of which member states can be proud -- and which we must all strive to preserve.\"\n",
      "\tGuterres cited other major U.N. victories over 75 years: peace treaties, decolonization, setting human rights standards, the end of apartheid in South Africa, eradication of diseases, a reduction in hunger, development of international law and landmark pacts to protect the environment.\n",
      "\tBut 25 years after world leaders adopted a platform to achieve equality for women, he said \"gender inequality remains the greatest single challenge to human rights around the world.\"\n",
      "\tGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel stressed that \"the United Nations can be only as effective as its members are united\" and urged new efforts \"to do everything in our power\" to find common responses and end \"the most intractable security issues,\" including conflicts in Libya and Syria.\n",
      "\tGuyana's President Irfaan Mohamed Ali, the head of what's called the Group of 77 and China -- the main U.N. bloc of developing countries that now has 134 member states -- said the commemoration \"must send a strong and positive signal to the peoples of the world of our commitment to multilateralism and our resolve to strive for peace, justice and development.\"\n",
      "\tEchoing broader global concerns, the president of Equatorial Guinea, Teodoro Obiang, said, \"There is no justification for the huge economic gap between rich and poor countries today.\"\n",
      "\tSimilarly, Seychelles President Danny Faure warned that issues like climate change know no borders.\n",
      "\t\"I assure you that the smallest, poorest and weakest of nations can contribute ideas as innovative ... as the biggest, wealthiest and most powerful countries,\" Faure said.\n",
      "\tDiplomats from the U.N. member nations managed to agree after sometimes difficult negotiations on a declaration to mark the U.N.'s anniversary, which was adopted Monday. It recalls the body's successes and failures and vows to build a post-pandemic world that is more equal, works together and protects the planet.\n",
      "\tRichard Gowan, U.N. director for the Crisis Group, a Brussels-based think-tank , said the declaration was weakened by the U.S. opposing strong language on climate change and Britain and others objecting to China trying to insert language including its hallmark phrase, \"win-win.\"\n",
      "\tPresident Xi used it Monday in speaking about \"Cold War mentality,\" declaring \"what we need to do is to replace conflict with dialogue, coercion with consultation and zero-sum with win-win.\"\n",
      "\tGowan said the dispute over the declaration was minor but \"captures the real question that has emerged over the U.N. in 2020, exacerbated by COVID, which is: How is this organization going to navigate an era of U.S.-China tension?\"\n",
      "\tAmid those questions, the U.N. released results of \"a global conversation\" it launched in January, using surveys, polls and gatherings to determine what all kinds of people thought about the future.\n",
      "\tGuterres said the U.N.'s 75th anniversary is an ideal time to realize goals that were expressed, including speeding up the transition to zero carbon emissions, ensuring universal health coverage and ending racial injustice.\n",
      "\t\"We face our own 1945 moment,\" he said. \"We must meet that moment. We must show unity like never before to overcome today's emergency, get the world moving and working and prospering again.\"\n",

      "CONTENT : TORONTO -- \n",
      "\tAs scientists around the world race to create a vaccine for the novel coronavirus, some researchers predict that belief in conspiracy theories could hinder the uptake of a safe vaccine once it becomes publicly available.\n",
      "\tA new study published today in the journal Social Science & Medicine found that conspiracy theories regarding COVID-19 have been persistent from March to July and are associated with the reluctance to adopt preventive behaviours, such as mask-wearing and vaccination in the future.\n",
      "\t“Belief in pandemic conspiracy theories appears to be an obstacle to minimizing the spread of COVID-19,” said Dan Romer, research director at the University of Pennsylvania’s Annenberg Public Policy Center in a statement.\n",
      "\t\"To control the pandemic we need high rates of mask-wearing, physical distancing, and hand-washing now - and of vaccination when a safe and effective vaccine is available.\"\n",
      "\tResearchers found the most common COVID-19-related conspiracies had to do with three main issues: the perceived threat of the pandemic, taking preventive actions (such as mask wearing) and the safety of vaccines.\n",
      "\tBased on a survey of 840 U.S. adults, researchers found that 28 per cent of survey participants reported believing in March that the Chinese government created the coronavirus as a bioweapon. By July the number of people who believed that conspiracy theory increased to 37 per cent. The study also found that nearly one in seven participants believed that the pharmaceuticals industry created the virus to increase the sale of drugs and vaccines.\n",
      "\tIn a White House briefing on April 30, U.S. President Donald Trump promoted the idea that COVID-19 accidentally escaped from a lab in Wuhan, China. Experts have said there is no evidence to support this claim and Chinese officials have vehemently rebuked the allegation.\n",
      "\tResearchers say they were able to predict the use of face masks among participants based on political ideology and “conservative media reliance,” however when it came to vaccinations there was a wide range of responses, indicating that vaccines are more of a bipartisan concern.\n",
      "\tBelievers of COVID-19 conspiracies were also more likely to have doubts about the safety of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine.\n",
      "\t\"Conspiracy theories are difficult to displace because they provide explanations for events that are not fully understood, such as the current pandemic, play on people's distrust of government and other powerful actors, and involve accusations that cannot be easily fact-checked,\" co-researcher Kathleen Hall Jamieson said in a statement.\n",
      "\tThe study suggests that those who did not believe in the conspiracies were 1.5 times more likely to wear a face mask every day outside of the home when in contact with others compared to those who most strongly believed in the conspiracies.\n",
      "\tResearchers say that counteracting the effects of conspiracy beliefs will require persistent public health campaigns and straightforward messaging particularly on platforms where COVID-related conspiracies have flourished. \n",

      "CONTENT : TORONTO -- \n",
      "\tA new study from researchers at McGill University is looking into the link between holidays and nut allergies in children.\n",
      "\tResearchers evaluated the average daily cases of nut anaphylaxis in children during six holidays and compared them to all the other days of the year. Their findings were published today in the Canadian Medical Association Journal.\n",
      "\tThe study found that bouts of anaphylaxis brought on by peanut allergies increased by 85 per cent on Halloween and 60 per cent on Easter, compared to the rest of the year. Cases of child anaphylaxis from unknown nuts accounted for a 70-per-cent increase around the same period. However, the researchers did not find the same pattern when it comes to other holidays.\n",
      "\t“We didn’t see an increase in anaphylaxis at Christmas, Diwali, Chinese New Year, or Eid al-Adha,” lead researcher Dr. Moshe Ben-Shoshan said in a press release. “This may be due to the fact that on Halloween and Easter, children often receive candies from people who may be unaware of those children’s allergies. Christmas and other holidays may involve more intimate celebrations with family members and close friends who are more vigilant regarding allergen exposure.”\n",
      "\tFor the study, researchers analyzed data from more than 1,300 patients who visited pediatric emergency departments in four Canadian provinces between 2011 and 2020: Quebec, Ontario, Newfoundland and Labrador, and British Columbia.\n",
      "\t“Identifying those times of the year associated with an increased risk of anaphylaxis can help to intensify vigilance around food allergies and inform the timing of public awareness campaigns to prevent allergic reactions,” Ben-Shoshan said.\n",
      "\tPeanut allergies are one of the most common food allergies, and are considered a priority food allergen by Health Canada. Ben-Shoshan suggests lax food labelling regulations may also be a factor regarding the increase in cases. When sold individually, prepackaged “one-bite” snacks and candies are exempt from food labelling regulations that require common allergens to be listed on the label.\n",
      "\t“At Halloween, one-bite treats are often packaged together in a larger bag, and although the outer bag must label ingredients and allergens, most people empty the candies into a bowl and hand them out individually, so there’s no allergen information there,” Dr. Ben-Shoshan notes.\n",
      "\tResearchers also found that the holiday period particularly affected older children. “The incidence of anaphylaxis was higher during Halloween and Easter for children six years of age and older, compared to younger children,” says co-researcher Mélanie Leung. “We suspect this is likely due to decreased parental supervision of older children.”\n",
      "\tShe added, “The big takeaway from this study is that educational tools are needed to increase vigilance toward children who have food allergies and that new strategies and awareness campaigns are needed to highlight the risk of anaphylaxis during holiday periods.”\n",

      "\tA judge has approved a request from a group of U.S. WeChat users to delay looming federal government restrictions that could effectively make the popular app nearly impossible to use.\n",
      "\tIn a ruling dated Saturday, Magistrate Judge Laurel Beeler in California said the government's actions would affect users' First Amendment rights, as an effective ban on the app would remove their platform for communication.\n",
      "\tWeChat is a messaging-focused app popular with many Chinese-speaking Americans that serves as a lifeline to friends, family, customers and business contacts in China. It's owned by Chinese tech giant Tencent.\n",
      "\tThe group of WeChat users requested an injunction after the U.S. Commerce Department said Friday it would bar WeChat from U.S. app stores and keep it from accessing essential internet services in the country beginning Sunday at 11:59 p.m.\n",
      "\tEarly on Monday, WeChat was still available for download at Apple and Android app stores.\n",
      "\tThe Trump administration has targeted WeChat and another Chinese-owned app, TikTok, for national security and data privacy concerns, in the latest flashpoint amid rising tensions between Washington and Beijing. The administration contends that the data of U.S. users collected by the two apps could be shared with the Chinese government.\n",
      "\tOn Saturday, President Donald Trump said he supported a proposed deal that would have TikTok partner with Oracle and WalMart to form a U.S. company. There is still a chance that TikTok could be banned in the U.S. as of Nov. 12 if the deal isn't completed, under the restrictions put in place by the Commerce Department.\n",
      "\tHowever, a restriction to bar TikTok from app stores in the U.S., similar to what WeChat faced, was pushed back a week to Sept. 27 after Trump backed the latest TikTok deal.\n",
      "\tOn Sunday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told Fox News that the government will ensure that under the TikTok-Oracle-WalMart deal, no American's data would end up in the possession of the Chinese government. Trump reiterated on a TV show on Monday that he could still withdraw his approval if the deal didn't satisfy his concerns about security and who controls TikTok, which is currently owned by Chinese company ByteDance.\n",
      "\t\"There can be zero security risks,\" he told \"Fox & Friends.\"\n",
      "\tIn the WeChat case, the users argued that the moves targeting the all-in-one app with instant-messaging, social media and other communication tools would restrict free speech.\n",
      "\tIn her ruling, Beeler found that a WeChat ban \"eliminates all meaningful access to communication in the plaintiffs' community,\" and that an injunction would be in the public's interest. Furthermore, specific evidence about WeChat posing a national security threat was also \"modest,\" she wrote.\n",
      "\tThe U.S. government earlier argued that it would not be restricting free speech because WeChat users still \"are free to speak on alternative platforms that do not pose a national security threat.\"\n",
      "\tKerri Kupec, a spokesperson for the Department of Justice, said the department was reviewing the judge's order.\n",
      "\tThe dispute over WeChat and TikTok is the latest attempt by the Trump administration to counter the influence of China. Since taking office in 2017, Trump has waged a trade war with China, blocked mergers involving Chinese companies and stifled the business of Chinese firms like Huawei, a maker of phones and telecom equipment.\n",

      "\tAt the \"Genghis Security Academy\", which bills itself as China's only dedicated bodyguard school, students learn that the threats to the country's newly-rich in the tech age are more likely to emerge from a hacker than a gunman.\n",
      "\tEach day students in matching black business suits toil from dawn until midnight at the school in the eastern city of Tianjin, where digital defences are given equal pegging to the traditional close-protection skillset of combat, weapons training and high-speed driving.\n",
      "\tAround a thousand graduate each year, hoping to land jobs as guards to China's burgeoning ranks of rich and famous, positions which can be worth up to US$70,000 -- several times more than an annual office wage.\n",
      "\tBut the school says it can't meet demand as China's rapid growth mints millionaires -- 4.4 million according to a Credit Suisse 2019 report, more than in the U.S.\n",
      "\tThe course fees are up to $3,000 a student; and while they had to cancel training between February and June because of the coronavirus pandemic, it has not dampened demand.\n",
      "\tOnly the best make the cut, says founder Chen Yongqing, insisting his disciplinarian standards are stricter than in the army.\n",
      "\t\"I'm quick-tempered and very demanding,\" the army veteran from China's northern Inner Mongolia region told AFP.\n",
      "\t\"Only by being strict can we cultivate every good sword. If you don't forge it well, it will break itself.\"\n",
      "\tAbout half of the students are ex-military, Chen says.\n",
      "\tThey train in rows in a large, shabby sports hall, holding blue plastic guns ahead of them with a steady stare -- before practising hustling their clients safely into a black Audi with smashed windows.\n",
      "\tOther sessions are held in a classroom or gym, where they box in matching red T-shirts.\n",
      "\tMobile phones are confiscated throughout, while meals are taken in silence in a large dining hall presided over by pictures of acclaimed graduates, who have protected everyone from China's second richest man Jack Ma to visiting French presidents.\n",
      "\t\"We have been defining the standard of Chinese bodyguards,\" instructor Ji Pengfei told AFP.\n",
      "\tIn one class, students in pairs work through a scenario protecting a \"client\" from an intruder.\n",
      "\t\"Danger!\" shouts Ji, prompting the guard to quickly throw their \"boss\" behind them and pull out a gun in the same move.\n",
      "\tThose who fail to do it in two seconds are assigned 50 push-ups.\n",
      "\tThe guns at the Tianjin school are fake -- China outlaws possession of firearms. For live firearms training, students are taken to Laos in Southeast Asia.\n",
      "\tBut in a highly surveilled country with a low rate of street crime, the modern minder needs an up-to-date skillset, against state monitoring or professional hackers.\n",
      "\t\"Chinese bosses don't need you to fight,\" Chen tells his students of a client base which includes the country's biggest real estate and tech firms.\n",
      "\tRepelling hacks on mobile phones, network security, spotting eavesdroppers and wiping data are all required tools in the bodyguard's armoury.\n",
      "\t\"What would you do if the boss wants to destroy a video file immediately?\" Chen asks a class.\n",
      "\tEven so, old-school threats still exist in China -- earlier this year billionaire He Xiangjian, founder of Midea and one of the country's richest men, was kidnapped at his home.\n",
      "\tAccording to Chinese media, He's son escaped by jumping into a river and was able to call the police, who said they arrested five suspects at the scene.\n",
      "\tStudent Zhu Peipei, a 33-year-old army veteran from northern Shanxi province, hopes becoming a bodyguard could offset his lack of professional skills or academic qualifications.\n",
      "\t\"And of course, it's cool,\" he added.\n",
      "\tBut the alumni of the Genghis Academy also provide humdrum services, like accompanying children of the rich and famous to school -- for a fee of 180,000 yuan ($26,000) a year.\n",
      "\tThat in itself is far more than the base salary in private companies of around 53,000 yuan.\n",
      "\tStudents must also navigate the quirks of their wealthy clients, says trainer Ji.\n",
      "\tSome only trust bodyguards whose Chinese zodiac sign matches theirs, he explains -- while one, from a Fortune 500 company, only wanted to hire from his hometown.\n",
      "\tAnother demanded a prospective bodyguard tell him what books he liked to read -- he was hired after saying he liked military novels.\n",
      "\tThe best can command as much as 500,000 yuan a year inside China, but some set their sights on a posting overseas, potentially working with foreign clients.\n",
      "\t\"I want to work in the Philippines or Myanmar,\" one student said, requesting anonymity.\n",
      "\t\"Then I can carry a gun... it will be more challenging and I can earn more.\"\n",

      "CONTENT : NEW YORK -- \n",
      "\tU.S. President Donald Trump said Saturday he's given his \"blessing\" to a proposed deal that would see the popular video-sharing app TikTok partner with Oracle and Walmart and form a U.S. company.\n",
      "\tTrump has targeted Chinese-owned TikTok for national security and data privacy concerns in the latest flashpoint in the rising tensions between Washington and Beijing. The president's support for a deal comes just a day after the Commerce Department announced restrictions that if put in place could eventually make it nearly impossible for TikTok's legions of younger fans to use the app.\n",
      "\tTrump said if completed the deal would create a new company likely to be based in Texas.\n",
      "\t\"I have given the deal my blessing,\" he said. \"If they get it done, that's great. If they don't, that's OK too.\"\n",
      "\tTrump said the new company will be hiring at least 25,000 people and making a $5 billion contribution to a fund dedicated to education for Americans. \"That's their contribution that I've been asking for,\" he said.\n",
      "\tTikTok said Oracle and Walmart could acquire up to a cumulative 20% stake in the new company in a financing round to be held before an initial public offering of stock, which Walmart said could happen within the next year. Oracle's stake would be 12.5%, and Walmart's would be 7.5%, the companies said in separate statements.\n",
      "\tThe deal will make Oracle responsible for hosting all TikTok's U.S. user data and securing computer systems to ensure U.S. national security requirements are satisfied. Walmart said it will provide its ecommerce, fulfilment, payments and other services to the new company.\n",
      "\t\"We are pleased that the proposal by TikTok, Oracle, and Walmart will resolve the security concerns of the U.S. administration and settle questions around TikTok's future in the U.S.,\" TikTok said in a statement.\n",
      "\tTrump has been demanding that the U.S. operations of TikTok be sold to a U.S. company or else be shut down. He's also been targeting WeChat, another Chinese-owned app.\n",
      "\tThe administration contends that the user data collected by the two apps could be shared with the Chinese government. On Saturday, Trump said the U.S.-based TikTok \"will have nothing to do with China.\" TikTok says it has 100 million U.S. users.\n",
      "\tOn Friday, the U.S. Commerce Department said it would bar TikTok from U.S. app stores as of late Sunday. Further restrictions that would prevent TikTok from accessing essential internet services in the country would go into effect on Nov. 12. Commerce said Saturday that it will delay the barring of TikTok from U.S. app stores until Sept. 27 at 11:59 p.m.\n",
      "\tCommerce is imposing similar restrictions on WeChat, although all of the restrictions on that app are set to go into effect Sunday night at 11:59 p.m.\n",
      "\tEarlier Saturday, WeChat users asked a U.S. judge to block the government's actions, saying they would restrict free speech. WeChat is an all-in-one app with instant-messaging, social media and other communication tools. The U.S. government argued that it is not restricting free speech because WeChat users still \"are free to speak on alternative platforms that do not pose a national security threat.\"\n",
      "\tU.S. Magistrate Judge Laurel Beeler asked lawyers for the government and WeChat users whether the prohibitions would cripple WeChat as soon as the clock ticked from Sunday night into Monday morning without a resolution. An attorney for the government said they would likely lead to a \"degradation\" of WeChat over time.\n",
      "\tJudge Beeler did not rule immediately on the motion.\n",
      "\tWeChat has millions of U.S. users who rely on the app to stay in touch and conduct business with people and companies in China and around the world. In court filings, the founder of the Mental Health Association for Chinese Communities, who is a U.S. citizen in California, said that the group's primary tool to reach out and provide services to Chinese Americans is WeChat.\n",
      "\t\"Since many of the Chinese community members we serve are not fluent in English, WeChat is the only online tool that they rely on,\" Elaine Peng said.\n",
      "\tThe Trump administration's aggressive tactics are part of its latest attempt to counter the influence of China, a rising economic superpower. Since taking office in 2017, Trump has waged a trade war with China, blocked mergers involving Chinese companies and stifled the business of Chinese firms like Huawei, a maker of phones and telecom equipment.\n",
      "\tChina-backed hackers, meanwhile, have been blamed for data breaches of U.S. federal databases and the credit agency Equifax, and the Chinese government strictly limits what U.S. tech companies can do in China.\n",
      "\tChina's ministry of commerce condemned the U.S. moves and urged it to stop what it called bullying behaviour. It also said China may take \"necessary measures\" to protect Chinese companies.\n",
      "\tThe U.S. Treasury Department said Saturday that TikTok's deal still needs to close with Oracle and Walmart, and it also needs documentation and conditions to be approved by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States.\n",
      "\tThat, of course, also leaves the potential for more roller coasters of emotion for TikTok users, such as Haley Hoffman Smith, a 24-year-old who moved to Manhattan this year to pursue her dream of becoming a talk-show host. She said she had just hit 100,000 followers on TikTok and was crushed on Friday to hear it may be headed for a shutdown.\n",
      "\t\"TikTok is an inextricable part of my dream chasing story,\" she said, \"and to lose it forever would not only be an inconvenient setback, but an absolute heartbreak.\"\n",

      "CONTENT : WASHINGTON -- \n",
      "\tAdam Schiff was in the audience at the 2018 Aspen Security Forum when a Microsoft executive mentioned an attempted hacking of three politicians up for reelection. It was the first that Schiff, then the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, had ever heard of it.\n",
      "\tSchiff said he thought it was \"odd\" that Congress hadn't been briefed. He got in touch with high-ranking officials in the intelligence agencies, and they didn't know about it, either. It turned out that Russian hackers had unsuccessfully tried to infiltrate the Senate computer network of then-Sen. Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., and other unidentified candidates.\n",
      "\tTwo years later, Schiff says that breakdown is still emblematic of the disjointed effort among government agencies, Congress and private companies as they try to identify and address foreign election interference. But this year, with President Donald Trump adamant that Russia is not interfering and his administration often trying to block what Congress learns about election threats, it's those private companies that often are being called upon to fill the breach.\n",
      "\tLawmakers welcome the help from the private sector and say the companies have become increasingly forthcoming, but it's a haphazard way to get information. It allows the companies to control much of what the public knows, and some are more co-operative than others.\n",
      "\t\"If a company wants to publicize it, that's great,\" says Virginia Sen. Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee. \"But what happens when they don't want to bring it to the attention of the government?\"\n",
      "\tThat's what happened in 2016, when Russia spread disinformation through social media, including Facebook, Twitter and YouTube. Those companies were slow to recognize the problem and they initially balked at government requests for more information. But after Congress pushed them publicly, they gradually became more co-operative.\n",
      "\tNow, Facebook and Twitter give Congress regular briefings to the intelligence committees, issue frequent reports about malicious activity and are part of a group that regularly meets with law enforcement and intelligence officials in the administration.\n",
      "\tMicrosoft, which is part of that group, announced last week that Russian hackers had tried to breach computers at more than 200 organizations, including political campaigns and their consultants. Most of the hacking attempts by Russian, Chinese and Iranian agents were halted by Microsoft security software and the targets notified. But the company would not say which candidates or entities may have been breached.\n",
      "\tLawmakers say the private sector can only do so much.\n",
      "\t\"It's certainly important that the social media companies participate and co-operate, which they have not always done in the past, but that does not in any way replace the analysis that is done by the intelligence community, and I believe that analysis should be shared with Congress,\" says Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee.\n",
      "\tThat relationship between intelligence agencies and Congress has grown strained since Trump took office. He has has doubted the agencies' conclusions about Russian interference in 2016 and he fired, demoted and criticized officials who shared information he didn't like.\n",
      "\tThe current director of national intelligence, John Ratcliffe, a close Trump ally, tried to end most in-person election security briefings -- a decision he later reversed after criticism from lawmakers from both parties. But Ratcliffe maintains that his office will not provide \"all member\" briefings for all lawmakers, citing what he says were leaks from some of those meetings this year.\n",
      "\tLawmakers say that in restricting what's given to Congress, the administration is effectively restricting what it tells the public about election security and misinformation. That threatens to sow confusion, just as foreign adversaries such as Russia are hoping for.\n",
      "\tSchiff, now chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, has pressured the companies to act more quickly, including taking down misinformation before it goes viral, not after. He has particular concerns about Google, which owns YouTube, and says it has been less transparent than others. Schiff and other lawmakers have stepped up concerns about doctored videos and foreign-owned news outlets spreading fake news on the video platform.\n",
      "\tAt a hearing with tech companies in June, Schiff pressed Google, saying that it \"has essentially adopted a strategy of keeping its head down and avoiding attention to its platform while others draw heat.\"\n",
      "\tRichard Salgado, Google's director for law enforcement and information security, told Schiff: \"I certainly hope that is not the perception. If it is, it is a misperception, Mr. Chairman.\"\n",
      "\tGoogle has made some disclosures, including recently revealing a Chinese effort to target Trump campaign staffers and an Iranian group's attempt to target the Biden campaign. But the company gave little detail on the attacks, including when they took place or how many were targeted.\n",
      "\tStill, the companies have stepped up in many cases.\n",
      "\tFacebook and Microsoft have been making disclosures to the public while also working behind the scenes with the federal government and the intelligence committees. Facebook issues a monthly release on foreign and domestic election activity, and Microsoft has publicly disclosed more than a dozen instances of threat activity since Schiff was caught unaware at the Aspen event in 2018.\n",
      "\tThe executive who revealed the Russian activity at that event, Microsoft's Tom Burt, says the company has learned to be more proactive with the federal government. He says the attempted hackings were not something he had planned to announce at the security forum, but he answered honestly when asked a question by the moderator. Today, Burt says the company gives federal and congressional authorities a heads-up when they have announcements about election interference.\n",
      "\tForeign attackers \"are persistent, they are skilled, they are super well-resourced, and they are going to continue to try and interfere with the electoral process and try to sow distrust with the American people,\" Burt said.\n",
      "\tAs lawmakers pursue other channels of information, there are still places where the public sector cannot help. Florida Rep. Stephanie Murphy, a Democrat, has been fighting for more than a year to have the administration publicly identify the two Florida counties where Russian hackers gained access to voter databases before the 2016 election.\n",
      "\t\"The only way you can fight that disinformation is with transparency, and the U.S. government has to be transparent about the attacks on our democracy by providing the information,\" Murphy said. \"I think maybe companies are accustomed to disclosing when they have had breaches, and that is why you are seeing corporate America leading.\"\n",

      "\tWeChat reached 10,000 installs on Friday, up 150% from the previous day. That's the most downloads the app has seen in a day since October 2019, according to Sensor Tower.\n",
      "\tWeChat's rank among all free iPhone apps in the U.S. climbed to number 100 as of noon on Friday, up from number 1,385 in the early morning, Sensor Tower data showed. The firm said this is the first time WeChat has ranked in the top 500 so far this year. Many people rely on WeChat as the main way of keeping in touch with family and friends in China.\n",
      "\tAnyone who has already downloaded TikTok or WeChat will still be able to use the apps -- if they're already on their phone. But at midnight between Sunday and Monday, both apps are likely to vanish from U.S. app stores, including those operated by Apple and Google.\n",
      "\tHowever, even if you downloaded the app on your phone prior to the deadline, you won't be able to receive security patches or other updates, which could cause outages or glitches within the app in the future.\n",
      "\tFor months, the Trump administration has claimed that TikTok is a risk to national security because of its Chinese ownership. The administration has alleged its parent company ByteDance could be required to hand over TikTok's user data to the Chinese government, compromising the safety and privacy of U.S. users. TikTok has repeatedly said that it stores data outside of China and that it would refuse any request by Beijing for data about U.S. users.\n",
      "\tIn a statement Friday, TikTok said that it disagreed with and was disappointed by the Trump administration's announcement. \"Our community of 100 million U.S. users love TikTok because it's a home for entertainment, self-expression, and connection,\" the company said, \"and we're committed to protecting their privacy and safety as we continue working to bring joy to families and meaningful careers to those who create on our platform.\"\n",
      "\tTencent, which owns WeChat, called the restrictions outlined by the Commerce Department \"unfortunate.\"\n",
      "\t\"Following the initial executive order on August 6 we have engaged in extensive discussions with the US government, and have put forward a comprehensive proposal to address its concerns,\" Tencent said in a statement Friday. \"...(G)iven our desire to provide ongoing services to our users in the U.S. -- for whom WeChat is an important communication tool -- we will continue to discuss with the government and other stakeholders in the U.S. ways to achieve a long-term solution.\"\n",

      "CONTENT : WASHINGTON -- \n",
      "\tThe U.S. Commerce Department said Friday it will ban Chinese-owned TikTok and WeChat from U.S. app stores on Sunday and will bar the apps from accessing essential internet services in the U.S. - a move that could effectively wreck the operation of both Chinese services for U.S. users.\n",
      "\tTikTok won't face the most drastic sanctions until after the Nov. 3 election, but WeChat users could feel the effects as early as Sunday.\n",
      "\tThe order, which cited national security and data privacy concerns, follows weeks of dealmaking over the video-sharing service TikTok. President Donald Trump has pressured the app's Chinese owner to sell TikTok's U.S. operations to a domestic company to satisfy U.S. concerns over TikTok's data collection and related issues.\n",
      "\tCalifornia tech giant Oracle recently struck a deal with TikTok along those lines, although details remain foggy and the administration is still reviewing it. Trump said Friday said he was open to a deal, noting that “we have some great options and maybe we can keep a lot of people happy,” suggesting that even Microsoft, which said its TikTok bid had been rejected, might continue to be involved, as well as Oracle and Walmart.\n",
      "\tTrump noted that TikTok was “very, very popular,” said “we have to have the total security from China,” and added that “we can do a combination of both.”\n",
      "\tThe new order puts pressure on TikTok's owner, ByteDance, to make further concessions, said James Lewis of the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Trump had said this week that he does not like the idea of ByteDance keeping majority control of TikTok.\n",
      "\tTikTok expressed “disappointment” over the move and said it would continue to challenge President Donald Trump's “unjust executive order.” The Commerce Department is enacting an order announced by President Donald Trump in August. TikTok sued to stop that ban.\n",
      "\tWeChat owner Tencent said in an emailed statement that it will continue to discuss ways to address concerns with the government and look for long-term solutions.\n",
      "\tGoogle and Apple, the owners of the major mobile app stores, did not immediately reply to questions. Oracle also did not reply.\n",
      "\t“At the President's direction, we have taken significant action to combat China's malicious collection of American citizens' personal data, while promoting our national values, democratic rules-based norms, and aggressive enforcement of U.S. laws and regulations,” Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said in a prepared statement.\n",
      "\tChina's ministry of commerce condemned the ban, and urged the U.S. to stop what it called bullying behaviour and wrongdoing. It said China would “take necessary measures to resolutely safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese companies.”\n",
      "\tThe action is the Trump administration's latest attempt to counter the influence of China, a rising economic superpower. Since taking office in 2017, Trump has waged a trade war with China, blocked mergers involving Chinese companies and stifled the business of Chinese firms like Huawei, a maker of phones and telecom equipment.\n",
      "\tChina-backed hackers, meanwhile, have been blamed for data breaches of U.S. federal databases and the credit agency Equifax, and the Chinese government strictly limits what U.S. tech companies can do in China.\n",
      "\tThe order requires WeChat, which has millions of U.S. users who rely on the app to stay in touch and conduct business with people and companies in China, to end payments for business transactions through its service as of Sunday and prohibits it from obtaining vital technical services from vendors. The Justice Department said in a filing that it would not target users with criminal or civil penalties for messaging on the app.\n",
      "\tWeChat users have sued to stop the ban, and a federal judge in California on Friday set an emergency hearing for Saturday at 1:30 p.m. Pacific time.\n",
      "\tSimilar technical limitations for TikTok don't go into effect until Nov. 12, shortly after the U.S. election. Ross said early Friday on Fox Business Network that access to that app may be possible if certain safeguards are put into place. TikTok says it has 100 million U.S. users and 700 million globally.\n",
      "\tNicholas Weaver, a computer science lecturer at UC Berkeley, said the actions taking effect Sunday are short-sighted and suggest that “the U.S. is not to be trusted and not a friendly place for business.” Users, meanwhile, face a security “nightmare” because they won't be able to get app updates that fix bugs and security vulnerabilities, he said.\n",
      "\tThe technical measures are “enforceable, the question is whether they are legal,” said the Center for Strategic and International Studies' Lewis, likening them to a U.S. version of China's “Great Firewall,” which censors its domestic internet. He said there could be a First Amendment challenge.\n",
      "\tLike most social networks, TikTok collects user data and moderates users' posts. It grabs users' locations and messages and tracks what they watch to figure out how best to target ads to them.\n",
      "\tSimilar concerns apply to U.S.-based social networks such as Facebook and Twitter, but Chinese ownership adds an extra wrinkle because the Chinese government could demand co-operation from Chinese companies. The administration, however, has provided no specific evidence that TikTok has made U.S. users' data available to the Chinese government. Some cybersecurity experts question whether the administration's efforts are more political than rooted in legitimate concerns about Chinese threats to data security.\n",
      "\t“If there are direct national security threats, that information should be shared with the U.S. population,” said David Kennedy, CEO of cybersecurity firm TrustedSec, before the Commerce Department's regulations were announced. “We're not taking about what needs to happen policy-wise, we're trying to hack this together to hurt China.”\n",
      "\tTikTok says it does not store U.S. user data in China and that it would not give user data to the government, and does not censor videos per dictates from China.\n",

      "\tChina's military sent 18 planes including fighter jets over the Taiwan Strait in an unusually large show of force Friday as a U.S. envoy held a day of closed-door meetings on the self-governing island claimed by China.\n",
      "\tUnder Secretary of State Keith Krach, who handles the economic growth, energy and the environment portfolio, held talks with Taiwan's minister of economic affairs and vice-premier. He also met with business leaders over lunch and was to dine with President Tsai Ing-wen later Friday.\n",
      "\tIn response to Krach's visit, the Eastern Theater Command of the Chinese People's Liberation Army held combat exercises near the Taiwan Strait, in at least the second round of war games this month aimed at intimidating supporters of the island's independent identity.\n",
      "\tTaiwan's defence ministry said two bombers and 16 fighter jets from China crossed into Taiwan's air defence identification zone. It said it scrambled jets in response and monitored the movements of the Chinese planes.\n",
      "\tChinese defence ministry spokesperson Ren Guoqiang called the drills a \"legitimate and necessary action taken in response to the current situation across the Taiwan Straits to safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity.\"\n",
      "\t\"Recently, the U.S. and (Taiwan's ruling) Democratic Progressive Party authorities have stepped up their collusion and frequently stir up troubles,\" Ren told reporters Friday morning. \"Whether it is using Taiwan to contain China or relying on foreign powers to threaten others, it is wishful thinking and is destined to be a dead end.\"\n",
      "\tIn a brief message on its microblog, the Eastern Theater Command said the exercises involved naval and air force units in the Taiwan Strait aimed at gauging their ability to carry out joint operations.\n",
      "\tChina's Ministry of Foreign Affairs also defended the move. Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said China has the \"firm will, full confidence and sufficient ability to thwart all external interference and separatist actions by Taiwan independence forces.\"\n",
      "\tBeijing views Taiwan as part of its own territory and strongly opposes any type of formal interaction between other countries and the self-ruled island democracy.\n",
      "\tKrach's trip follows a visit in August by U.S. Health Secretary Alex Azar, the highest-level U.S. Cabinet official to visit since the U.S. switched formal relations from Taiwan to China in 1979.\n",
      "\tIt is one of a series of moves by the Trump administration to strengthen relations with Taiwan, including stepped-up arms sales and support for the island's participation in international forums.\n",
      "\tBefore Krach's arrival, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Kelly Craft, had lunch Wednesday with Taiwan's top official in New York, in a meeting she called historic.\n",
      "\tOn Saturday, the last day of his visit, Krach will also attend a memorial service for former President Lee Teng-hui, who led the island's transition to democracy and died at age 97 in July.\n",
      "\tAnalysts say the Chinese military response is a clear message to the U.S. to stop what it is doing, since the Chinese side took similar actions when the U.S. health secretary visited in August.\n",
      "\t\"I think the Chinese are using this tool to try and stop the kind-of diplomatic relationship between the U.S. and Taiwan. It's very clear from them,\" said Alfred Wu, associate professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy at the National University of Singapore.\n",
      "\tTensions between Washington and Beijing have already reached high levels as the governments spar over the coronavirus pandemic, trade, technology, Hong Kong and the South China Sea.\n",
      "\tThe frequency of Chinese exercises near Taiwan recalls the last major crisis between them in 1995-96, when China fired missiles near the island and held war games in a bid to intimidate voters in Taiwan's first direct presidential election. Those actions were largely seen to have backfired.\n",
      "\tTaiwan said Chinese warplanes entered its airspace over two days last week during large-scale war games that it called a \"serious provocation to Taiwan and a grave threat to regional peace and stability.\"\n",
      "\tSuch actions by the Chinese military threaten the entire region, it said, calling on the international community to respond.\n",
      "\tChina has increasingly relied on military threats and diplomatic isolation to pressure Taiwan. That follows the apparent failure of its efforts to win over the island's 23 million people to the prospect of political unification under the \"one country, two systems\" framework used in Hong Kong, with a large majority of Taiwanese favouring maintaining the status quo of de facto independence.\n",
      "\tDespite of the frequency of the exercises, analysts said it does not mean imminent war.\n",
      "\t\"The signal from Beijing is very, very clear, but does that mean a prelude to war? No, far from it,\" said Chong-Pin Lin, a former deputy defence minister in Taiwan.\n",
      "\tChina cut contacts with Taiwan's government following Tsai's 2016 election. She was reelected by a large margin this year and her Democratic Progressive Party maintained its majority in the legislature.\n",
      "\tThis story has been corrected to show that the flyover took place Friday, not Monday.\n",

      "\tNorth American stock markets dipped to close a relatively flat week on signs of a slowing U.S. recovery and weakness in the American technology sector.\n",
      "\tMarkets started moved lower after the U.S. government announced it will ban Chinese-owned TikTok and WeChat from U.S. app stores on Sunday.\n",
      "\tThey partially recovered in afternoon trading, with U.S. markets ending down for a third-straight week.\n",
      "\t\"The negative sentiment that we've seen from the U.S. equity markets over the last couple of weeks has just continued to bleed over into this week,\" said Macan Nia, senior investment strategist at Manulife Investment Management.\n",
      "\tFriday was also unique because it was \"quadruple witching,\" a day that marks the quarterly expiration of U.S. stock options, stock index futures and index option contracts.\n",
      "\tVolumes in the option market over the past couple of weeks have been very high with some technology companies seeing more activity in options than in the underlining securities.\n",
      "\t\"That speaks to the wonkiness,\" Nia said in an interview.\n",
      "\tThe S&P/TSX composite index closed down 47.75 points to 16,198.97 after hitting an intraday high of 16,310.03.\n",
      "\tIn New York, the Dow Jones industrial average was down 244.56 points at 27,657.42. The S&P 500 index was down 37.54 points at 3,319.47, while the Nasdaq composite was down 116.99 points at 10,793.28.\n",
      "\tOverall, Nia attributed the different movements of equity markets to the fact that U.S. markets posted larger gains leading into September than did the TSX.\n",
      "\t\"So from a valuation perspective, when markets are weaker, generally those markets that have run-up the most typically pull back and the TSX did not run as hot as the Nasdaq, for example, or the S&P 500.\"\n",
      "\tThe U.S. technology sector continued to lose ground, with big names such as Apple, Alphabet and Amazon falling, as investors pocketed profits after a strong run that boosted valuations.\n",
      "\tIn Canada, the technology sector led the TSX, gaining nearly one percentage point as shares of Absolute Software Corp., Shopify Inc. and Blackberry Ltd. gained 7.1, four and three per cent respectively.\n",
      "\tAnxiety from the TikTok announcement was followed by some \"high frequency data\" out of the U.S. which showed that the rate of economic improvement over the past couple of months is beginning to temper down, said Nia.\n",
      "\tThe released data measured real-time hours worked, credit-card spending and community developments like library openings.\n",
      "\t\"So I think it's all of these things together that has generally created this risk-off environment today, which is just pigging-backing on the risk-off environment that we've seen over the past couple of weeks,\" he said.\n",
      "\tThe Canadian dollar traded for @75.84 cents US compared with 75.76 cents US on Thursday.\n",
      "\tEight of the 11 major sectors on the TSX were lower.\n",
      "\tEnergy was down 0.8 per cent with producers Crescent Point Energy Corp. down 2.6 per cent, Imperial Oil off 2.4 per cent and Husky Energy Inc. two per cent lower.\n",
      "\tThe November crude contract was up 10 cents at US$41.32 per barrel and up nearly 11 per cent for the week. The October natural gas contract was up 0.6 of a cent at nearly US$2.05 per mmBTU.\n",
      "\tThe December gold contract was up US$12.20 at US$1,962.10 an ounce and the December copper contract was up 4.5 cents at almost US$3.12 a pound.\n",

      "\tResearchers in China have observed a curious link in one of the more specific COVID-19 studies to come out of this pandemic: hospitalized COVID-19 patients were less likely to wear glasses than the average population.\n",
      "\tA new study, the results of which were published Wednesday in the journal JAMA Ophthalmology, found that there was a smaller proportion of glasses-wearers out of a sample of COVID-19 patients at a hospital in China, than the percentage of glasses-wearers in the general population.\n",
      "\t\"Wearing of eyeglasses is common among Chinese individuals of all ages,” the study stated. “However, since the outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan in December 2019, we observed that few patients with eyeglasses were admitted in the hospital ward.”\n",
      "\tResearchers looked at 276 COVID-19 patients admitted to Suizhou Zengdou Hospital between Jan. 27 and March 13, and found only 16 had myopia and thus generally wore glasses more than eight hours a day.\n",
      "\tMyopia is the official term for nearsightedness, which is one of the most common reasons that people wear glasses. Those who are nearsighted are able to see things close to them clearly, but see objects that are farther away as blurry.\n",
      "\tAccording to a previous 1985 study of the general population in the Hubei province of China, the average rate of myopia among students aged 7-22 years in that region was 31.5 per cent. Those same students would now be 42 to 57 years old, the study pointed out, “which is close to the median age of our patients with COVID-19.”\n",
      "\tBut this new study of COVID-19 patients found that only 5.8 per cent of those hospitalized with the virus wore glasses, a far lower percentage than 31.5 per cent.\n",
      "\tIt’s important to note that this is an observational study, not one looking for causation.\n",
      "\tThere’s no reason to believe that wearing glasses protects against COVID-19, or that being blessed with perfect vision also makes you more susceptible to COVID-19.\n",
      "\tThe researchers also acknowledged that the data from the previous 1985 study could have impacted the results because “the age, region, and educational level of the students in that survey had some differences compared with our study population.”\n",
      "\tThe results, the study suggested, may come down to human behaviour, not any inherent, virus-fighting sheen on the average pair of glasses.\n",
      "\tThe researchers hypothesized that wearing glasses might have prevented some spread of the virus due to the glasses discouraging “wearers from touching their eyes, thus avoiding transferring the virus from the hands to the eyes.”\n",
      "\tThey noted that previous research has shown that the enzyme that SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) uses as a receptor is in abundance on the surface of the eye.\n",
      "\t“Presently, many COVID-19 guidelines state the need to pay attention to preventing infections through the eyes, but most people only focus on wearing masks and home isolation, ignoring recommendations such as washing hands frequently and avoiding touching the eyes with the hands,” the study stated.\n",
      "\tSo while this new research doesn’t mean you need to go out and buy the widest pair of sunglasses possible, it might be a sign that you should be a little more careful about not touching your eyes after you readjust your mask. \n",

      "\tNew data from Statistics Canada is adding to growing calls for the federal government to address racial inequities experienced by various population groups in Canada during the course of the pandemic in its economic recovery plan.\n",
      "\tThe survey results released Thursday found that 28 per cent of Canadians surveyed reported they had experienced some form of discrimination since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n",
      "\tStatistics Canada surveyed 35,000 Canadians between Aug. 4 to 24 to better understand which groups have been negatively impacted as a result of systemic failures amid the health crisis.\n",
      "\tThe agency notes that the survey data is not based on random selection and that the findings should not be interpreted to represent the overall Canadian population.\n",
      "\tYoung participants aged 15 to 24 were twice as likely as seniors aged 65 and older to report that they had experienced discrimination over the course of the pandemic. Among youth, Statistics Canada found women were 45 per cent more likely than their male counterparts to reporting having experienced prejudice.\n",
      "\tBoth Indigenous men and women were more likely than their non-Indigenous participants to report experiences of discrimination, but the difference was again particularly large among women.\n",
      "\tAccording to the report, the experiences of discrimination also varied “across ethnocultural characteristics.”\n",
      "\tStatistics Canada found that Chinese, Korean, Southeast Asian and Black participants were more than twice as likely as white participants to report that they had experienced discrimination.\n",
      "\tThe agency said the results are consistent with the data from a previous crowdsourcing initiative, which found that Chinese, Korean and Southeast Asian participants perceived an increase in the frequency of race-based harassment or attacks since the beginning of the pandemic.\n",
      "\tThe new report also found that immigrants who arrived in Canada within the last 10 years were more likely than established immigrants and Canadian-born participants to report that they had experienced discrimination.\n",
      "\tGender-diverse participants who did not report their gender as exclusively female or male were almost three times more likely than males to report that they had experienced discrimination during the pandemic. LGBTQ and other sexual minority participants were also more likely to report experiencing discrimination.\n",
      "\tAdditionally, participants who identified themselves as having a disability were twice as likely as participants without a disability to report being discriminated against.\n",
      "\tAmong those who said that they experienced discrimination, the most commonly reported form was based on race or skin colour (34 per cent), followed by age (30 per cent), physical appearance (26 per cent) ethnicity and culture (25 per cent) and sex (22 per cent).\n",
      "\tAvvy Go, director of the Chinese and Southeast Asian Legal Clinic, says the new data amplifies equity concerns those who have experienced racism have had for years.\n",
      "\tGo told CTV's Your Morning on Thursday that the coronavirus pandemic has exposed racial inequities in multiple sectors across Canada including employment, health care, housing and education.\n",
      "\t\"Even before the pandemic, People of Colour, Indigenous people were earning less income, they were more likely to be employed in low wage jobs, and they have higher unemployment rates… There has also been significant increases for unemployment rate among Chinese and South Asian, more so than any other group,\" Go said.\n",
      "\t\"We know that this is a result of systemic racism and structural racism within the labour market.\"\n",
      "Colour of Poverty – Colour of Change (COP-COC) is a campaign that is currently pushing for political parties to acknowledge racial inequalities amid the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada's economic restart plan.\n",
      "\tThe campaign is calling for the federal government to address discrimination within its borders so the health crisis does not continue to impact racialized groups more so than other populations.\n",
      "\t\"By doing so, we will increase the opportunities for employment for the underrepresented groups, and that includes not just people of colour, but also women and people with disability as well,\" Go said.\n",
      "\tAs each group faces its own set of unique challenges and circumstances, Statistics Canada found that the most common forms of discrimination differed between groups.\n",
      "\tAmong Indigenous participants who faced bias over the course of the pandemic, the most common form was discrimination based on Indigenous identity while those belonging to a visible minority group reported forms related to race and ethnicity. Among Black participants 84 per cent reported that they had experienced discrimination related to race or skin colour.\n",
      "\tSimilar to how the forms of discrimination were mixed, where participants experienced prejudice also varied.\n",
      "\tStatistics Canada reported that about 4 in 10 participants (36 per cent) said that they had experienced discrimination in a store, bank or restaurant. One-third experienced it while using public areas such as parks and sidewalks, almost one-third experienced it online, and approximately 3 in 10 experienced it in the workplace or when applying for a job.\n",
      "\tHowever, not all groups experienced the same types of discrimination situations.\n",
      "\tAccording to the data, Black and South Asian participants reported more often incidents of discrimination that occurred in a store, bank or restaurant.\n",

      "\tA team of paleontologists have discovered what they believe is the world's oldest animal sperm, frozen in tree resin 100 million years ago inside a tiny crustacean in Myanmar.\n",
      "\tThe oldest known examples of fossilised animal sperm were previously a mere 17 million years old, according to the team of experts led by Wang He of the Chinese Academy of Science in Nanjing.\n",
      "\tThe sperms were found inside an ostracod -- a type of crustacean that has existed for 500 million years and can be found in many oceans today, they said in a paper published on Wednesday in the Royal Society's Proceedings journal.\n",
      "\tThey were found in the body of a female specimen, indicating that she must have been fertilised shortly before being trapped in amber, the experts said.\n",
      "\tThe individual sperms were described as \"giants\", measuring up to 4.6 times the size of the body of the male.\n",
      "\t\"This is equivalent to about 7.30 metres (24 feet) in a 1.70-metre human, so it requires a lot of energy to produce them,\" Renate Matzke-Karasz of the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, co-author of the study, told AFP.\n",
      "\tThe ostracod was also a new species that the scientists have named \"Myanmarcypris hui\".\n",
      "\tFossilised shells of ostracods are common but finding a specimen with \"soft parts\" is rare, the experts said.\n",
      "\tDuring the Cretaceous period around 145 to 66 million years ago, the ostracods in question probably lived in the coastal waters of present-day Myanmar where they became trapped in a blob of tree resin.\n",
      "\tThe specimen was handed over to researchers by a Chinese collector in 2017.\n",
      "\tThe tiny creatures are less than a millimetre long but the scientists made 3D reconstructions of them to observe them more closely, leading to what Wang described as \"one of those special Eureka moments in a researcher's life\".\n",
      "\tAs well as the sperm, the reconstructions also showed the distinctive muscular sperm pumps and penises (two of each) that male ostracods use to inseminate the females.\n",
      "\t\"This specimen allowed us to confirm our hypothesis that such giant sperm cells existed 100 million years ago,\" Matzke-Karasz said.\n",
      "\tUntil now, this theory had been based on the discovery in 2009 of large genital organs in the crustaceans, which suggested the existence of correspondingly large sperms.\n",
      "\tMost males in the animal world including humans produce tens of millions of tiny sperm cells, but ostracods are different -- for them, it's all about quality over quantity.\n",
      "\tThere are several conflicting theories about the evolutionary value of such giant sperms.\n",
      "\t\"For example, experiments have shown that in one group, a high degree of competition between males can lead to a longer sperm life, while in another group, a low degree of competition also led to a longer sperm life,\" said Matzke-Karasz.\n",
      "\tThe researcher believes the giant sperm are a sign of good health on the part of the males, a characteristic \"favoured\" by the females, whose genitals evolved to accommodate them in an example of \"co-evolution\".\n",
      "\t\"Given that many ostracods can reproduce parthenogenetically, without the need for males, sexual reproduction with giant sperm cells must have a clear advantage over asexual reproduction,\" Matzke-Karasz said.\n",
      "\t\"To show that using giant sperms in reproduction is not an extinction-doomed extravagance of evolution, but a serious long-term advantage for the survival of a species, we need to know when they first appeared.\"\n",
      "\tScientists have been researching the amber of Myanmar for decades, finding all kinds of frozen treasures including frogs, snakes and a feathered dinosaur tail.\n",

      "\tSeveral thousand people in northwest China have tested positive for a bacterial disease, authorities said on Tuesday, in an outbreak caused by a leak at a biopharmaceutical company last year.\n",
      "\tThe Health Commission of Lanzhou, the capital city of Gansu province, confirmed that 3,245 people had contracted the disease brucellosis, which is often caused by contact with livestock carrying the bacteria brucella.\n",
      "\tAnother 1,401 people have tested as preliminarily positive, though there have been no fatalities reported, the city's Health Commission said. In total, authorities have tested 21,847 people out of the city's 2.9 million population.\n",
      "\tThe disease, also known as Malta fever or Mediterranean fever, can cause symptoms including headaches, muscle pain, fever and fatigue. While these may subside, some symptoms can become chronic or never go away, like arthritis or swelling in certain organs, according to the United States' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n",
      "\tHuman-to-human transmission is extremely rare, according to the CDC. Instead, most people are infected by eating contaminated food or breathing in the bacteria -- which seems to be the case in Lanzhou.\n",
      "\tThis outbreak stemmed from a leak at the Zhongmu Lanzhou biological pharmaceutical factory, which occurred between late July to late August last year, according to the city's Health Commission. While producing Brucella vaccines for animal use, the factory used expired disinfectants and sanitizers -- meaning not all bacteria were eradicated in the waste gas.\n",
      "\tThis contaminated waste gas formed aerosols that contained the bacteria -- and leaked into the air, carried by wind down to the Lanzhou Veterinary Research Institute, where the outbreak first hit.\n",
      "\tPeople at the institute began reporting infections in November, and it quickly accelerated. By the end of December, at least 181 people at the institute had been infected with brucellosis, according to Chinese state-run news agency Xinhua.\n",
      "\tOther infected patients included students and faculty members of Lanzhou University; the outbreak even spread to Heilongjiang province, at the very northeastern tip of the country, where 13 positive cases had worked in the veterinarian institute in August, Xinhua reported at the time.\n",
      "\tIn the months after the outbreak, provincial and municipal officials launched an investigation into the leak at the factory, according to the Lanzhou Health Commission. By January, authorities had revoked vaccine production licenses for the plant, and withdrew product approval numbers for its two Brucellosis vaccines.\n",
      "\tA total of seven veterinary drug product approval numbers were also canceled in the factory.\n",
      "\tIn February, the factory issued a public apology, and said it had \"severely punished\" eight people who were determined as responsible for the incident. It added that it would cooperate with local authorities in the response and cleanup efforts, and contribute to a compensation program for those affected.\n",
      "\tThe Lanzhou Health Commission also announced in its report on Tuesday that 11 public hospitals would provide free and regular checkups for the infected patients. The report didn't offer additional details on the compensation for patients, except that it would be launched in batches starting October.\n",
      "\tBrucellosis had been much more common in China in the 1980s, though it has since declined with the emergence of vaccines and better disease prevention and control. Still, there have been a smattering of brucellosis outbreaks around the world in the past few decades; an outbreak in Bosnia infected about 1,000 people in 2008, prompting the culling of sheep and other infected livestock.\n",
      "\tIn the US, brucellosis has cost the federal government and livestock industry billions of dollars. About 60% of female bison at Yellowstone National Park carry the bacteria, according to national park authorities.\n",

      "\tThe remake of \"Mulan\" struck all the right chords to be a hit in the key Chinese market. Disney cast beloved actor Liu Yifei as Mulan and removed a dragon sidekick popular in the animated original to cater to Chinese tastes.\n",
      "\tStill, the movie drew decidedly mixed reviews after its coronavirus-delayed release in China last week, with thousands panning it online.\n",
      "\tThe movie was rated 4.9 out of 10 by more than 165,000 people on Douban, a leading website for film, book and music ratings. Negative comments and jokes about the film outnumbered positive reactions on social media.\n",
      "\t\"Mulan\" has earned an estimated 198 million yuan (US$28.8 million) since its opening last week, and was the second most watched movie in China as of Thursday, according to ticketing platform Maoyan. It scored a higher 7.5 out of 10 on Maoyan, but also with mixed reviews.\n",
      "\t\"Poor artistic level, misunderstanding of Chinese culture lead to the film's failure in China,\" the state-run Global Times newspaper tweeted.\n",
      "\tChinese critics, both at home and abroad, said they were disappointed with the film's inaccurate and stereotypical portrayals of Chinese history and the main character, infused with nationalist tropes.\n",
      "\tOthers were not as bothered.\n",
      "\t\"It's fine that different screenwriters make up different stories,\" Zhang Qin, a military veteran, said after watching the film in Beijing last week. \"They can play with imagination and it's a good thing.\"\n",
      "\tIT engineer Zhang Fan also had positive things to say about the film. \"What touched me is the humanity,\" he said.\n",
      "\tThe remake of Disney's popular 1998 animation is based on the ancient tale of Hua Mulan, a young woman who takes her father's place in the army by dressing as a man.\n",
      "\tThe animated version was a global hit but earned just $30 million in China, where viewers found the movie too Americanized, according to reports at the time.\n",
      "\tThe original tale, \"The Ballad of Mulan,\" has gone through multiple renditions. Themes such as filial piety and being loyal to the central government have remained as core tenets, which some find outdated and problematic.\n",
      "\t\"It's a very touchy subject in modern China because a lot of people find (filial piety) very constraining, including me,\" said Xiran Jay Zhao, the Chinese Canadian author of an upcoming book about the only female emperor in China. \"It's like a moral shackle for people.\"\n",
      "\tCritics also pointed out inaccurate details such as the use of a southern-style house when Mulan is likely from the north and a depiction of \"qi\" as a power that only boys should wield -- when in fact there is no such gender restriction. Some called the makeup and costumes ugly and inauthentic.\n",
      "\tZhao said the film comes off more like European fantasy than a Chinese story, and noted that the film's crew was mostly white, including the director, four screenwriters and costume designer.\n",
      "\t\"They didn't really get any Chinese people on the writing staff, and it really showed,\" she said.\n",
      "\tJeannette Ng, a Chinese fantasy writer based in the United Kingdom, said the film perpetuates a narrative of China's majority Han people that assimilates and excludes minorities including ethnic Mongolians, Tibetans and Uighurs.\n",
      "\t\"The mainland Chinese people aren't the mainland Chinese viewers from 20 years ago,\" she said of the lukewarm response. \"The culture has moved on.\"\n",
      "\tHer comments mirror the latest in a series of controversies that have hit the film outside mainland China.\n",
      "\tThe movie's final credits thank propaganda departments and a public security bureau in Xinjiang, where part of it was filmed.\n",
      "\tChina has come under widespread criticism for detaining Uighurs and other predominantly Muslim minorities in Xinjiang as part of a campaign to snuff out sometimes-violent struggle against Chinese rule.\n",
      "\tEarlier, a boycott movement was sparked after Liu, the actor who portrays Mulan, publicly supported Hong Kong police as they battled pro-democracy protesters last year.\n",
      "\tHong Kong resident Sarah Chan said she does not plan to see the film, which opened in her city on Thursday.\n",
      "\t\"The main actress ... supports Hong Kong police, so I don't want to watch it,\" Chan said. \"Furthermore, I think they changed the historical background of the story. It's not the same story anymore.\"\n",

      "\tU.S. President Donald Trump said he expects to get a report Thursday about Oracle's bid for the Chinese-owned video-sharing app TikTok and admitted there is no legal path to letting the U.S. Treasury get a cut of the deal -- a proposition experts had criticized as unprecedented and possibly illegal.\n",
      "\t\"I'm not prepared to sign off on anything. I have to see the deal,\" Trump told White House reporters Wednesday evening about Oracle's interest in TikTok.\n",
      "\tSome in the U.S. have raised concerns about the deal, fearing that ByteDance Ltd., the Chinese company that owns TikTok, would maintain access to information on the 100 million TikTok users in the United States.\n",
      "\t\"It has to be 100% as far as national security is concerned,\" Trump said.\n",
      "\tThe president previously said that he would ban TikTok if it wasn't sold to an American company. In an Aug. 6 order, Trump said TikTok \"reportedly censors content that the Chinese Communist Party deems politically sensitive,\" is potentially a source for disinformation campaigns and \"threatens to allow the Chinese Communist Party access to Americans' personal and proprietary information.\"\n",
      "\tTikTok maintains that it has not shared U.S. user data with the Chinese government and would not do so, says it does not censor videos at the request of Chinese authorities and notes that moderators for U.S. operations are led by a U.S. team.\n",
      "\tTrump said he was stunned to learn that the Treasury could not receive any payment in exchange for the U.S. signing off on the deal.\n",
      "\t\"Amazingly, I find that you're not allowed to do that,\" Trump said. \"If they're willing to make big payments to the government they're not allowed because ... there's no legal path to doing that. ... How foolish can we (the United States) be?\"\n",
      "\tTikTok, which says it has 100 million users in the U.S. and 700 million globally, is known for fun, goofy videos of dancing, lip-syncing, pranks and jokes. It's also home to more political material, some of which is critical of Trump.\n",
      "\tThe Oracle arrangement, according to a person familiar with the matter who isn't authorized to speak publicly, entrusts TikTok's U.S. user data to Oracle, which would oversee technical operations for TikTok in the U.S. Oracle won't develop code for the app, but will review it and updates to it.\n",
      "\tNot all Republicans are on board with the Oracle deal. Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri, a frequent critic of both China and the tech sector, called for the government to reject the Oracle partnership and instead pursue a full sale of TikTok in the U.S. or ban the app.\n",
      "\t\"An ongoing `partnership' that allows for anything other than the full emancipation of the TikTok software from potential Chinese Communist Party control is completely unacceptable, and flatly inconsistent with the President's Executive Order of Aug. 6,\" he wrote on Tuesday.\n",
      "\tA group of six other Republican senators led by Marco Rubio of Florida on Wednesday sent a letter to the president expressing reservations about the partnership agreement with Oracle, saying that it appears to have \"significant unresolved national security issues\" and that a deal \"must ensure that TikTok's U.S. operations, data and algorithms are entirely outside the control of ByteDance or any Chinese-state directed actors.\"\n",
      "\tA Trump executive order has set a Sept. 20 deadline, although it isn't clear what will happen on that day. TikTok has sued to stop the ban, which also affects a separately owned Chinese messaging app, WeChat, which is used by several million in the U.S.\n",

      "\tThe Justice Department has charged five Chinese citizens with hacks targeting more than 100 companies and institutions in the United States and abroad, including social media and video game companies as well as universities and telecommunications providers, officials said Wednesday.\n",
      "\tThe five defendants remain fugitives, but prosecutors say two Malaysian businessmen charged with conspiring with the alleged hackers to profit off the attacks on the billion-dollar video game industry were arrested in Malaysia this week and now face extradition proceedings.\n",
      "\tThe indictments are part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to call out cybercrimes by China. In July, prosecutors accused hackers of working with the Chinese government to target companies developing vaccines for the coronavirus and of stealing hundreds of millions of dollars worth of intellectual property and trade secrets from companies across the world.\n",
      "\tThough those allegations were tailored to the pandemic, the charges announced Wednesday -- and the range of victims identified -- were significantly broader and involved attacks done both for monetary gain but also more conventional espionage purposes.\n",
      "\tIn unsealing three related indictments, officials laid out a wide-ranging hacking scheme targeting a variety of business sectors and academia and carried out by a China-based group known as APT41. That group has been tracked over the last year by the cybersecurity firm Mandiant Threat Intelligence, which described the hackers as prolific and successful at blending criminal and espionage operations.\n",
      "\tThe hackers relied on a series of tactics, including attacks in which they managed to compromise the networks of software providers, modify the code and conduct further attacks on the companies' customers.\n",
      "\tThe Justice Department did not directly link the hackers to the Chinese government. But officials said the hackers were probably serving as proxies for Beijing because some of the targets, including pro-democracy activists and students at a Taiwan university, were in line with government interests and didn't appear to be about scoring a profit.\n",
      "\t\"A hacker for profit is not going to hack a pro-democracy group,\" said acting U.S. Attorney Michael Sherwin of the District of Columbia, where the cases were filed. Those targets, including some that bear the \"hallmark\" of conventional espionage, point to the conclusion that the hackers had at least an indirect connection with the government, Sherwin said.\n",
      "\tIn addition, one of the five defendants told a colleague that he was very close to the Chinese Ministry of State Security and would be protected \"unless something very big happens,\" and also agreed not to go after domestic targets in China, said Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen.\n",
      "\tBut some of the conduct was clearly profit driven, officials said. Two of the Chinese defendants, for instance, were charged with breaking into video game companies and obtaining digital currency that was then sold for profit on the black market, officials said.\n",
      "\tRosen, the Justice Department's No. 2 official, criticized the Chinese government for what he said was a failure to disrupt hacking crimes and to hold hackers accountable.\n",
      "\t\"Ideally, I would be thanking Chinese law enforcement authorities for their co-operation in the matter and the five Chinese hackers would now be in custody awaiting trial,\" Rosen said. \"Unfortunately, the record of recent years tells us that the Chinese Communist Party has a demonstrated history of choosing a different path, that of making China safe for their own cyber criminals, so long as they help with its goals of stealing intellectual property and stifling freedom.\"\n",
      "\tThere was no immediate response Wednesday to an email seeking comment from the Chinese Embassy in Washington.\n",
      "\tThe Justice Department also announced that it had seized hundreds of accounts, servers and domain names used by the defendants and that it had worked with Microsoft and other private sector companies to deny the hackers continued access to tools, accounts and hacking infrastructure.\n",
      "\tAlso Wednesday, the department announced charges against two Iranian nationals accused of stealing hundreds of terabytes of data in a hacking campaign targeting institutions -- and perceived enemies of Iran -- in the U.S., Europe and the Middle East.\n",

      "\tFielding compelling questions about voters' real-world problems, U.S. President Donald Trump denied during a televised town hall that he had played down the threat of the coronavirus earlier this year, although there is an audio recording of him stating he did just that.\n",
      "\tTrump, in what could well be a preview of his performance in the presidential debates less than two weeks away, cast doubt on the widely accepted scientific conclusions of his own administration strongly urging the use of face coverings and seemed to bat away the suggestion that the nation has racial inequities.\n",
      "\t\"Well, I hope there's not a race problem,\" Trump said Tuesday when asked about his campaign rhetoric seeming to ignore the historical injustices carried out against Black Americans.\n",
      "\tFace-to-face with everyday voters for the first time in months, Trump was defensive but resisted agitation as he was pressed on his administration's response to the COVID-19 pandemic and why he doesn't more aggressively promote the use of masks to reduce the spread of the disease.\n",
      "\t\"There are people that don't think masks are good,\" Trump said, though his own Centers for Disease Control and Prevention strongly urges their use.\n",
      "\tThe event, hosted by ABC News' George Stephanopoulos, was a warmup of sorts before Trump faces Democratic nominee Joe Biden in the first presidential debate on Sept. 29. Taped at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia, it featured Trump taking questions from an audience of just 21 voters to comply with state and local coronavirus regulations.\n",
      "\tTrump sought to counter his admission to journalist Bob Woodward that he was deliberately \"playing it down\" when discussing the threat of COVID-19 to Americans earlier this year. Despite audio of his comments being released, Trump said: \"Yeah, well, I didn't downplay it. I actually, in many ways, I up-played it, in terms of action.\"\n",
      "\t\"My action was very strong,\" Trump added. \"I'm not looking to be dishonest. I don't want people to panic.\"\n",
      "\tTrump also insisted he was not wrong when he praised China's response to the virus in January and February, saying he trusted Xi Jinping, the Chinese leader. \"He told me that it was under control, that everything was and it turned out to be not true,\" Trump said,\n",
      "\tTrump also suggested the virus would disappear without a vaccine, claiming the nation would develop a herd immunity with time, but he didn't mention the lives that would be lost along the way.\n",
      "\t\"It's going to be herd-developed, and that's going to happen. That will all happen,\" Trump said. \"But with a vaccine, I think it will go away very quickly.\"\n",
      "\tHe concluded by praising his own handling the virus, saying it had enhanced the reputation of some governors and that \"we've made a lot of people look good that shouldn't look good, to be honest with you.\"\n",
      "\tThe questions from uncommitted voters were pointed and poignant: a diabetic man who said he felt he'd been thrown \"under the bus\" by mishandling of the coronavirus pandemic; a Black woman with a disease that left her uninsurable until the Obama health care law came along who is worried that she could lose coverage again; a Black pastor who questioned Trump's campaign motto to \"Make America Great Again.\"\n",
      "\t\"When has America been great for African Americans in the ghetto of America?\" the pastor asked.\n",
      "\tAsked about what he was doing to address protests against racial injustice, Trump lamented a \"lack of respect\" and the absence of \"retribution\" for those who clash with or carry out attacks against police officers. Trump on Sunday called for the death penalty for the individual who shot and critically injured two Los Angeles Sheriff's Department deputies over the weekend.\n",
      "\tTrump has been unusually mum on his debate preparations ahead of the first debate, set to take place in Cleveland. On Tuesday, he told Fox News that he believes his day job is the best practice for his three scheduled showdowns with Biden.\n",
      "\t\"Well, I sort of prepare every day by just doing what I'm doing,\" Trump said. He noted that he had been in California on Monday and had been to other states before that to make the point that he's getting out and about more than Biden.\n",
      "\tOne person likely to study the replay: Biden. Returning from a long day of campaigning in Florida, Biden said at his plane that he was preparing for the debates mostly by going back through what Trump has said in the past. But he suggested he had yet to initiate mock debates, saying he was unaware who would play the role of Trump in his preparations.\n",
      "\tTrump, in the Fox interview, lowered expectations for his Democratic opponent's performance, judging Biden \"a disaster\" and \"grossly incompetent\" in the primary debates. He assessed Biden as \"OK\" and \"fine\" in his final one-on-one debate with Bernie Sanders before clinching the nomination.\n",
      "\tTrump's rhetoric on Biden marked a departure from the traditional efforts by candidates to talk up their rivals' preparation for televised debates, in hopes of setting an unattainably high bar for their performance.\n",
      "\tThe second of the three scheduled debates, set to be held in Miami on Oct. 15, will feature a similar \"town meeting\" style.\n",
      "\tBiden is to have his own opportunity to hone his skills taking questions from voters on Thursday, when he participates in a televised town hall hosted by CNN.\n",
      "\tThe visit to Pennsylvania is Trump's second to the battleground state in the last week, after he attended a Sept. 11 memorial event in Shanksville on Friday.\n",

      "\tSales in the transportation equipment industry rose by 24.1 per cent in July, boosted by a 32.9 per cent gain in motor vehicle sales as auto manufacturers shortened or skipped their summer shutdowns this year. Sales of motor vehicle parts rose 38.9 per cent.\n",

      "\tIndia's defence minister accused China on Tuesday of violating past border agreements and expanding its troop deployments along a disputed mountainous frontier in the Ladakh region where the two countries have been locked in a military standoff for months.\n",
      "\tRajnath Singh told Parliament that India has informed China through diplomatic channels that its “attempts to unilaterally alter the status quo were in violation of the bilateral agreements.” He also said India has made counter-deployments along the rugged frontier and its troops have foiled “transgression attempts by China.”\n",
      "\t“We should be confident that our armed forces will handle the situation successfully,” Singh said.\n",
      "\tIndia and China have been embroiled in a tense border standoff in Ladakh, where in June they had their deadliest clash in decades. The Asian giants have accused each other of sending soldiers into rival territory and firing warning shots for the first time in 45 years, threatening a full-scale military conflict.\n",
      "\tOn Sept. 5, Singh and his China counterpart, Gen. Wei Fenghe, met in Moscow to discuss ways to lower tensions. It was the first high-level direct contact between the two sides since the standoff.\n",
      "\tDays later, the foreign ministers of the two countries also met in Moscow. They agreed to deescalate border tensions, but a settlement of the impasse is expected to be a long process.\n",
      "\tIn Beijing, foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said at a daily briefing Tuesday that China hopes that India “will earnestly implement the consensus reached by the foreign ministers of the two sides, meet China halfway, and make concrete efforts to ease the situation.”\n",
      "\tRelations between the two countries have often been strained, partly due to their undemarcated border.\n",
      "\tThey fought a border war in 1962 that spilled into Ladakh and ended in an uneasy truce. Since then, troops have guarded the undefined border area, occasionally brawling. They have agreed not to attack each other with firearms.\n",
      "\tSoldiers from the two sides fought in May and June with clubs, stones and their fists. A clash on a high ridge on June 15 left 20 Indian soldiers dead. China is believed to have also suffered casualties, but has not given any details.\n",
      "\tSingh said India inflicted “heavy” casualties on Chinese forces, but did not provide any numbers.\n",
      "\tAfter that clash, the two countries partially disengaged from the site in the Galwan Valley and at least two other places, but the crisis has continued in at least three other areas, including glacial Pangong Lake.\n",
      "\tSingh said the countries have resolved to keep peace and tranquility along their border but haven't been able to find a mutually acceptable solution.\n",
      "\tHe said the impasse was due to differing perceptions of the fiercely contested Line of Actual Control that separates Chinese and Indian-held territories from Ladakh in the west to India's eastern state of Arunachal Pradesh.\n",
      "\tSingh said India had built roads, bridges and other infrastructure along the border.\n",
      "\t“We are fully prepared to protect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of our country,” he said, adding that China continued to occupy nearly 38,000 square kilometres (14,670 square miles) of Indian land in Ladakh.\n",
      "\tAfter Singh's address, the main opposition Congress party staged a walkout from Parliament and said Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government was misleading the country over the issue of Chinese encroachment.\n",
      "\tOn June 19, Modi said China had not intruded inside India's borders during the latest standoff. He added that no one could take even an “inch of land” from India.\n",
      "\t“But Mr. Modi, when will you stand against China? When will we take back the land of our country from China?” Congress party leader Rahul Gandhi tweeted.\n",

      "The top spokesman for the Department of Health and Human Services issued an extraordinary broadside on Sunday against career government scientists, accusing them of \"sedition\" in their response to coronavirus and claiming without evidence that a critical federal health agency has a \"resistance unit\" against President Donald Trump.\n",
      "Michael Caputo, a fierce defender of Trump who was appointed to the agency earlier this year by the President, made the accusations during a live video hosted on his personal Facebook page, which -- along with his Twitter account -- was deactivated at some point following the Sunday diatribe. Caputo confirmed the comments he made during the video, which were first reported by The New York Times, to CNN on Monday.\n",
      "\tThe live video followed criticism in response to reporting that Trump-appointed communications officials at HHS pushed to change language of weekly U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention documents and that Caputo, the assistant secretary of public affairs, demanded to see the documents before they were released. The effort caused alarm among officials at the agency who view the move as political.\n",
      "\tIn the Sunday video, Caputo mentioned a series of conspiracy theories and predicted that Trump will win reelection but that his Democratic opponent, Joe Biden, will not concede, which Caputo claimed would lead to political violence.\n",
      "\t\"And when Donald Trump refuses to stand down at the inauguration, the shooting will begin,\" he said. \"The drills that you've seen are nothing.\" He also added, \"If you carry guns, buy ammunition, ladies and gentlemen, because it's going to be hard to get.\"\n",
      "\tCaputo said he was under attack by the media, said his physical health was in question and that his \"mental health has definitely failed.\" The Times reported that he \"sounded anguished\" over the nation's coronavirus death toll -- which has reached more than 194,000 dead. He warned people in the video to wear masks when attending the President's campaign rallies.\n",
      "\t\"I don't want to talk about death anymore,\" he said in the video, adding: \"You're not waking up every morning and talking about dead Americans.\"\n",
      "\tCaputo said in a statement to CNN on Monday that in the time since he has joined the administration, \"my family and I have been continually threatened and in and out of criminal court dealing with harassment prosecutions.\"\n",
      "\t\"This weighs heavily on us and we deeply appreciate the friendship and support of President Trump as we address these matters and keep our children safe,\" he said.\n",
      "\tCaputo declined to discuss the matter any further in a brief phone interview with CNN later Monday, except to say he made the comments as he was dealing with some of the pressure caused by harassment to himself and his family over the last several days. He added that harassment included what he deemed to be death threats.\n",
      "\tHHS told the Times in a statement that Caputo \"is a critical, integral part of the president's coronavirus response, leading on public messaging as Americans need public health information to defeat the Covid-19 pandemic.\"\n",
      "\tDuring his broadside, Caputo took aim at the CDC, claiming without evidence that scientists \"deep in the bowels of the CDC have given up science and become political animals.\"\n",
      "\tThe scientists \"haven't gotten out of their sweatpants except for meetings at coffee shops\" to plot \"how they're going to attack Donald Trump next,\" Caputo said.\n",
      "\tAmid tension between the administration and the CDC, a federal health official told CNN over the weekend that some federal health officials at the CDC believe the interference with the weekly scientific reports to be an effort to change communications by the agency's scientists so as not to contradict the President. Since the beginning of the pandemic, Trump has repeatedly downplayed the significance of the virus, sometimes contradicting his own White House task force doctors.\n",
      "\tRevelations of the HHS' officials involvement marked the latest example of political interference by administration appointees at the nation's health agencies.\n",
      "\tCaputo also referenced a contract he is overseeing between HHS and a marketing firm handling a campaign on coronavirus. CNN previously reported that the contract, which was advertised over the summer to help the administration \"defeat despair and inspire hope\" surrounding coronavirus, according to the performance work document sent to communication firms, is valued at $250 million.\n",
      "\tDuring the video on Sunday, Caputo said he expected to stay in his position because the President supported him.\n",
      "\t\"I'm not going anywhere,\" Caputo said in the video. \"I swear to God, as God is my witness, I am not stopping.\"\n",
      "\tCaputo has a history of making inflammatory remarks on social media. CNN's KFile reported earlier this year that he made racist and derogatory comments about Chinese people, accused Democrats of wanting the coronavirus to kill millions of people and accused the media of intentionally creating panic around the pandemic to hurt Trump in a series of now-deleted tweets.\n",
      "\tCaputo also made a slew of crude and sexist comments toward women in a series of now-deleted tweets.\n",

      "CONTENT : LOS ANGELES -- \n",
      "\tBack in February, when few Americans were aware of a distant and oddly named phenomenon called coronavirus, two Chinese filmmakers strapped on hazmat suits and embedded themselves in Wuhan's overrun hospitals.\n",
      "\tThere, they captured harrowing footage of terrified citizens hammering on hospital doors, medics collapsing from exhaustion, and relatives begging in vain to say goodbye to infected loved ones.\n",
      "\tNow, those images have been edited together by New York-based director Hao Wu (\"People's Republic of Desire\").\n",
      "\tPremiering at the Toronto International Film Festival on Monday, \"76 Days\" -- named for the duration of the central Chinese city's draconian lockdown -- is the first major documentary from the disease's original epicentre to hit theaters.\n",
      "\tShot in a claustrophobic, cinema verite style -- without voice-over or direct-to-camera interviews -- the film relies on the intimacy of the footage of doctors and patients grappling with a terrifying new reality.\n",
      "\tWu first contacted the two filmmakers, one of whom is anonymous for his own safety, after witnessing China's early lockdown first-hand during a family visit for Chinese New Year.\n",
      "\tThe footage they sent him revealed how, in the chaos of the disease's early weeks, they were able to get remarkable access -- but at considerable personal risk and suffering.\n",
      "\t\"It was a horrible, horrible shooting experience for them,\" Wu told AFP. \"They were fainting, it was really warm. A few times [filmmaker Weixi Chen] wanted to throw up inside [his] goggles, but he couldn't because once you throw up, once you remove your PPE, you have to get out, you could not come back again.\"\n",
      "\t\"It was like shooting in a war zone,\" he added.\n",
      "\tWu also had a personal motivation for pursuing the project.\n",
      "\tHis grandfather died from cancer soon after the outbreak, unable to find a hospital bed as resources strained under the weight of COVID-19.\n",
      "\t\"In the beginning I was angry with the Chinese government -- I really wanted to find out who's at fault, what caused this,\" said Wu.\n",
      "\tBut once the pandemic spread -- with exponentially greater tragedy -- to other countries like the U.S., the desire to place blame was replaced by a desire to document how \"as human beings live through this, how we can share this experience.\"\n",
      "\tIronically, despite Beijing's tight controls on information, access was in some ways easier in China. Privacy and litigation concerns proved far more of a barrier to filming in New York hospitals, Wu found.\n",
      "\tWuhan hospitals desperately lacking personal protective equipment initially welcomed coverage that could boost donations and volunteers, he added.\n",
      "\tThe film eschews politics and blame to focus on personal stories of tragedy and bravery, hope and despair, which repeated around the world after emerging in China.\n",
      "\tMedics tenderly hold the hands of patients locked away from their families, and are distinguishable to viewers only by the colorful doodles they scrawl upon each other's head-to-toe hazmat suits.\n",
      "\tBut it remains unclear whether the movie will ever be seen in China, where news about the pandemic has been tightly controlled since day one -- leading to many in the West, including U.S. President Donald Trump, accusing Beijing of a vast cover-up.\n",
      "\t\"I would love to show it in China, because I feel that for the entire country with COVID, it has been such a scar on the nation's psyche,\" said Wu, who hopes it could help his ancestral home to mourn its losses.\n",
      "\t\"Obviously right now most Chinese feel proud the country has been able to control it. But it is a trauma.\"\n",

      "\tThe United States' image around the world has plummeted in the wake of its coronavirus response, a major global survey has found.\n",
      "\tPeople in several of America's allied nations are dismayed by U.S. President Donald Trump's handling of the crisis and view him as less trustworthy than other world leaders, including Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping, according to the survey by the Pew Research Center.\n",
      "\tFavorability toward the U.S. in the U.K., Canada, France, Japan and Australia is the lowest it has been in at least two decades, the survey found.\n",
      "\tTrump's personal ratings slumped further in the annual index, with respondents in the U.K., Spain, France and Germany giving him ratings comparable to the lowest points of former President George W. Bush's tenure and significantly below the highs of Barack Obama's administration.\n",
      "\tMeanwhile, people in all 13 of the major countries surveyed considered the American response to the COVID-19 pandemic worse than that of China, the World Health Organization, the EU or their own governments.\n",
      "\tPew has conducted research in 13 of the United States' most important international partners for two decades. For this report, it used telephone interviews with more than 13,000 adults total in Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, South Korea, Spain, Sweden and the UK.\n",
      "\tThe driving force behind the slump in attitudes toward Trump was a response to the coronavirus that has left nearly 200,000 Americans dead and more people infected than anywhere else. Fewer than 1 in 6 people surveyed thought the U.S. had handled the outbreak well, with majorities in most countries saying it had done \"very badly.\"\n",
      "\tTrump found pockets of support among poll respondents who were favorable of right-wing, populist parties.\n",
      "\tBut overall, fewer than 1 in 5 people in Canada and Western Europe trusted Trump to do the right thing in international affairs. In Belgium, Denmark, France and Germany, around 1 in 10 said they had confidence in Trump.\n",
      "\tAngela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron were viewed far more favorably; majorities of those surveyed had confidence in the German and French leaders, and just under half had confidence in British Prime Minister Boris Johnson. By contrast, Trump had a lower rating than Russia's Putin or China's Xi.\n",
      "\tPew noted that past surveys had included countries such as India, Israel, Kenya, Nigeria and the Philippines, where Trump had a relatively higher favorability rating, but that the survey could not be conducted in those nations this time due to the pandemic, as they would have required face-to-face interviews.\n",
      "\tIn the U.S., Trump has been unable to improve his popularity less than two months before the election. His approval rating hovers around 40% in most polls, below Obama, George W. Bush or Bill Clinton at this stage of their re-election bid, and about on par with George H.W. Bush, who lost his re-election bid.\n",

      "\tBlack actor John Boyega has stepped down from his role as a global ambassador for perfume brand Jo Malone after the company decided to hire a Chinese actor to replace him in an ad he created.\n",
      "\tThe \"Star Wars\" star wrote on Twitter Tuesday that the brand's decision to \"replace my campaign in China by using my concepts and substituting a local brand ambassador for me, without either my consent or prior notice, was wrong.\"\n",
      "\tJo Malone, an upscale British perfume brand owned by Estee Lauder, has said that replacing Boyega with Chinese star Liu Haoran in the ad campaign was a misstep. It has removed the ad and apologized.\n",
      "\tThe original ad starring Boyega, 28, aired last year and was called \"The London Gent.\" It features the London-born actor walking around the neighbourhood where he grew up and riding a horse in a park, and it makes reference to his Nigerian heritage in a scene featuring West African attire.\n",
      "\t\"The film celebrated my personal story-- showcasing my hometown, including my friends and featuring my family,\" Boyega wrote. \"While many brands understandably use a variety of global and local ambassadors, dismissively trading out one's culture this way is not something I can condone.\"\n",
      "\tIt's not the first time Boyega has been deleted from a China-based ad. He played a leading role as Finn in 2015's \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens,\" but he and other nonwhite characters were removed or diminished from a Chinese poster for the movie.\n",
      "\tBoyega recently told GQ that Black characters have been \"pushed to the side\" in Disney's \"Star Wars\" franchise. In June, the star made an emotional speech on racism when he joined Black Lives Matter protests in London.\n",
      "\t\t\tI have decided to step down as Jo Malone's global ambassador. When I joined the brand as their first male global ambassador last year, I created the short film we used to launch the campaign. It won the Fragrance Foundation Virtual awards 2020 for Best Media Campaign.\n",

      "\tThe U.S. on Tuesday issued a sweeping new advisory warning against travel to mainland China and Hong Kong, citing the risk of \"arbitrary detention\" and \"arbitrary enforcement of local laws.\"\n",
      "\tThe advisory is likely to heighten tensions between the sides that have spiked since Beijing's imposition on Hong Kong of a strict new national security law in June that has already been met with a series of U.S. punitive actions.\n",
      "\tThe statement warned U.S. citizens that China imposes \"arbitrary detention and exit bans\" to compel co-operation with investigations, pressure family members to return to China from abroad, influence civil disputes and \"gain bargaining leverage over foreign governments.\"\n",
      "\t\"U.S. citizens travelling or residing in China or Hong Kong, may be detained without access to U.S. consular services or information about their alleged crime. U.S. citizens may be subjected to prolonged interrogations and extended detention without due process of law,\" the advisory said.\n",
      "\tIn Hong Kong, China \"unilaterally and arbitrarily exercises police and security power,\" the advisory said, adding that new legislation also covers offences committed by non-Hong Kong residents or organizations outside of Hong Kong, possibly subjecting U.S. citizens who have publicly criticized China to a \"heightened risk of arrest, detention, expulsion, or prosecution.\"\n",
      "\tWhen in Hong Kong, U.S. citizens are \"strongly cautioned to be aware of their surroundings and avoid demonstrations,\" the advisory said.\n",
      "\tChinese foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin told reporters at a daily briefing Tuesday that the U.S. should \"fully respect the facts and should not engage in unwarranted political manipulation\" when issuing such advisories.\n",
      "\t\"China has always protected the safety and legal rights of foreigners in China in accordance with law. China is one of the safest countries in the world,\" Wang said. \"Of course, foreigners in China also have an obligation to abide by Chinese laws.\"\n",
      "\tLast month, the Trump administration suspended or terminated three bilateral agreements with Hong Kong covering extradition and tax exemptions, citing Beijing's violation of its pledge for Hong Kong to retain broad autonomy for 50 years after the former British colony's 1997 handover to Chinese rule.\n",
      "\tOther Western nations have also suspended their extradition treaties with Hong Kong following the national security's law's passage.\n",
      "\tThe U.S. has also acted to end special trade and commercial privileges that Hong Kong had enjoyed and has imposed sanctions on Hong Kong and Chinese officials, including Hong Kong's pro-Beijing leader Carrie Lam, involved in enforcing the new security law.\n",
      "\tTensions between Beijing and Washington have hit their lowest point in decades amid simmering disputes over trade, technology, Taiwan, Tibet, the South China Sea, the coronavirus pandemic and, most recently, Hong Kong. The impact of the tensions has been felt in the tit-for-tat closures of diplomatic missions as well as visa restrictions on students and journalists.\n",
      "\tThe latest travel advisory did not offer any new warnings regarding COVID-19 in mainland China and Hong Kong, but referred travellers to earlier notices advising Americans to avoid the regions and return home from them if possible.\n",
      "\tU.S. President Donald Trump has assigned full blame to Beijing for the coronavirus outbreak in the U.S., deflecting criticism of his own handling of the pandemic that threatens his reelection.\n",
      "\tThe virus was first detected in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year, leading to the global pandemic. Critics have accused Beijing of an initial coverup attempt, although Trump himself has admitted to downplaying the severity of the virus as early as February.\n",
      "\tChina appears to have contained the virus within its borders, reporting no new cases of domestic infection in a month, while Hong Kong has also radically brought down its numbers of new cases.\n",

      "\tThey rose seven per cent from June, helped by motor vehicle, petroleum and coal sales, Statistics Canada reported Tuesday.\n",
      "\t“The gains that we're seeing in Canada are largely consistent with that optimistic mood in the market and the improved appetite for risk in general,” said Candice Bangsund, portfolio manager for Fiera Capital.\n",
      "\tShe said the risk-on trade was in equities, currencies, commodities, and bond yields.\n",
      "\t“So that has added to, of course, that narrative for a faster-than-expected recovery in economic growth.”\n",
      "\tOn the virus front, she said, there's been optimism regarding the potential for a successful vaccine from a couple of lead candidates in the last few days.\n",
      "\tAnd investors are looking forward to Wednesday's Federal Reserve meeting where a dovish approach is expected to continue with interest rates “pinned lower at these rock-bottom levels for an extended time.”\n",

      "\tThe TSX was supported by a broad-based rally with only energy falling.\n",
      "\tIt lost 0.4 per cent as shares of several large energy producers were down despite higher crude oil prices. Husky Energy Inc. was down 1.9 per cent while Suncor Energy Inc. and Canadian Natural Resources were each off about one per cent in heavy trading.\n",

      "\tCrude prices rose despite a sombre tone, slashing its demand outlook and raising its forecast for U.S. shale production.\n",
      "\t“So of course those are two headwinds for the crude outlook but today the stronger economic data has largely countered those reports from OPEC and has sparked a strong rally in crude prices,” Bangsund said.\n",

      "\t\"Since the first wave of COVID-19 appeared in Wuhan, China has already survived the impact of COVID-19 several times,\" Gao Fu, director of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), said at a vaccine summit in the city of Shenzhen on Saturday, according to state-run news agency China News Service.\n",
      "\tThe question of vaccinating the public was one of balancing \"risks and benefits,\" he added, pointing to factors like cost and potential side effects. There isn't currently a need for mass vaccination at this stage -- though that could change if another serious outbreak takes place, Gao said.\n",
      "\tThe policy marks China apart from many Western governments, most notably Australia, that have outlined plans to introduce mass public vaccination drives.\n",
      "\tChina's reported virus numbers have stayed low since the spring. There have been a few flare-ups -- clusters in the northeastern Jilin province in May, an outbreak in Beijing in June, and another in the Xinjiang capital of Urumqi in July -- but these were met with immediate lockdown measures and mass testing, and the outbreaks were contained within a few weeks.\n",
      "\tGao cited these brief outbreaks as evidence of China's effective containment measures. \"The facts have proven that we have several magic weapons to respond to the epidemic,\" he said, according to China News Service.\n",
      "\tAny potential vaccine would instead be prioritized for those on the front lines, he added: medical workers, Chinese nationals working overseas in virus hostpots, and people working in dense, high-risk environments like restaurants, schools or cleaning services.\n",
      "\tOn Saturday, China's National Health Commission only recorded 10 new symptomatic confirmed cases, all imported from overseas. It also reported 70 new asymptomatic cases, which are counted separately, also all imported.\n",
      "\tCNN has reached out to the NHC for further comment.\n",
      "\tDespite Gao's comments, China has been one of the biggest players in the global race to develop a coronavirus vaccine.\n",
      "\tChina is the world's largest producer and consumer of vaccines, and can supply more than 1 billion doses of a vaccine annually from 40 manufacturers across the country, according to the 2018-2022 China Human Vaccine Industry Report.\n",
      "\tOf the more than 30 vaccines currently in human trials globally, nine are from China -- the most from any country. And four of the nine vaccine candidates in late-stage trials are being developed by Chinese companies.\n",
      "\tJust last week, the University of Hong Kong announced that clinical trials have been approved for a nasal spray vaccine, developed in collaboration with mainland Chinese researchers.\n",
      "\tChina has already pushed forward some vaccines before their efficacy has been fully proven. In late June, the country approved an experimental vaccine for use by its military. And since July, China has been using a different experimental vaccine on people who work in \"high risk\" jobs like medical professionals and border agents. Neither vaccine has completed Phase 3 trials.\n",
      "\tOther countries may follow suit; the Indian health minister said on Sunday that the government was considering granting emergency authorization to COVID-19 vaccine candidates before the completion of Phase 3 trials.\n",
      "\tGao himself was injected with an experimental vaccine in July, in a move that was \"intended to enhance the public's confidence in vaccines,\" according to state-run tabloid Global Times.\n",
      "\tExperts have previously said that vaccination is key for countries like China, where the percentage of infected people within the population is relatively low due to strict containment measures.\n",
      "\t\"The overall immunity is very low. And so in these places, definitely the way forward is vaccinations,\" said Ivan Hung, an infectious diseases specialist at the Hong Kong University School of Medicine, in late August.\n",
      "\tBut Gao warned on Saturday that vaccine development is still a work in progress, with risks of poor side-effects.\n",
      "\t\"Since there has never been a COVID-19 vaccine developed before, which makes this case the very first in science, it is possible that it may induce ADE (antibody-dependent enhancement) effects as any other firsts we will possibly face,\" he said, according to Global Times.\n",
      "\tADE is when specific antibodies help a virus to enter cells and replicate -- basically, when a treatment makes the disease worse.\n",
      "\t\"Scientific research is a very rigorous process, we need to give scientists a bit more time,\" he added.\n",

      "\tJo Malone and its parent company, Estee Lauder, didn't respond to emailed requests for comment Sunday. Boyega and his representatives also couldn't be reached for comment.\n",
      "\tThe original ad starring Boyega aired last year and was called “The London Gent.” It features the London-born actor walking around the neighbourhood where he grew up and riding a horse in a park, and it makes reference to his Nigerian heritage in a scene featuring West African attire.\n",
      "\tIt's not the first time Boyega has been deleted from a China-based ad. He played a leading role as Finn in 2015's “Star Wars: The Force Awakens,” but he and other nonwhite characters were removed or diminished from a Chinese poster for the movie.\n",
      "\tBoyega has spoken out about Hollywood racism, recently telling GQ that Black characters have been “pushed to the side” in Disney's “Star Wars” franchise.\n",

      "\tChinese authorities have confirmed the criminal detention of 12 Hong Kongers who were allegedly attempting to travel illegally to Taiwan by boat last month, while the foreign ministry in Beijing labeled the group separatists.\n",
      "\tThe 12 people, aged 16 to 33, were under \"compulsory criminal detention\" in accordance with Chinese law for illegally crossing the border, according to a statement Sunday from the public security bureau in Shenzhen, a southern Chinese city. It said they were arrested on Aug. 23.\n",
      "\tThe statement was the first formal announcement from Chinese authorities that the 12 would likely face criminal charges. Last month authorities confirmed the detention at sea of the 12, some of whom were linked to the anti-government protest movement in the city last year.\n",
      "\tThe 12 were believed to be travelling to the self-ruled island of Taiwan, a popular choice among protesters who have chosen to leave Hong Kong since the passage of a new national security law in June. Critics say the Hong Kong law is Beijing's clearest attempt to erase the legal firewall between the semi-autonomous territory and the mainland's authoritarian Communist Party system.\n",
      "\tBeijing foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said Sunday on Twitter that the 12 detained were not \"democratic activists, but elements attempting to separate .HongKong from China.\"\n",
      "\tUnder Hong Kong's security law, attempting to separate Hong Kong from China is illegal, as the law outlaws secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces in the city's internal affairs.\n",
      "\tPro-democracy lawmaker Eddie Chu expressed concern in a interview with public broadcaster RTHK on Monday that the 12 could face more severe charges in the future, which could result in longer prison sentences. They are currently accused of illegally crossing the border and not separatism.\n",
      "\tThe relatives of the arrested Hong Kongers held a news conference on Saturday calling for the return of their family members to Hong Kong, saying their legal rights were being violated.\n",
      "\tThe relatives, who wore masks and sunglasses and did not not reveal their names, said those arrested should be allowed to meet with lawyers they themselves have hired, not those appointed by Chinese authorities. They also said they should be provided with needed medications and be allowed to call their families.\n",
      "\tIn a statement released at the news conference, the families said that the Hong Kong government had not yet provided any sort of concrete assistance to the families.\n",
      "\tHong Kong leader Carrie Lam said last week that the group arrested would have to be dealt with according to Chinese laws if they were arrested for committing an offence in China. She said that the Hong Kong government would try and render assistance.\n",
      "\tU.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement Friday that the U.S. is \"deeply concerned\" over the arrests of the 12 people, whom he called \"democracy activists.\"\n",
      "\tU.S. State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus said in a Twitter post Saturday that the arrest of the 12 is \"another sad example of the deterioration of human rights in Hong Kong.\"\n",
      "\t\"Legitimate governments do not need to wall their countries in and prevent their citizens from leaving,\" Ortagus wrote.\n",

      "\tTerry Branstad, appointed by President Donald Trump in 2017, confirmed his decision in a phone call with Trump last week, the U.S. Embassy said in a statement Monday. It did not give a reason for his departure.\n",
      "\t\"I am proudest of our work in getting the phase one trade deal and delivering tangible results for our communities back home,\" he was quoted as saying at an embassy staff meeting on Monday.\n",
      "\tWord of his departure leaked out earlier in the day when Secretary of State Mike Pompeo thanked Branstad on Twitter for his service.\n",
      "\t\"Ambassador Branstad has contributed to rebalancing U.S.-China relations so that it is results-oriented, reciprocal, and fair,\" Pompeo wrote in a follow-up tweet.\n",
      "\tChina's foreign ministry said before the embassy announcement that it was aware of Pompeo's tweet but had not received any notification that Branstad was leaving.\n",
      "\tBranstad became embroiled in a recent controversy when China's official People's Daily newspaper rejected an opinion column that he had written.\n",
      "\tPompeo tweeted last week that China's ruling Communist Party refused to run Branstad's op-ed while the Chinese ambassador to the United States \"is free to publish in any U.S. media outlet.\"\n",
      "\tChinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian responded that Branstad's article was \"full of loopholes, seriously inconsistent with facts and wantonly attacks and smears China.\"\n",
      "\tThe U.S. Embassy had contacted the People's Daily on Aug. 26 about the piece, asking that it be printed in full without any edits before Sept. 4, the People's Daily said in a statement posted online.\n",
      "\tBranstad, 73, is a native of Iowa and was governor of the major farming state for 22 years over two spans, from 1983 to 1999 and 2011 to 2017.\n",
      "\tEarly in his first term, he met Xi Jinping, now China's leader, when the then county-level Communist Party official visited Iowa on a 1985 trade trip.\n",
      "\tTrump appointed him ambassador after a vacancy of several months, during which the embassy's No. 2 official, David Rank, resigned after criticizing the Trump administration's withdrawal from the Paris climate accord.\n",
      "\tSoon after arriving in Beijing in June 2017, Branstad welcomed American beef back to the Chinese market after a 14-year ban, saying \"I know it is a key priority of the president to reduce the trade deficit, and this is one of the ways we can do it.\"\n",
      "\tBut trade relations quickly soured, as the U.S. imposed tariffs on Chinese products and China retaliated in kind. Other disputes followed over technology, human rights and the response to the coronavirus pandemic.\n",
      "\tBranstad joined U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin at trade talks with Chinese counterparts in Beijing in May 2019.\n",
      "\tThe phase one deal reached the following January represented a truce but did not address the more fundamental complaints of the American side.\n",
      "\tThe U.S. Embassy statement also noted Branstad's role in the effort to reduce the flow of fentanyl from China to the United States, including a 2018 pact in which China agreed to list the opioid as a controlled substance.\n",
      "\tBranstad also made a rare visit to Tibet in May 2019, where he expressed concerns about what the U.S. called Chinese government interference in the freedom of Tibetan Buddhists to organize and practice their religion.\n",
      "\t\"He encouraged the Chinese government to engage in substantive dialogue with the Dalai Lama or his representatives, without preconditions, to seek a settlement that resolves differences,\" an embassy statement at the time said.\n",

      "\tYoshihide Suga was elected as the new head of Japan's ruling party on Monday, all but assuring that he will become the country's new prime minister when a parliamentary election is held later in the week.\n",
      "\tDespite his low-key image, Suga, 71, has been an important figure in outgoing Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's administration, serving as the government's top spokesperson in his role as chief Cabinet secretary. Abe announced last month that he would resign due to health problems.\n",
      "\tSuga's victory in the ruling Liberal Democratic Party vote virtually guarantees his election in a parliamentary vote Wednesday because of the majority held by the LDP's ruling coalition.\n",
      "\tSuga, the son of a strawberry grower in northern Japan's Akita prefecture, said he had come a long way. \"I will devote all of myself to work for the nation and the people,\" he said in his victory speech.\n",
      "\tHe has said that his top priorities will be fighting the coronavirus and turning around a Japanese economy battered by the pandemic. He gained the support of party heavyweights and their wing members early in the campaign on expectations that he would continue Abe's policies.\n",
      "\tSuga received 377 votes in Monday's vote to pick a successor to Abe. Former Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida, one of the other two contenders, received 89 votes, while former Defence Minister Shigeru Ishiba got 68.\n",
      "\t\"Now I'm handing the baton to new LDP President Suga,\" Abe said after the vote. \"We can count on him.\"\n",
      "\tSuga has been a loyal supporter of Abe since Abe's first stint as prime minister from 2006 to 2007. Abe's tenure ended abruptly because of chronic illness, and Suga helped him return as prime minister in 2012.\n",
      "\tSuga repeatedly has praised Abe's diplomacy and economic policies when asked about what he would like to accomplish as prime minister. He also has defended scores of favouritism and cronyism scandals, saying that investigations into the cases were properly handled.\n",
      "\tOn the surface, the straight-faced Suga is known for offering bland comments at twice-daily televised news briefings.\n",
      "\tBut behind the scenes, he's known for his iron-fist approach to getting jobs done as a policy co-ordinator and influencing bureaucrats by using the centralized power of the prime minister's office, leading political watchers to call him the \"shadow prime minister.\" Some bureaucrats who have opposed his policies have reportedly been removed from projects or transferred elsewhere.\n",
      "\tSuga, whose portfolio also included a ministerial role as head of Okinawa issues in the Abe-led government, has offended local leaders with his high-handed approach to a disputed relocation of a U.S. Marine air station on the southern island. He also sparked criticism last year over his hostile responses to a female reporter asking tough questions about Abe's policies and scandals.\n",
      "\tAs his parents' eldest son, Suga defied tradition by deciding not to take over the family farm. Instead, he headed to Tokyo, where he became a self-made politician, a rarity in Japan's largely hereditary business of politics -- and a change from Abe, the scion of a political dynasty.\n",
      "\t\"Where there is a will, there is a way,\" is Suga's motto. He also says he seeks to build a nation of \"self-support, mutual support then public support,\" raising concerns of having a vision of a government that is cold to the weak and the needy.\n",
      "\tSuga says that he is a reformist and that he has worked to achieve policies by breaking territorial barriers of bureaucracy. He has credited himself for those efforts in achieving a booming foreign tourism industry in Japan, lowering cellphone bills and bolstering agricultural exports. On Monday, he pledged to crack into vested interests and rules hampering reforms.\n",
      "\tWhile there is speculation that he may form a caretaker Cabinet that mainly keeps key members from the Abe government, Suga said he might as well pick reform-minded people willing to carry out his policies.\n",
      "\tDespite speculation that Suga may be a caretaker for the remainder of Abe's scheduled term, which was to end in September 2021, he may actually last longer, according to analysts.\n",
      "\tSuga, who grew up in rural Japan and does not belong to a faction within the ruling party, may be a political realist with a broad national perspective, more so than Abe, said Tobias Harris, a political analyst. \"I think he has a more holistic view of politics and the government than maybe a lot of people who have occupied the post of prime minister,\" Harris said.\n",
      "\tCompared to his political prowess at home, Suga has hardly travelled overseas, and his diplomatic skills are unknown, though he is largely expected to pursue Abe's priorities.\n",
      "\tIn addition to the coronavirus and the economic fallout, Suga stands to inherit several other challenges, including China, which continues its assertive actions in the East China Sea. He also will have to decide what to do with the Tokyo Olympics, which were pushed back to next summer due to the coronavirus. And he will have to establish a good relationship with whoever wins the U.S. presidential race.\n",
      "\tSuga has said he wants to maintain communication and develop strategic ties with China and South Korea despite rocky relations with them.\n",
      "\tChinese foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin congratulated Suga and expressed willingness \"to deepen co-operation in the fight against the epidemic and economic and social development, and continuously promote improvement and development of China-Japan relations.\"\n",
      "\tSuga is known to have helped smooth out differences by keeping close ties with a centrist coalition partner, Komeito. His ties to the more dovish partner could make his administration less hawkish on national security issues, analysts say.\n",
      "\tA man of self-discipline, his daily routine includes sit-ups and walking -- in his business suits in the neighbourhood of the parliament so he can immediately head to work in an emergency.\n",
      "\tBut he says he has a weakness: He loves sweets, namely pancakes and Japanese mochi with sweet bean paste inside.\n",

      "\tOracle said Monday that the Chinese owner of TikTok has picked the U.S. company to be its \"trusted technology provider,\" beating out rival Microsoft in a deal that could help keep the popular video-sharing app running in the U.S.\n",
      "\tOracle spokeswoman Deborah Hellinger said she was confirming remarks made by U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who told CNBC on Monday that TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, submitted its proposal to the U.S. government for approval.\n",
      "\t\"We did get a proposal over the weekend that includes Oracle as the trusted technology partner with Oracle making many representations for national security issues,\" Mnuchin said.\n",
      "\tMnuchin said there's also a commitment to make TikTok's global operations a U.S.-headquartered company with 20,000 new jobs.\n",
      "\tPresident Donald Trump's administration has threatened to ban TikTok by Sept. 20 and ordered owner ByteDance to sell its U.S. business, claiming national security risks due to its Chinese ownership. The government worries about user data being funneled to Chinese authorities. TikTok denies it is a national security risk and is suing to stop the administration from enacting the threatened ban.\n",
      "\tMuch remains unclear about the proposed deal with Oracle, which is pointedly not referring to it as a sale or acquisition.\n",
      "\tAny deal must still be reviewed by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, known as CFIUS, a U.S. government group chaired by the Treasury Secretary that studies mergers for national security reasons. Mnuchin said he expects the group to review the proposal this week and later make a recommendation to the president.\n",
      "\tThe president can approve or deny a transaction recommended by the panel, though Trump has already voiced support for Oracle as a \"great company\" that could handle the acquisition.\n",
      "\tMicrosoft said in a Sunday statement that ByteDance \"let us know today they would not be selling TikTok's US operations to Microsoft.\"\n",
      "\tProposals to acquire TikTok's U.S. business raised questions among outside observers about how it would be split from the rest of TikTok's social media platform, which is popular worldwide. ByteDance also owns a similar video app, Douyin, for the Chinese market.\n",
      "\tMicrosoft added it was \"confident our proposal would have been good for TikTok's users, while protecting national security interests.\" The company said it \"would have made significant changes to ensure the service met the highest standards for security, privacy, online safety, and combating disinformation.\"\n",
      "\tWalmart, which had planned to partner with Microsoft on the acquisition, said Sunday it \"continues to have an interest in a TikTok investment\" and is talking about it with ByteDance and other parties.\n",
      "\tTikTok, which says it has 100 million U.S. users and about 700 million globally, is known for its fun, goofy videos of dancing, lip-syncing, pranks and jokes. It's recently become home to more political content such as the comedian Sarah Cooper, who drew a large audience by lip-syncing Trump's often-disjointed statements from public appearances.\n",
      "\tBut the app has also raised concerns because of its Chinese ownership. The White House has cracked down on a range of Chinese businesses, including telecom equipment makers Huawei and ZTE and messaging app WeChat, over worries that they would enable Chinese authorities to access U.S. user data. Republican and Democratic lawmakers have raised concerns about censorship and children's privacy.\n",
      "\tTikTok denies that it has shared user data with the Chinese government or that it would do so if asked. The company says it has not censored videos at the request of Chinese authorities and insists it is not a national-security threat.\n",
      "\tTikTok has sued to stop the ban, but not the sale order. The negotiations have been complicated by several factors, including Trump's repeated demands that the U.S. government should get a \"cut\" of any deal, a stipulation and role for the president that experts say is unprecedented.\n",
      "\tIn addition, the Chinese government in late August unveiled new regulations that restrict exports of technology, likely including the artificial intelligence system TikTok uses to choose which videos to spool up to its users. That means ByteDance would have to obtain a license from China to export such technology to a foreign company.\n",
      "\t\"The Chinese government has implied it may block export of TikTok's AI systems, so that might complicate a direct sale,\" said Tiffany Li, a visiting professor at the Boston University School of Law.\n",
      "\tShe said that TikTok's AI-backed video recommendation system is one of the app's competitive advantages.\n",
      "\tWhether the Oracle-TikTok deal will allow the sidestepping of Chinese export restrictions depends on which entity retains control of TikTok in the U.S., said Paul Haswell, a Hong Kong-based partner at law firm Pinsent Masons.\n",
      "\tThe deal had come together rapidly after the administration ramped up its threats against TikTok this summer, despite TikTok's efforts to put distance between its app and its Chinese ownership. It installed former Disney executive Kevin Mayer as its American CEO, but he resigned in August after just a few months on the job, saying the \"political environment has sharply changed.\"\n",
      "\tBoth Microsoft and Oracle are known more for their business software offerings than for those intended for consumers.\n",
      "\tOracle primarily makes database software. It competes with tech giants such as Microsoft and Amazon that provide cloud services as well as business-software specialists like Salesforce.\n",
      "\tSome analysts see Oracle's interest in a consumer business as misguided. Oracle should focus on enterprise-market acquisitions and not invest in a consumer app like TikTok that doesn't fit with the rest of its business, said Jefferies analyst Brent Thill, who compares the idea to Delta Airlines buying a motorcycle company. \"It doesn't make any sense,\" he said.\n",
      "\tThill suggested that TikTok competitors like Facebook and Snapchat should be \"cheering on Oracle\" as a buyer, because Oracle wouldn't \"add a lot of value to the app.\"\n",
      "\tOracle co-founder Larry Ellison is unusual among tech executives for his public support of Trump, hosting a fundraiser for him in February at his Rancho Mirage, California, estate. The company also hired a former top aide to Vice-President Mike Pence; its CEO, Safra Catz, also served on Trump's transition team.\n",
      "\tThe president said on Aug. 18 that Oracle was \"a great company\" that \"could handle\" buying TikTok. He declined to state his preference between Oracle and Microsoft as buyers.\n",
      "\t\"We have a lot of confidence in both Microsoft and Oracle,\" Mnuchin said Monday. \"They've chosen Oracle.\"\n",

      "CONTENT : WASHINGTON -- \n",
      "\tA whistleblower's allegation that he was pressured to suppress intelligence about Russian election interference is the latest in a series of similar accounts involving former Trump administration officials, raising concerns the White House risks undercutting efforts to stop such intrusions if it plays down the seriousness of the problem.\n",
      "\tThere is no question the administration has taken actions to counter Russian interference, including sanctions and criminal charges on Thursday designed to call out foreign influence campaigns aimed at American voters. But Trump's resistance to embracing the gravity of the threat could leave the administration without a consistent and powerful voice of deterrence at the top of the government heading into an election that U.S. officials say is again being targeted by Russia.\n",
      "\tRussian President Vladimir Putin \"is not deterred,\" said Connecticut Rep. Jim Himes, a Democratic member of the House Intelligence Committee. Himes said Putin feels \"empowered, probably inoculated in the U.S. because of the president's behaviour.\"\n",
      "\tBrian Murphy, the former top intelligence official at the Department of Homeland Security, alleges in the complaint made public Wednesday that he was instructed to hold back intelligence on Russian interference because it \"made the president look bad.\" That follows reports that Trump berated his then-intelligence director after a congressional briefing about Moscow's interference, and that the president sought the firing of another official who told Congress he supported intelligence agencies' assessment that Russia had interfered in 2016 with a preference for Trump.\n",
      "\tThe department denied Murphy's allegation, and the White House issued a statement describing instances in which it said the president had it taken action against Russia.\n",
      "\t\"This president has been resolute that any foreign adversary seeking to disrupt our elections will face tremendous consequences,\" White House spokeswoman Sarah Matthews said.\n",
      "\tSenior Trump administration officials have been eager to focus more on China in discussing election interference, asserting that Beijing is the more potent danger. Though career intelligence officials do say China is a major espionage concern, there is also bipartisan consensus, including in a Republican-led Senate intelligence committee report, that Russia directly interfered in 2016 with the goal of helping Trump defeat Democrat Hillary Clinton. This year, intelligence officials say, Russia is working to denigrate Democratic nominee Joe Biden.\n",
      "\tMurphy is not alone in alleging that he felt stymied from raising the Russia threat head-on.\n",
      "\tMiles Taylor, as chief of staff to former Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, participated in high-level administration meetings and has in recent weeks publicly conveyed his concerns about Trump's leadership. In an interview, Taylor said Nielsen had to create a \"shadow\" National Security Council to deal with the issue because she felt the president's own team had not convened enough meetings to co-ordinate a response.\n",
      "\tOnce when Nielsen tried to communicate the seriousness of the threat heading into the 2018 election, Trump responded that the whole issue was \"all (expletive),\" Taylor said.\n",
      "\tIn addition, Taylor said Trump president once tried to have the Homeland Security Department's then-intelligence chief fired after hearing that the official had told lawmakers that he agreed with the assessment of Russian interference during the 2016 election.\n",
      "\t\"The president himself has threatened to fire multiple individuals in the administration for even publicly supporting the intelligence community assessment on Russia, and that had a direct and chilling effort on the ability of key Cabinet secretaries to get out and do what they needed to do to thwart foreign interference in our democracy,\" Taylor said.\n",
      "\tTrump's stance on Russian interference, including publicly questioning intelligence agencies' assessment at a Helsinki news conference with Putin, has colored his relationship with spy chiefs.\n",
      "\tLast February, Trump erupted after learning of a congressional briefing involving Russian interference, a senior administration official has said, and berated the then-acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire.\n",
      "\tIn arguing that Trump has been tough on Russia, the White House pointed to actions including the closure of Russian consulates on the West Coast, the expulsion of dozens of Russian agents from the U.S., sanctions on hundreds of targets, the U.S. suspension of a decades-old nuclear arms treaty and millions of dollars in election-related funding.\n",
      "\tThe administration has also issued public statements acknowledging ongoing efforts by Russia and its proxies to interfere in the election, including one last month that said Russia was denigrating Biden. The Treasury Department on Thursday sanctioned a Ukraine lawmaker who has leaked recordings of Biden's calls that Trump has promoted on Twitter but that his own administration has said rely on a false narrative. Also Thursday, the Trump administration Justice Department announced charges against a Russian national in a plot to sow discord in the U.S.\n",
      "\tBut Taylor said that when he was in the administration, far tougher options that were contemplated were not always pursued when it came to Russia.\n",
      "\t\"We felt like it was mission critical that the president firmly come down on the Russians and punish Moscow for their interference and punish them hard enough that they would be dissuaded from engaging in foreign meddling again,\" Taylor said. \"The president didn't want to do that.\"\n",
      "\tSome administration officials contend that China, which has been aggressive in efforts to steal American intellectual property, is the more assertive adversary. Intelligence officials say China prefers that Trump lose because it views him as unpredictable and has been expanding its influence operations and weighing risks and benefits of more aggressive action.\n",
      "\tBut a statement from intelligence officials that accused Russia of actively trying to undermine Biden suggested that China's actions against Trump were less direct. Microsoft, in identifying both countries as well as Iran as being involved in election-related hacking, has said that people associated with the Biden campaign were among those targeted by Chinese state-backed hackers.\n",
      "\tHimes, the House Intelligence Committee member, said he was concerned heading into the Nov. 3 election about intelligence being twisted for political reasons.\n",
      "\t\"I'm not sure people naturally understand the destruction,\" he said, \"that can be caused by the politicization of intelligence.\"\n",

      "\tChina's Defence Ministry on Sunday blasted a critical U.S. report on the country's military ambitions, saying it is the U.S. instead that poses the biggest threat to the international order and world peace.\n",
      "\tThe statement follows the Sept. 2 release of the annual Defence Department report to Congress on Chinese military developments and goals that it said would have \"serious implications for U.S. national interests and the security of the international rules-based order.\"\n",
      "\tDefence Ministry spokesman Col. Wu Qian called the report a \"wanton distortion\" of China's aims and the relationship between the People's Liberation Army and China's 1.4 billion people.\n",
      "\t\"Many years of evidence shows that it is the U.S. that is the fomenter of regional unrest, the violator of the international order and the destroyer of world peace,\" he said.\n",
      "\tU.S. actions in Iraq, Syria, Libya and other countries over the past two decades have resulted in the deaths of more than 800,000 people and displacement of millions, Qian said.\n",
      "\t\"Rather than reflecting on itself, the U.S. issued a so-called report that made false comments about China's normal defence and military construction,\" he said in the statement. \"We call on the U.S. to view China's national defence and military construction objectively and rationally, cease making false statements and related reports, and take concrete actions to safeguard the healthy development of bilateral military relations.\"\n",
      "\tRunning to more than 150 pages, the Defence Department report examined the PLA's technical capabilities, doctrines and the ultimate aims of China's military buildup. It said it includes becoming a \"practical instrument\" of China's statecraft with an active role in advancing Beijing's foreign policy and \"aims to revise aspects of the international order.\"\n",
      "\t\"Certainly, many factors will determine how this course unfolds,\" the report said. \"What is certain is that (the ruling Communist Party) has a strategic end state that it is working towards, which, if achieved and its accompanying military modernization left unaddressed, will have serious implications for U.S. national interests and the security of the international rules-based order.\"\n",
      "\tMuch of the report was devoted to analyzing China's strategy toward Taiwan, a U.S. ally which China considers a part of its territory to be annexed by force if necessary. China's military capabilities dwarf those of the island of 23 million in numerical terms, although any invasion of Taiwan would be complex and would carry major political risks, the report said.\n",
      "\tIt also looked at areas where the 2 million-member PLA, the world's largest standing military, has overtaken the U.S., including in the size of its navy, now the world's largest with approximately 350 ships and submarines compared to around 293 for the U.S.\n",
      "\tChina has also built a considerable arsenal of land-based ballistic and cruise missiles and has one of the world's largest forces of advanced long-range surface-to-air systems, the report said.\n",
      "\tThis year's report comes as relations between Beijing and Washington have hit their lowest ebb in decades amid simmering disputes over trade, technology, Taiwan, human rights and the South China Sea.\n",
