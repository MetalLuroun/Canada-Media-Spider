Innocent citizens should not be caught in the crossfire of superpowers as they negotiate and manage their competition or differences.”She acknowledged that the situation is complicated but added, “I’m sometimes reminded there are three ways Michael comes home.”\n",

      "CONTENT : TAIPEI — Months after eliminating a popular challenge to its rule in Hong Kong, China is turning to an even higher-stakes target: self-governing Taiwan. The island has been bracing for conflict with China for decades, and in some respects, that battle has now begun.It’s not the final, titanic clash that Taiwan has long feared, with Chinese troops storming the beaches. Instead, the People’s Liberation Army, China’s two-million-strong military, has launched a form of “grey zone” warfare. In this irregular type of conflict, which stops short of an actual shooting war, the aim is to subdue the foe through exhaustion.Beijing is conducting waves of threatening forays from the air while ratcheting up existing pressure tactics to erode Taiwan’s will to resist, say current and former senior Taiwanese and U.S. military officers. The flights, they say, complement amphibious landing exercises, naval patrols, cyber attacks and diplomatic isolation.\n",

The internet is rife with advice on how to make the most of solitude while keeping it together, and survive the holidays without seeing our families.Now imagine that you’ve missed two Christmases with your loved ones, and every other day in between. You haven’t spent those days in the comfort of your home, either; you’ve spent them in a cramped cell, in a foreign country, where the lights have been kept on 24 hours a day and you have been repeatedly interrogated for hours on end.That is the reality Canadians Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor have endured, for the past two years, as prisoners in China.\n",

Talks with Japanese counterpart Toshimitsu Motegi covered maritime tensions, trade and the pandemic response.On Wednesday, Wang will make a courtesy call on Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga, who has so far sought to balance Japan’s deep economic reliance on China with security concerns, including Beijing’s claims over the disputed isles that are controlled by Japan.While Suga has steered clear of the harsh anti-China rhetoric used by Japan’s ally the United States, he has moved to counter its influence by deepening ties with Australia and choosing Vietnam and Indonesia for his first overseas trip.“It’s important to interact with people and talk directly with each other,” Motegi told a news briefing after the talks.He was referring to schemes streamlining travel for business travelers and those residing in each country, which has been restricted due to the coronavirus pandemic.\n",

      "CONTENT : TOKYO — Japan and Australia agreed on a breakthrough defense pact on Tuesday allowing reciprocal visits for training and operations, and voiced concern over the disputed South China Sea, where China is extending its military influence.It is Japan’s first agreement covering foreign military presence on its soil since a status of forces agreement in 1960 that allowed the United States to base warships, jets and troops in Japan as part of an alliance that Washington describes as the bedrock of regional security.The Reciprocal Access Agreement strengthens defense ties between the two U.S. allies at a time when China is asserting its role in the region and the United States is going through a messy leadership transition.The pact allows Japanese and Australian troops to visit each other’s countries and conduct training and joint operations and was agreed in principle by Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga and his Australian counterpart, Scott Morrison, who is visiting Tokyo.“I hereby announce that we reached agreement in principle on a reciprocal access agreement, which had been negotiated to elevate security and defense cooperation between Japan and Australia to a new level,” Suga told a joint news conference.\n",

Their arrests came shortly after the detention in Canada of Chinese Huawei executive, Meng Wanzhou, on a U.S. extradition warrant.“Over the past two years, two Canadians, Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, have been detained arbitrarily by China, and Canada has done absolutely everything necessary to try and get them home safe,” Trudeau said Wednesday in the House of Commons.Ottawa has resisted applying sanctions against China in response, and the government has not moved to recall our ambassador or send China’s ambassador to Ottawa home. Instead the Liberal government says it has been working with allies to increase verbal pressure on China, and several countries have raised the plight of the two men on Canada’s behalf.\n",

In September, Russia announced a deal to supply Egypt with 25 million doses of the Sputnik V vaccine.Egypt’s government has confirmed relatively low numbers of coronavirus infections, partly due to limited public testing, but has been warning of a second wave of the pandemic as daily infections have risen in recent weeks.

      "CONTENT : Tomorrow, Canada marks a grim milestone. For two years, Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor will have been held hostage in China simply for being Canadian.While Canadians are rightfully concerned about the fate of our two wrongfully imprisoned citizens, China’s hostage diplomacy has awoken the Canadian public to a far larger reality. A realignment in geopolitics has taken place over the last 40 years, and Canada has been late to heed its warnings.For 40 years the great opening of China’s free market has not gone as we had hoped. And for the past 30 years, since tanks rolled into Tiananmen Square, the Western world has chosen to hope that things would get better.To this day, every business, public or private, remains subject to the strategic objectives of the Chinese state. This may not have been a big deal when China produced mainly low-tech goods like shoes and toothbrushes, but it has dramatic implications today as Chinese tech firms export facial recognition technology and surveillance drones. All Chinese firms are required by law to collaborate with Chinese intelligence agencies. Yes, that includes mining TikTok videos and feel-good apps for data. And it certainly concerns Huawei building our digital future.\n",

      "CONTENT : BEIJING/TAIPEI — China will strike back against any moves that undermine its core interests, its foreign ministry said on Friday, after U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said that Taiwan “has not been a part of China.”China calls Taiwan the most sensitive and important issue in its ties with the United States, and has been angered by the Trump administration’s stepped up support for the Chinese-claimed yet democratically ruled island, such as arms sales.Speaking in a U.S. radio interview on Thursday, Pompeo said: “Taiwan has not been a part of China.”“That was recognized with the work that the Reagan administration did to lay out the policies that the United States has adhered to now for three-and-a-half decades,” he said.The United States is bound by law to provide Taiwan with the means to defend itself, and officially only acknowledges the Chinese position that Taiwan is part of it, rather than explicitly recognizing China’s claims.Speaking in Beijing, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said Taiwan was an inalienable part of China and that Pompeo was further damaging Sino-U.S. ties.“We solemnly tell Pompeo and his ilk, that any behavior that undermines China’s core interests and interferes with China’s domestic affairs will be met with a resolute counterattack by China,” he said, without elaborating.\n",

OK, it’s what the spokesperson said so it’s worth reporting, however stilted. But this opinion piece long-marched on: “A quick look into Australia’s official report on this matter finds that troops indeed are reported to have slit the throats of young boys within Afghanistan. This cartoon, created by a Chinese satirical artist, is in fact true.”\n",

      "CONTENT : Meng Wanzhou, the scion of the Huawei telecommunications company, who is mired in extradition proceedings in Canadian court, has spent the last two years living under partial house arrest in her Vancouver mansions, a colourful and relaxing life compared to the “grey, grinding monotony,” endured by the two Canadians in China who were seized in retaliation for Meng’s 2018 arrest in Vancouver.The story of the Two Michaels — Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor — are inextricably linked with Meng’s fate and on Thursday evening, U.S. media reported the U.S. Justice Department was in discussions with Meng’s lawyers about dropping criminal proceedings against her in exchange for an admission of wrongdoing.It’s the latest development in a saga that has seen a distinct deterioration in the diplomatic relationships between Ottawa and Washington and Beijing, and raises questions not just about Meng’s future, but also the possible fate of Kovrig and Spavor, not to mention other Canadians imprisoned in China.\n",

As of Wednesday, there were 24,363 confirmed cases in China, and 490 deaths.Outside of China there were 191 cases in 24 countries and one death, in the Philippines.So far, 99 per cent of cases of the virus known as 2019-nCov are in China; 80 per cent are from the province of Hubei.Many of those who have died succumbed to multiple organ failure, not necessarily from the virus itself but from “the demand and the shock the virus causes in the body in general,” Dr. Mike Ryan, executive director of the WHO health emergencies program said at a media briefing from Geneva.

That made China the fifth country to send satellites into orbit following the Soviet Union, the United States, France and Japan.Nov. 26, 1975: China’s first recoverable satellite was successfully launched and returned to Earth.Nov. 20, 1999: China successfully launched its first unmanned spacecraft, the Shenzhou 1, at the Jiuquan launch center. The country launched another three unmanned spaceships in 2001 and 2002 in preparation for a manned spacecraft.Oct. 15, 2003: China became the third country after the United States and Russia to send a man into space with its own rocket.

As I said, I think it is important to resolve such concerns one by one through high-level talks,” Japanese Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi told reporters on Friday.He added he would have a “frank exchange” of views on bilateral relations with Wang, including on how to resume traffic between the two countries during the pandemic.\n",

The United States has imposed a series of sanctions on senior officials from Hong Kong and China deemed responsible for Beijing’s crackdown in the territory.The latest such move was on Monday, when Washington imposed financial sanctions and a travel ban on 14 Chinese officials. In response, China summoned the acting top U.S. diplomat in Beijing on Tuesday and vowed to take “reciprocal” retaliation.\n",

Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig, a.k.a. the two Michaels, have been held on trumped-up charges in Chinese prisons for almost two years now. They are hostages in a dispute they had no part in over Chinese tech giant Huawei.Canada is doing what it can to ensure their release. But the broader challenge can only be met by a United States that leads its allies in concert abroad, and marshals every ounce of muscle that America can bring to bear at home. In some respects, the signs are positive.Canadians should need no reminders about how pitiless and ruthless China’s leaders can beIn Congress, where there is strong bi-partisan agreement that robust push-back against Xi Jinping’s aggressive brand of authoritarianism is now unavoidable, Biden would be knocking at an open door. By giving credit to President Donald Trump for leading the first U.S. administration since the end of the Cold War to take the Chinese threat seriously, he would be setting a very public precedent that his commitment to inclusive politics is more than rhetoric.\n",

The two men face spying charges.“They are both very healthy, physically and mentally,” Ambassador Dominic Barton told a special parliamentary committee on Canada’s ties with China.“I am deeply inspired by their resilience and their mindset – it’s incredible given what they’re going through … they are very, very strong and it’s remarkable,” he added.The affair has badly damaged bilateral relations. Canada, which says the return of the two men is a priority, condemns what it calls “hostage diplomacy” and dismisses Beijing’s insistence that the detentions are not linked to Meng’s arrest.Canada is trying to balance demands for the return of the two men and the insistence China improve its human rights record with what it says is the need to talk to Beijing about economic ties and climate change.\n",

      "CONTENT : TOKYO — Japan’s annual defense review accuses China of pushing its territorial claims amid the coronavirus pandemic and suspects Beijing of spreading propaganda and disinformation as it provides medical aid to nations battling the disease.China “is continuing to attempt to alter the status quo in the East China Sea and the South China Sea,” Japan said in the defense white paper, approved by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s government on Tuesday.The white paper described “relentless” intrusions in waters around a group of islets claimed by both nations in the East China Sea, known as the Senkaku in Japan and the Diaoyu in China.In the South China Sea, it said Beijing was asserting territorial claims by establishing administrative districts around disputed islands that forced countries distracted by the virus outbreak to respond.Japan’s criticism of China echoes comments by the United States at a time of rising regional tension as Beijing and Washtington held separate military drills in the resource-rich South China Sea and ties between the world’s two biggest economies deteriorated.\n",

      "CONTENT : WASHINGTON — U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper said on Tuesday he hoped to visit China by the end of the year to improve “crisis-communications” channels and address other areas of mutual interest as he condemned China’s maritime activity in the South China Sea.Earlier this month, the United States rejected China’s claim to offshore resources in much of the South China Sea, drawing criticism from China which said the U.S. position raised tension in the region, highlighting an increasingly testy relationship.“Before the year is out, I hope to visit the PRC for the first time as secretary in order to enhance cooperation on areas of common interest, establish the systems necessary for crisis communications and reinforce our intentions to openly compete in the international system,” Esper said, using an acronym for the People’s Republic of China.It was unclear whether Esper’s trip would be contingent upon securing special travel waivers given the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, which has strained already fraught relations between the world’s two largest economies.International diplomatic and defense travel has been severely curtailed due to the coronavirus pandemic, which has added strain to U.S.-China relations.\n",

      "CONTENT : NEW YORK — Nearly half the 15-member U.N. Security Council plan to raise the issue of rights abuses in North Korea during a closed-door meeting on Friday – a move likely to anger Pyongyang – after Russia and China objected to a public briefing, diplomats said.The United States, Britain, France, Germany, Belgium, the Dominican Republic and Estonia told council colleagues they will raise the implications of North Korea’s “ongoing human rights violations against its people on international peace and security,” according to an email seen by Reuters on Thursday.They had initially requested a public briefing on the issue by U.N. human rights officials, but diplomats said Russia and China had objected. The Chinese, Russian and North Korean U.N. missions did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Between 2014 and 2017 the Security Council held annual public meetings on human rights abuses in North Korea.In 2018 the council did not discuss the issue amid now failed efforts by North Korea leader Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Donald Trump to work toward Pyongyang’s denuclearization.Last year at least eight council members pushed for a meeting on human rights abuses, sparking Pyongyang to warn it would consider such a move a “serious provocation” to which it would “respond strongly.”\n",

He warned of new U.S. sanctions against China-based individuals and entities in response.Wong said China had continued to host at least 20,000 North Korean laborers in violation of U.N. bans, and that in the past year the United States had observed ships carrying prohibited coal or other sanctioned goods from North Korea to China on 555 separate occasions.“On none of these occasions … did the Chinese authorities act to stop these illicit imports,” Wong told Washington’s Center for Strategic and International Studies.He said China currently hosted at least two dozen North Korean representatives connected to Pyongyang’s weapons programs or banks, and Chinese firms had continued to do business with U.N.-sanctioned entities with key roles in those programs.Wong said China “increasingly allows” its companies to conduct trade with North Korea in a broad spectrum of U.N.- prohibited goods, including seafood, textiles, iron and steel, industrial machinery, vehicles, sand and gravel.\n",

The 15-member body has unanimously boosted sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in a bid to choke off funding for Pyongyang’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs.“The DPRK (North Korea) continues to circumvent the U.N. prohibition on the exportation of coal, a key revenue generator that helps fund its weapons of mass destruction programs,” U.S. Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a statement.“The North Korean regime often uses forced labor from prison camps in its mining industries, including coal, exploiting its own people to advance its illicit weapons programs,” he said.An annual report to the U.N. Security Council by independent sanctions monitors earlier this year said North Korea continued to flout council resolutions “through illicit maritime exports of commodities, notably coal and sand” in 2019, earning Pyongyang hundreds of millions of dollars.The U.S. action freezes any U.S. assets of those sanctioned and generally bars Americans from dealing with them.\n",

      "CONTENT : TOKYO — China’s Foreign Minister Wang Yi is set to visit Tokyo on Tuesday marking the first such high-level trip since Japan picked a new leader in September and amid mounting concerns over Beijing’s growing assertiveness in the region.Wang could make a courtesy call on Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga, who has so far sought to balance Japan’s deep economic reliance on China with addressing security worries, including Beijing’s claims over disputed East China Sea isles.While Suga has steered clear of the harsh anti-China rhetoric used by Japan’s ally the United States, he has moved to counter its influence by deepening ties with Australia and making his first overseas trip to Vietnam and Indonesia.“There are various pending issues between the two countries, so through high-level meetings, it is important to reach solutions to each issue one by one,” Japanese Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi told reporters on Tuesday before the meeting.He said he would have a “frank exchange” of views on bilateral relations with Wang, including on how to resume traffic between the two countries during the pandemic.Japanese media reported that Motegi would also raise concerns about China’s beefed-up activity in the East China Sea.\n",

I hope that happens soon,” he said.\n",

      "CONTENT : BEIJING — China and the United States need to proceed together with “good will” to improve relations, the Chinese ambassador to Washington said on Saturday, as ties remained fraught between the world’s two biggest economic powers.Sino-U.S. relations have fallen to their lowest point in decades over issues from trade and security to human rights and COVID-19. On Friday, a Chinese state media editorial said ties are being shifted to “a dangerous path.”“In order to put the relations on the right track, to have real improvement of the relations, both sides have to proceed with good will and good faith,” Ambassador Cui Tiankai told the Annual Conference of the Institute for China-America Studies via video link.“I don’t think that China should just do something to please anybody here,” he said, according to a transcript posted on his embassy’s website.Tensions between the two countries dramatically escalated in July when China closed the U.S. consulate in the southwestern city of Chengdu in retaliation for Beijing’s ouster from its consulate in Houston, Texas.Earlier in the year, Washington cut the number of Chinese nationals allowed to work at the U.S. offices of major Chinese state media. Beijing then expelled U.S. journalists in the China bureaus of New York Times, Wall Street Journal and the Washington Post.\n",

      "CONTENT : The idea of a musketeer arrangement with other like-minded countries when dealing with China might appeal to our theatrical prime minister.That suggestion, for creating a new counterweight to China, was advanced Monday by Stephen Nagy, a Canadian academic who teaches at the International Christian University in Tokyo and is a fellow at the Asia Pacific Foundation and was appointed a China expert with Canada’s China Research Partnership.Trudeau doesn’t have the d’Artagnan style-musketeer beard he once sported, but the principle of “one for all and all for one” may resonate with his multilateral convictions.Nagy told MPs on a parliamentary committee that Canada needs to think seriously about enhanced co-operation with other middle powers when dealing with China, and that they should collectively lobby the United States to adopt a more multilateral approach.\n",

It is a very good golf course, and we very much appreciate Laguna Golf Bintan and its leadership accommodating us and helping this come together so quickly.”\n",

I hope that happens soon,” he said.\n",

      "CONTENT : BEIJING — Passengers of China-bound flights must provide negative COVID-19 test results before boarding, China’s aviation authority said on Tuesday, as the government looks to further reduce the risk of imported coronavirus cases amid increased international travel.Nucleic acid tests must be completed within five days of embarkation, the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) said on its website. Tests should be conducted at facilities designated or recognized by Chinese embassies in host countries, it said.The embassies will carefully assess the testing capacity of host countries and formulate travel procedures when testing conditions are met, CAAC said.The announcement comes as countries struggle with testing capacity and speed. In parts of the United States, receipt of test results can take up to two weeks, while in some other countries, nucleic acid tests are reserved for people who have come in close contact with COVID-19 patients or who have symptoms of the potentially fatal disease.In the past month, CAAC has allowed more foreign airlines to resume services in China and add flights to the country as the economy recovers. Deutsche Lufthansa AG on Friday said it would double the number of flights to and from mainland China in coming weeks, and Air France KLM SA said it has received approval to add more China flights.A number of airlines have been suspended from operating China routes after more than five passengers tested positive for the coronavirus upon arrival.

We will not accept the Beijing authorities’ use of ‘one country, two systems’ to downgrade Taiwan and undermine the cross-strait status quo. We stand fast by this principle,” Tsai said.\n",

Among several of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s cabinet ministers who have demonstrated exemplary talent in the trick of speaking at length on a particular subject without revealing anything of substance, Champagne has elevated the cunning practice into an art form.The point is to give the impression that something is being done, some new action is being taken or some policy is under close consideration and will be imminently revealed, when in fact nothing is being done, and there’s nothing new, and nothing is in the offing — at least nothing you want anybody to know about.You’ll need a particular adroitness in the sleight of hand that’s required to pull it off, though, because any close scrutiny could cause the whole gambit to vanish into thin air. That’s why Champagne was taking particular pains this week, during his appearance before the House of Commons special committee on Canada-China relations, to avoid and deflect any close scrutiny of the shambles that has become of his government’s unrequited affection for Xi Jinping’s China.\n",

      "CONTENT : BEIJING — China and the United States need to proceed together with “good will” to improve relations, the Chinese ambassador to Washington said on Saturday, as ties remained fraught between the world’s two biggest economic powers.Sino-U.S. relations have fallen to their lowest point in decades over issues from trade and security to human rights and COVID-19. On Friday, a Chinese state media editorial said ties are being shifted to “a dangerous path.”“In order to put the relations on the right track, to have real improvement of the relations, both sides have to proceed with good will and good faith,” Ambassador Cui Tiankai told the Annual Conference of the Institute for China-America Studies via video link.“I don’t think that China should just do something to please anybody here,” he said, according to a transcript posted on his embassy’s website.Tensions between the two countries dramatically escalated in July when China closed the U.S. consulate in the southwestern city of Chengdu in retaliation for Beijing’s ouster from its consulate in Houston, Texas.Earlier in the year, Washington cut the number of Chinese nationals allowed to work at the U.S. offices of major Chinese state media. Beijing then expelled U.S. journalists in the China bureaus of New York Times, Wall Street Journal and the Washington Post.\n",

      "CONTENT : UNITED NATIONS — Germany accused Russia and China on Tuesday of preventing a United Nations Security Council committee from determining whether North Korea has breached a U.N. cap on refined petroleum imports by the isolated Asian state.The Security Council has ratcheted up sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in a bid to choke funding for Pyongyang’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs. In 2017 it imposed an annual cap of 500,000 barrels on refined petroleum imports.China and Russia are the only countries to have notified the Security Council’s North Korea sanctions committee of refined petroleum exports to Pyongyang, but they did so in tonnes instead of barrels and the committee has been unable to agree on a conversion rate so it can determine when the cap was reached.“Despite numerous attempts – the issue has been on the agenda for no less than three years – to find an agreement on a conversion rate, Russia and China have been stalling the process,” German U.N. Ambassador Christoph Heusgen, chairman of the sanctions committee, told reporters.“While this shouldn’t be a complicated matter to solve, it has become clear that the two delegations are politicizing this topic,” Heusgen said after raising the issue behind closed doors in a formal Security Council meeting.The Russian and Chinese missions to the United Nations did not immediately respond to a request for comment.For the past three years, the United States and dozens of allies have accused North Korea of breaching the fuel cap through illicit imports and called for an immediate halt to all deliveries. However, Russia and China repeatedly prevented the sanctions committee from issuing such a statement.The North Korean mission to the United Nations in New York has not responded to the accusations.

      "CONTENT : Canada seems to be adopting a “see no evil; hear no evil; speak no evil” attitude on relations with China. The question is, to what end? Is it because of our overweening desire to win a two-year seat on the UN Security Council — a prize of dubious distinction given the unremarkable track record of the council in recent years that has featured more gridlock than action due to the chronic conflict between the veto-carrying Russia and China and most of the others. Should we win a seat, what would Canada do on a controversy which divides the two authoritarian powers from our allies — the U.S., the U.K. and France, among others? Abstain, a weaselly option used occasionally in the past by Canadian governments on biased resolutions directed at Israel?We are presumably currying not only China’s vote but also China’s influence on several African states that have received generous dollops of economic assistance from Beijing. It is demeaning to wheedle this way for support in any circumstance.The second motivation cited is that Canada does not want to jeopardize the fate of the two Michaels (Kovrig and Spavor) who were essentially kidnapped and have held in stark detention for more than 500 days in retaliation for Canada’s intention to extradite to the U.S. Meng Wanzhou, the daughter of the founder of Huawei, in accordance with the terms of our bilateral extradition treaty with the Americans.\n",

      "CONTENT : SYDNEY — China is threatening the sovereignty of small Pacific Islands and undermining the region’s stability, a top U.S. military commander said on Thursday, in comments likely to inflame tension with China.U.S.-China relations improved in January with the signing of a trade deal that defused an 18-month row that has hit global growth but strains remain.Admiral Philip Davidson – commander of the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command – said the United States “was all in” to counter China in the Pacific, citing its “excessive territorial claims, debt trap diplomacy, violations of international agreements, theft of international property, military intimidation and outright corruption.”“The Communist Party of China seeks to control the flow of trade, finance, communications, politics and the way of life in the Indo-Pacific,” Davidson said in a speech in Sydney.The Chinese embassy in Australia did not immediately respond to a request for comment. China has in the past rejected accusations of aggressive behavior and of luring small economies into debt “traps.”\n",

      "CONTENT : WASHINGTON — The United States on Wednesday targeted 24 Chinese companies and a number of individuals it said were part of ongoing construction and military actions over disputed islands in the South China Sea, the U.S. State and Commerce departments said.The U.S. Commerce Department, in a statement, said the two dozen companies played a “role in helping the Chinese military construct and militarize the internationally condemned artificial islands in the South China Sea.”The State Department, in a separate statement, said it would impose visa restrictions on Chinese individuals “responsible for, or complicit in,” such action in the South China Sea, and those linked to China’s “use of coercion against Southeast Asian claimants to inhibit their access to offshore resources.”The move marked the Trump administration’s latest efforts to crack down on companies whose goods may support Chinese military activities.The United States accuses China of militarizing the South China Sea and trying to intimidate Asian neighbors who might want to exploit its extensive oil and gas reserves. The United States has conducted multiple freedom of navigation operations by sending its warships through the area to assert the freedom of access to international waterways.China claims 90% of the potentially energy-rich South China Sea, but Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam also lay claim to parts of it, through which about $3 trillion of trade passes each year.

An additional 67 cases have been found on board, Japan’s Health Minister Katsunobu Kato said in televised comments.The plane will arrive on the evening of Feb. 16 and will transport the passengers first to Travis Air Force Base in California, and some may be moved to Lackland Air Force Base in Texas. They will undergo a two-week quarantine.Some 3,500 people are being kept in quarantine on Carnival Corp.’s Diamond Princess. The latest cases bring the total infections on the ship to almost 300, fueling concerns that rather than keeping passengers safe, the quarantine is allowing the virus to spread.\n",

      "CONTENT : WASHINGTON — The United States has blacklisted six companies, including several based in China, and four ships accused of illicit exports of North Korean coal, the Treasury Department said on Tuesday.The United Nations Security Council banned North Korean coal exports in 2017. The 15-member body has unanimously boosted sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in a bid to choke off funding for Pyongyang’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs.“The DPRK (North Korea) continues to circumvent the U.N. prohibition on the exportation of coal, a key revenue generator that helps fund its weapons of mass destruction programs,” U.S. Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a statement.“The North Korean regime often uses forced labor from prison camps in its mining industries, including coal, exploiting its own people to advance its illicit weapons programs,” he said.An annual report to the U.N. Security Council by independent sanctions monitors earlier this year said North Korea continued to flout council resolutions “through illicit maritime exports of commodities, notably coal and sand” in 2019, earning Pyongyang hundreds of millions of dollars.The U.S. action freezes any U.S. assets of those sanctioned and generally bars Americans from dealing with them.\n",

The FCCC fears that China is preparing to expel more journalists,” the group said, citing responses from 114 reporters to a survey.“Chinese authorities are using visas as weapons against the foreign press like never before, expanding their deployment of a long-time intimidation tactic as working conditions for foreign journalists in China markedly deteriorated in 2019,” it said.\n",

      "CONTENT : With millions of people under coronavirus quarantine in China, meeting basic needs — such as securing food — comes with unique challenges. When eating out or making routine trips to the supermarket becomes either impossible or undesirable, ordering in is one of few options. For those who are confined to their own homes as part of an effort to halt contagion, food delivery companies have transitioned from selling convenience to survival.But food delivery comes with its own set of potential pitfalls, for both customers and couriers. As orders increase due to the spread of the disease, so too does people’s wariness of direct human contact. In response, restaurants and food delivery companies have started taking precautions to mitigate the risk.Late last month, China’s top food delivery company Meituan launched “contactless delivery” in Wuhan, coronavirus epicentre, before rolling it out to 184 cities nationwide, the South China Morning Post reports. True to its name, the service allows customers to place orders via the app and pick them up at designated areas such as doorsteps and lobbies. Competitor delivery app Eleme, and fast-food chains KFC and Pizza Hut have also introduced contactless delivery options in China, according to Business Insider.\n",

He said Beijing had also increased its activity in the East China Sea, where it has a territorial dispute with Japan.Beijing’s increased level of activity would likely continue, predicted Schneider: “I don’t see troughs, I see plateaus,” he said.China says its maritime activities in the area are peaceful.

He said his visit would promote business links with Taiwan, and that the Czech Republic would not bow to Beijing’s objections.“We will make him pay a heavy price for his short-sighted behavior and political opportunism,” said Wang, while on a visit in Germany.Wang said that challenging the One China principle is tantamount to “making oneself the enemy of 1.4 billion Chinese people,” and the Chinese government and people will not tolerate such “open provocation” by the Czech senate speaker and the anti-China forces behind him.The One China principle refers to China and Taiwan both belonging to “one China”, a position which Beijing requires all countries it has diplomatic relations with to abide.China considers Taiwan a breakaway province ineligible for state-to-state relations.

Delta Air Lines and United Airlines wanted to resume flights to China in June, the U.S. Transportation Department has noted.U.S. airlines are not flying to China at all because they suspended services before the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) imposed restrictions on air travel.\n",

      "CONTENT : BEIJING/TAIPEI — China is becoming increasingly assertive in the region as the coronavirus crisis eases on the mainland while raging elsewhere in the world, with a crackdown in Hong Kong and saber-rattling around Taiwan and in the South China Sea.The U.S. State Department said China was taking advantage of the region’s focus on the pandemic to “coerce its neighbors.”In a significant strike against democracy activists in Chinese-ruled Hong Kong, police in the city arrested 15 people on Saturday, just days after a senior Beijing official called for the local government to introduce national security legislation “as soon as possible.”The arrests drew a strong rebuke from the United States and Britain.China has also been flying regular fighter patrols near Chinese-claimed Taiwan, to the island’s anger, and has sent a survey ship flanked by coast guard and other vessels into the South China Sea, prompting the United States to accuse Beijing of “bullying behavior.”\n",

      "CONTENT : SYDNEY — An Australian man from China’s Muslim Uighur community was reunited with his family, including a three-year-old son he had never met, after Beijing agreed they could depart Xinjiang.Sadam Abudusalamu posted on Twitter photographs of his family arriving at Sydney airport on Thursday and thanked Australia’s Foreign Minister Marise Payne, human rights activists, and “everyone who worked so hard to reunite us.”In 2017, Chinese authorities banned Abudusalamu’s wife Nadila Wumaier and son from leaving Xinjiang by confiscating their passports, in what became a high-profile human rights case in Australia.Abdusalamu had come to Australia as a student over a decade ago, and married Wumaier in Xinjiang in 2016. Their son Lufty was born in Xinjiang, and granted Australian citizenship in 2019, after Abdusalamu urged the Australian government to help the family.In February, after China’s deputy head of mission in Australia, Wang Xining, said on ABC Television Wumaier didn’t want to leave Xinjiang, she posted a photograph to Twitter holding a sign saying ‘I want to leave and be with my husband’.Payne said in July the Australian embassy in Beijing had formally requested the Chinese authorities allow Wumaier, a Chinese citizen, to leave.\n",

      "CONTENT : TAIPEI — Taiwan denounced China on Thursday over large-scale air and naval drills off its southwestern coast, calling them a serious provocation and a threat to international air traffic.It urged Beijing to rein in its armed forces.China, which claims democratic Taiwan as its own, has stepped up military exercises near the island, in what Taipei views as intimidation to force it to accept Chinese rule.Yeh Kuo-hui, from Taiwan’s Defence Ministry’s operations and planning department, told a hastily arranged news conference that China’s intentions could not be predicted.“We must make all preparations for war readiness,” Yeh said, following a news briefing from senior officers describing the Chinese activities over the last two days, and showing a map of Chinese movements.The drills took place in Taiwan’s air defense identification zone, between mainland Taiwan and the Taiwan-controlled Pratas Islands, the ministry said. Taiwan says China sent advanced Su-30 and J-10 fighters to participate.Taiwan Deputy Defence Minister Chang Che-ping said the drills threatened regional stability and endangered international aviation.“We once again say, do not underestimate the military’s determination to defend our home. We are confident and capable of defending the country,” Chang said.\n",

      "CONTENT : BEIJING — China’s Chang’e-5 lunar vehicle has finished collecting samples of lunar rocks and soil more than a day ahead of schedule in the first lunar sample retrieval mission since the 1970s, the country’s space agency said on Thursday.The robotic vehicle has stored the samples and will now dock with the orbiting Chang’e-5 for the return journey to Earth.China launched a robotic spacecraft on Nov. 24 to bring back rocks from the moon in the first bid by any country to retrieve samples since 1976.Late on Tuesday, the Chang’e-5 spacecraft successfully deployed a pair of landing and ascending vehicles onto the moon’s surface. The plan was to collect 2 kg (4.4 pounds) of samples.The sample collection was completed after 19 hours, the space agency said in its statement, without disclosing the total weight of the samples collected.China had planned to collect the samples over a period of about two days, with the entire mission taking around 23 days.The ascending vehicle would lift off from the lunar surface with the samples, and dock with a module currently orbiting around the moon.The samples would then be transferred to a return capsule onboard the orbiting module for delivery back to Earth.If successful, the mission will make China only the third country to have retrieved lunar samples after the United States and the Soviet Union.China made its first lunar landing in 2013.In January 2019, the Chang’e-4 probe landed on the far side of the moon, the first space probe from any nation to do so.

      "CONTENT : With millions of people under coronavirus quarantine in China, meeting basic needs — such as securing food — comes with unique challenges. When eating out or making routine trips to the supermarket becomes either impossible or undesirable, ordering in is one of few options. For those who are confined to their own homes as part of an effort to halt contagion, food delivery companies have transitioned from selling convenience to survival.But food delivery comes with its own set of potential pitfalls, for both customers and couriers. As orders increase due to the spread of the disease, so too does people’s wariness of direct human contact. In response, restaurants and food delivery companies have started taking precautions to mitigate the risk.Late last month, China’s top food delivery company Meituan launched “contactless delivery” in Wuhan, coronavirus epicentre, before rolling it out to 184 cities nationwide, the South China Morning Post reports. True to its name, the service allows customers to place orders via the app and pick them up at designated areas such as doorsteps and lobbies. Competitor delivery app Eleme, and fast-food chains KFC and Pizza Hut have also introduced contactless delivery options in China, according to Business Insider.\n",

He warned of new U.S. sanctions against China-based individuals and entities in response.A Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman said on Wednesday that China had always implemented the sanctions seriously, and that countries should care more about how sanctions had affected North Koreans’ “humanitarian livelihood.”Wong said China had continued to host at least 20,000 North Korean laborers in violation of U.N. bans, and that in the past year the United States had observed ships carrying prohibited coal or other sanctioned goods from North Korea to China on 555 separate occasions.“On none of these occasions … did the Chinese authorities act to stop these illicit imports,” Wong told Washington’s Center for Strategic and International Studies.He said China currently hosted at least two dozen North Korean representatives connected to Pyongyang’s weapons programs or banks, and Chinese firms had continued to do business with U.N.-sanctioned entities with key roles in those programs.\n",

      "CONTENT : DUBAI — Emirates and Etihad Airways will have to suspend flights to mainland China, except Beijing, from Wednesday after the United Arab Emirates halted most flights between the two countries due to the coronavirus outbreak in China.The suspension, effective Feb. 5, cuts off most of the UAE’s air links with the world’s second-biggest economy, and one of its largest trading partners.Dubai’s Emirates is one of the world’s biggest long-haul airlines and flies to mainland China cities Beijing, Guangzhou and Shanghai. Abu Dhabi’s Etihad Airways flies to Beijing, Shanghai and Chengdu.The UAE is a major international transit hub used to connect between Asia and Europe, Africa and South America.The suspension, to be enforced until further notice, does not apply to Chinese-ruled Hong Kong, the UAE’s civil aviation regulator said.Several Chinese carriers flying to the UAE will also have to suspend flights.\n",

Elsewhere there have been about 500 cases in some two dozen countries and territories, with four deaths – in Japan, Chinese-ruled Hong Kong, the Philippines and France.Russia has reported two cases of the illness – two Chinese nationals who have recovered and have been released from hospital, according to the authorities. Russia has quarantined hundreds of Russian and Chinese nationals upon their arrival from China.Oleg Popenkov, a worshipper at Father Igor’s service, said he was relieved the disease has not caused more devastation in Russia. But China, he said, needed the prayers.“We must pray for the misfortune happening in China to end soon.” (Reporting by Lev Sergeev Writing by Gabrielle Tétrault-Farber Editing by Frances Kerry)\n",

The FCCC fears that China is preparing to expel more journalists,” the group said, citing responses from 114 reporters to a survey.“Chinese authorities are using visas as weapons against the foreign press like never before, expanding their deployment of a long-time intimidation tactic as working conditions for foreign journalists in China markedly deteriorated in 2019,” it said.\n",

This will take place midweek,” French Health Minister Agnes Buzyn told reporters on Sunday. Evacuees will have to spend 14 days in quarantine to avoid spreading the virus in France.The U.S. State Department said on Sunday it would evacuate personnel from its Wuhan consulate to the United States and will offer a limited number of seats to private U.S. citizens.The coronavirus outbreak that began in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, in the province of Hubei, has killed 81 people in China so far and infected more than 2,750 globally, most of them in China.

Authorities reported 119 new cases the previous day and 125 the day before that.The increase was driven by more cases in Wuhan, the provincial capital of Hubei, where the virus is believed to have emerged in a market late last year.Wuhan’s new infections climbed to 131 from 114 a day earlier. There was no immediate elaboration and health officials were due to hold a briefing later in the day.After what some critics said was an initially hesitant response to the new virus, China imposed sweeping restrictions to try to stop it, including transport suspensions, lockdowns of cities and extending a Lunar New Year holiday across the country.\n",

      "CONTENT : There are quite a few lessons we will all just have to wait to draw from the COVID-19 pandemic that erupted last December in the Chinese city of Wuhan. The coronavirus that causes the sickness is still rampaging across the face of the Earth. The economic and geopolitical shockwaves are still shattering almost everything that was commonplace and routine and familiar from the days before the plague began.But there is a lesson that we all should have learned quite some time ago, which is proving its merit and value now that we are being forced to learn it in the hard and horrific way that the SARS-CoV-2 virus is teaching it. It’s that thriving liberal democracies cannot coexist for long within a model of neoliberal globalization that admits into its embrace such a tyrannical state-capitalist monstrosity as the People’s Republic of China.The arrangement would end badly. It was already putrefying long before the plague began radiating outward from the offal-strewn alleys in the wild animal section of the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan’s Jianghan district, and outward across the province of Hubei, and then, for weeks, as a human-borne contagion undisclosed by the Chinese Communist Party, outward around the world.\n",

The two districts are under the control of China’s Sansha city, according to China Global Television Network.“The establishment of the so-called Sansha City and related activities seriously violated Vietnam’s sovereignty,” Vietnam’s Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Le Thi Thu Hang said in a statement.“Vietnam demands that China respect Vietnam’s sovereignty and abolish its wrongful decisions,” Hang said in the statement.A Chinese government survey ship was seen earlier this week tagging an exploration vessel operated by Malaysia’s state oil company Petronas in the disputed waters, and remained offshore of Malaysia as of late Sunday..Earlier this month, Vietnam lodged an official protest with China after the sinking of a Vietnamese fishing boat it said had been rammed by a China Coast Guard vessel near the Paracels.

      "CONTENT : BEIJING — China should expand its stock of nuclear warheads to 1,000 soon, Global Times editor-in-chief Hu Xijin said on Friday, even as U.S. President Donald Trump repeats his call for China to join an arms control treaty.The Global Times is published by the People’s Daily, the official newspaper of China’s ruling Communist Party. The party has been known to float ideas and guide public sentiments via the Global Times, which tends to take a nationalistic stance on issues involving other countries.Tensions between United States and China, already high from an ongoing trade war, have increased in recent months amid a war of words over the origins of the coronavirus pandemic.“We love peace and promise not to use nuclear weapons first, but we need a bigger nuclear arsenal to suppress U.S. strategic ambition and impulse against China,” Hu wrote in a Weibo post.Hu added that this stockpile should include “at least 100 DF-41 strategic missiles,” a latest class of intercontinental missiles capable of striking continental United States, according to defense experts.\n",

The FCCC fears that China is preparing to expel more journalists,” the group said, citing responses from 114 reporters to a survey.“Chinese authorities are using visas as weapons against the foreign press like never before, expanding their deployment of a long-time intimidation tactic as working conditions for foreign journalists in China markedly deteriorated in 2019,” it said.\n",

More than 9,000 members have pledged to take part, first in suspending non-emergency services offered by the city’s Hospital Authority before extending it to providing only limited emergency needs, it said.Hong Kong authorities have resisted pressure from some groups to shut all its borders with China, where the deadly outbreak has killed 259 people and infected more than 11,000 others. Hong Kong has at least 13 confirmed cases of the new strain of coronavirus. The government has extended school holidays and suspended residents of China’s Hubei province, where the outbreak is centered, from entering the city.\n",

      "CONTENT : When historians look back at 2020, they will not only see the pandemic as a time of massive social and economic upheaval, but the moment when China decided to fully assert itself on the world stage.COVID-19 offered the cover China’s Communist rulers needed to crack down on Hong Kong, get tough on Taiwan, increase its military presence in the South China Sea and step up its bullying tactics against Western countries, including Canada.There is now broad-based agreement in the West that something has to be done to counter the threat posed by Beijing. It is one of the few issues that unites Democrats and Republicans in the United States. But in Canada, our parliamentarians seem oddly divided on the issue, despite the fact that we’ve been the victim of Chinese aggression.Nowhere is this better exemplified than in the actions of NDP MP Niki Ashton.This week, the member of Parliament for the Manitoba riding of Churchill—Keewatinook Aski came under fire, along with Green MP Paul Manly, for agreeing to participate in an online panel discussion sponsored by handful of left-wing groups titled, “Zoom to Free Meng Wanzhou.”\n",

Already the biggest in the world, the Chinese men’s facial skincare market is forecast to hit 12.5 billion yuan ($1.90 billion) this year – and expand 50% to 18.5 billion yuan in 2025, research firm Mintel estimates.Market research provider Euromonitor International estimates the men’s skincare business in China, excluding post-shave products, was last year already more than three times the size of the U.S. market in dollar terms and more than twice the size of South Korea – with value growth through 2024 seen easily outstripping both.\n",

Wuhan and the surrounding region of Hubei are in virtual quarantine.More than 9,800 people have been infected in China and more than 130 cases reported in at least 25 other countries and regions, with Russia, Britain, Sweden and Italy all reporting their first cases on Thursday or Friday.The World Health Organization said on Thursday that the epidemic constituted a public health emergency of international concern, a designation that triggers tighter global containment measures and coordination.\n",

We extend congratulations to Mr. Biden and Ms. Harris,” foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said at a regular daily briefing, referring to Vice-President-elect Kamala Harris.“We understand the results of the U.S. election will be determined according to U.S. laws and procedures,” he added, repeating Beijing’s earlier stance.Trump’s refusal to accept defeat has put Beijing in an awkward position, with China loath to do anything to antagonize Trump, who has mounted court challenges to the balloting and remains in office until the Jan 20 inauguration.Relations between China and the United States are at their worst in decades over disputes ranging from technology and trade to Hong Kong and the coronavirus, and the Trump administration has unleashed a barrage of sanctions against Beijing.Shortly after Biden’s win following days of ballot counting in several swing states, numerous U.S. allies offered congratulations, while the leaders of China and Russia were among conspicuous holdouts. In 2016, Chinese President Xi Jinping sent congratulations to Trump on Nov. 9, a day after the election.

      "CONTENT : HANOI — Vietnam protested on Sunday at China saying it had established two administrative units on islands in the South China Sea, in Beijing’s latest move to demonstrate its assertiveness in the disputed waters.China has recently been pushing its presence in the energy-rich waters while other claimants are pre-occupied with tackling the new coronavirus pandemic, prompting the United States to call on China to stop its “bullying behavior” there.On Saturday it said it had established an administrative district on the Paracel islands and another on the Spratly islands. The two districts are under the control of China’s Sansha city, according to China Global Television Network.“The establishment of the so-called Sansha City and related activities seriously violated Vietnam’s sovereignty,” Vietnam’s Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Le Thi Thu Hang said in a statement.“Vietnam demands that China respect Vietnam’s sovereignty and abolish its wrongful decisions,” Hang said in the statement.A Chinese government survey ship was seen earlier this week tagging an exploration vessel operated by Malaysia’s state oil company Petronas in the disputed waters, and remained offshore of Malaysia as of late Sunday..Earlier this month, Vietnam lodged an official protest with China after the sinking of a Vietnamese fishing boat it said had been rammed by a China Coast Guard vessel near the Paracels.

      "CONTENT : TOKYO — Japan’s Defence Minister Taro Kono said on Saturday he had agreed with his U.S. counterpart Mark Esper that both countries opposed any unilateral attempt to change the status quo in the key waterways of the South China Sea and the East China Sea.Kono shared his view with the U.S. defense secretary at a time when the United States and China are at loggerheads over issues ranging from technology and human rights to Chinese military activities in the disputed South China Sea.A thorny issue in China’s ties with Japan is Beijing’s claim to a group of tiny East China Sea islets controlled by Tokyo.“We agreed that the international community will respond firmly to any unilateral change to the status quo in the South China Sea as well as the East China Sea,” Kono said.He was speaking online from Guam to reporters in the Japanese capital following his meeting with Esper.Kono said Esper had confirmed that the U.S.-Japan security treaty covered the East China Sea islets, known as the Senkaku islands in Japan and the Diaoyu islands in China.Turning to Japan’s domestic politics, Kono said he would think hard about running in a ruling party election to choose a successor to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who abruptly announced his resignation for health reasons on Friday.The United States has long opposed China’s expansive territorial claims in the South China Sea and has sent warships regularly through the strategic waterway.China claims 90% of the potentially energy-rich waters but Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam also lay claim to parts of it.About $3 trillion worth of trade passes through the waterway each year. China has built bases atop atolls in the region but says its intentions are peaceful. (Reporting by Kiyoshi Takenaka, Antoni Slodkowski; Editing by William Mallard and Clarence Fernandez)\n",

      "CONTENT : The United States has told China to close its consulate in Houston, both countries said on Wednesday, deepening a deterioration in bilateral relations, and a source said Beijing was considering shutting down the U.S. consulate in Wuhan.Washington had “abruptly demanded” closure of the Houston consulate on Tuesday, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesman said, and the editor of an official media outlet said on Twitter that China had been given 72 hours to do so.Beijing condemned the order and threatened retaliation, but did not say what measures it might take.Late on Tuesday in Houston, local media reported that documents had been burned in a courtyard at the consulate building. Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said the consulate was operating normally, declining to comment further on those reports.Ties between the United States and China have worsened sharply this year over a range of issues, from the novel coronavirus and telecoms gear maker Huawei to China’s territorial claims in the South China Sea and its imposition of a national security law on Hong Kong.\n",

But the move won’t stop the wave, given that 90% of the imported virus cases are Chinese nationals returning from other countries, according to data from China’s foreign ministry.Beijing is actively discouraging its 11 million Chinese diaspora from coming home, telling them that it would mean long delays in their studies and jobs overseas. And it’s no longer sending chartered flights to get citizens home, an about-turn from an earlier policy that saw it bring plane loads of Chinese back from Iran and Japan.\n",

The plan was to collect 2 kg (4.4 pounds) of samples.The sample collection was completed after 19 hours, the space agency said in its statement, without disclosing the total weight of the samples collected.China had planned to collect the samples over a period of about two days, with the entire mission taking around 23 days.The ascending vehicle would lift off from the lunar surface with the samples, and dock with a module currently orbiting around the moon.The samples would then be transferred to a return capsule onboard the orbiting module for delivery back to Earth.If successful, the mission will make China only the third country to have retrieved lunar samples after the United States and the Soviet Union.China made its first lunar landing in 2013.In January 2019, the Chang’e-4 probe landed on the far side of the moon, the first space probe from any nation to do so.

President-elect Joe Biden takes over on January 20.The State Department and the White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Up to 14 people, including officials of China’s parliament, or National People’s Congress, and members of the CCP, would likely be targeted by measures such as asset freezes and financial sanctions, two sources said.The U.S. official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said multiple individuals would be sanctioned. A person familiar with the matter said the group would likely include officials from Hong Kong as well as the mainland.

      "CONTENT : SHANGHAI/BEIJING — The United States drew China’s wrath with a travel warning on Friday while businesses struggled with supply problems from the coronavirus epidemic that has killed 213 people and been declared a global emergency.Russia, Britain, Sweden and Italy all reported their first cases, Rome declaring its own national emergency as it sought to reconstruct the itinerary of two infected Chinese tourists.“Do not travel to China due to novel coronavirus first identified in Wuhan,” the U.S. State Department said, raising the warning for China to the same level as Afghanistan and Iraq.Beijing, which has only just started to mend tattered trade ties with the United States, called that move “truly mean” given the World Health Organization (WHO) had commended its containment efforts and not recommended travel or trade curbs.“The World Health Organization urged countries to avoid travel restrictions, but very soon after that, the United States did the opposite,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said in a statement. “It’s truly mean.”\n",

In the meantime, it advised travelers to be prepared for disruption to air links between the two countries.Passenger flights between France and China were suspended earlier this year due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

      "CONTENT : ROME — A planeload of medical supplies, including masks and respirators, has arrived in Italy from China to help it deal with its growing coronavirus crisis.The coronavirus outbreak began in China late last year but has since swept the globe. Italy is now the worst-affected nation in the world after China, with 1,016 dead and 15,113 confirmed cases since the contagion came to light there on Feb. 21.A team of nine Chinese medical staff arrived late on Thursday with some 30 tonnes of equipment on a flight organized by the Chinese Red Cross.“In this moment of great stress, of great difficulty, we are relieved to have this arrival of supplies. It is true that it will help only temporarily, but it is still important,” said the head of the Italian Red Cross, Francesco Rocca.“We have a desperate need for these masks right now. We need respirators that the Red Cross will donate to the government. This is for sure a really important donation for our country,” Rocca said.The outbreak risks overwhelming Italian hospitals and some key supplies are running low.In contrast to China, Italy’s partners in the European Union earlier this month refused Rome’s requests for help with medical supplies as they looked to stockpile face masks and other equipment to help their own citizens.

      "CONTENT : White House reporters may be shocked to learn how unhelpful the average person finds their ongoing badgering of U.S. President Donald Trump to stop highlighting that the COVID-19 coronavirus originated from China. He’s calling it the “Chinese virus.” Members of the press have challenged the president, insisting it’s “racist” to keep saying it. Maybe. Although that might come as a surprise the ethnically Han Chinese population of Taiwan, where naming the virus after the place the outbreak began — Wuhan, China — is both common and uncontroversial.Meanwhile most of the rest of us probably consider it a bigger priority right now to focus on a frightening and dangerous worldwide pandemic rather than politically correct terminology. Still, Americans and the rest of the world won’t likely forget who is to blame for allowing the outbreak to become far more deadly and destructive than it needed to be — and it isn’t Chinese people, who have also been made to suffer, both at home and worldwide. The blame instead belongs to the criminally self-interested communist government, which rules over China whether Chinese people like it or not. And after watching Beijing respond so ineptly to a globally threatening virus outbreak, with deceit, paranoia, self-preservation and cruelty, they must like it rather much less than before. Perhaps we can all compromise and call it the “Chinese communist virus.” Chicom-19?\n",

      "CONTENT : There are quite a few lessons we will all just have to wait to draw from the COVID-19 pandemic that erupted last December in the Chinese city of Wuhan. The coronavirus that causes the sickness is still rampaging across the face of the Earth. The economic and geopolitical shockwaves are still shattering almost everything that was commonplace and routine and familiar from the days before the plague began.But there is a lesson that we all should have learned quite some time ago, which is proving its merit and value now that we are being forced to learn it in the hard and horrific way that the SARS-CoV-2 virus is teaching it. It’s that thriving liberal democracies cannot coexist for long within a model of neoliberal globalization that admits into its embrace such a tyrannical state-capitalist monstrosity as the People’s Republic of China.The arrangement would end badly. It was already putrefying long before the plague began radiating outward from the offal-strewn alleys in the wild animal section of the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan’s Jianghan district, and outward across the province of Hubei, and then, for weeks, as a human-borne contagion undisclosed by the Chinese Communist Party, outward around the world.\n",

The law makes it a crime to advocate for secession or independence and allows for sweeping surveillance. It also allows for people charged with these crimes to be moved to China for trials that could occur behind closed doors.Earlier this week four pro-democracy legislators — two of whom were former Canadian citizens — were expelled from Hong Kong’s legislature causing others to resign and leaving the legislature without any opposition. Canada condemned that move in a statement as did several other Western nations.\n",

The 15-member body has unanimously boosted sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in a bid to choke off funding for Pyongyang’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs.“The DPRK (North Korea) continues to circumvent the U.N. prohibition on the exportation of coal, a key revenue generator that helps fund its weapons of mass destruction programs,” U.S. Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a statement.“The North Korean regime often uses forced labor from prison camps in its mining industries, including coal, exploiting its own people to advance its illicit weapons programs,” he said.An annual report to the U.N. Security Council by independent sanctions monitors earlier this year said North Korea continued to flout council resolutions “through illicit maritime exports of commodities, notably coal and sand” in 2019, earning Pyongyang hundreds of millions of dollars.The U.S. action freezes any U.S. assets of those sanctioned and generally bars Americans from dealing with them.\n",

The two were picked up shortly after Canadian police detained Huawei Technologies Co Ltd’s Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou in December 2018 on a U.S. arrest warrant.“We will continue working hard for the return of the two Michaels,” he said, referring to Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor. “Two years is a very long time to be in prison in China, or anywhere,” Trudeau said at a news conference. “We will continue to do all the work that’s necessary to get them back.”U.S. prosecutors are discussing a deal with lawyers for Meng to resolve criminal charges against her, a person familiar with the matter said on Thursday, signaling a potential end to a case that has strained ties between the United States, China and Canada.Meng, 48, faces bank fraud charges over allegations she misled HSBC Holdings Plc about Huawei’s business dealings in Iran, which was subject to U.S. sanctions.

The U.S. State Department has accused Chinese officials of subjecting Uighur Muslims to torture, abuse “and trying to basically erase their culture and their religion.” Earlier this year, U.S. President Donald Trump signed legislation calling for sanctions over the repression of China’s Uighurs.

      "CONTENT : Indonesia said on Wednesday it rejected China’s claims over a disputed part of the South China Sea as “having no legal basis,” after two days earlier protesting to Beijing over the presence of a Chinese coastguard vessel in its territorial waters.The boat trespassed into Indonesia’s exclusive economic zone off the coast of the northern islands of Natuna, leading Indonesians officials to issue a “strong protest” and summon the Chinese ambassador in Jakarta.Speaking in Beijing on Tuesday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang had said China had sovereignty over the Spratly Islands and their waters and that both China and Indonesia have “normal” fishing activities there.In a sharp rebuke, Indonesia’s foreign ministry called in a statement on Wednesday for China to explain the “legal basis and clear borders” regarding its claims on the exclusive economic zone, as based on the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS).\n",

Trains sit idle in the stations. In Wuhan, the teeming city at the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak, the streets are strangely empty. State censors work round the clock to scrub the internet of independent reporting. Citizen journalists are disappearing without a trace. Nobody knows quite what to believe, or who to trust.According to China’s official tally, as of Wednesday morning roughly 45,000 people have fallen ill and more than 1,100 have died from the virus, now designated by the World Health Organization as COVID-19 in order to satisfy Beijing’s complaint that calling the sickness the Wuhan coronavirus or some such name would be “stigmatizing.” Nobody believes Beijing’s numbers. In Washington on Tuesday, Dr. Anne Schuchat, principal deputy director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, admitted as much. “We absolutely assume that the reported cases are an underestimate,” she said.\n",

He said he believed Italy was the likely source.The governor noted that Trump ordered a ban on travel from China on February 2, more than a month after news reports had emerged about an outbreak in China, and decided to restrict travel from Europe the following month. By that time, the virus had spread widely in the United States, he said.“We acted two months after the China outbreak. When you look back, does anyone think the virus was still in China waiting for us to act two months later?” Cuomo told a news briefing. “The horse had already left the barn by the time we moved.” (Reporting by Nathan Layne in Wilton, Connecticut and Jessica Resnick-Ault in New York; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama and Dan Grebler)\n",

      "CONTENT : ZURICH — Switzerland should renegotiate its six-year-old free trade agreement with China to bolster human rights protections for its Uighur Muslim minority, the Society for Threatened Peoples activist group said on Monday.The demand to the Swiss government comes as France, the United States and others also pressure China over the treatment of Uighurs in its far western Xinjiang region, as well as a Hong Kong security law that some contend infringes on rights in the former British colony.U.N. experts and activists say at least a million ethnic Uighurs and other Muslims are held in detention centers in Xinjiang.China calls them training centers helping to halt terrorism and extremism and teaching new skills.“The current free trade agreement between Switzerland and China does too little to prevent forced labor products from reaching Switzerland and even receiving tariff concessions,” the Germany-based Society for Threatened Peoples said in a statement with other groups, including the Uighur Association Switzerland.Switzerland exported 21.4 billion Swiss francs ($23.41 billion) in goods to China in 2019, while importing goods worth 15.1 billion francs from China, official data show.\n",

The United States has conducted multiple freedom of navigation operations by sending its warships through the area to assert the freedom of access to international waterways.China claims 90% of the potentially energy-rich South China Sea, but Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam also lay claim to parts of it, through which about $3 trillion of trade passes each year.

How many people are infected? What are the names of the hospitals? It might be US army who brought the epidemic to Wuhan. Be transparent! Make public your data! US owe us an explanation!” Zhao wrote.\n",

The 15-member body has unanimously boosted sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in a bid to choke off funding for Pyongyang’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs.“The DPRK (North Korea) continues to circumvent the U.N. prohibition on the exportation of coal, a key revenue generator that helps fund its weapons of mass destruction programs,” U.S. Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a statement.“The North Korean regime often uses forced labor from prison camps in its mining industries, including coal, exploiting its own people to advance its illicit weapons programs,” he said.An annual report to the U.N. Security Council by independent sanctions monitors earlier this year said North Korea continued to flout council resolutions “through illicit maritime exports of commodities, notably coal and sand” in 2019, earning Pyongyang hundreds of millions of dollars.The U.S. action freezes any U.S. assets of those sanctioned and generally bars Americans from dealing with them.\n",

      "CONTENT : CALGARY — The Calgary Zoo says two giant pandas are on their way home to China today.The zoo said in May that it would be sending the pair back early because the COVID-19 pandemic was making it difficult to source bamboo.The plant makes up 99 per cent of the animals’ diet and the zoo has said it was an expensive and all-consuming effort to cobble together supplies from across North America.The zoo says on Twitter it was a difficult decision to send the pandas home three years earlier than planned.It says it took months of hard work to secure international permits to get the pandas home.The zoo posted photos of reams of paperwork needed for the journey, the crates that were to carry the pandas and the Lufthansa Cargo plane that was to take them to China.The two adults, Er Shun and Da Mao, were on loan from China to Canadian zoos as part of a 10-year deal signed in 2012. They were to stay in Calgary until 2023.Two cubs, Jia Panpan and Jia Yueyue, were born in Toronto in 2015. They were sent to China as planned in January.The price tag to have the pandas in Calgary was around $30 million, including $14.4 million for the Panda Passage exhibit itself. Expanded parking lots, washrooms and restaurants were also required to accommodate an expected influx of visitors.This report by The Canadian Press was first published Nov. 27, 2020.\n",

      "CONTENT : OTTAWA — Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Friday declined to comment on talks between the U.S. Justice Department and lawyers that could lead to the release of a senior Huawei executive who is under house arrest in Vancouver.Trudeau told reporters that his “top priority” was the return of two Canadian citizens being held in China. The two were picked up shortly after Canadian police detained Huawei Technologies Co Ltd’s Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou in December 2018 on a U.S. arrest warrant.“We will continue working hard for the return of the two Michaels,” he said, referring to Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor. “Two years is a very long time to be in prison in China, or anywhere,” Trudeau said at a news conference. “We will continue to do all the work that’s necessary to get them back.”U.S. prosecutors are discussing a deal with lawyers for Meng to resolve criminal charges against her, a person familiar with the matter said on Thursday, signaling a potential end to a case that has strained ties between the United States, China and Canada.Meng, 48, faces bank fraud charges over allegations she misled HSBC Holdings Plc about Huawei’s business dealings in Iran, which was subject to U.S. sanctions. She is currently fighting extradition in a Vancouver court.\n",

It’s not a time when we can say everything is going well.”Most of those imported cases have involved Chinese returning home from abroad.\n",

He said he was basing the forecast on mathematical modeling, recent events and government action.Dale Fisher, chair of the Global Outbreak Alert & Response Network that is coordinated by the World Health Organization, said that predicted “time course” may well be true if the virus is allowed to run free in Wuhan.“It’s fair to say that’s really what we are seeing,” he told Reuters in an interview. “But it has spread to other places where it’s the beginning of the outbreak. In Singapore, we are at the beginning of the outbreak.”The flu-like virus has killed more than 1,100 people and infected nearly 45,000, predominantly in China and mostly in Wuhan.\n",

We will continue to update on any advances,” Gonzalez Laya wrote on Twitter.She did not provide further details.The British Foreign Office said on Monday that it was working to offer British nationals in Hubei province an option to leave, one day after France said it expected to evacuate hundreds of its 800 citizens from the area.“French citizens will be repatriated by airplane to France, with the agreement of Chinese authorities. This will take place midweek,” French Health Minister Agnes Buzyn told reporters on Sunday. Evacuees will have to spend 14 days in quarantine to avoid spreading the virus in France.The U.S. State Department said on Sunday it would evacuate personnel from its Wuhan consulate to the United States and will offer a limited number of seats to private U.S. citizens.The coronavirus outbreak that began in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, in the province of Hubei, has killed 81 people in China so far and infected more than 2,750 globally, most of them in China.

      "CONTENT : It is easy to mock the concept of a Canadian Parliamentary committee striking fear into the stony hearts of the Chinese politburo. As this newspaper indeed did in an editorial cartoon on Thursday. But if the Butchers of Beijing are not worried, they should be. And Canadians should be pleased.To be sure, Canadian parliamentary committees have few trophies on their walls. And most of what they do have is participants or observers who died of such desiccating boredom as not to require taxidermy. But this situation is different.It is different first, of course, because in a minority parliament the cabinet cannot simply order committees around. Trudeau and his ministers tried to prevent the committee from being struck, which is yet more proof of how badly it is needed. And brings me to the second difference: The real problem with China isn’t out there. It’s in here.OK, it’s out there too. Despite the feeble denials of our defence minister and the powerful China lobby of ex-politicians and ex-bureaucrats already aboard the Gravy Belt and Road and current officials hoping one day to jump on, China is a brutal and increasingly aggressive tyranny with nuclear weapons, a communist ideology, a sense of destiny and growing concerns about long-term economic and demographic issues.\n",

Wet markets are a key facet of China’s daily life, though not all sell wildlife.China imposed a temporary ban on selling wildlife on Jan. 23 and is now reviewing its legislation to restrict commercial wild animal trading on a permanent basis.Minister for Agriculture David Littleproud said on Thursday he had asked government officials from the Group of 20 major economies to back a plan to end wet wildlife markets.“There are risks with wildlife wet markets and they could be as big a risk to our agricultural industries as they can be to public health,” Littleproud told Australia’s Channel 7 television.\n",

Don’t they owe the American people an apology? Disregarding facts and shifting blame to China only illustrates what it means to be scoundrels,” she fired back earlier this month, responding to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s accusations that Beijing sought to cover up the coronavirus outbreak.Temperatures rose again this week, as Chinese state television released an animated cartoon mocking Pompeo as a liar, and President Donald Trump blasted back at “some wacko in China.”Propaganda may not be true, but it can change the course of reality if enough people believe it.\n",

Tsai says Taiwan is already an independent nation, called the Republic of China, Taiwan’s official name.In a live televised pre-election policy address by the three presidential candidates – a debate comes later this month – Tsai accused the main opposition party, the Kuomintang, of cosying up to China, pointing to presidential hopeful Han Kuo-yu’s meeting with senior Chinese officials earlier this year.\n",

In 2017 it imposed an annual cap of 500,000 barrels on refined petroleum imports.China and Russia are the only countries to have notified the Security Council’s North Korea sanctions committee of refined petroleum exports to Pyongyang, but they did so in tonnes instead of barrels and the committee has been unable to agree on a conversion rate so it can determine when the cap was reached.“Despite numerous attempts – the issue has been on the agenda for no less than three years – to find an agreement on a conversion rate, Russia and China have been stalling the process,” German U.N. Ambassador Christoph Heusgen, chairman of the sanctions committee, told reporters.“While this shouldn’t be a complicated matter to solve, it has become clear that the two delegations are politicizing this topic,” Heusgen said, after raising the issue behind closed doors in a formal Security Council meeting.\n",

      "CONTENT : WASHINGTON — The deputy White House national security adviser on Friday denounced China’s treatment of Uighur Muslims, saying there was no justification for the country maintaining “concentration camps” within its borders.Matt Pottinger, who has been a leading figure in the development of President Donald Trump’s China policy, made the remark in Mandarin in an online address to the U.K.-based Policy Exchange think tank.Pottinger’s remark represented a further ratcheting up of American rhetoric against China in the run-up to the Nov. 3 U.S. presidential election, in which Trump, a Republican, has made a tough approach to China a key foreign policy theme.Last week, Pottinger’s boss, U.S. national security adviser Robert O’Brien, said China was perpetrating “something close to” genocide with its treatment of Muslims in its Xinjiang region.The United States has denounced China’s treatment of Uighur and other minority Muslims in Xinjiang and imposed sanctions on officials it blames for abuses.It has not, though, so far termed Beijing’s actions genocide, a designation that would have significant legal implications and require stronger action against China.The United Nations estimates that more than a million Muslims have been detained in Xinjiang, and activists say crimes against humanity and genocide are taking place there. China has denied any abuses and says its camps in the region provide vocational training and help fight extremism.Pottinger spoke after China’s President Xi Jinping delivered a speech on the 70th anniversary of Chinese troops entering the Korean War to fight against U.S. troops, in which he warned that China will never allow its sovereignty, security and development interests to be undermined.Xi did not directly refer to the present-day United States, with which relations have sunk to their lowest in decades over disputes ranging from trade and technology to human rights and the coronavirus.

Yet the call for a united front against Beijing is a sensitive subject for Washington’s allies, which are reliant on China for trade.In comments before the start of a meeting of the Quad grouping of the four nations’ foreign ministers, Pompeo spoke in typically unsparing terms against Beijing’s ruling Chinese Communist Party. That was in contrast to his three counterparts, all of whom avoided calling out China directly.“As partners in this Quad, it is more critical now than ever that we collaborate to protect our people and partners from the CCP’s exploitation, corruption and coercion,” Pompeo said, referring to the ruling party.“We see it in the South and East China Seas, the Mekong, the Himalayas, the Taiwan Strait.”China has denounced the Quad as an attempt to contain its development.The four nations in the grouping stated their support for a free and open Indo-Pacific. In an interview with Japan’s Nikkei newspaper, Pompeo spoke of formalizing and potentially broadening the Quad grouping.\n",

The Federation of American Scientists has estimated that China has about 320 nuclear warheads.The Pentagon said the growth projection was based on factors including Beijing having enough material to double its nuclear weapons stockpile without new fissile material production.The Pentagon’s estimate is in line with an analysis by the Defense Intelligence Agency.“We’re certainly concerned about the numbers … but also just the trajectory of China’s nuclear developments writ large,” Chad Sbragia, deputy assistant secretary of defense for China, told reporters.\n",

And Beijing is threatening a trade war with Australia, after the government in Canberra called for an inquiry into where COVID-19 originated.Even before the COVID crisis, Trump was battling a trade war with China and the two countries have been fighting for supremacy over intellectual property and high-tech dominance, which the White House has called “a new era of great power competition.”So where does this leave Canada among the turmoil?\n",

It can cause pneumonia, which has been deadly in some cases.China’s National Health Commission Minister Ma Xiaowei said the incubation period for the virus can range from one to 14 days, during which infection can occur, which was not the case with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).\n",

That visit came a week after Vietnam freed a Vietnamese-born U.S. citizen, Michael Nguyen, who had been sentenced to 12 years in prison for “attempting to overthrow the state.”The former Vietnam War foes now have warm relations in spite of U.S. concerns about Hanoi’s human rights practices.Washington also has concerns about human rights in the Philippines, where President Rodrigo Duterte has been engaged in a war on drugs in which thousands of urban poor have been killed, many in mysterious circumstances.On a visit last year, Pompeo assured the Philippines that Washington would come to its defense if it came under attack in the South China Sea, where Manila has competing claims with China and other countries, including Vietnam.\n",

Nor should we be concerned about the non-return to Canada of people whom we believe to have committed crimes.

      "CONTENT : On Saturday the Chinese Embassy in Canada issued its latest statement “on the Meng Wanzhou incident and the cases of Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor.” This, of course, follows last week’s bungled effort by a group of senescent Canadian worthies to appeal to the prime minister; they wanted him to intercede in Meng’s extradition case on the premise that China would, in return, immediately let Kovrig and Spavor go. The embassy, as is its habit, is complaining of misrepresentation in the press through an unnamed “spokesperson.” In the interests of Chinese-Canadian amity, I propose to take this statement on behalf of the People’s Republic of China seriously.It has two main parts. In the first part we are reassured that Kovrig and Spavor are, contrary to the claims of those who propose an explicit trade of Meng for the two Michaels, being treated appropriately:“China is a country with rule of law. Chinese judicial organs handle cases in accordance with law. After due investigation, Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor were formally prosecuted by Chinese procuratorial organs. The facts are clear and evidence solid and sufficient. The accusation of so-called ‘arbitrarily’ detaining Canadian citizens is totally groundless. Chinese judicial organs will continue to handle the above cases strictly in accordance with law, and protect the two Canadians’ lawful rights.”\n",

It says Missouri and its residents suffered possibly tens of billions of dollars in economic damages, and seeks cash compensation.“The Chinese government lied to the world about the danger and contagious nature of COVID-19, silenced whistleblowers, and did little to stop the spread of the disease,” Schmitt, a Republican, said in a statement.“They must be held accountable for their actions.”\n",

Chinese there should stay put and not return home, the state-owned Global Times said on Tuesday.“Chinese people have watched Russia become a severely affected country … This should sound the alarm: China must strictly prevent the inflow of cases and avoid a second outbreak,” the paper, which is run by the Communist Party’s People’s Daily, said in an editorial.China’s northeastern border province of Heilongjiang saw 79 new cases of COVID-19 on Monday, all Chinese citizens traveling home from Russia, state media said. Mainland China reported 89 new cases.\n",

      "CONTENT : TOKYO — U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo visited Japan on Tuesday to rally support from Washington’s closest allies in Asia, calling for deeper collaboration with Japan, India and Australia as a bulwark against China’s growing regional influence.The East Asia visit, Pompeo’s first in more than a year, coincides with worsening tensions with China. Yet the call for a united front against Beijing is a sensitive subject for Washington’s allies, which are reliant on China for trade.In comments before the start of a meeting of the Quad grouping of the four nations’ foreign ministers, Pompeo spoke in typically unsparing terms against Beijing’s ruling Chinese Communist Party. That was in contrast to his three counterparts, all of whom avoided calling out China directly.“As partners in this Quad, it is more critical now than ever that we collaborate to protect our people and partners from the CCP’s exploitation, corruption and coercion,” Pompeo said, referring to the ruling party.“We see it in the South and East China Seas, the Mekong, the Himalayas, the Taiwan Strait.”China has denounced the Quad as an attempt to contain its development.Pompeo’s visit was supposed to include trips to Mongolia and South Korea but was cut back to one day after President Donald Trump was diagnosed with COVID-19.\n",

Elsewhere in China, authorities have placed restrictions on travel and business activity in a bid to contain the spread of the virus.In its latest figures, China’s National Health Commission said there were 2,102 new confirmed infections in China on Friday, bringing the cumulative total to 11,791. Around two dozen other countries have reported confirmed cases of the virus.Amid growing international concern, Singapore and the United States announced measures on Friday to restrict entry to foreign nationals who have recently been in China.\n",

They have given more than 400 media interviews and published more than 300 articles, according to the foreign ministry.That outreach, which has included donations of medical gear, is part of an effort to change the narrative after China was criticized for an initially secretive response that exacerbated the early spread of the virus.Beijing is even disputing the widely held belief that the disease originated in China.More recently, China has won plaudits for the success of its drastic containment measures, including the virtual lockdown of Hubei province, home to 60 million people, dramatically slowing the increase in new cases even as the epidemic spread globally.\n",

The team name, logo and color are all part of it.”The new rule was among a series of changes announced in December last year and has already been implemented by clubs such as Dalian Yifang, who changed their name to Dalian Professional ahead of the 2020 season.The CFA has also announced major curbs on spending by clubs, who invested heavily in recent seasons to bring big-name foreign players to China on lucrative contracts.CFA President Chen Xuyuan said last week that clubs must implement further salary cuts to safeguard the future of the professional game as the overspending by clubs was unsustainable.

His hard-fought trade deal with China could also hang in the balance.As Trump seeks re-election in November, his advisers have become more in sync on the need to pressure China, including over Hong Kong, according to current and former U.S. officials and a congressional source.

      "CONTENT : SHANGHAI — The number of deaths from a coronavirus epidemic in China has risen to 259, the country’s health authority said on Saturday, as the United States announced new border curbs on foreign nationals who have been in China.The province of Hubei, the center of the epidemic, remains under virtual quarantine, with roads sealed off and public transport shut down, but small numbers of travelers continue to breach the lockdown.Amid fears that the virus could spread further overseas, the United States announced measures to restrict entry to foreign nationals who have recently been in China. All three major U.S. airlines also said on Friday they would cancel flights to mainland China.Australia’s Qantas Airways Ltd said the entry restrictions imposed by the United States and other countries had forced it to suspend its direct flights to China from Feb. 9.Nearly 10,000 flights have been suspended since the outbreak of the coronavirus in China, according to travel and data analytics firm Cirium.\n",

Canada will not permit the export of sensitive military items to Hong Kong,” he said. “Canada is also suspending the Canada-Hong Kong extradition treaty.”Separately, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told a briefing that Canada could take further measures, including those related to immigration, but gave no details.Canada and China are locked in a diplomatic and trade dispute which erupted in late 2018 after Canadian police detained Huawei Technologies Co’s chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, on a U.S. warrant.\n",

And while we should probably extradite Meng to the United States, we should not ratify an extension of the extradition treaty with the U.S., not because of this particular case, but because we should not be sending anyone to a jurisdiction where practically all prosecutions are successful. In its criminal law, the United States is not a society of laws, it is a prosecutocracy, and we should not feed it. Nor should we be concerned about the non-return to Canada of people whom we believe to have committed crimes.

The embassy, as is its habit, is complaining of misrepresentation in the press through an unnamed “spokesperson.” In the interests of Chinese-Canadian amity, I propose to take this statement on behalf of the People’s Republic of China seriously.It has two main parts. In the first part we are reassured that Kovrig and Spavor are, contrary to the claims of those who propose an explicit trade of Meng for the two Michaels, being treated appropriately:“China is a country with rule of law. Chinese judicial organs handle cases in accordance with law. After due investigation, Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor were formally prosecuted by Chinese procuratorial organs. The facts are clear and evidence solid and sufficient. The accusation of so-called ‘arbitrarily’ detaining Canadian citizens is totally groundless. Chinese judicial organs will continue to handle the above cases strictly in accordance with law, and protect the two Canadians’ lawful rights.”\n",

Yet the call for a united front against Beijing is a sensitive subject for Washington’s allies, which are reliant on China for trade.In comments before the start of a meeting of the Quad grouping of the four nations’ foreign ministers, Pompeo spoke in typically unsparing terms against Beijing’s ruling Chinese Communist Party. That was in contrast to his three counterparts, all of whom avoided calling out China directly.“As partners in this Quad, it is more critical now than ever that we collaborate to protect our people and partners from the CCP’s exploitation, corruption and coercion,” Pompeo said, referring to the ruling party.“We see it in the South and East China Seas, the Mekong, the Himalayas, the Taiwan Strait.”China has denounced the Quad as an attempt to contain its development.The four nations in the grouping stated their support for a free and open Indo-Pacific. In an interview with Japan’s Nikkei newspaper, Pompeo spoke of formalizing and potentially broadening the Quad grouping.\n",

But a choice between reckless and feckless offers little promise of responsible, Roosevelt-style, global leadership.The U.S. and China are increasingly at loggerheads on several fronts. Despite Trump’s contradictory impulse to praise effusively his personal relations with President Xi, he and his administration are out front blaming China for the virus outbreak and for concealing information that would have helped America and the world cope earlier with the pandemic. Chinese authorities returned the salvos by accusing the U.S. military of being the culprit. These exchanges were described with unusual candour by China’s ambassador to the U.S. as “crazy.” Trump may have turned on China to distract attention about his handling of the crisis.\n",

      "CONTENT : A British diplomat leapt into a river in southwest China and rescued a drowning student over the weekend, Britain’s embassy in Beijing and Chinese state media said.Stephen Ellison, the 61-year-old British consul-general in Chongqing, jumped into the water at a scenic spot in the municipality on Saturday after spotting the struggling female student, who had fallen in by accident, China’s official Xinhua news agency reported.A video https://twitter.com/ukinchina/status/1328309479595798530 of the incident posted on the British embassy’s Twitter account shows a woman drifting face-down in the water as onlookers scream in panic, before the diplomat takes off his shoes, plunges in and swims to her aid.A lifebelt is then tossed into the river, enabling people on the bank to drag Ellison and the student to safety.“Thanks to the rescue, the student soon resumed breathing and regained consciousness,” Xinhua said, citing the local authorities, without naming the woman.The British embassy said everyone is “immensely proud” of Ellison.Sino-British ties have been strained in recent months over China’s decision to impose a new national security law to quell pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong, which London handed back to Beijing in 1997 after 156 years of British rule.China on Nov. 5 barred non-Chinese travelers from countries including Britain from entering amid surging coronavirus cases.

How many people are infected? What are the names of the hospitals? It might be US army who brought the epidemic to Wuhan. Be transparent! Make public your data! US owe us an explanation!” Zhao wrote.\n",

      "CONTENT : PARIS — The European Union has not been naive in its dealings with China, said EU Industry Commissioner Thierry Breton on Tuesday, as rifts emerge between the United States and China over the origins of the coronavirus.“We are absolutely not naive,” Breton told France Info radio on Tuesday, when asked if the EU might have shown any gullibility in its dealings with China.Britain said on Monday that China has questions to answer over the information it shared about the coronavirus outbreak, while the United States has scaled up its rhetoric over Chinese culpability for the virus in recent days.

      "CONTENT : WASHINGTON — The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) asked the Justice Department and other U.S. agencies to detail if China Unicom’s continued U.S operations pose national security risks, according to a letter released Friday.In April, the FCC issued show-cause orders warning it might shut down the U.S. operations of three state-controlled Chinese telecommunications companies: China Telecom, China Unicom and Pacific Networks Corp and its subsidiary ComNet (USA). China Unicom Americas has a nearly two-decade old authorization to provide international telecommunications services to and from the United States.The FCC asked the executive branch agencies “whether and how (China Unicom Americas) is subject to the exploitation, influence, and control of the Chinese government, and the national security and law enforcement risks associated.” It also asked “whether mitigation measures could address any identified concerns.”The FCC letter asked the executive branch agencies to respond by Nov. 16.In April, the Justice Department and other federal agencies urged the FCC to revoke China Telecom’s authorization.The three Chinese companies’ U.S. units have urged the FCC not to revoke the authorizations.\n",

      "CONTENT : In Canada, hostage diplomacy works. It’s exceedingly difficult to reach any other conclusion, with the evidence for that proposition piling up every day. As of May 13, 520 days have passed since Beijing abducted and imprisoned Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor. Well done, China. You’ve bested us. You win.Or at the very least, the Trudeau government has been bested. The overwhelming majority of Canadians certainly have not been so eager to bow and to scrape and to mind their tone lest they give Chinese President Xi Jinping and his thugs any offence. But around Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s cabinet table, and in every impression Canada is giving the rest of the world, that’s exactly how things are to be done in Ottawa.On Tuesday, the National Research Council, for reasons that were not made quite clear, entered into an agreement, the exact details of which Canadians are apparently unentitled to know, with a Chinese entity known as CanSino Biologics Inc., in a project backed by the Institute of Biotechnology in China’s Academy of Military Medical Sciences. The deal commits Canadian researchers to the development of a vaccine for COVID-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, the deadly virus that Chinese authorities, by gross negligence and disinformation, in roughly equal measure, unleashed upon the world late last year.\n",

But what about the criminals?No one will weep for them, but recent reports indicate that like their counterparts in the licit economy, Latin American drug cartels have seen their business badly curtailed by the pandemic for various reasons, some more obvious than others.In a recent Vice report, it was reported that Sinaloa Cartel boss Ismael Zambada — the man known as “El Mayo” who leads the cartel in the absence of the jailed Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman — has introduced a major wholesale price hike for methamphetamine. The reason? The gang’s supply chain for the pre-cursor chemicals used to make meth, which normally come from China to Mexico, has been badly slowed since China went into pandemic lockdown. Supply of the synthetic opioid fentanyl, also sourced in China, has been similarly impacted.\n",

      "CONTENT : BEIJING — China on Monday denied that two Canadian citizens held for almost two years had been “arbitrarily” detained in response to Canada’s arrest of an executive of technology giant Huawei.Foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian’s denial came days after China granted consular access to Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor for the first time since January. Canada’s government on Saturday issued a statement saying it remains “deeply concerned by the arbitrary detention by Chinese authorities” of the two, and called for their immediate release.Zhao said China “firmly opposes the erroneous statements made by Canada” and reiterated its claim that Kovrig and Spavor were “suspected of engaging in activities that endanger China’s national security.”“The Chinese judicial organs handle the case independently according to law. So the label of arbitrary detention cannot be pinned to the Chinese side,” he told reporters at a daily briefing.Canadian attempts to enlist other countries in pressuring China are “completely futile and will only backfire,” Zhao said. On Saturday, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and U.S. President Donald Trump discussed Kovrig’s and Spavor’s cases in a phone call and Trudeau expressed thanks for U.S. support.\n",

      "CONTENT : WASHINGTON — U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday said he was very disappointed in China over its failure to contain the novel coronavirus, saying the worldwide pandemic cast a pall over his U.S.-China trade deal.The coronavirus outbreak originated in Wuhan, China, in December and was spreading silently as Washington and Beijing signed a Phase 1 trade deal hailed by the Republican president as a major achievement.“I’m very disappointed in China,” the Republican president said in an interview broadcast Thursday on Fox Business Network.“They should have never let this happen. So I make a great trade deal and now I say this doesn’t feel the same to me. The ink was barely dry and the plague came over. And it doesn’t feel the same to me,” Trump said.Under the Phase 1 deal signed in January, Beijing pledged to buy at least $200 billion in additional U.S. goods and services over two years while Washington agreed to roll back tariffs in stages on Chinese goods.\n",

Its elections are always closely watched by China, which claims the island as its territory.Taiwan says it is an independent country called the Republic of China, its formal name.“I just don’t think China should read Taiwan’s election as its own victory or defeat,” Foreign Minister Joseph Wu told reporters in Taipei. “If China reads too much into our election … there might be a likely scenario that China will engage in military intimidation or diplomatic isolation or using economic measures as punishment against Taiwan.”President Tsai Ing-wen, who is seeking re-election, has repeatedly warned Taiwan’s people to be wary of Chinese attempts to sway the election through disinformation or military intimidation, an accusation China denies.\n",

      "CONTENT : BEIJING — China is considering drawing up a blacklist of “diehard” supporters of Taiwan’s independence, the government said on Wednesday, which may see Beijing try to take legal steps against democratically-elected President Tsai Ing-wen.Taiwan condemned the plan after the pro-Beijing Hong Kong-based newspaper Ta Kung Pao first reported on it this month. China’s widely-read Global Times tabloid has said the list could include senior Taiwanese government officials.China claims self-governing Taiwan as its own territory. Taiwan’s government says the island is already an independent country called the Republic of China, its formal name, although China rejects this position.Zhu Fenglian, a spokeswoman for China’s Taiwan Affairs Office, said the “list of diehard Taiwan secessionists” now under consideration was only aimed at a very small number of independence supporters and those who fund them.“It is absolutely not aimed at the vast majority of Taiwan compatriots,” she told a regular news briefing in Beijing.Zhu did not give details or a timeframe, saying only that Beijing would take “targeted steps to severely punish in accordance with the law” those it viewed as hard-core backers of independence.\n",

      "CONTENT : There is less to the Phase 1 China–U.S. trade agreement than the initial fanfare in the U.S. would suggest but the negative consequences for the global trading system should be of concern to others, including Canada. Even more ominous perhaps are the dramatic moves China is making to develop Artificial Intelligence (AI), which will likely be the major driver of economic growth and security prowess in the next quarter-century.President Donald Trump wanted his tariff war to reduce the U.S. trade deficit with China. That deficit has actually increased from US$544 billion in 2016 to US$691 billion in the 12 months ending in October 2019.The administration had also intended to dismantle the core of China’s industrial strategy — extensive subsidies and other forms of state assistance that have stimulated the growth of many Chinese companies. The U.S. sought explicitly to prevent the theft of intellectual property and the forced divestiture of foreign technologies. While there is reportedly some agreed language on each of these issues there is no indication of precise commitments or enforcement measures. The U.S. could have enhanced its leverage on each by enlisting support from such key allies as Canada, Japan and the EU. Instead, the Trump administration chose to go it alone suffering from delusions of “America First” grandeur. These thorny issues have been effectively punted to Phase 2.\n",
